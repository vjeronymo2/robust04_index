			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRITAIN'S BLUE AEROPLANES GET OFF THE GROUND AT LAST;  </P> <P> MUSIC: THE 8-YEAR-OLD BAND HAS MOVED BEYOND ITS U.S. CULT FOLLOWING TO BECOME  THE DARLING OF ALTERNATIVE RADIO STATIONS.  </P> <P> Gerard Langley, the founder of and chief songwriter for the Blue Aeroplanes,  said he finds a lot of current music "pretty boring." But he believes things  are changing.  </P> <P> The Aeroplanes, who play Bogart's in Long Beach tonight, are Englishmen who  conjure up the likes of Bob Dylan, the Sisters of Mercy and Dire Straits, even  traces of British folk rock a la Fairport Convention. With three guitarists --  Rodney Allen, Angelo Bruschini and 18-year-old whiz Alex Lee -- the band is  able to provide multiple layers of texture.  </P> <P> "We've been doing this kind of music all along," said Langley, whose  distinctive sung/spoken vocals are another of the band's trademarks. "But  people in England were more into novelty and noise, until recently, and now  what we do has suddenly become acceptable. I really think it's a case of us  having waited around long enough to become fashionable."  </P> <P> Indeed, with the release of "Swagger," the 8-year-old band's first album for a  major label, the Aeroplanes have finally moved beyond their cult following in  the United States and are becoming the darlings of college radio and other  alternative stations. The album was produced by Gil Norton, who did the Pixies'  breakthrough, "Doolittle."  </P> <P> R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, a fan of the band since 1985, has been an ally,  contributing vocals to one track on "Swagger" and requesting that the  Aeroplanes open for R.E.M. during its British tour.  </P> <P> The Blue Aeroplanes started out as a vehicle for Langley's poetry, which he  would read to the accompaniment of his brother John's drums and his and  Bruschini's guitars. Soon, though, he found that poetry "was a limited forum"  and started placing more emphasis on the music.  </P> <P> About 20 musicians came and went over the years before things stabilized with  the current lineup, which still finds John Langley on drums and also includes  bassist Andy McCreeth and free-form dancer Wojtek Dmochowski.  </P> <P> "This lineup wasn't necessarily intended to last a long time," Gerard Langley  said. "But it became a proper band very quickly. In the previous lineups,  everyone was always a bit undecided about whether he wanted to be in a band or  whether he wanted to have a proper job."  </P> <P> In the midst of the Aeroplanes' second American tour this year (the first was  with the Church), Langley said he's finding that the group is adaptable to any  size venue.  </P> <P> "Our sets go from loud, thrashy stuff to quiet acoustic stuff to things that  build and swell," he said. "That sort of thing seems to be rare in rock music  at the moment, but it's something that's quite natural to us. We're the sort of  band that can tour in smoky rock 'n' roll clubs or large venues, then turn  around and quite comfortably play in an art gallery."  </P> <P>  The Blue Aeroplanes and the Jazz Butcher play tonight at 9:30 at Bogart's,  6288 Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach. Tickets: $13.50. Information: (213)  594-8975.  </P> <P> </P></p>

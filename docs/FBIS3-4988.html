As agreed last  week after exhaustive negotiations between North Korea and the  United States, Seoul announced suspension of this year's "Team  Spirit," the joint military exercise with Washington held  annually since 1976. Washington is to follow up with the  announcement of a March 21 meeting with North Korean officials  in Geneva, the third round of high-level dialogue, wrapping up a  small package deal in a first-phase resolution of the nuclear  problem.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu labeled these announcements as  steps "enabling thorough inspections in North Korea, preventing  a threatening situation and allowing room for a solution through  dialogue." But he admitted to shortfalls in details that  outwardly show Pyongyang holding more marbles after the game.  "But let's look at the forest, not each tree. There are more  optimistic aspects than negative ones," Han said.    As things stood Thursday, the decision on Team Spirit's  suspension and North Korea-U.S. high-level talks was  conditional. Pyongyang must allow unrestricted access to the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection team. It  also has to exchange presidential envoys with Seoul. The former  condition is likely to be met easily. South Korean officials  expect the latter to be fulfilled in one form or another.    Pyongyang doesn't come right out and say it, but it fully  understands that the envoy exchange is an absolute prerequisite  to the March 21 meeting with Washington, Seoul officials insist.  But their explanations hardly allay concerns that North Korea is  succeeding in isolating South Korea from the nuclear  negotiations.    A high-level official in Seoul admitted that realistically,  there wasn't enough time for both sides' envoys to make the  visits. Seoul is thinking of sending its representative to  Pyongyang first, around March 15, which may have to suffice for  the demand on envoy exchanges, according to this official.  Shortfalls in such small but significant items serve as bases  to claims of failure in microscopics. But as the foreign  minister says, looking at the big picture, the nuclear stalemate  has turned back from the brink and is heading in the right  direction. All concerned parties -- South Korea, North Korea  and the United States -- will all keep on negotiating.  Meanwhile, the more immediate task of nuclear inspections in  North Korea can continue.    Although pessimism lingers on the viability of the  inter-Korean envoy exchange, officials here point the finger at  Pyongyang for refusing to accept it. "Once the envoys do meet,  they cannot but discuss inter-Korean matters," said Han in  sounding a note of optimism. Besides, officials here reason, to  break off the negotiations over differences on the envoy issue  would be a serious setback for all concerned. There would be no  IAEA inspections, no more diplomatic dialogue. One official goes  as far as saying that "if there can't be a meaningful  inter-Korean dialogue anyway, then it's better to at least  secure IAEA inspections."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yevgeniy Sobetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kyzyl, 1 Jun--The question of the legality of Tuva's  joining Russia in 1944 is now completely meaningless. Republic  President Sherig-ool Oorzhak said this on Tuesday during the  festive ceremony of the signing of the Public Accord Treaty.  This document was signed by representatives of all authorities,  political parties--including the Communist Party--all public  associations, and all religious persuasions.    The president addressed the fact that certain forces in the  republic--first of all the nationalists--are still disputing the  lawfulness of this decision made 50 years ago on the pretext  that it was made by a narrow circle of leaders. Having voted at  the December 1993 referendum in favor of the republic's  Constitution-- which regards the republic as an integral part of  Russia--Tuva's multiethnic people thus legitimized the 1944  decision. In the president's view, the Public Accord Treaty  plays a similar role today.</p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (13): Let the feet be your guide - Passing the time / Even though the city's public transport is highly efficient, Barcelona is best explored on foot ONE OF the qualities which makes Barcelona an enjoyable city to visit is that it is best explored on foot. Its two most famous streets, the Passeig de Gracia and Las Ramblas, are both designed for the pedestrian, and both offer different aspects of Barcelona's culture. The Passeig de Gracia was once the connecting road between Barcelona itself and the village of Gracia, along which wealthy Catalan families built their mansions. Now it cuts through the centre of what is called the Eixample, or expansion, which is the 19th century addition, its regular grid reference streets designed by the avant-garde town-planner, Ildefons Cerda. In the space of a few yards on the Passeig de Gracia, it is possible to see three of the best examples of modernist architecture, one by each of its most famous practitioners. Close to the intersection with Carrer d'Arago, standing next door to each other and unmissable, are Antoni Gaudi's Casa Batllo and the more restrained Casa Amatller by Josep Puig i Cadafalch. A little further down is the Casa Lleo-Morera by the architect Lluis Domenech i Montaner. Las Ramblas bisects the old part of the city and leads down to the port. It is much narrower than the Passeig de Gracia and is the place where at times the whole city seems to be out for a stroll. Trying to attract the attention of the crowd are all forms of street entertainers, from break dancers to live statues. Halfway down on the right, is Spain's premier opera house, the Liceu; while a little further on on the left is the Carrer dels Escudellers, which is synonymous with the rough end of the city. The Barri Gotic is a tight network of narrow streets and contains the centres of the regional and local government, the City Hall and the Generalitat, which face each other across the Placa Sant Jaume, and most of the architectural heritage of the earlier period. As Barcelona has its back to the mountain of Tibidabo, and is flanked by the hill of Montjuic, where the Olympic stadium and the Palau Sant Jordi stand, there are plenty of vantage points from which the whole of the city can be seen. One of the best spots for this is the Parc Guell. This is well worth a visit not only for the view but also for an opportunity to see this fantasy garden designed by Gaudi on the slope of the mountain. One other trip worth taking from the city centre is a visit to the most recent addition to its cultural agenda, and one which will compete with its Picasso Museum as the most visited by tourists. It is the part of the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection which is on display, from last month, in the monastery of Pedralbes, and which includes works by Titian, Tintoretto and Velazquez.</p>

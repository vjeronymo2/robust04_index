			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "mh": "Vladimir Meciar: The Movement for a </F> Democratic Slovakia Knows Who Its Coalition Partner Is"]    [Text] Bratislava--During yesterday's coalition talks, the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak  National Party [SNS] agreed to seek a compromise solution with  regard to the amendment to the law on large-scale privatization.  At a joint meeting with the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]  Club of Deputies, the coalition partners want to accommodate SDL  demands and thus achieve the submission of a single draft  amendment. As Prime Minister Meciar noted, the only issue of  dispute between the government-sponsored draft and the SDL  deputies' draft is the combining of government posts with  positions in the National Property Fund (FNM). Asked when the  talks with the SDL Club of Deputies would be held, Vladimir  Meciar replied: "Who knows? They may be under way already." As  SDL Chairman Peter Weiss told SME shortly after the conclusion  of the coalition talks, so far he had not received any official  offer for talks with the coalition on the amendment to the law  on large-scale privatization. As for the SDL's own draft, they  stick to their positions. Weiss said that it was unacceptable  and unconstitutional to combine government posts with FNM posts  and that he did not see any possibility of reaching an agreement  on this point.    At their talks yesterday, the coalition representatives  returned to the nonacceptance of the so-called law on  [bilingual] signposts [by Slovak Parliament on 28 January].  According to Vladimir Meciar, the government can submit it  again to parliament for another discussion in six months at the  earliest.    As Vladimir Meciar reported further, the coalition partners  dealt with the existence or nonexistence of the so-called SNS  National Democratic Club [of SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak] in the  National Council of the Slovak Republic. According to the HZDS  chairman's words, the HZDS upholds the opinion that it signed  the coalition agreement with the SNS Central Council, which is  the partner for the HZDS. This partner announced that there  exists only one SNS Club of Deputies, so the HZDS has no doubt  as to who its coalition partner is.    SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak told SME in this context that,  during the coalition talks, he had advised Vladimir Meciar to  read carefully what he signs. According to Cernak, the  coalition agreement was signed by two legal entities--the HZDS  and the SNS. Ludovit Cernak confirmed that the existence of the  SNS National Democratic Club had been a subject of the coalition  talks. The participants did not arrive at a final stand,  however, because, according to Ludovit Cernak, a meeting of  coalition partners is not a forum that is entitled to assess the  founding of the SNS National Democratic Club. As he went on to  say, in this context, the promise could be heard from the other  participants that, if members of the SNS National Democratic  Club gave up their SNS membership, the establishment of the SNS  National Democratic Club would be respected. The SNS chairman  rejected this offer. He said that he would continue to  participate in the coalition talks in line with the decision of  the SNS Central Council.</p>

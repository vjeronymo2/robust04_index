			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: TelecomAsia valued at over Dollars 10bn TelecomAsia, the Thai concession-holder for the installation of 2m new telephone lines in Bangkok, immediately became the largest capitalised company on the Stock Exchange of Thailand when its shares were publicly traded for the first time yesterday. TA shares closed at Bt116, more than double the initial public offering price of Bt55, giving the company a market value of more than Dollars 10bn. The company, a subsidiary of the multinational Charoen Pokphand (CP), Thailand's largest group of companies, is now regarded by most foreign stockbrokers in Bangkok as greatly over-priced. With the contract to install telephone lines still in its early stages, the prospective price/earnings ratio for 1994 is 500 times, falling to about 20 times for 1997 and 1998. 'It reflects the market mania that has now gripped Bangkok. Unless the company has invented the secret of eternal life, nothing justifies a p/e multiple above 100,' said one stockbroker yesterday. Even TA's main asset - its contract to expand the Bangkok telephone system - is in danger of being undermined by the slow rate at which the state-owned Telephone Organisation of Thailand (TOT) connects new lines to subscribers. TOT staff have long profited from the acute shortage of lines and they are reluctant to relinquish income from bribes, typically more than Dollars 1,000, paid for the installation of each new line. TA has sought to co-opt TOT workers by offering them cut-price TA stock worth up to two years' salary at TA's current share price. Trading in TA was the focus of stock market activity in Bangkok yesterday. Turnover in the shares amounted to more than Dollars 170m. Thai mutual funds are expected to want TA shares because the company now accounts for about one-tenth of the market's capitalisation and will be a significant factor in the movement of the SET index. Foreign suppliers and their local partners regard the Thai market as rich in opportunities because the country has only three telephones per 100 inhabitants, compared with 10 in neighbouring Malaysia. Nynex of the US is CP's partner and holds 15 per cent of TA stock. TA hopes to lift the value of its Bangkok contract by using fibre-optic lines for cable television as well as telephone calls, and is looking for opportunities to expand abroad. The CP group, controlled by the ethnic Chinese Chearavanont family, is one of the largest foreign investors in China. TA intends to install hundreds of thousands of telephone lines in China's Hubei province and to join a Chinese satellite launching venture.</p>

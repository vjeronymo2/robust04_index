			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ARKANSAS;  </P> <P> TOWN GRIEVES OVER TEEN-AGERS' SUICIDES  </P> <P> Mourners of three teen-agers who killed themselves were told at the first  victim's funeral in Sheridan, Ark., that it was too late to bring him back, but  going with him was "still our choice." Thomas Smith, 17, was the first of three  suicides among students at Sheridan High School in two days, and counselors for  their classmates were on 24-hour call. About 250 people packed into a chapel to  hear the Rev. Dennis Moon urge them to cling to God as they grieved over  Smith's death.  </P></p>

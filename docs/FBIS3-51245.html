			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Arnulfo Barroso Watson] </F>   [Text] Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, president of the Arnulfist  Party [PA], has said three political parties have confirmed they  will join the PA in the coming elections, while President  Guillermo Endara has said he was "seriously assessing" his  government's situation after negotiations were broken off with  Molirena [Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement].    Moscoso de Gruber has said the Authentic Liberal Party  (PLA),  the Independent Democratic Union (UDI), and the Popular Alliance  [AP] have confirmed they will join forces with the PA in the  coming elections; nevertheless, according to a ruling issued  last night by the Electoral Tribunal, the AP cannot participate  in the coming elections.    Moscoso de Gruber added that the Popular Nationalist Party  will decide in the coming hours if it will participate in this  alliance, while the Nationalist Unity Mission will decide on  this issue during the weekend.    Regarding Molirena, the political leader has said that if  this party will remember that the PA must lead the presidential  ticket, negotiations can be resumed.    According to the latest Electoral Tribunal statistics, the  PA  has 130,000 registered members. Meanwhile, its allies, the PLA  and the UDI, have 27,000 and 24,000 registered members  respectively.    The opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party has 180,000  registered voters, and its possible allies--the Labor Party and  Liberal Republican Party--have 80,000 and 30,000 registered  voters respectively.    Meanwhile, President Endara has told EL PANAMA AMERICA that  he will decide on the state of his government regarding Molirena  when his conscious tells him what he must do.    "It is a critical situation, because there is no doubt that  when two parties of my government cannot reach an agreement,  this can logically have some consequences; nevertheless, as  president I am removed from partisan interests," he said.    Endara reiterated that for the time being he has not made  any  decision on the situation of the Molirena members in his  government. Nevertheless, he said that he will make a decision  that is best for Panama.    Meanwhile, the president has reported that the nation's  current political situation might prevent his participation in  the inauguration for new Honduran President Carlos Roberto  Reina, scheduled for 27 January.</p>

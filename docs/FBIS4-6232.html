			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Eighth installment of "basic contents" of Hanoi 20-25 </F> January Midterm Party National Conference resolution]    [Text] At present, our party still upholds its tradition of  unity, a very important factor for our party's strength in  leading the public to overcome difficulties and obtain very  important achievements in the renovation undertaking. However,  we must always highly rate the duty of strengthening party unity  because although, generally, out party is united, some party  organs and party committees are facing a lack of unity --  serious in some places; some party cadres and party members do  not strictly observe the principle of democratic centralism; and  hostile forces are finding ways of interfering with our internal  affairs, degrading our cadres' political and moral quality, and  dividing us in line with the implementation of their "peaceful  evolution" conspiracy.    In order to strengthen internal unity, we must perform many  tasks. Party committees must outline appropriate measures  suitable for their practical conditions. But there is a common  point that all party organs, cadres, and members must take heed  of: this is the implementation of the party principles on  organization and activity, beginning with the principle of  democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership  and individual responsibility. These very principles, on one  hand, help to develop the party's intellectual ability so that  it can reduce mistakes and shortcomings in its decision and  ensure the party's stable and dynamic management. On the other  hand, they make sure that our party is a united bloc and a  strong organization.    It is necessary to stress that these principles do not  destroy democracy. The party statures clearly state: In  organizing and in discussing all issues, every party member is  allowed to fully express his view. However, when an issue has  been decided upon by the majority, a person with a view which is  in the minority can retain his view, but he must conform with  the decision of the majority.    Together with the implementation of these principles, the  political report clearly points out that party cadres and party  members must inculcate in themselves a revolutionary morality  and a healthy lifestyle and fight against waste, corruption,  illegal business practices, individualism, indiscipline,  authoritarianism, parochialism, and clannishness, because these  evils will lead to disunity.    c. The national block must be broadened, and the close  relationship between the party and public must be consolidated.  Uncle Ho's thought must be promulgated to broadly unite the  Vietnamese people in supporting the renovation cause for  national independence and in striving to extricate ourselves  from poverty and backwardness in order to surge forward toward  the goal of a prosperous population, a strong nation, and a just  and civilized society.    We must consider the national interest as our common goal.  At the same time, we accept different viewpoints as long as  they do not run counter to the national interest. We should  eliminate obsessions and hatred and look forward to the future.  The ideology of great unity must be manifested in all state  guidance, policies, and laws.    Is national unity a strategic policy?    National unity is a fundamental policy of our party and  state. The ideology of great unity must be manifested in all  state guidance, policies, and laws and in all areas of politics,  economy, society, security, national defense, and foreign  affairs to meet the legitimate interest and aspiration of people  from all walks of life; link benefit with responsibility and  individual interest with citizenship obligation; respect  national interest; and create favorable conditions and an  environment to completely liberate the power of production and  encourage all people and economic sectors to increase  production, improve business, enrich themselves legally,  practice thrift for national construction and protection, and  continuously improve the people's material and cultural life.  At the same time, it encourages all people to satisfactorily  implement social welfare policies by repaying debts to people  who have rendered meritorious service to the nation, to  participate in public work and charity and humanitarian  activities, and to help each another eliminate starvation,  reduce poverty, and develop the tradition of kindness and  gratitude of our ancestors.    We must broaden the national unity in diversified forms. We  must organize and develop more new activity forms from low to  higher levels and create different forms suitable to different  walks of life. We must develop the active role of exemplary  persons in all social classes, levels of society, ethnic  communities, and religions. We must direct our activity to  villages, subwards, and households. And we must consolidate the  alliance between the worker and the peasant and intellectuals,  making it a foundation for national unity.    d. We have to reform the cadre-related work. First, we must  renew the concepts and methods of our cadre-related work in  assessing, selecting, employing, and deploying cadres,  especially key cadres. Gifted people must be trained,  encouraged, and employed. We have to create favorable  conditions for sound people -- both inside and outside the party  and inside and outside the country -- to contribute their best  efforts for the nation. We have to rejuvenate the contingent of  cadres and promote elderly cadres with sound knowledge,  experience, political stance, and health. Woman and ethnic  cadres must be given special attention. And we must fight  narrow-mindedness, parochialism, prejudice, and discrimination.</p>

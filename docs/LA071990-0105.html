			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GLENDALE;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION ASKED OF FIRE RESPONSE  </P> <P> A coalition of Glendale homeowner associations has asked the state to  investigate whether a countywide force of firefighters responded efficiently to  a hillside blaze that destroyed 46 homes and damaged 20 others in the city on  June 27, a spokesman for the coalition said Wednesday. Some activists have  charged that many homes were lost in neighborhoods neglected by firefighters  until well after the flames had spread. The Glendale Homeowners Coordinating  Council, representing 15 homeowner associations, asked that Atty. Gen. John K.  Van de Kamp, along with the state fire marshal's staff, "conduct a full  investigation of all aspects of the fire."  </P></p>

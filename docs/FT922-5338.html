			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / America's sale of the century: Privatisation is gaining momentum in state and city government There is a tide in world financial and business affairs which normally flows from the western hemisphere to Europe, a little like the Gulf Stream: Americans invent an idea, popularise it, and some time later it washes up in plagiarised form on the shores of Britain, France and Germany. In an unusual reversal of this phenomenon, the US is slowly warming to privatisation - the sale of state owned businesses to the private sector. It is doing so roughly a decade behind Britain and contemporaneous with the former east European satellites of the Soviet Union and the Third World regimes of Latin America. To non-Americans, it may seem surprising that the US, the most capitalist economy of all, has any significant assets in public ownership. Certainly, very little is owned by the Federal Government, apart from the post office, some regional electric power systems, the Amtrak railway and America's air traffic control network. However, state and city governments own and operate a huge range of businesses in the utility and infrastructure sectors, including highways, bridges, tunnels, seaports, airports, power stations and water plants. A few of these local governments, citing the successful example of Margaret Thatcher's privatisation drive in Britain, are now beginning to look at ways of selling existing enterprises, mostly to private corporations, but possibly in public share sales as well. They are also trying to get the private sector to finance the construction of new facilities such as toll roads. This in turn is starting to create opportunities for bankers, financial advisers and corporate investors, be they US companies or European ones with privatisation experience. The Reason Foundation, a Los Angeles-based think-tank which strongly supports privatisation, reckons that the US has some Dollars 226bn of existing state and municipal enterprises which could potentially be spun off. Privatisation on such a grand scale seems highly unlikely, due to a combination of political, legal and financial hurdles. However, President Bush gave the nascent movement a large nudge forward in April when he signed an executive order which removes some of the biggest financial and bureaucratic barriers to asset sales. Why the sudden enthusiasm? The Republican White House, which has long paid lip service to privatisation as ideologically desirable, now views it as politically helpful too. Mr Bush, weighed down with a Dollars 360bn federal budget deficit, has very limited scope for fiscal stimuli which would help spur recovery from recession in this presidential election year. The privatisation initiative is part of his re-election campaign effort to streamline or remove government regulations which hold back economic growth. The small but vocal privatisation lobby argues that there are several powerful, longer-term reasons for selling off assets. First, this could help alleviate America's serious infrastructure problems. Many of America's roads, bridges, and sewers are in serious decay - a fact underlined by the quarter of a billion gallons of water which flooded central Chicago in April when a tunnel collapsed. But the states and municipal authorities responsible for maintaining them lack the funds to do so. The privatisation lobby argues that private investors would provide the necessary capital if ownership were transferred to them. The weakness of this argument is that canny investors will want to buy only assets in good condition, leaving local governments nursing those most in need of rehabilitation. Still, the money raised from the disposal of 'good' assets could then be used by governments to rehabilitate 'bad' ones. Some of the money raised by privatisation might also be used by local governments to alleviate other serious problems, such as the plight of the predominantly black underclass in the inner cities. This argument is being pressed with particular vigour in the wake of last month's Los Angeles riots. 'It is a crime that state and local governments fiddle with billions of dollars in assets which could be used to rebuild cities - while the cities burn,' says Mr John Giraudo, a privatisation expert with the legal firm of Skadden Arps. The sale of state-owned enterprises is also the logical corollary of a fast-growing movement in the US to make government more efficient by adopting business practices similar to those of the private sector. Apostles of the movement include some of the most innovative state governors in the country, both Democratic and Republican: Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee and Arkansas Governor; Mr William Weld, the Republican who is shaking up Massachusetts; Mr Lawton Chiles, the Democrat who is reshaping Florida's civil service; and Mrs Ann Richards, the Democrat running Texas. Their bible is Reinventing Government, a book which has gone through seven printings since publication in February and, improbably for such a dry subject, spent eight weeks on the New York Times non-fiction best-seller list. Its authors, Mr David Osborne and Mr Ted Gaebler, are consultants on public sector efficiency, who believe government in the US must be more 'entrepreneurial' or businesslike if it is to overcome decades of accumulated bureaucratic inertia and financial waste. Their solutions include privatisation; decentralising responsibility to encourage innovation and flexibility among civil servants. Much of this medicine will appear commonplace to anyone who lived through Britain's privatisation revolution in the 1980s. But the American variant adds in a hefty dose of popular US business theories which emphasise quality standards and customer satisfaction. Several powerful financial forces have been impelling local governments in this direction: a revolt by taxpayers, tired of financing bureaucratic inefficiency, manifested both in anti-tax referenda and votes against high-tax administrations; President Reagan's cuts in federal aid to state and local administrations during the 1980s; and recession, which has further eroded local governments' revenue base. State and municipal politicians, desperate to balance their budgets, have been pursuing two main avenues of reform. First, they have been shaking up their existing civil service structures and control systems to improve performance. Second, they have been contracting out services previously performed by the government - such as running prisons and collecting garbage - to private sector companies, a process which is also often termed 'privatisation'. So far there is still far more talk of reform than action. Political inertia or fear of opposition from public sector unions remains widespread, and relatively few politicians have begun seriously considering the outright sale of large assets. But the cutting edge of the reform movement can be seen in Massachusetts, where the Republican Mr Weld took over as governor at the start of last year in a wave of revulsion by voters against the high tax regime of his predecessor, Mr Michael Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic presidential nominee. Mr Weld's first budget slashed state spending, while his second proposes modest cuts in taxes at a time when most states have been raising theirs to cope with revenue shortfalls. He has launched a war on bureaucratic red tape and begun contracting out government services, including parts of the hospital system, prisoners' healthcare, some roads' maintenance and parts of the vehicle registration system. Mr Weld has also floated the idea of privatising two of the state's largest infrastructure assets - Boston's Logan airport, the ninth busiest in the US, and the Massachusetts Turnpike, a 135-mile toll road. Studies have suggested that both could be sold - the airport for nearly Dollars 800m and the road for about Dollars 950m - but neither disposal is imminent, partly for local political reasons and partly because of the complexity of such a move. In Massachusetts, as elsewhere, one factor holding back privatisation is the sheer fragmentation of the government machine and the large number of interested parties involved in decision-making. 'In the US,' says Skadden Arp's Mr Giraudo, 'privatisation requires achieving a much larger political consensus than in other nations.' For example, an attempt by Lockheed, the aerospace company, to take a long-term lease on the regional airport at Albany, in New York state, became bogged down last year in a lengthy debate with the Federal Aviation Administration, the federal agency responsible for the industry. Until now, another difficulty holding back privatisation has been a requirement that any administration selling an asset pay back any grants the enterprise has received from the federal government. President Bush's recent order clears away some of the biggest of these hurdles, for it allows a privatising administration to keep the bulk of such grants and also orders federal agencies - such as the FAA - to co-operate fully in privatisation efforts. Even so, obstacles will remain. Take airports, for example. This sector is closest to producing a big candidate for disposal, with Los Angeles completing a study for the privatisation of its international airport and Maryland looking at leasing out Baltimore/Washington. America's airlines, concerned that this will mean much higher landing fees, have begun lobbying against privatisation, and some analysts believe no sale is likely until their fears are allayed, possibly by granting them a stake in a privatised airport's profits. The privatisation movement, however, extends beyond the sale of existing assets to entirely new projects. For example, a highways act passed by congress last November should encourage the building of new toll roads by private investors. The federal government heavily subsidises road construction, but until now it has not allowed most roads built by states with federal aid to charge tolls. The new legislation retains this ban on America's main interstate highways, but it allows states to use federal money for non-interstate toll roads - and for the first time it specifically allows them to use these funds to support private sector investment. Even before the new legislation, plans were well advanced for the construction of five unsubsidised private toll roads - four of them in California and one in Virginia. These new projects create opportunities beyond America's borders. European commercial and investment banks have much more experience of financing such ventures - be it providing loans or advising on debt and equity offerings. SG Warburg, the British merchant bank which arranged public share offerings in both the Channel tunnel and the new Disney theme park in France, has, for example, been examining the possibilities of advising on US privatisations. However, Warburg's Mr David Freud points out that the US project financing market has substantial differences from Europe. He cites, for example, 'horrific' legal liability issues which could complicate US equity offerings. In this, as in so many other aspects of privatisation, it seems the US may still have something to learn from Europe. * Reinventing Government. David Osborne and Ted Gaebler.

Churin Laksanawisit, vice minister of commerce, told  reporters at a Thai products fair here that there are a number  of domestic quality inspections of rice before it is exported  and inspected in Japan.    The vice minister said Bangkok recognizes the importance of  value and quality.    Japan recently began importing rice on an emergency basis to  cover shortfalls caused by harvest shortages last year due to an  unusually cool summer.    The rice imports have been met with opposition by Japanese  farmers and consumer groups, along with reports that some of the  rice coming into Japan has been discolored by mold.    As for the flavor of Thai rice, Laksanawisit began by noting  that the method of preparing the rice in Japan and Thailand is  different but added that if Japanese consumers get used to the  way of cooking Thai rice they would find it delicious.</p>

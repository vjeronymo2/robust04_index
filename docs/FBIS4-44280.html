			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Summit: Berlusconi Sees </F> Fruitful Future"]    [Text] (ANSA) Corfu, June 25 -- Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi said here today that, after his first taste of  a European summit, he is now optimistic over the chances of his  government's constructive and fruitful cooperation with the  other eleven EU [European Union] capitals.    At a summit marked by the EU leaders' failure to find  agreement on a successor to Commission President Jacques Delors,  Berlusconi told reporters at a press conference afterwards that  he had found himself "on the same wave length" as the other  summiteers.    On the naming of a new head to the EU's executive,  Berlusconi  said the Italian position was that the choice would be "of a  philosophy" as much as a person whence the counsel against haste.    According to the Italian premier, the philosophy involves  leaving only joint defence and security to the EU level of  Europe, ensuring that joint economic policies are applied with a  minimum of regulation and also requiring continual application  of the "principle of subsidiarity" whereby the EU should not do  what can be done at a lower level.    The Italian candidate for the commission presidency was Ruud  Lubbers, but there were no objections to the Franco-German  suggestion of Belgian premier Jean Luc Dehaene. The British  veto postponed any decision until mid-July. "The important  thing is for each country to identify itself in the new  president," said Berlusconi. "For this reason, too, we have to  wait a bit."    According to Berlusconi, he voiced support for a further  summit on this specific issue on July 15. He also described the  signing of Norway, Austria, Finland and Sweden into the EU as  projecting the future union towards Central and East Europe.    In other points, he said Italy's only claim in Slovenia was  to the return of property confiscated from Italian nationals  after the war and forecast that the EU would only be able to  introduce a single currency after the year 2000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Alliance 90/Greens regard their  success in the European election as signalling the wish of many  people for a political change in the FRG. On Monday [13 June]  Executive Committee spokeswoman Marianne Birthler and Executive  Committee spokesman Ludger Volmer called on the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] to declare itself in favor of  a clear reform policy, in order jointly to replace Chancellor  Helmut Kohl's coalition in the Bundestag election. The chances  for Red-Green in the government have not yet been missed, it was  stated.    "We hope that the SPD will still make it," Volmer stated  before journalists in Bonn. His party will continue to put  pressure on the Social Democrats -- "Rudolf Scharping will not  get rid of us." The Greens have finally established themselves  as the third political force in Germany, he said.    It is true that SPD Chairman Scharping is the loser of the  European election. However, Kohl continues to be the main  opponent. He alone benefits from false promises and vague fears  of the people. He does not have any recipes for overcoming the  problems of the future. This has to be made even clearer to the  voters in the next few months, also by the Social Democrats, who  must not adjust to Kohl's policy any longer. "There is a need  for a tough opposition to Kohl's government" -- if necessary,  the Greens will "also fight for the SPD."    Claudia Roth, European frontrunner of the Greens, warned the  Christian Democrats against taking the party of Italian Prime  Minister Silvio Berlusconi into their European parliamentary  group. In this way, the ban on the right-wing extremists by the  democratic parties in Europe would be undermined, she said.</p>

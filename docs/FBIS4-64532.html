			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Li Ruihuan, one of the major leaders in China,  has met Finland's political leaders in Helsinki. The talks with  President Martti Ahtisaari, Prime Minister Esko Aho, and Foreign  Minister Heikki Haavisto raised issues concerning world  politics, relations between China and Finland, and human rights  in China. Matti Vaeisaenen reports.    [Vaeisaenen] The treatment of Chinese dissidents --  oppression, harassment, detention, and arrests -- has aroused  opposition from western governments toward the political  leadership in China. Finland's line has been -- as shown during  Prime Minister Esko Aho's visit to China a month ago -- that  human rights are talked about but no big fuss is made about  them, and an attempt is made to influence Chinese politics in a  discreet fashion. In this sense the talks with Li Ruihuan were  not very different. Both President Martti Ahtisaari and Foreign  Minister Heikki Haavisto raised the matter of human rights.  Departmental head Jaakko Laajava from the Foreign Ministry said  that Haavisto expressed Finland's basic views. [passage omitted]    Li justified the events in Tiananmen Square five years ago  with the explanation that chaos caused by some activists was  threatening the country at the time. If the matter had not been  dealt with, that is if the opposition, which was known as the  democracy movement in the West, had not been crushed by armed  force, China might have gone the way the Soviet Union went --  disintegration, Li Ruihuan said.    The Chinese guest reiterated one of the main principles of  Chinese politics, that it does not interfere in the affairs of  other countries and it does not allow others to interfere in its  affairs. This includes human rights; according to China, taking  care of human rights is entirely an internal matter.    Li Ruihuan explained to the Finnish leaders the basic  principles and achievements of the economic and political reform  process in China. The rapid pace of developing economic  relations between Finland and China was mentioned in this  connection.    Finland and China agree that Russia is an important factor  internationally and it must not be isolated. In the dispute on  the Korean peninsula China attempts to keep the peninsula  nuclear free by peaceful means. Li warned that China's  influence is not limitless, and overly high expectations should  not be attached to China's influence.</p>

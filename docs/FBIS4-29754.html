			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata's ruling coalition is headed for crucial reconciliation  talks with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ]  which holds the key to the fate of his minority government.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said he will call on Hata,  hopefully Wednesday [22 June], to discuss the SDP's policy  platform, adopted late Tuesday, and the party's possible return  to the ruling coalition.    The SDP, the second largest opposition party, will not  submit  a no-confidence vote during the course of talks, whose outcome  should determine the survival of Hata's two-month-old cabinet,  Murayama said.    Meanwhile, the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) decided the same day to formalize the party policy of  submitting a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet after  the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget clears the last Diet hurdle  on Thursday.    With the opposition camp raising the ante through their  political maneuvering, the ruling coalition extended its own  overture to the SDP to rejoin their camp, officially proposing  talks to the socialists.    The coalition is pinning hopes on its efforts to woo the SDP  back into their group in order to defeat the LDP's planned  no-confidence vote.    The SDP platform has been welcomed by both the ruling  coalition and the LDP, which is seeking to create a stopgap  cabinet with the SDP through early elections.    The SDP policy outline calls for making the policy-making  process within the coalition more "democratic" and proposes a  tax reform centered on raising indirect taxes.    The party stormed out of the ruling coalition in April in a  row over a move by some coalition partners to create a new Diet  bloc without the socialists, which the SDP viewed as an attempt  to put them on the back-seat in policy making.    The outline also urges passage in the next Diet session of  the bills for redrawing the electoral map for a new election  system of single-seat constituencies combined with proportional  representation for the House of Representatives, to replace the  current multi-seat system.    Ruling coalition lawmakers immediately showed a readiness to  embrace the SDP proposals.    "At first sight, there are no problems (with the platform),"  said a top government official.    A senior official of Komeito [Clean Government Party], a key  component of the coalition, concurred, saying, "the hurdles (for  an agreement) are not high. The proposals show (the SDP) is  seriously thinking about returning to the coalition."    The SDP's government blueprint also met a welcome from the  LDP, which needs the socialists' support to pass the  no-confidence vote.    "The contents (of the proposals) are nothing that we have to  refuse at the negotiating table," a senior party policy maker  said.    "No obstacles exist to our acceptance," another senior  official said.    Even if the ruling coalition and the socialists agree to  link  up again, it remains unclear whether Hata will retain office due  to disarray within the SDP.    SDP lawmakers who support Murayama called first for Hata's  resignation, and a no-confidence motion if Hata should refuse  the call.    On the other hand, SDP right-wingers led by Wataru Kubo, the  party's secretary general, are placing top priority on a return  to the ruling camp and are reluctant about demanding that Hata  step down before the results of the realliance talks become  clear.</p>

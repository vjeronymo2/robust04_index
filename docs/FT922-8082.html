			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation data fail to give Dow a boost Wall Street US EQUITIES largely ignored the day's economic news and traded in a narrow range yesterday, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just 6.86 higher at 3,391.98 after light volume for the New York SE of 176m shares. Advances held a slim lead over declines by 869 to 808. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.16 up at 416.45 while the Nasdaq composite eased 1.58 to 582.28. The market failed to respond to two sets of economic data for April. The 0.2 per cent rise in the consumer price index confirmed low inflation prospects, while the 0.9 per cent increase in retail prices was consistent with moderate economic growth. Although it is still possible that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, the unexpectedly strong retail price report reduced expectations of an imminent easing. There was some confusion following the Fed's aggressive adding operation in the morning, when it arranged overnight system repurchase agreements. The strength of the open market intervention was unexpected, but it was generally seen as a technical move. Marion Merrell Dow led big board trading, dipping Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32. Late on Tuesday, 16m shares were priced at Dollars 32 a share. A group of shareholders, including the company's chairman emeritus, will offer 12.8m shares of the total in the US, with the remainder offered abroad. Delivery is scheduled for May 19. The company will not receive any proceeds from the offering. Eastman Kodak rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 41 5/8 . At the annual meeting Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman and chief executive, predicted improved sales and earnings in the second half of this year. Polaroid, Kodak's main US rival, gained Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 25 3/8 after Prudential Research increased its second-quarter estimate for the company to 50 cents a share from 37 cents. At Polaroid's annual meeting a day earlier, a proposal to remove its so-called 'poison pill' takeover defence was quashed. The defeat, however, was narrower than the previous year when a similar suggestion was also rejected. The Limited regained Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 1/8 in heavy trading after dropping Dollars 2 5/8 on Tuesday on disappointing first-quarter results. A number of banks firmed in active afternoon trading, including Citicorp, up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 19 5/8 , BankAmerica, Dollars 1 1/8 higher at Dollars 49 5/8 , Chase Manhattan, Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars 30 1/8 , and Chemical, Dollars  7/8 ahead at Dollars 38 3/4 . Live Entertainment jumped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 2 3/4 on news that its home-video business had signed a three-year distribution agreement with a unit of Time Warner. On the Nasdaq market, high-tech and telecommunications issues led trading. Microsoft fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 112 3/4 and Intel dipped Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 . Canada TORONTO weakened late in the day, with declines seen in bank and utility shares. Banks fell on rising nervousness that Olympia &amp; York is having trouble with its debt restructuring process and faces the seizure of several assets. The composite index finished 23.7 down at 3,404.2, while falls outscored rises by 313 to 258. Volume rose to 31m shares.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tandil, 4 May (NA) -- Air Force Chief of Staff  Brigadier General Juan Paulik today said that it is  "inadmissible to judge or doubt" the Armed Forces' "function of  maintaining national sovereignty."    He said this today at the Tandil air base, during the  commemoration of the 12th anniversary of the Argentine Air  Force's baptism of fire.    President Carlos Menem attended the ceremony accompanied by  Army Commander Lieutenant General Martin Balza and several  government officials.    During the ceremony to commemorate the Air Force's baptism  of  fire in 1982, Paulik said: "Man and his instruction will forever  be the marrow of military organization," despite the "evolution  of scientific and technological progress."    "Technological progress will be of little use if the  military  career, the will to serve, the esprit de corps, loyalty, and the  total conviction of our role as members of the armed branch of  the nation is downgraded," Paulik said.    He added: "The current moment poses serious questions  regarding the Armed Forces" but he considered that it  "inadmissible to doubt or judge the function of maintaining  national sovereignty."    The ceremony was also attended by former Air Force  commanders  Carlos Alberto Rey, Omar Graffigna, and Arturo Lami Dozo,  Military Affairs Secretary Jorge Baeza, and union leader Diego  Ibanez.    Brig. Gen. Paulik said the Air Force "has not given up the  supreme mandate of acting as part of the military instrument at  the service of the objectives of the National Government."    Finally, the Air Force chief paid homage to the pilots who  fought in the South Atlantic war, describing them as "true  examples of the duty of all Argentines, not just a few, to  defend the motherland."</p>

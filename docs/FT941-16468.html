			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / China to launch Dollars 100m fund in London The investment arm of China's Guangdong provincial government is launching a Dollars 100m (Pounds 67.5m) direct investment fund which will be listed on the London Stock Exchange. It will be the first Chinese development fund to be endorsed by a state government. The Guangdong Development Fund will invest in a wide range of projects in what is China's wealthiest province, and the management role of the provincial government should ensure rapid deal flow. A subsidiary of Guangdong Enterprises - the Guangdong government's investment arm - is to invest Dollars 10m in the fund. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the sponsor to the issue, will invest a similar amount, and it is planned that a further Dollars 80m will be placed out to US and European institutions. Since the 1992 visit to Guangdong by Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, alerted international fund managers to the changes taking place in southern China, there has been a flood of China funds listed, primarily in Hong Kong, New York and Dublin. Many of these funds have been slow to invest beyond the Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets, and most of the asset appreciation has come from Hong Kong-listed China concept stocks. Mr Victor Chu, a veteran China investor whose First Eastern China Investment will be co-manager of the fund, claims the Guangdong Development Fund will be fully invested within 15 months, and only 10 per cent can be invested in equities. He said: '1994 is going to be a difficult year in China. Even good state companies will find it difficult to expand capacity, but this will create investment opportunities.' The Guangdong Development Fund has already signed letters of intent for up to five projects which would absorb around 25 per cent of its capital. The fund is looking to invest in infrastructural projects and light industries within Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong.</p>

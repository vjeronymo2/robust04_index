			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Bundesbank chief in row over need for realignment THE German Bundesbank was last night at the centre of a renewed controversy after reports that Mr Helmut Schlesinger, its president, had suggested that a more comprehensive realignment of European currencies could have reduced turbulence in currency markets. The reports, quoted by DPA and VWD, the main German political and economic news agencies, were denied last night by a spokesman for the German central bank. The reported comments were based on an interview given by Mr Schlesinger to Handelsblatt, the German business newspaper, and to the Wall Street Journal. They prompted hurried telephone calls to Germany from officials at the Treasury and the Bank of England last night to seek clarification. According to the news agencies, Mr Schlesinger said that the measures taken so far had not resolved all the problems in the markets. The Bundesbank chief was reported to have suggested that the weekend realignment of the Italian lira had not gone far enough and that a wider realignment could have been more effective in reducing tensions in the currency market. He did not rule out continuing pressure on individual currencies. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said last night: 'There has never been any question of sterling being realigned or devalued and at no stage did anybody else suggest we should move with the Italians.' For its part, the Bundesbank said through a spokesman after consulting Mr Schlesinger: 'This statement is no authorised version of the interview.' It added: 'The president did not say it in that way or mean it in that way. The words were suggested to him and he did not answer them.' The spokesman said an authorised version of the interview would appear in the Wall Street Journal. Mr Hans Mundorf, editor-in-chief of Handelsblatt said last night: 'This interview . . . was conducted by the head of our currencies and capital markets staff. I have no doubt in the correctness of the information he gave to DPA.' The reported statements are in line with what is seen as a common Bundesbank view, but one it has been careful never to express publicly. Few officials in Bonn deny that there had been arguments in the Bundesbank for a wider realignment as part of last weekend's changes, but they insist that the 'political reality' only allowed a limited move involving the lira. The officials say that devaluation of sterling was 'not really considered as a valid option' because of the fierce hostility of the British government. According to the excerpts of the interview on German news agencies, Mr Schlesinger said the EMS was now considerably more relaxed than it had been last week. The Bundesbank chief was said to have noted that other currencies could be hit ahead of France's Sunday vote on the Maastricht Treaties. But the report continued: 'Even if France were to vote to reject the treaties - which he (Mr Schlesinger) thought unlikely - other currencies such as the pound sterling were not likely to come under similar pressure to that placed on the lira.'</p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Telling rebels to leave the past behind: Pehr Gyllenhammar, of Volvo, explains his mission to Hugh Carnegy For a man facing a powerful shareholder revolt, much of it directed against himself, Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the chairman of Volvo, is surprisingly unwilling to raise the stakes in the battle to push through the merger of Volvo's car and truck operations with France's Renault. No, he says, the survival of Volvo is not threatened if the deal does not go through. No, he does not think rejection would make Renault suddenly abandon Volvo. Yes, he takes seriously the often bitter criticism of his own role in the affair. But in an interview at Volvo's elegant headquarters outside Gothenburg, Mr Gyllenhammar is unshaken in his belief that the conversion of the three-year alliance into a full-blown merger is necessary for Volvo, and good for its sceptical shareholders. He cites the 7 per cent average return on turnover Renault and Volvo predict for the merged company - better than either has averaged alone in recent years. 'If we stop the momentum in a time of very tough competition in the industry, it would be a very serious mistake. There is little leeway these days for not doing the things you believe are right.' Opponents working to reject the merger at the rescheduled December 7 shareholders meeting argue that Volvo would be better to continue the alliance with Renault. That way, they say, Volvo would retain its independence and avoid the doubts about France's commitment to privatise, and the government's plans to hold a golden share in Renault-Volvo after privatisation. But PG, as everyone in Sweden calls him, insists such a move would 'replace momentum and dynamism with confusion and stagnation. You say 'you have the alliance'. No] Things have changed in the meantime. You cannot go back to something you have just mentally left. That's our concern and worry - that this doesn't work backwards. 'The French disappointment could be such that it underlines what I have just said, that there is not much to go back to. I shouldn't fear that they will turn their backs on us, but they must ask themselves what is now the way forward. If this which we believed in will not work, what then do we do?' The Renault merger affair has re-awakened a long-simmering dispute in Sweden about both the personality of Mr Gyllenhammar and the strategies he has pursued since he took over as Volvo chief executive in 1971. This has led, over the years, to interests acquired and sold in the energy business, a failed attempt in the late 1970s to sell 40 per cent of Volvo to Norway in exchange for oil concessions and, more recently, to the building of interests in the pharmaceutical and food and drink industries. A criticism now repeatedly voiced is that Volvo would never have reached the point of having to seek a junior partnership with Renault if it had concentrated its resources in its core businesses of cars and trucks. Why, ask some Swedes, could Volvo not have been a Swedish BMW? PG bristles. 'You could have said to me in the early 1970s, why don't you become a Rover? Well you have the answer now. What did Jaguar do, if that wasn't a BMW strategy? It has now disappeared. Or would we be an Alfa-Romeo, or a Lancia? They have disappeared. Or a Citroen, which went bankrupt? And why don't people compare us with Mercedes today? You know the answer. Because they are now loss makers.' BMW, says Mr Gyllenhammar, is cited because 'soon it will be the only one'. Besides, it benefits from a huge home market which Volvo does not. 'We sell more than 250,000 cars outside Sweden. Compare that to the others and you will find we are at the same volume outside our home market. 'We have invested as much money as could usefully be converted into good work and good results. It was money we could not have usefully invested in our core business that has been used outside. If you look at the value of our investments today they are not unattractive.' These arguments, however, have yet to stem the tide of opposition, much of which focuses on himself. Much given to making strong public statements, particularly urging reticent, neutral Sweden to open itself up more readily to the outside world, PG has frequently topped public popularity polls. But he has long irritated many in the business community for what is seen as his arrogance and cavalier attitude to shareholders. He is undoubtedly paying for some of that now in opposition to the Renault deal. He shrugs this off by remarking that although some dislike him - 'and I know many people do' - he has always been unanimously re-elected as chairman. What bothers him, he says, is that the personal criticism and nationalistic elements in the debate confuse the issue. And he is 'amazed' by what he sees as a lack of confidence in Volvo's ability to hold its own in the merger. 'That really upsets me,' he says. After the merger, he says, 'We will have a parent company that will have a good debt-equity ratio, be financially strong and therefore be a good and credible partner and owner with Renault. There is no reason whatsoever why we should be the losers.</p>

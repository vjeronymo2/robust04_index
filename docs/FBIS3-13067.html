It is 12 days since this  shocking tragedy took place, and despite extensive regional and  international reaction condemning it, the continuation of strong  protests by the Palestinians, and the unprecedented clashes  between the Zionist occupiers and the oppressed Palestinians,  the UN Security Council has refrained from issuing a resolution  on this.    The only thing that has prevented this resolution has been  U.S. opposition to the condemnation of the Zionist regime's  unprecedented crime in the massacre of worshipers. Despite  fundamental changes in the international balance of power with  the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the Eastern  bloc, one can see that UN decisions do not go beyond the  traditional frameworks based on alliances and that criteria such  as justness and humanity, as well as true security, have not  found their suitable place in UN decisions.    Even though the United States feigns to be a mere observer  in  the so-called Arab-Israeli compromise talks and should thus take  an impartial approach to incidents, it has impudently adopted a  pro- Zionist policy vis-a-vis a calamity, the condemnation of  which no one has the least bit of doubt, and is ignoring world  public opinion.    This stance by the White House stems from the fact that on  the basis of international laws and the conventions on war,  prisoners of war, and occupied territories, especially the  Fourth Convention of Geneva, the Zionist regime is legally  responsible for ensuring the security of the residents in the  occupied territories. If the Zionist regime is unwilling or  unable to ensure the security of the Palestinians, it should  hand over this duty to international organizations. Since the  Zionist regime wants to crush the risen Palestinians, on the one  hand, and does not want a third party to enter the scene in  order to cover up its crimes, on the other, it opposes the  dispatch of UN peacekeeping forces to the occupied territories.  Thus, the United States, which regards the Zionist regime's  behavior to be part of the confrontation with the wave of  Islamism and the Islamic revolution and in line with its own and  the Zionist regime's interests, extends unconditional support  for this regime.    However, behind the U.S.-Zionist regime's confrontation with  the wave of Islamism and the just uprising of the Palestinians,  talks are being held in the UN corridors between the United  States and the compromising Palestinian faction on the one side  and the Zionist regime and 'Arafat's representative on the  other. Egypt also plays the role of mediator in these talks.    Political experts consider the issuance of a Security  Council  resolution on this issue to be contingent on a compromise  between Tel Aviv and 'Arafat on the Palestinian demands on what  should be stated in the resolution. The Palestinian side--which  has been greatly disgraced among the Palestinians because of its  recent compromise on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, as well as  ensuing agreements--has lost its support, is propounding demands  that ultimately benefit the Zionist regime, and is trying to  slightly repair its domestic image. Thus, it wants the  resolution to emphasize international support for Palestinians  and to clarify the situation of Jerusalem.    However, experts believe that Israel will not give in to  these two demands and, in view of U.S. support for the Zionist  regime and the composition of the Security Council, no serious  resolution is expected to be issued.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / BT unions take lessons from US LEADERS of British Tel-ecommunications unions were yesterday being tutored by their US counterparts in 'electronic picketing'. The new tactic has been developed by US union officials in dispute with American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), principally over job security. The officials, who are visiting European unions as part of their campaign against AT&amp;T, have worked out a plan based on diverting long-distance business away from AT&amp;T into the hands of its competitors. Mr Tony Young, general secretary of the NCU communications union, the main BT engineers union, said BT exhibited many of AT&amp;T's features in its labour relations. The NCU has rejected a pay offer of 4.1 per cent from July for BT engineers.</p>

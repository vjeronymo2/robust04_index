			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: London's liquid liability It was easy enough to conclude last week that there were special factors behind the great GPA flop. The continuing lack of enthusiasm for equities in London, though, will do nothing for the nerves of Wellcome's advisers or the clutch of smaller companies with flotations now at an advanced stage. Wellcome ought to make it if for no other reason than that it is a notable member of the Footsie, in which major investors are badly underweight. Un-like the now empty-handed aircraft lessors, moreover, the company is in the position of not needing the money itself, which would limit the damage if the issue did have to be pulled. The problem is not just that the economic recovery has again failed to arrive, but a marked shortage of liquidity. Eighteen months ago cash represented around 7 per cent of institutional portfolios, but the proportion is now nearer 4 per cent. Last year's spate of rights issues was partly responsible, but the growing number of pension fund holidays and lower dividend increases have also taken their toll. The third quarter of 1992 coincides not only with calls from the flotations, but instalment payments from BT and the regional electricity companies, while government funding in the gilts market continues apace. In itself, of course, liquidity would not be an obstacle if equities were thought to be cheap. Perceptions will change at some stage - but it arguably does not help that institutions' UK equity weighting is close to the top end of its 10 year range.</p>

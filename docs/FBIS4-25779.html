			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "China Seeks Advice on GATT"] </F>   [Text] China will consult major Asia-Pacific countries  this week on rejoining the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), a senior official said yesterday.    The consultation will take place at the two-day Awashima  Forum, which starts in Japan on Friday.    The forum, organized by the Japan Institute of International  Affairs, will shed light on Asia-Pacific cooperation after the  conclusion of the Uruguay Round in April.    Almost all the countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific Rim  are expected to participate in the conference.    "We attach great importance to integration with the  Asia-Pacific economies, with which most of our trade is  involved," said Long Yongtu, assistant minister at the Ministry  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).    He leaves today for Japan together with a senior Chinese  research fellow in the automobile industry.    He said that the advice of Asia Pacific nations would be  beneficial to China.    Most countries in the region support China's re-entry into  the global free trade body because they know that today's  multilateral trade system would be incomplete without Chinese  participation.</p>

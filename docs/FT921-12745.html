			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories to maintain tax offensive - Economy THE Conservatives signalled their determination to keep Labour on the defensive over taxation yesterday, alleging that the 'phasing' of increases in national insurance and income tax would decisively undercut its spending pledges. The attack coincided with an effort by Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, to rekindle concern about Labour's plans for a minimum wage by saying it would cost more than 2m jobs. Following Mr Kinnock's interview yesterday in the Financial Times, Mr David Mellor, the chief secretary of the Treasury, said Labour's immediate commitments now totalled Pounds 4.75bn. That comprised the Pounds 3.75bn it would cost to raise child benefit and pensions and the Pounds 1bn economic recovery programme promised by the opposition. Mr Mellor said official figures given in response to parliamentary questions showed that by abolishing the income ceiling on National Insurance contributions and raising the top rate of income tax to 50 per cent, Labour would raise an extra Pounds 3.85bn in the first year. That left a shortfall of nearly Pounds 1bn, even if Labour dropped any suggestion that the tax and national insurance contribution increases would be phased. Mr Kinnock insisted in his interview that he would keep open the option of phasing until after the election. Mr Mellor has been given the role of ensuring tax remains a central issue in the campaign. He said that Labour's attempt to present a prudent and balanced tax and spending policy had 'fallen apart after just a few days scrutiny'. Mr Howard said Labour's plans for a national minimum wage, for a training levy and for implementing the European Community's social action programme would lead to the loss of a total of 2.25m jobs. For the first time, the Tories provided a rough guide as to how the national figures they claimed for job losses would be dispersed throughout the regions and in some constituencies: worst hit would be the south-east and greater London, which would lose 427,500 and 337,500 jobs respectively. While Labour has emphasised commitment to a minimum wage at half median male earnings, Tory figures were based on a promise that at some point the minimum wage would rise to two-thirds male earnings, and assumed differentials would be maintained in full. Mr Howard also emphasised that Labour had other plans, such as cuts in defence spending, that would threaten jobs. He said: 'Dozens of constituencies would be desperately hard hit, including those in Bristol, Derby and Nottingham.' Barrow would be devastated by Labour's irresponsible approach to the defence of our country.' Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said the figures would not stand serious scrutiny.</p>

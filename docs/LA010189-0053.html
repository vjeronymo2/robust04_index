			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEHIND THE SCENES  </P> <P> If Harlowe wants to see the real Soviet Union she should stay away from cities  like Moscow and Leningrad. They represent their country as much as Tijuana and  Juarez represent Mexico. Moscow and Leningrad have been set up to appeal to  Western tourists. Mostly everything in these cities has been carefully  orchestrated to create a positive image. I was born and raised in Moscow, so I  am very much aware of how this system has been set up. If Harlowe wants her  eyes opened she should see towns outside of the mainstream -- if she can get  permission.  </P> <P> VICTORIA ZAKHARIN  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

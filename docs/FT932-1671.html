			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Major enjoys a minor triumph THIS WAS not a summit that settled anything. But from Mr John Major's perspective that perhaps was no bad thing. With the final act of the Maastricht drama now drawing to a close in the UK parliament, the prime minister had two well-defined objectives. The first was to persuade sceptical European counterparts that Britain - stranded outside the ERM, dismissive of Emu and disparaging of the social chapter - can still make a significant contribution to the debate on Europe's future. The second, and more immediate, aim was to persuade a rather different brand of sceptic in his own Conservative party - the Europhobes - that he is being listened to, that Europe might yet forsake its obsession with internal institutional change in favour of a liberal, free-market, outward-looking agenda. Mr Major half-succeeded. Copenhagen provided the evidence of post-Maastricht exhaustion among Europe's leaders. British officials could claim that federalism was a word scarcely uttered at the summit table. 'Reality has broken in,' declared Mr Major. With 17m unemployed across the Community and the total rising there was grudging admission that the biggest challenge facing Europe was to reverse the decline in its competitiveness. But his partners still cannot understand his antagonism to the social dimension and are less than amused by UK boasts that its more flexible labour market acts as a magnet for inward investment. The realities, though, of large budget deficits, of inexorable increases in social security budgets and of rising jobless totals have had an impact. Mr Major still faces battles over several planned directives, the part-time work and young persons employment proposals among them. But it was hard to detect any enthusiasm for another wave of social harmonisation. With the Dutch, the Spanish, the Portuguese and one or two others ready to use phrases like 'flexible labour markets' and 'social priorities', Mr Major claimed the summit marked a breakthrough. He did not agree with the prescription of some of his partners for restoring Europe's ailing economies, but at least the Community had agreed on the need to confront the hard realities. It was now 'addressing today's needs and not tomorrow's dreams'. There was hyberbole in much of this. At these summits Britain still looks the reluctant partner. But Mr Major played his cards well. He has had much worse summits.</p>

Faithful compatriots, the recent treacherous coup d'etat is  the continuation of a series of consistent crimes that have been  shaped by the enemies of Islam and our dear homeland outside the  country's borders and that have been implemented one by one by  treacherous elements and merciless murderers, the sworn enemies  of our nation. The defeat of this bloody conspiracy along with  its broad external and internal dimensions, is a gigantic  victory and a historic deed by self-sacrificing heroic mojahedin  and the wisdom of our new Islamic army. I congratulate the  faithful nation and brave mojahedin, who with unprecedented  courage stand in the trenches defending the soil of Islam and  their homeland, on this great victory. I express thanks and  gratitude to all leaders, the knowledgeable ulema, and dear  commanders who have played a historic role in the defeat of this  bloody coup d'etat and have supported the Islamic state. I  sincerely thank all the people of Kabul, who have welcomed  refugees from the affected areas; the state's services  commission; the Red Crescent; the International Red Cross; and  doctors and hospital personnel, who, with courage and sympathy,  have rendered services to the wounded, the disabled, and  refugees.    The Islamic state, while determined to uproot the reasons  for  the country's lack of stability in line with the wishes of the  people, [words indistinct] to violate shamefully the life,  property, and honor of the people, is ready to end the war with  the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], which  Hekmatyar, contrary to the will of its center of decision-making  and contrary to the will of its commanders, has unilaterally  participated in this bloody catastrophe. We believe the members  of Hezb-e Eslami are never desirous of war against their  colleagues-in-one-trench and mojahedin in the Islamic state. In  particular, after the recent conspiracy, no one in the Hezb-e  Eslami wants to stand against the [word indistinct] of faithful  mojahedin in the Islamic state and against the whole nation and  to be apparently those whose swords are with Yazid [person who  killed Prophet Mohammad's grandson Husayn in Karbala'] and their  hearts with Hosayn.    However, as far as it depends on the militia, the purging of  professional murderers and the centers of corruption and  savagery will continue until they surrender their weapons to the  Afghan nation.    The Islamic state warmly welcomes the sympathetic efforts of  leaders of the fraternal countries: Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, the  Islamic Republic of Iran, the ICO [Islamic Conference  Organization] foreign ministers conference, and the UN, who are  making efforts toward the establishment of security and putting  an end to bloodshed in Afghanistan. Special envoys of the  Islamic state of Afghanistan have met and discussed this matter  with the leaders of the fraternal countries, Pakistan and Saudi  Arabia. A delegation will be sent soon to Tehran to gain the  cooperation of this fraternal neighboring country in solving our  problems, while thanking it for its goodwill efforts.    In the meantime the state sincerely welcomes all esteemed  circles in the country who are making efforts toward peace. We  hope their efforts bear fruit.    Concerning political changes in the country's future, this  point should not be left unsaid: The Islamic state never allows  conspirators to target the destiny of this nation for their  sinister aims through killing and murder. The people have  determined their political destiny through their presence within  the Resolution and Settlement Council [Shra-e Hal wa 'Aqd]. We  again give the right to the nation's representatives to appoint  their future leadership through a gathering or elections in line  with the country's special conditions.    We invite the ICO and UN representatives to take part in and  help us with the process of elections or any other process our  people choose. Peace be upon you. God be with you.</p>

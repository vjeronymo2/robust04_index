			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Svetla Koleva: "Boyko Noev's Reignation Was His </F> Personal Decision"]    [Text] The Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] did not make  any official or unofficial demand for the resignation of Deputy  Defense Minister Boyko Noev, Nikolay Kamov [deputy leader of the  BSP-led parliamentary group] told correspondents, adding that  such an act was merely a matter solely for a personal decision.    According to Kamov, it is no accident that the BSP is  demanding that the government review the action or lack of  action of all top state officials in delaying to provide  information on the UN request for an air corridor. The  socialist deputies claim that Noev attempted to present in the  National Assembly his political assessment of the situation,  which is in sharp contradiction to the Constitution. The BSP  leadership regards Noev's resignation as a lesson for all state  servants who intend to undertake actions not in conformance with  their powers or the law.</p>

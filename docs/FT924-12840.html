			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / People: From Granada to Meridian Malcolm Wall, sales director of Granada Television, has been appointed deputy chief executive of Meridian Television, the new ITV company for the south of England. Wall is also the current chairman of the ITV Association's marketing committee. The ITV executive was one of those considered in the running for the chief executive's job at Granada following the departure of Andrew Quinn to run the ITV central network. The job went instead to Charles Allen, a Granada group executive. Wall, who will work with Meridian's chief executive Roger Laughton, says he regards his new job as ' a terrific opportunity to get involved in a new company building a broadcasting business from scratch.' Meridian goes on the air at the beginning of next year. The present deputy sales director of Granada, Michael Desmond, has been promoted to the position of sales director and will join the board of Granada Television. Granada says that Desmond's appointment confirms the role he has assumed for the past 18 months of managing the sales operation. This enabled Wall to involve himself in general television industry issues, the company adds.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Upton &amp; Southern losses doubled Upton &amp; Southern Holdings, the Cleveland-based department store and property group, saw its loss double to Pounds 2.86m in the year to January 25, although turnover rose to Pounds 13.6m. The retailing business showed a satisfactory increase in sales from department stores, but margins were depressed and overall profitability showed a small decline. To reduce bank borrowings the group sold property developments at Newbury and Richmond and its investment unit in Congleton. The loss on disposals and trading deficit led to the group having a negative net worth of some Pounds 500,000, as indicated last November. Losses per share came to 31.69p. Previously they were 15.76p, when the pre-tax deficit was Pounds 1.43m from turnover of Pounds 11.7m. The auditors have qualified the accounts in respect of work-in-progress of Pounds 979,000 (Pounds 3.83m). They are unable to determine whether the provisions made are sufficient to reduce the book value of work to net realisable value.</p>

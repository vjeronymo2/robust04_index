			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: SAM'S CAFE ANCHORS THOSE ADRIFT ON FISH SEARCH  </P> <P> "Man does not live by meat alone." Not even a butcher. Certainly not one who  spends much -- if not most -- of his time in Tiburon, Calif., not 50 yards from  the San Francisco Bay and a lot of great fish.  </P> <P> Sam's Anchor Cafe is a marvelous place in my little town of Tiburon. It's been  there as long as any living being I know, and it hasn't changed much. From the  looks of it as you come in off Main Street, it's an old bar, but out back on  the bay side there are a couple of dining rooms and a huge outdoor deck with a  magnificent view of San Francisco.  </P> <P> A couple of young guys, Brian Wilson and Steve Spears, bought Sam's a few years  back. They didn't remodel the place, and they didn't paint everything mauve,  gray and green or anything like that. They did clean the place up some; having  been there as long as it had, there were a few cobwebs in the corners. But  basically, Sam's today is as Sam's has always been, with one notable exception  -- the food.  </P> <P> Hamburgers have long been the specialty of the house at Sam's, and they still  make one of the best in the country, but in the past few years the menu has  gone far beyond burgers.  </P> <P> When they took over, Wilson and Spears hired a 22-year-old cook named Matthew  Raftery. Raftery had paid his dues. He'd been cooking professionally since he  was 16, and he had learned to love the creativity the kitchen offers. He has  made a marvelous difference at Sam's. He's even made a fish-eater out of me.  </P> <P> When Raftery first started at Sam's, I used to give him a hard time because he  seldom had a serious meat dish on the specials board. A man can get a little  tired of hamburgers, even great ones. One day, Raftery said, in response to my  complaint about the lack of meat: "Merle, man does not live by meat alone. Try  one of my fish specials. They're good. You'll like them."  </P> <P> I did. Raftery was right. I've been eating lots of fish at Sam's lately. Try  it, you'll like it.  </P> <P>  Some simple preparation gives this dish an elegant taste and presentation. The  rich taste of the melted Brie along with the subtle sweetness of the roasted  peppers make the salmon melt in your mouth. Serve with pecan-flavored wild rice  and fresh steamed asparagus.  </P> <P> BAKED SALMON WITH BRIE AND ROASTED RED PEPPERS  </P> <P> 2 or 3 medium sweet red peppers  </P> <P> 1 cup bread crumbs  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon flour  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets  </P> <P> Olive oil  </P> <P> 2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons lemon juice  </P> <P> 1/4 cup dry white wine  </P> <P> 10 to 12 ounces Brie cheese  </P> <P> Place peppers on baking sheet. Broil 10 to 15 minutes, rotating until skin  blisters and turns black on all sides. Remove peppers and place in plastic bag,  close and let steam until cool enough to handle. Discard skin and seeds. Cut  flesh into strips and reserve.  </P> <P> Combine bread crumbs, flour, oregano, basil and dash of salt and pepper. Dredge  fish in bread crumb mixture until completely coated.  </P> <P> Heat about 1 ounce oil per fillet in saute pan to smoking point. Carefully  place fish in pan and add garlic. Cook until golden brown (about 1 minute per  side).  </P> <P> Remove fish from pan and place on lightly greased baking sheet. Deglaze pan  with lemon juice and wine. Keep sauce warm.  </P> <P> Arrange alternate strips of roasted peppers and cheese across top of each  fillet. Bake at 450 degrees 5 to 7 minutes (depending on thickness). Serve with  sauce. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P>  This is an easy back-yard barbecue recipe that reflects the philosophy at  Sam's: Make it taste great, make it fast and simple, make it again. The dense  flesh of the tuna makes it perfect for the barbecue, but it will work just as  well under the broiler. Remember, it will cook fast.  </P> <P> BROILED AHI 'MARGARITA'  </P> <P> (Tequila Lime Marinade and Avocado Salsa)  </P> <P> 2 avocados, chopped  </P> <P> 1 tomato, chopped  </P> <P> 1 onion, minced  </P> <P> 1 sweet yellow pepper, chopped  </P> <P> 1/2 jalapeno chile, minced  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups chopped cilantro  </P> <P> 1/4 cup lemon-lime carbonated beverage  </P> <P> 2 cups lime juice  </P> <P> 1/2 cup lemon juice  </P> <P> 1/4 cup triple sec  </P> <P> 1 cup flat beer  </P> <P> 1/2 cup tequila  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin  </P> <P> 4 to 6 (8-ounce) tuna (Ahi) fillets  </P> <P> Combine avocados, tomato, onion, yellow pepper, chile, 1/2 cup cilantro and  lemon-lime carbonated beverage. Set aside.  </P> <P> Combine lime juice, lemon juice, triple sec, beer, tequila, coriander, cumin  and remaining 3/4 cup cilantro. Add fish and marinate 30 minutes.  </P> <P> Grill or broil fish. Acid from citrus begins to cook fish, so be careful not to  overcook.  </P> <P> Serve with reserved salsa, either on top of fish or on side. Makes 4 to 6  servings.  </P> <P> POACHED SWORDFISH SALAD WITH HONEY-MUSTARD VINAIGRETTE  </P> <P> 2 to 3 bay leaves  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon peppercorns  </P> <P> 3 cups lemon juice  </P> <P> 1 gallon water  </P> <P> 2 pounds swordfish  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> 1 cup olive oil  </P> <P> 1/4 cup honey  </P> <P> 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard  </P> <P> Mixed salad greens  </P> <P> Combine bay leaves, peppercorns, lemon juice and water in large saucepot. Bring  to boil.  </P> <P> Cut fish into 3- to 4-inch pieces. Carefully place fish in boiling water and  poach to delicate flake (about 5 to 7 minutes). Remove from water with slotted  spoon or pour into colander and chill.  </P> <P> Beat egg in mixing bowl until frothy. While beating, gradually drip in olive  oil to create thick emulsion. Add honey, vinegar and mustard. Arrange fish on  greens and pour dressing over. Makes 6 to 8 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of  Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and  recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. Commercial egg substitutes may be  used in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances. Check egg substitute  package for applications.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> FORBES DAZZLES A WHO'S WHO OF AMERICANS  </P> <P> There they were -- Liz and Malcolm -- together under the stars on a moonlit  night, listening to Bolero as fireworks exploded high over Arabian tents and  out into the glistening Mediterranean.  </P> <P> The rhythmic music and the dazzling fireworks climaxed together, each reaching  a crescendo and abruptly ending in unison to the cheers of another 1,000 people  whom publisher Malcolm Forbes had invited along with his date, Elizabeth  Taylor, to celebrate his 70th birthday.  </P> <P> Liz and Malcolm were what the guests had come to see -- together with his  gleaming-white Moroccan palace (Palais Mendoub) and, actually, each other.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Politicians  </P> <P> Celebrity guests included opera star Beverly Sills (she sang "Happy Birthday"),  Henry Kissinger, Walter Cronkite and Barbara Walters.  </P> <P> There were hardly any politicians, but California's Gov. George Deukmejian was  one, apparently because Forbes likes his fiscal conservatism. Republican Gov.  Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey -- Forbes' home state -- also was there.  </P> <P> More than anything, however, the guest list read like a who's who of corporate  America -- Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, General Motors Chairman Roger B.  Smith and hundreds of other business and financial executives -- and clearly  represented an effort to attract advertising to Forbes magazine.  </P> <P> "They are all friends," Forbes said of his guests, "and some of them have  proven it by the amount of business they have put into Forbes magazine."  </P> <P> And to his guests as he and Liz were about to cut the huge four-layer birthday  cake around midnight Saturday, Forbes acknowledged: "If it hadn't been my  birthday we would have thought of a different reason (to party). The birthday  was incidental."  </P> <P> In an earlier generation, another publisher -- William Randolph Hearst -- used  to invite celebrities from Hollywood up to his "ranch" at San Simeon. They  would arrive by the scores in automobiles or in trains and spend the weekend  with Hearst and his celebrity girlfriend, Marion Davies, at La Casa Grande.  </P> <P> In the jet age, the publishing world's biggest party-giver is Forbes. And for  this soiree he flew most of the guests at his expense in three chartered jets  -- including a Concorde -- across the Atlantic to party with him and Liz. He  put everybody up at two seaside hotels.  </P> <P> The cost of the chartered planes alone was around $1 million, according to one  Forbes official: $500,000 for the Concorde, $300,000 for a 747 and $200,000 for  a DC-8.  </P> <P> But Forbes told reporters he doubted the party's tab would reach the $2-million  figure that has been estimated because things are cheaper in Morocco and also  because Morocco's King Hassan II -- who threw a lavish farewell lunch and  picnic for the entire group on Sunday at the Tangier Country Club -- supplied  all of the music and entertainment.  </P> <P> Much of the cost will be written off as a business expense and become a Forbes  tax deduction -- meaning that American taxpayers will wind up subsidizing a lot  of the fun for these rich party-goers. "I wish it was entirely," Forbes replied  when asked whether he considered the party a business expense. "Some of it is."  </P> <P> Whatever, Forbes said he did not feel the slightest bit guilty about spending  all that money on one extravagant party.  </P> <P> "Somebody asked me, 'How do you defend it?' " Forbes said. "It's difficult. You  can point out that we give several million dollars a year to philanthropies and  worthy causes. But that doesn't explain why we didn't use all this money for  the same thing. . . .  </P> <P> "There's nobody here," he told the reporters, "who doesn't, maybe, on their  wife's birthday take her to the theater or dinner or something and do you say  to yourself, 'Gee, instead of that, I should have given it to the local chapter  of the Red Cross.' We all do things in our lives that probably aren't  essential. It's just that this scale is more visible. . . .  </P> <P> "I don't feel guilty about it. I feel grateful that we can do it."  </P> <P> Forbes -- who has named his private jet Capitalist Tool and painted its tail  what he calls "money green" -- inherited a fortune from his self-made father,  B.C. Forbes, who founded the magazine. But Malcolm has multiplied that fortune  many times over and now is worth "somewhere between half a billion and a  billion," said Forbes communication director William Donald Garson. "Honestly,  he doesn't know what he is worth."  </P> <P> A flamboyant motorcyclist and hot air balloon enthusiast -- "It's very hard to  be anonymous when you're flying a Sphinx balloon over Cairo," he noted Saturday  -- Forbes entered Elizabeth Taylor's life two years ago when he handed her a  $1-million check to fight AIDS.  </P> <P> Asked what Liz gave him for his birthday, the divorced Forbes said, "I am not  telling, as a matter of fact." But then he paused for a second and added: "One  of the things she gave me was Elizabeth Taylor's passion for me."  </P> <P> He described their relationship as "happy," but said the actress should not be  considered his "fiancee. We have finessed around that. . . . You don't have to  marry somebody before you have fun together. . . . She's got wit and wisdom and  love."  </P> <P> Forbes said he threw the party because "I just wasn't that confident I would be  here or, if here, capable of enjoying my 100th. So I decided to have it on the  70th."  </P> <P> "I know they'll top it on his 75th," said Kissinger, who has been to a few gala  affairs himself, "but for now, it has to be the most unusual party I have  seen."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Once-in-a-Lifetime'  </P> <P> Said Deukmejian, who is not much of a party-goer but echoed the sentiments of  most guests: "There's no question it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience."  </P> <P> You know you've been to something special when they have designer outdoor  toilets that flush. The toilets -- five of them designed locally by a food  caterer -- had His and Her enclosed stalls under a small Arabian tent with  black and white tile floors and a sink. (But they had one common problem of  most outdoor heads: no towels, so people used soggy toilet paper to wipe their  hands.)  </P> <P> This is a little of what it was like to attend Malcolm Forbes' three-day  "Ali-Dada Birthday Bash." (A play on the name Ali-Baba):  </P> <P> For ordinary guests -- the Kissingers, the Betsy Bloomingdales, the Cronkites,  the Deukmejians and folks even more ordinary than that -- it was an early  wake-up Friday for arrival at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport by 7 a.m.  </P> <P> There also was another, much smaller category of guests who used their own jets  -- people like Chrysler's Iacocca and Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner.  These people had more flexibility.  </P> <P> For an example, financier Henry Kravis and his wife, fashion designer Carolyne  Roehm, planned to have their private jet meet them Sunday in Tangier so they  could take another couple to dinner in Venice en route to the Salzburg Music  Festival, the next stop on their summer fun calendar of social globe trotters.  </P> <P> There were other twists, too, in individual travel arrangements. Publisher  Rupert Murdoch, for instance, chartered a yacht and brought it to Tangier so he  could host a Saturday luncheon for roughly 100 select guests, including  Deukmejian and his wife, Gloria.  </P> <P> But for about 600 people, the weekend began shortly after dawn Friday with a  crush of limousines and taxicabs -- family sedans were scarce -- outside a  private hangar at JFK.  </P> <P> Amid the confusion of hundreds of people trying to check in and dump off their  bags, the partying began with the chanting of Moroccan musicians shaking  tambourines and other instruments. Then came a belly-dancer in a tight-fitting,  low-cut dress.  </P> <P> Deukmejian, sitting at a table under a tent right in front of the dancer, shook  his head to the rhythm, stretched out his arms and snapped his fingers. "I do  this every morning at 8:30," he told a reporter, smiling. In a few minutes, the  governor -- grinning ear to ear -- stood briefly near the woman and began  dancing himself, twisting and turning and clicking the fingers.  </P> <P> After an elaborate continental breakfast prepared by caterer Basil Rathbone --  granddaughter of the late film star Basil Rathbone -- Deukmejian and 99 other  passengers boarded the Concorde. The sleek, narrow craft flew at twice the  speed of sound, cruising at around 50,000 feet, and arrived at Tangier on the  northwestern tip of Africa, just opposite Gibraltar, in three hours, 20 minutes  -- about half the normal time.  </P> <P> Hundreds of Moroccan musicians greeted guests aboard all three chartered jets  at the airport. And thousands of curious citizens lined the streets into town  to catch a glimpse of the rich Americans. More musicians entertained at the  hotel -- and virtually every place the guests traveled throughout the weekend.  </P> <P> Deukmejian and his wife spent part of Saturday shopping in the famed Kasbahs,  but didn't buy anything. "We were trying to keep up with our guide. We didn't  want to get lost in that maze," said Gloria Deukmejian.  </P> <P> The weather was hot and humid. The hotel rooms had no air-conditioning and  everybody was sweating -- except, strangely, at the birthday party where guests  wearing the required tuxedoes and formals were spared by a cool, gentle breeze  that blew off the Mediterranean.  </P> <P> "The party works better in Morocco -- there's a romance and mystique about  being far from home," noted advice columnist Abigail Van Buren. "It's  glamorous, it's spectacular."  </P> <P> Hundreds of white-robed musicians and green-capped Royal Calvary guards wearing  turbans met guests outside the palace. Then the guests drew their dinner  seating assignments from a brass bowl. Deukmejian sat in the "Money Green"  tent, one of seven Arabian tents erected on the terrace gardens overlooking the  sea.  </P> <P> Forbes, wearing green Scottish kilts, stood in the reception line with his four  sons and one daughter for more than two hours greeting the steady stream of  guests. Many people, after having gone through the line themselves, just stood  around and ogled the other guests.  </P> <P> This was especially true when Elizabeth Taylor stood beside Forbes, which was  most of the time. She wore a floor-length emerald green caftan with gold  metallic braiding and long diamond and ruby earrings. Her hairdo could be best  described as free-form and she again seemed to be losing her battle against  pounds.  </P> <P> The dinner -- pastilla (pigeon pie), barbecued lamb, chicken and fruits --  lasted until nearly midnight. And guests didn't begin leaving until after 1  a.m.  </P> <P> "Look at it now," a man said to nobody in particular as one of the chartered  buses pulled away from the palace. "You'll never see it again."  </P></p>

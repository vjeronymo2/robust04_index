Work in the new residence has already  begun. This was announced yesterday by Vladimir Kvasov, chief  of the Russian Federation Government apparatus.    The first to move in, Vladimir Kvasov explained, was the  prime minister and all of his deputies. Government services  have also been located at the new address. But only part of the  apparatus has been accommodated. Ruslan Khasbulatov's office  has been occupied by Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Aleksandr  Rutskoy's has been taken over by a general department. On the  third level of the 20-story building a complex has been set up  for the Russian president and his services. This is necessary so  that the president could work in closer contact with the  government.    Generally, there are plans to trim the government apparatus  by 20 percent, Vladimir Kvasov said. Some ministries and  subdivisions will be fully abolished. Today it can be said with  certainty that subject to axing will be those departments that  have outlived themselves in the present economic conditions.  [passage omitted]    A department chief in the Russian Government, who declined  to  give his name, told POSTFACTUM that Gennadiy Burbulis,  commenting on this event, categorically stated: "Just as they  have moved in, so will they move out!" A former adviser to the  Russian president, according to the official, said that in  protest against the fact that the White House has not been  turned over to the Duma the deputies will hold their first  session out of doors.    The department chief also noted that as a result of the  government's relocation the work of its apparatus will be  paralyzed for at least half a month because there are not enough  phones in the White House; there are also difficulties with  government communication channels. All elevators operate well  up to the sixth level, beyond which only some do. [passage  omitted]</p>

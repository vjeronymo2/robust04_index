			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Support" rubric: </F> "Government Promises to Ease Taxes for Small Businesses. Local  Authorities Not Averse to `Redistributing' Them in Their Own  Favor"]    [Text] Addressing a seminar on the problems of low-level  enterprise that opened yesterday, Leonid Bochin, chairman of the  Russian Federation State Committee on Antimonopoly Policy,  declared that "since entrepreneurs are not to expect large-scale  direct credits from the budget," the main state support for  small businesses will consist in "considerable tax breaks and  freeing from spending on social infrastructure." Minister of  the Economy Aleksandr Shokhin confirmed that "lifting the burden  of outlays for housing, health services, etc.," would be one of  the main areas of "post-privatization state support for  businesses."    The economy minister stated that a "Council for Economic  Reform" will soon be set up, consisting of representatives of  executive power and Federation Council deputies. The Council  "in the context of the Treaty on Social Accord" will create a  "working conciliation mechanism," and, in particular, will  develop a new concept of tax policy. Aleksandr Shokhin hopes  that the Council's experts will manage to draft proposals before  the State Duma looks at a Tax Code.    The economy minister promised that two weeks from now, a  draft law "On State Support for Small Non-State Enterprises"  will be put before the government. The government proposes to  prepare in the second quarter draft amendments to the law "On  Enterprise and Entrepreneurial Activities." They will deal with  state guarantees for the rights of entrepreneurs and provide for  simplified registration procedures for entrepreneurs who are not  legal entities.    Aleksandr Shokhin underscored that the rise of small  businesses depends to a considerable degree on the good will of  the regional authorities. Today the seminar's "roundtable" will  be discussing possible interaction between federal and regional  bodies to develop small businesses. Already yesterday there  emerged one of the topics of the discussion -- the leaders of  territories are asking the center "to redistribute the bulk of  business taxes in favor of local authorities."</p>

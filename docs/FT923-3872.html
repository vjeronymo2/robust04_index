			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Talks fail to resolve EC banana quotas row TALKS between the European Community and a group of Latin American banana producers over proposed EC import barriers to bananas ended in failure yesterday. The talks were a first step under the disputes settlement mechanism of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), and could go to an arbitration panel. The seven exporters - Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador - claim existing national trade barriers are discriminatory and that the EC plan, which extends import quotas and customs duties to all 12 member states, could halve their exports to the Community of 2.5m tons a year. The bulk of this goes to Germany, the EC's biggest banana consumer, where bananas enter duty-free. Mr Roberto Rojas, trade minister of Costa Rica, said afterwards the group would raise the issue at the next meeting of Gatt's governing council on September 29. It would also be asking Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general, to call an urgent meeting of the surveillance body of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks to rule whether the EC proposals violated a commitment not to introduce new protectionist measures. Gatt procedures do not allow panels to be established until the rules being challenged have been adopted. Thus a request for a panel on the new proposals would have to await their endorsement by the council of ministers. The plan drawn up by the European Commission would impose a basic banana import quota of 2m tons next year, with a 20 per cent tariff on bananas from the so-called 'dollar region'. Higher-cost bananas from Africa and the Caribbean would enter duty-free under the EC's Lome Convention. Mr Rojas said the scheme could cost the seven countries about Dollars 500m a year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lusaka continues to be the target of our attention  and our hopes. The peace talks resumed there earlier this week,  but they continue to be unproductive. The negotiators have  reached yet another weekend and must now wait for next week.  Our correspondent Joao Ligio had this to report by telephone:    [Begin Ligio recording] UN Special Representative Alioune  Blondin Beye has not yet decided to give up, even after  yesterday's failure to bring the two sides closer together.  This suggests that Beye may be trying to devise a new plan to  bring the two sides together. So far, the work has continued to  concentrated on unfinished documents, both from the two warring  sides and from the mediators. As far as we have been able to  observe, there is still much to do: the national police must  still be given the status of a civilian institution. The crux  of the matter is whether it will be a military or paramilitary  institution. This is one of the many differences preventing  harmony reigning at the proceedings.    This is the first hurdle that the UN special representative  must overcome. The mediators have already identified the  problem and hope to act accordingly when talks resume on 10  January. It is hoped that, after four days in Lusaka, the  negotiators will again meet face to face on that day. It is not  an exaggeration to say that slowness appears to be the motto of  the talks. Between good morning and good afternoon greetings,  we do our best to obtain fresh information. The result is  always the same: nothing. But that is not what happens with  some foreign media here. The announced meeting between the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] team  and U.S. congressmen has not taken place yet, but UNITA sources  have repeatedly said that it may occur before the next  face-to-face meeting between the warring sides.

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Nokia sells energy operation Nokia, Europe's biggest manufacturer of mobile telephones, yesterday took a further step towards concentrating its business on telecommunications with the sale of its energy-supply subsidiary to Pohjolan Voima, a Finnish power group, for FM1.4bn (Dollars 298.5m). Nokia said the sale of Nokia Power, which last year contributed FM550m to group sales of FM23.7bn, through sales of electricity, thermal energy and natural gas, would produce a capital gain of about FM700m. The deal with Pohjolan, which supplies about 18 per cent of Finland's electricity consumption, includes the transfer of Nokia's shareholdings in four other Finnish power companies. 'Divesting our energy operations is a logical step in Nokia's strategic development,' Mr Jorma Ollila, Nokia's chief executive, said. The Finnish group is riding a wave of fast growth in its telecommunications operations. Last month, it announced a five-fold increase in group profits in the first eight months of the year, to a pre-tax surplus of FM2.29bn on sales of FM18.2bn. Much of the growth stemmed from its leading position in mobile telephones, where it is second in the world to Motorola of the US in the production of mobile handsets. Since taking over at Nokia two years ago, Mr Ollila has set about completing the company's transformation from a sprawling industrial conglomerate to a group focused on telecommunications and electronics. More than 60 per cent of group sales is accounted for by its telecommunications divisions. The next restructuring move is likely to be the flotation on the Helsinki stock market of most of Nokia's 80 per cent holding in Nokia Tyres, a move signalled by Mr Ollila last month. Nokia Tyres last year posted sales of FM862m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Congress of Peoples of Ingushetia, a republic in  Russia's North Caucasus, on Sunday qualified the performance of  the republic's government as unsatisfactory. The government,  dismissed by decree of President Ruslan Aushev as of March 6,  will remain in office until parliament takes a final decision.    The Congress passed a resolution which says recent  re-election of Aushev as president of Ingushetia showed that the  people approved of his internal and foreign policy. Aushev  himself, in a message to the congress, described the  presidential and parliamentary elections and referendum on the  republic's constitution, all held on February 27, as an historic  step towards Ingushetia's revival as a state.</p>

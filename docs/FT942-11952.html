			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Fear of inflation continues to dominate the US bond market. At the end of last week the price of the benchmark 30-year bond sank by more than two basis points, lifting the yield to 7.3 per cent, after key indicators in the GDP figures pointed towards growing inflationary pressures. The market is convinced that the Federal Reserve will push the Fed funds rate up by another  1/4 percentage point when it meets on May 17, if not before. Yesterday, the National Association of Purchasing Managers' monthly index of business activity came in at 57.7 per cent, much as expected, yet bond prices lost another half point or so in early trading. The rest of the week will provide more data to feed the market's fear. Tomorrow's index of leading indicators could show an increase of 0.6 per cent for March after slipping 0.1 per cent in February. On Wednesday, figures for factory orders are likely to show an increase of 0.5 per cent for March. The productivity figures, due out on Thursday, may indicate that output per hour grew by barely 1 per cent in the first quarter. But the climax of the week will come with the publication of the employment figures on Friday: anything much bigger than a 170,000 increase could send yields rising again.</p>

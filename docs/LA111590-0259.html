			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 6 TEXAS A&amp;M GRIDDERS CHARGED  </P> <P> Six Texas A&amp;M football players, including a starting cornerback, and one  former player have been charged in connection with the alleged illegal use of  telephone charge cards.  </P> <P> Wednesday's arrests came as a result of a monthlong investigation by Bryan  police and CallAmerica, a long-distance carrier in the Bryan-College Station  area.  </P> <P> A&amp;M Head Coach R. C. Slocum said all six players will make the team trip  this weekend to Fayetteville, Ark., for a game against Arkansas. Disciplinary  action will be taken later only if the athletes are found guilty, Slocum said.  </P> <P> CallAmerica announced last month that thousands of dollars worth of  long-distance phone calls had been made using illegal credit card numbers and  that several A&amp;M football players were among the A&amp;M students under  investigation. Arrest warrants were issued Tuesday, and the six players turned  themselves in Wednesday, Slocum said. They were released on bond later.  </P></p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Major broadens attack on taxes THE TORIES must ram home the message that Labour's manifesto programme would cost the average taxpayer an extra Pounds 1,250 a year, Mr John Major told a London rally of candidates yesterday. Mr Major ridiculed the small amounts for most gainers under Labour's proposals, calling the tax increases to pay for them 'a systematic smash-and-grab raid on the independent, the hard-working, the middle-income families of Britain'. He condemned Labour's Budget as 'economic illiteracy with a dash of calculated malice - intended to wound, intended to bite'. He added: 'We'll make sure it's doomed to failure.' Challenging Mr Neil Kinnock to set out his own costed programme, Mr Major called on the Labour leader to 'stand by your promises - or withdraw them'. He added: 'Dig deep behind those pledges and come up with the tax, the whole tax and nothing but the tax.' In a vitriolic attack on Labour's campaigning tactics on the National Health Service, he denounced Opposition 'friends' of the NHS as 'parasites who swoop on human error and personal tragedy, and can scarce disguise their relish as they do so'. However, in a television interview Mr Major sounded defensive on the balance between using the product of economic growth for public spending and using it for tax cuts. Questioned by Mr Brian Walden on London Weekend Television, Mr Major argued that lower taxes helped public services by 'incentivising' the doctors, nurses and teachers who worked in them. Spending on public services was due to rise by more than Pounds 5bn next year, Mr Major said, while the Budget tax cut would cost only Pounds 1.8bn and was directed at people on modest incomes, many of them in the caring services. Mr Major also rejected the suggestion that the government was uncaring towards the unemployed. 'If you really care about the people across this country . . . you've got to take the decisions now to get rid of that cancer of inflation and have the right economic circumstances for growth in the future,' he insisted. Labour seized on his defence of the flat-rate principle of the poll tax, which is being replaced by the council tax, as a gaffe. Mr Major said that on the government's original estimates of the charge at Pounds 224, the poll tax would have been fair because of the contribution to local government spending from the 'sharply progressive' income-tax system. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, told a rally in Nottingham yesterday that action to bring down unemployment was essential to bring an end to the recession. He also used his speech to counter the Tory charge that Labour's tax plans would damage prospects for young people starting their careers, by focusing on the consequences of the recession for the young.</p>

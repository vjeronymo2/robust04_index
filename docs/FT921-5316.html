			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: Alusuisse to cut its dividend ALUSUISSE, the Swiss aluminium, speciality chemical and packaging group, reports a steep fall in profits for last year and says its plans to cut its dividend. Net profits tumbled 63 per cent to SFr101m (Dollars 67.7m). According to Alusuisse the main problem has been the collapse of aluminium prices. The directors expect some improvement in results this year as the group continues to diversify away from its commodity-based activities. But they have nevertheless recommended cutting the dividend from 14 per cent to 10 per cent. Sales were flat at SFr6.3bn, with aluminium sales amounting to just over half the total, chemicals 30 per cent and packaging 17 per cent. The group revealed a breakdown of its operating profits for the first time, with aluminium contributing SFr106m, chemicals SFr131m and packaging SFr83m. Mr Theodor Tschopp, chief executive, said the group had curtailed its aluminium capacity by 20 per cent in response to the slump in metal prices and might have to cut it further if prices did not recover soon. The directors also proposed a capital restructuring, consisting of converting the SFr250 bearer shares into one SFr125 bearer share and one SFr125 registered share. Participation certificates are also to be converted at the rate of 10 PCs for one SFr250 bearer share. As part of the changes, the limit on ownership of registered shares in Alusuisse is to rise from 3 per cent to 5 per cent. The company plans a issue of bonus options to raise SFr17.5m.</p>

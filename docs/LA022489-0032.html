			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> CASE OF AN IMPOSTOR DOCTOR PROVIDES RX FOR SUSPENSE  </P> <P> A Paper Mask by John Collee (Arbor House: $16.95; 232 pages)  </P> <P> Drive with particular care next time you're in Gloucestershire, because the  emergency room at Bristol Hospital could be even riskier than the M-5  roundabouts at rush hour. Just plausible enough to keep skepticism at bay;  succinct and compelling, "A Paper Mask" is the first-person account of a glib  young orderly who manages to impersonate a doctor long enough to do  considerable damage.  </P> <P> Matthew Harris is a middle-class drifter looking for a short-cut to success. As  he says early in the narrative, "I had grown up with the burden of a promising  childhood," but long before the novel begins, he'd dropped that burden to work  at a succession of odd jobs; watching his contemporaries outstrip him,  realizing that he could never catch up without going back to square one and  starting over. Unwilling to take that arduous step at the age of 27, Harris  settles for an orderly's pittance and amuses himself by trying to outguess the  doctors. He's contemptuous of most of them, but one young resident earns his  reluctant admiration. Simon Hennessey is less arrogant than his colleagues;  confident, relaxed, witty and casually friendly to Harris, who fantasizes that  he could be in Hennessey's position if "things had gone differently."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Excellent Credentials  </P> <P> One foggy autumn day, Hennessey is killed in a motorcycle accident and Harris  is given the sad job of collecting the young doctor's few possessions. There's  not much -- clothes, textbooks, stethoscope, school and family photos,  diplomas, his medical license and a couple of envelopes that Harris  unhesitatingly opens. One is an invitation to Dr. Hennessey to interview at a  Bristol Hospital; the other is Hennessey's unmailed reply canceling the  appointment because he has decided to take a short sabbatical from medicine to  act in a play. A copy of Hennessey's impressive resume is conveniently included  among these personal effects.  </P> <P> In that instant, Matthew Harris decides to "become" Simon Hennessey. He writes  to say he will come for the interview early in January, correctly assuming that  the officials of the Bristol hospital will not have been reading the London  obits. By the time he appears before the committee, he has memorized  Hennessey's C.V. Though his answers to their cursory medical questions are  hesitant, the excellent credentials assuage their doubts and the examiners hire  him as attending emergency room physician without checking references any  further. They haven't exactly been inundated with applicants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Closely Watched  </P> <P> Telling his one friend at the London hospital that he's taken a job on a yacht  bound for the Caribbean, Harris spends his last month in London absorbing all  the medical information he can, diligently studying Hennessey's textbooks. For  the first time in his disordered life, he has a goal. He gives away his only  valuable possession, a gold cigarette case with his real name engraved inside,  discarding everything else that might identify him as Harris, keeping only his  passport, birth certificate and driver's license. As soon as he arrives at his  assigned quarters in Bristol, he tapes these incriminating documents to the  wall behind an armoire, hidden even from himself, and takes up his new life.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the Bristol emergency room is staffed with conscientious and  competent personnel. Harris quickly ingratiates himself with the most capable  of the nurses, who is delighted to be so appreciated. One way and another,  absolute disaster is temporarily averted, though there are some terrifyingly  close calls. Aloof and evasive, Harris reveals little about himself even after  he and the nurse become lovers.  </P> <P> But even with the best of luck, an emergency room will eventually live up to  its definition, and one day the impostor makes the inevitable fatal error.  There is an inquest and though Harris is technically absolved, he's watched  closely from that point on. The romance with the nurse cools, and he can no  longer depend upon her to cover his mistakes.  </P> <P> Simultaneously, Harris discovers that he has not eradicated his past quite as  thoroughly as he had thought. Desperation leads to attempted murder, and when  that fails, to murder itself. Superbly paced, the story mounts to a riveting  climax guaranteed to make all but the most reckless readers vow to insist upon  a second opinion, no matter what.  </P></p>

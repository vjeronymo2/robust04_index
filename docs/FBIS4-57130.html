			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, President Cesar Gaviria gave a number of  instructions to the country's mayors, governors, policemen,  police detectives, and the administrative institutions that deal  with public order.    In a directive defining the guidelines for national  strategies against violence, the Security Advisory Board listed  nine [as published] fronts of action to fight common delinquency  and organized crime.  <H5>  Anti-Violence </H5>   The National Police, the Defense Ministry, and security  organizations, under the coordination of the Prosecutor  General's Office, must create and support the Specialized  Homicide Brigades to be deployed in the most critical regions to  promote gun control.    The Armed Forces will toughen their fight against subversion  by training their staff and broadening their operational  capacity by means of carrying out other actions to attack the  financial sources of the subversion and the groups that embrace  private justice and common delinquency.    In short, according to the directive, the DAS  [Administrative  Department of Security] will coordinate with the Prosecutor  General's Office, the Finance Ministry, the Bank of the  Republic, and the National Superintendency of Banks on the  development of specific plans to curtail money laundering,  irregular money inflows, and illegal enrichment.    In due time, the government will promote campaigns asking  citizens to help eradicate kidnappings. Meanwhile, the Defense  Ministry will adjust budget guidelines to improve the  performance of the Unase [Antiextortion and Kidnapping Unit].  <H5>  Justice </H5>   The directive goes on. Mayors and governors must give  priority to developing local security plans, which must be  submitted to the National Security Council before 30 June.  These officials must also prepare the Justice Development Plan,  update the infringement system [regimen de contravenciones],  promote the mechanisms for out-of-court conflict settlements,  and cooperate in the consolidation of the Prosecutor General's  Office and the legal system.    Meanwhile, the National Penitentiary and Prison Institute  must expedite the construction of six new prison centers and  bolster the maximum security wings.  <H5>  Police Force </H5>   The Defense Ministry must increase the presence of policemen  nationwide. The goal is to increase the number of professional  soldiers by 10,000 in two years and to create two new mobile  brigades.    Likewise, within a month, the National Police must champion  the Career Statutes and conduct evaluations of the agenda of the  Immediate Attention Centers (CAI) to improve their performance.  The National Police commissioner, meanwhile, must restructure  within two months the procedures to respond to the complaints of  citizens.  <H5>  Intelligence </H5>   According to the new presidential directive, the Defense  Ministry must strengthen the channels of coordination among  security agencies and upgrade communications systems to ensure  that all intelligence organizations are linked within three  years.    Policemen, the DAS, and the Prosecutor General's Office must  prepare a counterintelligence program to avert subversion and  drug trafficking infiltrations and to prevent internal  corruption within the State's security corps.  <H5>  Peace and Reintegration </H5>   Those guerrilla groups that show a resolute willingness to  rejoin civilian life will benefit from reintegration plans that  include judicial and sociopolitical guarantees, as well as  security guarantees.    Only the president, through the Peace Counseling Board and  the National Rehabilitarion Plan, will hold talks and  negotiations with those groups who accept preestablished  conditions.    President Gaviria reaffirmed the validity of the  reintegration plans for guerrillas to rejoin civilian life and  said that mayors and governors will actively participate in the  implementation of these plans to guarantee that the commitments  included in the political agreements of each department will be  honored.  <H5>  Options for Youths </H5>   The Education Ministry, with the help of the private sector,  will persist in promoting efforts to achieve the expansion of  high school education through the creation of 600,000 new high  school openings by 1995.    The Labor Ministry, with the help of governors, mayors, and  the Presidency, will promote the development of local, national,  and regional programs to offer counseling, orientation, and  training to potential entrepreneurs and job-seeking youths.  <H5>  Human Rights </H5>   The presidency will continue to promote programs to defend  human rights and democracy by conducting civic education  campaigns to respect rights and their mechanisms of protection.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 15  February.    The Augusto Cesar Sandino Foundation (FACS) has announced  the  establishment of an $18 million revolving fund to promote  development, create employment, and help the extremely poor  become self-sufficient. The announcement was made by FACS  President Edwin Zablah. Zablah added that 75 percent of the  funds will be used to help Nicaraguan rural sectors. The  programs promoted by the FACS are supported by organizations in  Belgium, Canada, Norway, Australian, the UK, Denmark, New  Zealand, the Netherlands, Finland, and the United States.  (Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 4)    The Central American Bank of Economic Integration has made  22  million cordobas available to the Nicaraguan coffee growers to  bolster the coffee industry. (Managua Radio Nicaragua Network in  Spanish 1100 GMT 10 Feb 94)    National Coffee Commission President David Robleto Lang has  told BARRICADA that the nation's coffee growers will fall short  of their goal of producing 1.1 million quintals of coffee in  1994. Lack of funding and the situation in the northern region  of the country will be contributing factors. Agricultural and  Livestock Minister Roberto Rondon primarily blames the drop in  coffee production on heavy rains; however, he does admit that a  lack of funding is also a contributing factor. (Managua  BARRICADA in Spanish 19 Feb 94 pp 1, 10)    The Nicaraguan Government's payroll will be reduced  considerably in 1994. This was announced by Deputy Finance  Minister Mirna Somarriba. The government plans to cut back jobs  in areas such as public services. The cutbacks will affect  approximately 9,000 workers. Several trade unions are opposing  the reductions. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1540 GMT 13 Feb 94)    The Nicaraguan Government has defended the indefinite  closure  of its commercial borders to Costa Rican milk products because  of Costa Rica's delay in granting sale permits for Nicaraguan  rice. The decision was announced by Deputy Foreign Minister  Jose Pallais. The closure of the commercial borders occurred on  27 January. Nicaragua buys approximately $400,000 a month in  Costa Rican milk products. Meanwhile, Costa Rican Foreign Trade  Minister Roberto Rojas said that the granting of permits for the  import of Nicaraguan rice is the responsibility of the Costa  Rican private sector.

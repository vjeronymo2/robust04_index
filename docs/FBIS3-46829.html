He also said the company was  considering production in Argentina, too. At home, Toyota will  renovate old factories and review a list of items to be produced  at these factories, he said.    Concerning production in Mexico, President Toyoda merely  said: "We are studying it." Meanwhile, Toyota Vice President  Masaharu Tanaka met with visiting Mexican presidential aide  Gomez on the morning of 22 December and was briefed on how North  and Central American markets would expand after NAFTA takes  effect. Although President Toyoda said "we have not decided on  details," the company will promote the study of making inroads  into Mexico.    Toyota once set up a local production system in Mexico in  the  sixties. Also, it dispatched a survey team to Mexico last  October, indicating a desire to make inroads into the country.    Nissan Motor Company has a production base in Mexico.  Although Japanese car manufacturers are worried that the ratio  of parts to be procured locally might be raised following the  effectuation of NAFTA, they are expected to make full-scale  inroads into Mexico because of the market's bright future.    Toyota is currently promoting a feasibility study in  Argentina. In 1992, it exported 1,300 vehicles to the country.  To increase the volume of exports to Argentina, it is necessary  to establish a production base there, Toyota believes.    At home, Takaoka and Tsutsumi Factories in Toyoda city are  subject to renovation. The two factories manufacture passenger  cars like Corolla and Corona. Toyota is said to plan to remodel  them into ones for parts production.    Concerning prices of Toyota cars in the U.S. market,  President Toyoda said: "The appreciation of the yen is still  continuing. We have to take this into consideration." His  remark suggests that Toyota will further raise the prices of its  products in the U.S. market in the near future.    Explaining Toyota's long-term sales and production plans,  Toyoda stressed that the company would vigorously promote  overseas production, saying: "I hope we will sell 6 million  vehicles (in the world market) before we enter the 21st century."</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Travel: A dive that comes alive - Juliet Sychrava explores coral caves in the Red Sea the kind who struggle out of the churning waters of the North Sea laden with knives and computers shouting: 'I told you you need a 25mm Neoprene.' These are worrying people to find sitting next to you as you prepare to fall backwards off a boat. But after a week of the Red Sea's brilliant waters, even Carol had forgotten to argue with the other eight of us about the finer points of the American demand valve. As I set off for Hurghada, on the Egyptian coast of the Red Sea, I already suspected I was not a British diver. I prefer to know which way up I am, and found diving in the soupy waters off Devon last October uninspiring. 'Did you see that scallop?' someone asked as we stood shivering on the beach. 'Oh, was there a scallop?' 'Yes, it was near the beginning . . .' The Red Sea, by comparison, held out the promise of as much mixed seafood as anyone could digest. On the first day of our week's trip, our heads swivelled as a cry went up from one of the white-turbaned crew at the end of the boat. Said, the captain, was dangling what looked like a barracuda at the end of a line. 'Lunch,' he said, pointing at it with an enormous grin. Lunch aside, we were careful not to touch anything while diving, not least because the Red Sea is home to such prickly characters as stone and scorpion fish, as well as large Moray eels which rise up like cobra from the rocks. 'One girl last week stroke him and he take a bite out of her neck,' Paolo, our Italian diving instructor, warned us. He liked her gold necklace, he explained. But the eels, like most things in the Red Sea, will not bother you unless you bother them. As a result, feeding the fish is considerably more interesting than dropping pellets into a goldfish bowl. A hard-boiled egg is easiest to handle underwater, and brings thousands of multi-coloured fish crowding around your mask. People who have not dived often imagine it to be dark underwater, but the Red Sea is alive with light. Through caves in the white fan coral, which waves like a miniature forest on the sea floor, hundreds of transparent glass fish hang suspended in the water. As you look up, they mix with the streams of your own air bubbles rising through the blue water to the surface, clearly visible high above us. Then, suddenly, we saw the shark. As we pointed and hovered, it moved silently out of our vision. 'It was a reef shark,' Carol said. 'No, it had a white band on its tail fin, it was a grey shark,' someone else said. Paolo, the expert, landed on the boat, shivering as always. 'Yes, shark,' he said, 'shark.' Identifying the turtles, tuna, and smaller fish we'd seen - dolphins sometimes accompany divers - was only part of the fun. The physical pleasure of diving is also part of it, as is the varied company. Our group included two osteopaths, a trade unionist, an army officer and a research chemist. Hurghada, a strip of road between the desert and the sea, is not the place to go for sophisticated nightlife, though it is cheap. Regal Diving in Cambridge (tel: 0353-778096) is offering an eight-day trip (Thursday to Thursday) to Hurghada for Pounds 439 this summer. The price includes half-board, flight, and 12 boat dives. If you have never scuba dived before, you can go for the same time and price and do the basic beginner's 'open water' course, run by PADI, the US diving organisation. Diving equipment can be hired at Hurghada. Numerous travel companies offer Red Sea packages, including Twicker's World, tel: 081-892-7851.</p>

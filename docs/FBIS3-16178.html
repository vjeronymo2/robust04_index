			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Liga Laizane: "Government Needs Half a Year to </F> Consider Purchase of Arms"]    [Text] Riga, 3 Mar -- To make a decision about when, what  and how many arms to purchase, the government needs at least  half a year, said the Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs today.  "This month, we have found ourselves in a new situation, when  many countries, such as Poland, the United States, Great  Britain, Sweden, and the Czech Republic, expressed their  readiness to sell us arms. Of course it is in the interests of  the government to resolve this matter sooner," said the prime  minister at a press conference, at which government  representatives were reporting on their visit to Israel.    The main condition for the arms purchase from Israel would  be a proposal of a long-term (at least 12 years) credit. V.  Birkavs did not want to mention a specific sum and percentage  for the credit, but, due to his estimations, the sum would not  surpass half the Estonian credit. As DIENA already reported, it  is $56 million, therefore the Latvian credit would amount to no  more than $28 million.    According to V. Birkavs, Latvia is interested in antitank  weapons, communication equipment for the police, and border  control systems. The Minister of Home Affairs, Girts  Pavlovskis, and the Commander of the Defense Forces, Dainis  Turlais, have visited a few factories manufacturing arms. G.  Kristovskis said that he was quite impressed.    On Monday [7 March], a meeting of the leaders of the three  Baltic states and the Nordic states will take place in  Stockholm. V. Birkavs will consult with Mart Laar and Adolf  Slezevicius on the common Baltic borders protection system with  modern technology, and also problems of border security will be  discussed. "And yet, this is not only a problem of security,  but also of advantage," said V. Birkavs. The cost of the  technical equipment could be considerably lower, if it would be  purchased in larger quantity. All Baltic states have the common  goal of joining NATO, therefore it would be convenient to buy  similar arms and border protection systems, he pointed out.</p>

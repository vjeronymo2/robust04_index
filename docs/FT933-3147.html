			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sale helps Heywood Williams to Pounds 22.7m HEYWOOD WILLIAMS, the building materials group, reported half year pre-tax profits up from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 22.7m, which included a Pounds 15m profit on the sale of most of its glass business to Pilkington. Turnover fell to Pounds 170.3m (Pounds 190.4m) in the six months to June 30, including Pounds 34.3m from discontinued activities. This reflected the three month lacuna between the Pounds 95m sale of the glass distribution business in April and the maiden contribution of a US building products company acquired for Pounds 42m at the end of the half year. Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, chairman, said the glass business had not been making any money. He added that the profit rise reflected cost cutting in its aluminium and plastics businesses. 'Our automotive business has benefited from the inclusion of windscreens in the MOT test from January 1, with the trade up 30 per cent overall. Our US interests equalled the record profits they achieved in 1992 in dollar terms.' He added: 'Recovery in the UK is hesitant but the underlying trend is positive.' The acquisition of LaSalle-Deitch, a US buildings material company, gave the company further access to growth markets in prefabricated houses and recreational vehicles, Mr Hinchliffe said. Mainland Europe was likely to remain difficult for a little time. At the end of the period net cash was Pounds 19m, against net debt of Pounds 24.6m 12 months earlier. Interest income was Pounds 86,000 compared with charges of Pounds 1.16m last time. The board declared a maintained interim dividend of 4.5p from earnings per share of 23.7p (3.4p). COMMENT Management deserves credit for harsh cost cutting last year which has helped the company bear the seasonal losses of its old glass distribution business and improve underlying profits. The strategy of supplying higher margin components for specialist niche markets such as prefabricated houses and recreational vehicles looks good. But the cyclicality of both markets calls for caution. Stripping out the exceptional profit, forecasts are for Pounds 20m pre-tax giving a multiple of about 20.5 this year, a 30 per cent premium to the market, thanks mainly to loss elimination and growth in windscreens. But the multiple falls to 15 in 1994, which looks reasonable for a recovery stock.</p>

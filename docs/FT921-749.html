			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uzbeks see oil gusher as answer to their prayers - A blowout that could herald self-sufficiency for the former Soviet republic WHEN OIL began gushing out of the ground the day Uzbekistan joined the United Nations, inhabitants of the newly independent state saw it as a gift from God After flowing for almost a month, the awesome oil blowout is now spilling out about 15,000 tonnes of light crude a day. Experts at the site in Uzbekistan's impoverished Fergana Valley say it is still too early to estimate the size of the reserves below. But this Moslem nation of 20m people is already praying it will become a self-sufficient oil producer after decades of depending on neighbouring Russia, which first conquered Uzbek territory in the middle of the 19th century. 'This is a major discovery for Uzbekistan,' declared a delighted Mr Anwar Narmatov, director of Uzbekneft, the republic's state-owned oil company. But like his colleagues at a crisis centre set up less than a kilometre away from the sky-high fountain of oil and white smoke, he says that more drilling around the area is necessary to determine whether this discovery represents a freak occurrence or holds the promise of an oil bonanza. The unexpected find of 'black gold' could not have come at a better time as the most populous of the former Soviet Union's central Asian republics struggles to find its feet as an independent country. Even the name of the collective farming area where the oil discovery was made on March 2 - Mingbulak, meaning 'One Thousand Sources' - seems to support suggestions of divine planning. The oil was struck after Uzbekneft drove down to 5,200 metres - it had not expected to hit oil for another 600 metres. Experts have now decided that a necessary preliminary to tackling the blowout is to set fire to it within the coming week. Mr Efim Katznelson, Uzbekistan's expert at capping oil blowouts, says: 'Working under fire' is the only way to build new valves and pipelines to channel the oil in an orderly manner. The fire is also expected to burn the oil that has flooded surrounding farmland. If the oil is not brought under control quickly, it could not only damage large quantities of cotton farmland on the eve of the sowing campaign but pollute the neighbouring Syr Daria, which irritates crops for miles around. 'We can't do anything now with all the smoke and oil everywhere,' he said, his protective clothing spattered with oil droplets. He expects to produce a flame 100 metres high, after simulating a test operation. The blowout has already produced some 350,000 tonnes of oil. Some of it has been collected and dispatched to the republic's two refineries. But an army of battered trucks, assembled from all over Uzbekistan are clearly unable to cope with so much wealth all at once. Mr Joe Bowden, the Texan oil man whose Wild Well Control company is helping the Uzbeks along with experts from Russia, says it will take 15 days to cap the oil flow. Mr Katznelson says the last crisis of this kind in the former Soviet Union occurred six years ago, when a blowout at the Tenghiz oilfields in nearby Kazakstan took a year to cap. A decree issued by President Islam Karimov orders Uzbekistan's economic experts to draw up plans to attract foreign capital to help develop reserves. Mr Rustam Azimov, chairman of Uzbekistan's Natinal Bank for Foreign Economic Activity said that existing joint venture legislation already exempted foreign investors from taxation for the first two years from the date profits were declared. They are entitled to a 50 per cent reduction for the following three years and there are no restrictions on repatriating profits in hard currency. As a major producer of gold and cotton, Uzbekistan is already keen for foreign investors to help it process more of its wealth internally rather than export raw materials. Oil could provide a major boost to the republic's balance of payments.</p>

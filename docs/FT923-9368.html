			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Dresdner Bank improves 20% in first six months DRESDNER Bank yesterday became the second of Germany's big three banks to report robust profits for the first six months of the year. Buoyed by strong lending demand and increased fee income, Dresdner's partial operating profits - excluding gains from own account securities trading - rose by 20 per cent to DM1.29bn (Dollars 869m) better than the market was expecting. This follows a 14.7 per cent rise in Commerzbank's partial operating profits, announced last week, and comes ahead of today's figures from Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank. All leading German banks reported double-digit profits growth in the first four months of the year, and the figures from Dresdner and Commerzbank suggest that banking remains, with construction, one of only two sectors in Germany able to defy the recession and deliver strong profits growth. However, Deutsche's share price has fallen over the past week on worries that half-year profits will be flat, signalling the end of a long period of powerful profits growth. Commenting on the likely outcome for the full year yesterday, Mr Wolfgang Roller, Dresdner's chief executive, said that profits were likely to show double-digit growth over 1992 as a whole. He declined to comment on the possibility that the dividend would be raised this year. Earnings on interest in the Dresdner group rose by 12.6 per cent to DM2.95bn, whilst commission income climbed 14.8 per cent to DM1.13bn. Operating expenses rose by 10.3 per cent, lower than the increase last year, reflecting what the bank called 'a return to a more normal trend' following the pronounced increases in the past two years due to the bank's expansion in east Germany. Total operating profits - which include the contribution from own account trading - rose by 15 per cent to DM1.4bn. Dresdner's shares rose DM7 to close at DM332 yesterday. Mr Roller, dismissed talk of a power-struggle between Deutsche Bank, on the one hand, and Dresdner and Allianz, the big insurance company which owns 22.3 per cent of Dresdner, on the other. Speculation of such a struggle has been fanned in recent days following the sharp fall in the Allianz share price - and in the German stock market as a whole - after it published poor figures for 1991 on Tuesday last week. The shares fell further on Thursday and Friday, triggered by a sell recommendation from DB Research, the Deutsche Bank research arm. Mr Roller said that the sell note had caught the stock market at a delicate moment. Questions about the motivation for the earnings estimate should be put to DB Research itself, he said. However, he pointed out that Dresdner's own equity analysts had downgraded their forecasts for Allianz's earnings as long ago as December last year. Deutsche, which last month took a significant step into the German insurance market with the purchase of a 30 per cent stake in Gerling, the largest privately-owned insurance company in Germany, has argued that the sell recommendation was based on a fundamental assessment of Allianz's profits and was not an attempt to knock a rival's share price. Allianz has, for its part, denied rumours that it has dumped shares in Deutsche Bank by way of retaliation. DRESDNER Bank wants to relieve the former Soviet Union's debt problems by partially accepting repayments in roubles, Reuter reports from Hamburg. Mr Wolfgang Roeller, the bank's management board chairman, told a press conference that international banks should grant the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) a partial delay on payment of interest on its loans. He added: 'We are prepared to accept a proportion of the interest payments in roubles.' One condition of accepting roubles was that banks should be able to use them to buy stakes in companies and property in the former Soviet Union, he said.</p>

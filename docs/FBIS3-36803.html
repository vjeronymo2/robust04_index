Security Council, says a  letter by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev addressed to  U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali circulated as a  Security Council document here on Wednesday.    The Russian minister said that he read with great attention  the letter of January 28 from the U.N. secretary-general to the  Security Council president where Butrus-Ghali spelled out  versions of the use of air force to ensure the rotation of  troops in Srebrenica and to open the airport in Tuzla.    "We regard this letter as an important step aimed at  fulfilling provisions of appropriate Security Council  resolutions, which rule that all issues pertaining to the use of  air force in security areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina and around  them to help U.N. peace keepers in implementing their mandate,  are to be settled under the leadership of the Security Council,  provided there is close cooperation with the U.N.  secretary-general," Kozyrev noted.    He wrote: "Frankly speaking, the very possibility of a force  cover for opening the airport in Tuzla fills us with misgivings.  I'd like to explain: We voted for ensuring security for U.N.  peace keepers and do not preclude a direct air cover for U.N.  peace keepers in Bosnia and Herzegovina if they are attacked.    "However, one should clearly understand that any strikes,  even if limited within the scope of an air cover, will bring  about serious consequences. Situation at all the fronts in  Bosnia and Herzegovina will sharply deteriorate, which will more  likely result in an end to humanitarian aid and will put into  jeopardy the entire U.N. operation.    "Taking into account far-reaching consequences of possible  decisions on involving air force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we  believe as before that their adoption should be an exclusive  prerogative of the U.N. secretary-general in consultation with  the U.N. Security Council. You and I have reached a clear  understanding, as it seems to me, on this point," the Russian  minister stressed.    Kozyrev expressed confidence in the effectiveness of only a  political solution of the situation concerning the opening of  the airport in Tuzla and called for "the earliest political  settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina".</p>

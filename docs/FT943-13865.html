			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: An uncertain future for US soccer's Dollars 100m promise - A look ahead to the problems to be faced in setting up Major League Soccer When the US soccer establishment six years ago earned the right to host the 1994 World Cup, it made two promises to Fifa, the sport's governing body. First, it promised that the US would put on a great World Cup; second, that the tournament would be so successful that it would leave a priceless legacy for the game in the form of a sustainable top-flight US professional league. The US organisers have delivered on their first promise - and then some. The negatives have been few, the positives many, including record-breaking attendances, impressive TV ratings, peaceful crowds, superb organisation and, not least, plenty of exciting soccer. Delivering on the second promise is likely to be a much trickier proposition, at least if history is anything to go by. Since 1960, there have been six attempts to create a major professional soccer league in the US. All failed, mostly because of lack of support from fans, sponsors and broadcasters. The most memorable was the North American Soccer League, which briefly burned bright in the 1970s with the help of international stars like Pele and Beckenbauer. The NASL, however, collapsed little more than a decade later in bankruptcy. If the new league - named Major League Soccer, and due to kick-off next April - is to avoid the fate of its predecessors, it has to start well. But progress so far has been unpromising. When Alan Rothenberg, head of the US Soccer Federation, unveiled plans for MLS last December, he said he would announce at the start of the World Cup the names of the cities where the 12 league franchises would be based. By June 16, however, only seven locations had been chosen - Boston, Los Angeles, New Jersey, Washington DC, Long Island, San Jose and Columbus - and only one city, Columbus, had met the target of attracting deposits from 10,000 potential season-ticket holders that MLS originally required of all potential franchises. Rothenberg was also unable to provide names of any corporate sponsors who had agreed to contribute to the Dollars 100m capital MLS intended to raise to pay for the running of the league. Since then, MLS has signed up Nike to provide kits for half the teams, and Mitre to provide the league's official ball. Thus, with less than a year before the first ball is due to be kicked, MLS had an incomplete roster of teams and little money from sponsors. What it did have was a TV contract - ESPN, the cable sports channel, and the ABC network have agreed to broadcast the games (at no cost to them, mind you) - and an organisational structure designed to ensure the league's financial survival. In most unAmerican fashion, MLS is centrally-owned. All the teams and players are owned by the league, rather than individual franchises, as with every other major US sport. To keep the league competitive, MLS will control the drafting and movement of players, and set pay levels that are very low by US standards. The average salary will be Dollars 70,000 a year, with top players earning little more than Dollars 100,000 a year. This structure might make good business sense, but it could deter potential owners who would like to own an MLS franchise but who might balk at ceding so much control to the league. And fans might not like the idea of a sports league where a single owner decides who plays where. The limits on players' salaries could be an especially big problem. Everyone agrees it is crucial that MLS signs up some well-known players for its first season, especially some of the Americans who starred for the national team in the World Cup. Yet the very success of the US team will make that difficult. The World Cup was such a good showcase for US players that many foreign clubs have already expressed interest in signing them to play abroad - at salaries that will dwarf those on offer in the MLS. Pay may not be the only issue likely to deter US players from staying at home. If the US team is to improve its performance at the next World Cup, the squad has to have a larger contingent from the world's best leagues, which are all in Europe. It will be years, possibly decades, before the quality of the MLS rivals that of the top Italian, Spanish German and English leagues. Although MLS's chief operating officer, Bill Sage, has said the league would be willing to pay top rates to attract some stars to the US, the money may not be enough on its own. It seems that US soccer officials are resigned to seeing most of the players in the US squad not already employed overseas sign with top foreign clubs in the next few months. The success of the World Cup may prove a double-edged sword for MLS in another way. American sports fans have notoriously short attention spans, and the enthusiasm for soccer the tournament has generated is likely to have dissipated by next April. And once MLS does start, Americans who were captivated during the World Cup by Romario's sleight-of-foot dribbling and Roberto Baggio's lethal finishes may find it a huge let-down when they watch a bunch of unknowns battling it out in a three-quarters-empty stadium somewhere on Long Island. For now, though, the challenge is to raise enough money to get the league off the ground. Eager to use the World Cup as a launch-pad, Rothenberg and other MLS executives met potential corporate sponsors last week. If they can secure the money to persuade some World Cup stars to join in the debut of MLS, then they may win over enough US sports fans - plus the weight of advertising and sponsorship dollars that are the difference between life and death for all big-time sports.</p>

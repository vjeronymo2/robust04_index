			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / International Company News: Bramalea expects to pull out of industrial property market BRAMALEA, the debt-burdened developer controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, expects to withdraw from the North American industrial property market and retain only a handful of its Canadian office buildings as part of a last-ditch effort to maintain the confidence of its lenders. Mr Marvin Marshall, president, said that the company expected to present a new business plan to lenders later this month and hoped to complete negotiations by the end of August. Bramalea, which has debts of CDollars 4.9bn (USDollars 4bn), defaulted last month on interest payments on a debenture issue, and its financial problems are widely viewed as being at least as serious as those of Olympia &amp; York. But, unlike O&amp;Y, Bramalea has the advantage of a powerful shareholder and has up to now convinced its lenders that it is doing its utmost to raise cash through asset sales. As part of the restructuring, Bramalea also plans to sell its US shopping centres, to reduce its Canadian mall portfolio, and to concentrate on the residential market in Ontario and California. Bramalea has raised CDollars 573m since it began selling properties last year. It expects total proceeds to reach about CDollars 2bn by 1997. Several of its assets have been bought by Trizec, its controlling shareholder. But Trizec, which itself has debts of more than CDollars 9bn, has indicated that it is nearing the end of its willingness to provide support to its subsidiary. Bramalea's shares closed at 80 cents on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday, down 7 cents on the day. The shares were trading at close to CDollars 5 at the beginning of this year.</p>

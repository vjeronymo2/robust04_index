			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Jordanian Ambassador Fakhri Abu-Talib </F> with unidentified correspondents in Beirut on 8 February --  recorded]    [Text] [Abu-Talib] I visited the interior minister today to  thank him for his interest since the time of the crime [29  January assassination of Jordanian diplomat] and for instructing  the security departments to take all the necessary measures to  divulge the circumstances of the incident. I also thanked him  for his condolences, which he conveyed to the embassy, on a  common calamity that has pained us and all the Lebanese.    Such incidents will not affect Jordan or Lebanon. They can  happen anywhere. I do not believe this incident will deflect  the Jordanians from the correct course and the wise policy  pursued by the king.    [Correspondent] Have you identified the motives of the  crime?    [Abu-Talib] The motives and the investigation are in the  hands of the Interior Ministry and the security departments;  they are the ones qualified to make statements on the  investigation. We are not conducting the investigation.    [Correspondent] There is talk .... [incomplete sentence as  heard]    [Abu-Talib] I cannot confirm or deny who the culprits are.  We are being put in the picture but we are not the ones  authorized to officially state where the investigation has  reached.    [Correspondent] Will Jordan demand the culprits'  extradition?    [Abu-Talib] This is premature.    [Correspondent] Is it true there was a political message to  the Jordanian regime behind the incident?    [Abu-Talib] According to my own analysis, the motives for  the  incident were political and were intended to harm both Jordan  and Lebanon. The perpetrators were criminals supported by agent  regimes, which still resort to such incidents.    [Correspondent] Who are these agent regimes?    [Abu-Talib] I cannot identify them. As I told you, those who  committed this criminal act did not serve the interest of  Lebanon or the Arab nation.    [Correspondent] Are they Arab or non-Arab regimes?    [Abu-Talib] Soon you will start interrogating me.    [Correspondent] Today's reports say the culprits are  Palestinians, do they not?    [Abu-Talib] I heard what you heard.    [Correspondent] Have you confirmed this?    [Abu-Talib] We have not.    [Correspondent] Do you suspect any particular quarter?    [Abu-Talib] We hold nearly all the main leads. But we cannot  tell the press because we do not want to infringe upon Lebanese  security or the judicial authorities in Lebanon and play a role  that is not ours to play.</p>

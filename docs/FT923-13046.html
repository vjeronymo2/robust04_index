			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: A corporate marriage made to last / A look at the durability of the AMD-Fujitsu production venture WHEN a minnow marries a whale, one can only wonder how long the whale will wait before it swallows his mate. The alliance agreed this week between Fujitsu, Japan's biggest computer company with Dollars 25.9bn in sales last year, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), ranking only fifth among America's semiconductor makers with sales of Dollars 1.2bn, raises that question. However, Mr W. J. Sanders, chairman of AMD, has structured a deal that could just withstand strains within the partnership and make the marriage last. Not only have Fujitsu and AMD agreed to jointly build a Dollars 700m factory to manufacture flash memory devices, one of the hottest products in the electronics industry, they have also agreed to buy small equity stakes in each other. While cross-shareholdings are normal practice in Japan among closely-associated companies, this is a first in trans-Pacific technology alliances and represents a tangible commitment to a long-term partnership. Fujitsu and AMD will establish a 50-50 joint venture company that will build the factory to make flash memory chips. These retain information, just like a disc drive or tape recorder, when power is switched off, and can also perform data processing tasks. Dataquest, the research company, expects the market for these devices to expand from about Dollars 150m a year to Dollars 1.5bn in 1995. Many in the industry expect a market bigger than Dollars 5bn by the end of the decade. AMD and Fujitsu hope to establish a leading position quickly. The factory will open in late 1994 and have a capacity of 20,000 eight-inch silicon wafers a month. The two companies hope this will give them more than 20 per cent of the world market - an ambitious goal that requires a large financial commitment and close co-operation. The venture covers only the most advanced devices - using circuitry of 0.5 micron (millionth of a metre) width or smaller. The agreement, however, also forbids either partner from producing these devices outside the joint venture, effectively preventing them from competing against each other. This pact is a conscious attempt by the two companies to avoid the pitfalls that have struck many US-Japanese technology alliances. US companies have been accused of providing basic technology on the cheap to Japanese companies. While the agreement is the third in a series of cross-border alliances in flash memory announced this year, it goes further than the others. Intel, the US company which dominates the world's microprocessor industry and today has 85 per cent of the world's flash memory market, is providing technology to Sharp, the Japanese electronics company, which will manufacture advanced flash chips in Japan. IBM and Toshiba last month agreed to share technology to develop a proprietary flash technology owned by Toshiba, which invented the devices in 1984. Neither of these agreements involves joint manufacturing or equity ties. AMD will give some of its cash to Fujitsu in return for new shares, and Fujitsu will give cash back to AMD for some of its shares. Japanese companies have long felt comfortable owning small chunks of their business partners. Mr Sanders insisted that this be part of the deal so that Fujitsu would have an interest in the financial success of AMD. The share holdings are limited to 5 per cent or less and are still to be negotiated, but Fujitsu is likely to own a much bigger stake in AMD than vice-versa. 'This collaboration is based on a spirit of equal partnership and co-operation,' Mr Hikotaro Masunaga, Fujitsu managing director, said. Equal or not, the deal is a marriage rich in convenience. AMD has flash technology, but needs a big partner to shoulder the financial burden and the large market risks. Fujitsu needs the technology and, with around Dollars 8bn in consolidated net debt at the end of March - after a fiscal year when it was battered by weak semiconductor markets - it could use a partner to share the costs. The two companies also stressed the complementary nature of their technologies, leaving plenty of scope for further co-operation. Still, it would be difficult to imagine such a deal being struck until recently. Mr Sanders cited three reasons why. First, the cost of capital in Japan was so cheap until recently that Japanese companies did not need partners - now they are paying world rates or more. Second, the costs of developing new technology and building plants has also risen sharply. Third, Japanese companies are paying more attention to profitability than before, and it is easier to agree on an expected margin of return. 'This produces an environment in which enlightened companies can join together for their mutual benefit,' said Mr Sanders.</p>

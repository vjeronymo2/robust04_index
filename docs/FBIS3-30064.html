			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Richard Breeze] </F>   [Excerpt] SUVA, Feb 25 (AFP) -- Fiji's sharpest politician,  President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, took centre stage here Friday  as voting in a week-long general election closed amid deep  uncertainty. Most observers considered it unlikely that either  of the rival Fijian groups would emerge from the poll strong  enough on its own to provide this Pacific republic with a stable  government.    Mara's job would be to hammer out a compromise agreement on  a  premier and a government as soon as possible after counting is  complete, probably early Sunday.    Under a constitution stemming from a 1987 army coup, ethnic  Fijians have a lock on the politics of this sugar-producing  archipelago, with 37 seats in the 70-seat House of  Representatives.    Ethnic Indians have 27 with five for European, Chinese or  mixed-race members and one for the autonomous island of Rotuma.  The same constitution says the president picks the premier, who  must be a Fijian and have the support of the majority of the  multi-racial parliament.    The big question Friday was how many votes the Fijian  dissidents grouped in the Fijian Association (FA) would take  from the ruling Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party.  The dissidents broke from the SVT over controversial budget  proposals in November.    This split among the Fijians has spurred regional rivalries  and SVT leader and premier Sitiveni Rabuka fears the election  could further deepen divisions between Fijians. Rabuka says the  SVT should win around 33 seats but shaky economic policies and  criticism of Rabuka's mercurial management style could cost it  votes.    Josevata Kamikamica, the FA's leader, is confident of  wounding the SVT. "We are going to do well. We will get around  12 seats," he told AFP Friday as he sat quaffing kava with  supporters outside a Suva polling station. "I would be quite  happy to be premier. And we could look at having Rabuka in a  goverment which I lead, but I won't serve in a government led by  Rabuka," he said.    Mara, a 73-year-old veteran former premier, is Fiji's most  seasoned politician and is one of the last of the great  paramount chiefs. He sees himself in a role as father of the  nation.    Political sources expect the hard-headed chief to move  swiftly and decisively to get an agreement from Fiji's political  party leaders on an acceptable premier. He seeks prompt  agreement on a solidly-based government so as to boost both  local and international confidence in the country, the sources  said. "He could summon Rabuka and Kamikamica and tell them that  he wants a quick agreement on a premier and a government," one  Fijian source said.    One suggestion in political circles is that Fiji may emerge  from the election with a minority government which had an  understanding with other groups in parliament, particularly the  Indian-dominated parties. The long-established National  Federation Party (NFP) is widely expected to emerge stronger  from the vote at the expense of its rival for the Indian vote,  the National Labour Party.    NFP leader Jai Jam Reddy is seen as a Kamikamica backer, but  it is suggested that his party could cut a deal with Rabuka if  they thought him more open to their policy views. Top among  these is a review of the constitution which has to be completed  by July 1997. Nine parties and 23 independents contested this  poll in the country's scattered islands.

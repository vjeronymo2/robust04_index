			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 SHINEHEAD "THE REAL ROCK" ELEKTRA: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A  SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Shinehead's 1988 debut album "Unity" placed the Jamaican-born, New York  City-bred reggae rapper in the forefront of reggae's new generation and  established him as one of the freshest young artists in any genre. His  pastiches blended a wide array of sources and stances without slipping into  forced eclecticism.  </P> <P> "The Real Rock" is a mystifying follow-up because Shinehead has abandoned the  panoramic sweep for a one-dimensional, electronic reggae/rap groove. Only the  version of Sly Stone's "Family Affair" creates the excitement of never knowing  what's going to come flying at you next.  </P> <P> The remaining material just explores facets of Shinehead's sound one at a time.  The skeletal foundations are catchy enough -- particularly the dynamic  techno-roots groove to the Christian-themed title track -- but the gleeful  embellishments that made "Unity" memorable are missing.  </P> <P> Instead, there are lightweight novelties and facile exhortations to maintain a  positive attitude. "Good Things" and the Everly Brothers' "Till I Kissed You"  are more satisfying displays of Shinehead's singing skills in a '50s R&amp;B,  innocent vein. But even the strongest songs are more well-crafted than  inspirational, and the cleverest verbal forays are undercut by the musical  retrenchment. DON SNOWDEN  </P></p>

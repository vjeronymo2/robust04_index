			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Mikhail Zhuravovich for </F> TASS]    [Text] Minsk, 12 May -- "The economy of Belorussia  [Belarus] has reached the point beyond which it will find itself  in a very deep crisis, and it will be far more difficult to get  out of it than it is still possible to do so at present," Sergey  Ling, the Belarusian economics minister, said in an interview  published today in the NATIONAL ECONOMIC NEWSPAPER. According  to him, one of the reasons behind the recession is the mass  reciprocal nonpayments that have led to stoppages in production.  The debts of Belarusian enterprises to the republics of the  former USSR already exceed 1.3 trillion rubles and they  themselves are owed 890 billion rubles. The total amount of the  deficit is not in the Republic's favor. Sergey Ling underlined  that "at present, there is no economic mechanism that could  smoothly, without ruining production, regulate the problem of  nonpayments, nor do measures exist to ensure that payments are  made. What is happening is that a process is taking place when  old debts are being gradually pushed to the back into the  background. At the same, new debts are being incurred."    The Republic's economist also noted that Russia' is  responsible for the lion's share of mutual nonpayments. It  constitutes half of the total debt. That is why one can reckon  that the treaty on the merging of the monetary systems will make  it possible in general to take this problem off the agenda. At  the same time, "the National Bank should react more actively to  the situation. At present, it is spending too much time on  criticizing others, and is adopting a duplicitous position  regarding the unification of the monetary systems. What is  needed here, first and foremost, is a constructive committed  work that will make it possible to extricate the economy from  its present situation," Sergey Ling underlined.</p>

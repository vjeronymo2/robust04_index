			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Nissan ratings under review for downgrade MOODY'S, the US credit rating agency, is reviewing the ratings of Nissan Motor and its subsidiaries for possible downgrade, affecting about Dollars 9.1bn of securities. The Japanese car company's long-term debt is currently rated A2 and its commercial paper is rated Prime-A. The announcement came as Nissan reported a 9 per cent fall in domestic sales for September, which was its third straight year-on-year decline, and a 26 per cent decline in exports in the first half of the fiscal year to September. The company's domestic production also declined 13 per cent in the first half, the third straight year-on-year decline, partly due to an increase in overseas production of 22 per cent. Moody's said that its review would focus on Nissan's ability to respond to the challenges posed by weakening demand in Japan and on the outlook for new model introductions by the company. The review will also examine the impact of the yen's appreciation on profitability in overseas markets and Nissan's efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency. The credit rating agency is also looking at Nissan's use of local production facilities to offset pressures of the high yen, the potential implications for the company's Japanese production facilities, the investment required to maintain competitiveness in each of its major markets and Nissan's ability to meet its investment requirements either through internally generated funds or by increasing indebtedness. Separately, Nissan announced that it is setting up a US logistics company to handle logistics operations for US-made auto parts that are exported to Nissan factories in Japan and Mexico. The new facility is scheduled to start operations in April to manage the procurement of car parts by Nissan in the US. Nissan hopes the establishment of the logistics centre will cut lead times currently required to deliver US-made parts in half. The move comes in response to growing US demands that Japanese carmakers buy more US-made car parts and comes as the US and Japan prepare to face each other in negotiations over Japanese imports of US autos and auto parts this week. Nissan has voluntarily agreed to import Dollars 3.7bn worth of US auto parts in the fiscal year to March 1995.</p>

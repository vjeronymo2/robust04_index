			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Partition plan divides Moslems: Izetbegovic presents choice between 'a just war or an unjust peace' in Bosnia PROMINENT Bosnian Moslems yesterday debated a partition plan for the republic amid intense pressure to endorse the Serb-Croat proposal for three ethnic statelets in an attempt to end the war in Bosnia. The session upstaged a meeting of Bosnia's multi-ethnic parliament scheduled for today to vote on the Geneva conference proposal. Yesterday's ballot was set to determine whether Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic, a Moslem, would sign the plan brokered by international peace envoys Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. Moslem deputies comprise a majority of the multi-ethnic wartime assembly. Although Serb and Croat members of the Moslem-led Bosnian government attended yesterday's session as observers, their restricted status is a blow to those Serbs, Croats and Moslems who have fought to preserve the idea of a multi-ethnic Bosnia. But it is a partial victory for the Serb and Croat nationalist leaders, who for months have advocated the concept of separate ethnic states, even though the three communities used to live intertwined before the outbreak of war in April 1992. At the meeting yesterday, comprised of some 350 Moslem intellectuals, commanders and politicians, Mr Izetbegovic himself apparently avoided making any clear cut recommendation on whether to accept the plan. As he outlined the proposal, citing the pros and cons of accepting the landlocked, unviable state created under the plan, he said the Moslems could either 'continue a just war or accept an unjust peace'. He warned deputies 'reality is against us (the Moslems)', but pointed out that 'many people during history have been strong enough to fight a long-lasting war and battle.' Bosnia's Moslems would have difficulty surviving the harsh winter whereas Serb and Croat mini-states would be uncomfortable but helped considerably by their patron states, he said. The lack of a clear line from Mr Izetbegovic reflects the divisions within the Bosnian Moslem camp about whether they should accept the plan. He has been virtually deserted by the Croat members of Bosnia's collective government and has faced fierce criticism from many of his former colleagues. Although many deputies appeared to be veering towards an acceptance of the proposal, speakers sharply criticised western governments and the United Nations for allowing the partition of Bosnia along ethnic lines drawn by 18 months of war. Mr Alija Isakovic, president of the Moslem assembly, said: 'It is the height of hyprocrisy that two aggressors (Serbia and Croatia) are allowed to decide the fate of the victim.' But in what appeared to indicate a resigned acceptance of the republic's division, he said: 'No matter how they divide it, we will consider this solution temporary, leaving future generations to right this injustice.' Within Sarajevo itself, this line is undoubtedly popular - after months of siege, most of the war-weary population is ready for peace, on almost any terms. Meanwhile, up in the north-eastern enclave of Bihac, the local Moslem leadership have adopted an increasingly pragmatic - and independent - line, concluding their own trade agreement with neighbouring Croat and Serb populations, with scant regard for far-away Sarajevo. But buoyed up by their military advances in Central Bosnia in recent months, some commanders in Central Bosnia, remain reluctant to any compromise at all. Over the weekend Mr Stjepan Siber, a deputy commander of the army, said the army still favoured a unified Bosnia rather than a loose confederation of mini-states, and said that the partition maps were unsatisfactory in that they ignored local economic needs. Whether Mr Izetbegovic will be able to persuade these commanders to observe any ceasefire drawn up in Sarajevo - or Geneva - will be crucial to whether any peace agreement can be concluded in the coming weeks.</p>

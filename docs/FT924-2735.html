			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / BJP sees Ayodhya as desperate rallying call: The aspirations of India's Hindu militant opposition party MR Kewal Ratan Malkani, vice president of the Bharatiya Janata party, the radical Hindu party whose militant supporters stormed the Ayodhya mosque at the weekend, scorns the view that the incident will backfire against the BJP. 'It is only the upper classes who are shocked by this. The masses are delighted,' he said an interview yesterday. 'Look at Maharashtra (the state which includes Bombay and has born the brunt of the post-Ayodhya violence). If we had an election there tomorrow we would win.' The Delhi intelligentsia believes that Mr Malkani is quite wrong. Newspaper commentators insist that most Indians will now reject the BJP on the grounds that it foments intolerance. But the BJP has long learnt to do without the support of commentators. Mr Malkani's boasts reflect the party's defiant mood. The crisis has suddenly focused its energies. All the arguments over strategy and tactics which have dogged it over the past year as it saw its popularity waning have been set aside. So clear is the aim of advancing Hindu militancy that even the arrest of top BJP officials, including Mr L K Advani, the leader, for alleged incitement of religious hatred, has barely curtailed the party's activities. Today the BJP plans to stage demonstrations at the Pakistani and Bangladeshi High Commissions to protest against the destruction of Hindu temples in those countries. Mr Malkani was outraged by the suggestion that Moslems were merely reacting to the Ayodhya assault. 'They started this. Nobody is as patient as a Hindu but there are limits to our patience.' Mr Malkani said he regretted that the assault on the mosque was against the law. He also regretted the violence which has since swept India. But he accepted none of the responsibility. Instead, he blamed the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, and on the courts for repeatedly delaying settlement of long-standing Hindu claims to the mosque site. He also blamed Moslems for allegedly promoting intolerance. 'They smashed 3,000 temples (in the conquest of northern India). We want just three back.' The three are at Ayodhya, and at Mathura and Varanasi - two other Hindu holy cities where mosques stand on disputed sites. Mr Malkani, who is 71 and has spent his life working for militant Hinduism, speaks like a man who knows that if the BJP cannot fire Hindu passions now, with the Ayodhya issue burning, perhaps it never will. The BJP was formed in the early 1980s out of politicians linked to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the well-disciplined Hindu militant group which was one of three Hindu organisations banned last night. It sought to offer an alternative to the dominant Congress (I) party. But it won just two lower house parliamentary seats in the 1984 general elections. However, in 1986, Mr Advani began to fan the flames of the Ayodhya controversy. He also exploited growing disillusion with the Congress party's secularism which had united Indians during the struggle to build post-independent India but now seemed sterile. He won particular support from upper-caste Hindus, some of whom felt they were losing status as economic modernisation opened more opportunities to the low-caste masses. The party's financial strength came from many small shopkeepers and tradesmen, who felt Congress pampered the big corporations at their expense. The BJP tried to make its ideology coherent. Mr Advani said it was a 'nation first' party. Ideologues explained India should reject secularism and become an overtly Hindu nation. Historians rewrote parts of India's past to emphasise, for example, the role of Hindu princes, instead of Moslems, in opposing British rule. Even maths was not spared  - the Pythagoras theorem was attributed in one BJP-sponsored textbook to Baudhayan, an Indian mathematician who allegedly discovered it 450 years before Pythagoras. In last year's general election, the BJP secured 119 seats out of 543, making it the second largest party after Congress. It also won control of the state government in four states - the first taste of real power. However, the BJP then lost ground. It was unlucky in being unable seriously to challenge Mr Rao's economic reforms - a key issue over the past 18 months. BJP leaders were early fans of economic deregulation but the prime minister stole their clothes. The party's clean image was sullied by divisions between leaders and a minor sex scandal. In governing states, it suffered from inexperience. Moreover, even as they were wooed by the cause of Hindu unity, Hindus could hardly forget their many differences - including caste, language, wealth and regional origin. Without Ayodhya, it was difficult for the BJP to offer enough to hold them together. This autumn, when the Ayodhya conflict had temporarily gone quiet, an opinion survey showed just 14 per cent of those polled wanted Mr Advani as prime minister, against 49 per cent for Mr Rao. Mr Pran Chopra, a leading political analyst, is convinced Mr Advani's rating has fallen further this week: 'Ayodhya will damage the BJP's share of the total vote. The feelings of committed supporters may have hardened, but the party will lose mass support.' Mr Chopra believes the voice of moderation will prevail - a view shared by other analysts.</p>

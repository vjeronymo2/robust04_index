			<p>BFN     [Text] Israeli President Ezer Weizman has stated that the  kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani demonstrates that Israel is  doing its best for the sake of one of its soldiers. Israel will  even step up its efforts in defense of the border area where  army, security, and civilian personnel are deployed, Weizman  added. He said: We will never abandon them because Israel is  concerned with the security of this area and the fate of its  inhabitants.    At the end of a visit to the border area to convey  congratulations on 'Id al-Adha, President Weizman met the press.  Present were the South Lebanese Army's [SLA] General Lahd, some  of the area's key figures, Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq,  the commander of the northern sector, and the commander of the  Liaison Force. Weizman said that peace in the Middle East rests  with Syria and there is a link connecting Damascus, Beirut, and  Amman on this issue. Weizman stressed that conducting  unilateral talks with Lebanon depends on the Syrian president.  I hope President Hafiz al-Asad will understand that the time is  ripe for him to change his views concerning peace, he added.    Before leaving the border area, Weizman held a 30-minute  closed meeting with Gen. Lahd.</p>

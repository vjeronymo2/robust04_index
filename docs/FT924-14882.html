			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: La Generale net profits dip to BFr4.47bn in first half NET profits at Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, slipped from BFr4.81bn (Dollars 164m) to BFr4.47bn in the first half of 1992. However, profits before extraordinary gains - current profits - rose sharply from last year's trough. Before extraordinary gains, the group made profits of BFr3.64bn - still short of the 1990 interim figure of BFr4.6bn, but more than double the 1991 interim figure of BFr1.47bn. Mr Etienne Davignon, La Generale's chairman, said the group was still expecting to improve current profits for 1992, in spite of the continued economic depression. He also hinted that the group would want to take advantage of its stronger financial position. 'We have no intention of just sitting here and being happy about the good results - you can bet that we will be active in the future,' he said. 'The changes in the current profits are not due to external economic forces, but mainly due to the (improved) management of the company,' he said. La Generale's share of current profits from services groups - such as Generale de Banque, the Belgian bank, and Tractebel, the electricity, gas and communications company - increased from BFr2.79bn to BFr4.07bn in the first half. Mr Gerard Mestrallet, La Generale's managing director, said that Tractebel would announce improved interim profits today. But industrial subsidiaries contributed only BFr472m of profit, against BFr50m of losses in the first half of 1991. Exceptional gains of BFr830m (down from BFr3.34bn) mainly reflected proceeds from the sale of La Generale's shares in Wagons-Lits to Accor, the French hotels company.</p>

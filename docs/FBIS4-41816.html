			<p>BFN     [Text] A total of 61 percent of voters of the Ukrainian  Zaporozhye Region Kamensk-Dneprovsk District have voted against  the utilization of the sixth block of the Zaporozhye Nuclear  Power Station. A total of 38 percent of voters voted for it  during a referendum held along with the presidential and local  elections in Ukraine.    Voters were asked whether it was reasonable to switch on the  sixth block before a law on nuclear energy was adopted. The  ballot papers also included a question on whether a storage  facility for exhaust nuclear fuel could be built in the region.    An INTERFAX correspondent reports that 32 percent of voters  were in favor of such a facility for exhausted nuclear fuel and  63 percent were against. A total of 68 percent of the voters  registered in the region took part in the referendum.    This referendum was initiated by the District Council.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Arts: Today's Television Amid all the coverage of the Commonwealth Games (7.00 and 10.10 on BBC1, 8.30 on BBC2) BBC2 ends its current series of On The Line with a programme about drugs in sport. The present system seems ludicrously haphazard and inefficient, with some people penalised for taking cold cures or drinking coffee while wholesale blood-changers go unchallenged. The trouble is today that it is not just the pride of athletes that is at stake but huge investments from advertisers ((8.00). No one would claim that the BBC1 series All Night Long, with its collection of misfits working In a bakery, was a classic comedy. But after the final episode today in the opening series it may well be re-commissioned on the grounds that it is better than most of the other comedies around (8.30). Vitali Vitaliev who left the Soviet Union five years ago, before the fall of the Berlin Wall, takes a video camera and retraces his steps for the series Travels With My Camera (9.00 C4). Radio 4's new Book At Bedtime is Herodotus, read by John Tusa - a wonderful idea (10.45).</p>

[De Lucena] I knew him by sight when I was serving in Juiz  de  Fora and he was working -- if I am not mistaken -- as municipal  public works secretary. Now I know him better. I like him very  much. He is an honest man, a very correct person.    [ISTOE] Minister Mauricio Correa revealed that there was a  group of military men who were determined to turn President  Franco into a local Fujimori. Were you aware of this?    [De Lucena] I was. At the time an anonymous document  containing a project for a military movement appeared in  circulation inside the barracks.    [ISTOE] Did you read the document?    [De Lucena] I looked it over quickly. I can tell you that  within the Army no one paid much attention to the document.    [ISTOE] Do you see any possibility of a Peruvian-style coup  in Brazil?    [De Lucena] No possibility at all.    [ISTOE] In any case, someone wrote the "military movement"  to  which you are referring.    [De Lucena] Everybody knows that there are dozens of groups,  reserve officers' groups, behind these proposals. They are  well-intentioned individuals, but they do not live the problems  of those who are in the Army, as I do. These groups do not have  any relevance. I usually say -- I insist on the matter quite  often -- that we no longer have parallel or external leaders in  the Army. The leaders today are those serving in the  institution, or in the position of minister or commander.  Anyone from outside trying to lead an internal movement will  have to depose the minister first. I am not just bragging.  What I say is based on the Constitution.    [ISTOE] Will your leadership end when you leave the Army at  the end of the government's mandate?    [De Lucena] Yes. I will leave behind many friends. But I  will no longer exercise any leadership function.    [ISTOE] Many interpretations were made of a speech by  General  Benedito Onofre Bezerra Leonel in November, particularly about  his remark on the "anger of the legions." What is the correct  interpretation of that remark?    [De Lucena] I do not think any interpretation is necessary.  Gen. Leonel copied that phrase from an old Army book. The  remark does not have any secret meaning. I have known Leonel  since he was a cadet, and I can assure you he is as good a  democrat as I.    [ISTOE] What is the Army's situation today?    [De Lucena] The year 1993 was a much better year than 1992.  We can still hear complaints about salaries, which are really  very low, but the Army achieved many things compared to 1992.  We are purchasing some weapons, our schools continue to operate  well, and we are pursuing our modernization programs.    [ISTOE] Are you also optimistic about what is happening in  Congress?    [De Lucena] I am. I do not like to speak about that, but I  believe in renewal and democratic improvement. I do not believe  in tough regimes or dictatorships. I believe in democratic  regimes, and I believe in people.    [ISTOE] Have you experienced any particularly difficult  moment as a minister?    [De Lucena] As a minister, no. I had difficult moments when  I was at the Eastern Military Command. We had to decide how to  act if Congress did not impeach former President Fernando  Collor. Would we go out into the streets to repress the people  and defend a president who was clearly involved in corruption  and who did not have the people's support? That was the worst  moment for us, the military commanders.    [ISTOE] Did you discuss the issue with other military  commanders?    [De Lucena] I did. We decided that if there was no  impeachment, we were still obligated to defend the president.  Fortunately, the theory that the impeachment process would not  be approved by Congress was remote. All of us were quite aware  of that.    [ISTOE] For whom did you vote in the last elections?    [De Lucena] I voted for Collor in both instances. He  disappointed me very much.    [ISTOE] Had you been aware of what was to take place, would  you have voted for [Workers Party, PT, leader Luis Ignacio da  Silva] Lula?    [De Lucena] Absolutely. He was the other choice. Brazil  comes first, does it not?    [ISTOE] Your meeting with Deputy Aloizio Mercadante [Workers  Party -- Sao Paulo] was much discussed. Do you empathize with  the PT?    [De Lucena] I empathize with Deputy Mercadante's father,  General Oswaldo Muniz Oliva, who is in the reserves. I see no  problem in meeting with a PT deputy. I also met with Deputy  Jose Genoino [PT-Sao Paulo], and with deputies from other  parties. The Army relies on Congress for many things. There  are amendments, drafts that deserve our respect. I am  interested in being on good terms with Congress. It is all part  of the rites of a democratic regime.    [ISTOE] Sir, do you believe that the anti-left hysteria  within the Armed Forces has been overcome?    [De Lucena] Yes, it has been overcome. There are only some  reactions of little significance.    [ISTOE] Who are responsible for these reactions?    [De Lucena] People who have not developed, who have not  witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall.    [ISTOE] Are there many such people within the Army?    [De Lucena] No, not among those on active duty. I assess the  issue in the following manner: There are two kinds of military  officers in Brazil -- those who graduated from the Royal  Military School, and those who graduated from the Agulhas Negras  Military Academy [AMAN] in Resende. I believe that the opening  of the AMAN school in 1944 marked a change in the mentality of  the Brazilian military officer.    [ISTOE] Do you believe you represent a generation of  military  officers who have a different mentality, a different attitude?    [De Lucena] I believe so. The generations that emerged from  AMAN were trained in more open and modern surroundings. What  fascinated us in our youth -- and many entered the Army because  of it -- were the deeds of the Allies in World War II. We were  fighting for democracy at the time.    [ISTOE] Are you the first officer graduated from AMAN to be  appointed Army minister?    [De Lucena] No, the second. The first was General Carlos  Tinoco Ribeiro Gomez, who was Army minister during the Collor  administration.    [ISTOE] The generation that emerged from the Royal Military  School chose the Communists as the enemies of Brazil. Who are  Brazil's enemies today?    [De Lucena] As I said after I was installed, I believe that  the worse enemy we must face today is poverty, because this is  the root of all our evils.    [ISTOE] Is the Army involved in other social assistance  areas?    [De Lucena] In the health sector, we assist in vaccination  campaigns. In border areas, it is Army doctors who look after  the local population. Our doctors and dentists are working in  the Amazon region. The Brazilian Army is multifaceted. In the  south, we have a more combatant, better trained Army. In the  northeast, the Army is more involved in social assistance  activities. In the northeast, we have engineering battalions  who drill wells and build dikes.    [ISTOE] Is the Brazilian Army well equipped?    [De Lucena] We have made a great effort to modernize it.  President Franco obtained some resources, and we will be  receiving a lot of modern equipment by June. This is a good  thing, because it motivates young officers and helps us to avoid  those problems we faced in the past.    [ISTOE] Will Brazil sign the missile treaty that the  Argentine Government has just signed?    [De Lucena] I have nothing against it. But all treaties of  this nature are being reviewed by Congress. The Army is not in  charge of conducting the negotiations.    [ISTOE] The trend in countries such as the United States is  to reduce the number of military troops and to have professional  soldiers. Are you in favor or against mandatory military  service?    [De Lucena] Completely in favor. I believe it is a  necessity, and I also believe it is good for the upbringing of  young men. I usually say that the Brazilian Army is different.  It cannot be compared with the American Army. The United  States has world interests, and has to look after its capability  and political power. The concept of the Brazilian Army is that  which prevails in France: that of the citizen-soldier. A lot of  money is spent to support a trained soldier. The Army must pay  good salaries if it is to compete in the job market. This would  not be good for us. Moreover, I do not believe we have a large  Army. The Brazilian Army has 200,000 men. I believe this  figure is compatible with our country's needs.    [ISTOE] During the Geisel administration, the Army was  alloted 16 percent of the national budget. Today it is alloted  only 0.5 percent of the budget. What is your opinion of this?    [De Lucena] I believe this is a ridiculous amount. The most  serious problem is that concerning salaries. And it is not only  within the Army. Today all officers are poorly paid. This  month we will get a slight salary increase to compensate for  last year's loss in purchasing power. We are not happy about  it, but it helps. It is disturbing to see someone reach the end  of his career without being able to support a child.    [ISTOE] There are officers who want their salaries to be  equivalent to that of personnel from the legislative and  judiciary branches on the basis of the principle of salary  equalization. What is your opinion?    [De Lucena] I believe that salary equalization is a utopia.  It does not exist. What is important is to implement a salary  policy that reduces today's foolishness.    [ISTOE] Many military officers who were involved in the 1964  revolution believed that corruption in Brazil was monopolized by  civilians. What is your opinion?    [De Lucena] I disagree. I believe that because of its own  structure the Army is in a better condition to repress  corruption when it arises. In the Army there is immediate  punishment. In addition, the admission criteria for the Army  are much stricter than those for Congress. Nevertheless, I do  not believe anyone holds a monopoly on corruption.    [ISTOE] Do you admire any civilian leaders?    [De Lucena] I have always been a fan of good administrators.  Carlos Lacerda was a great administrator. There are also some  contemporary politicians whom I greatly admire, such as Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Deputy Roberto Magalahes,  who was governor of my home state.    [ISTOE] Does the Army empathize with current events in  Congress?    [De Lucena] Absolutely. I was disgusted when I learned that  public resources, which could have been put to good use, are  serving personal interests.    [ISTOE] Are there people in the Army who still believe that  all politicians are thieves?    [De Lucena] Of course there are. But this is also true of  civilians. Wasn't it Lula who said that there were 300  swindlers in Congress? That is right. But this is unimportant,  because the guilty will be punished.    [ISTOE] You referred to the extreme poverty issue. Is the  Army also concerned about violence, particularly that in Rio de  Janeiro?    [De Lucena] Undoubtedly, but this a very delicate issue  about  which I would not like to comment.    [ISTOE] Will the much discussed Army intervention in the  hills [of Rio de Janeiro] ever take place?    [De Lucena] No, unless either the governor or the president  requests it. We cannot take on the fight against violence,  because the Constitution does not allow it. A 19-year-old  serving in the Army is not trained to climb the hill and fight  drug traffickers. As I have said, this is a very delicate issue.  What we can do is what is being done: support the Federal  Police and the local state police forces.    [ISTOE] Was the military regime good or bad for Brazil?    [De Lucena] It was good because it built an infrastructure  that the country lacked. That cannot be denied. But from the  point of view of political progress, of course it was harmful.    [ISTOE] Will you stay in government until the end of the  Franco administration?    [De Lucena] Yes, unless they kick me out before that.    [ISTOE] Do you believe there may some antagonism within the  Army regarding Lula's candidacy?    [De Lucena] I do not think so. What I can guarantee is the  following: Whoever wins, will lead. The Army will guarantee  the installation of the next president in compliance with the  Constitution, whoever is elected.    [ISTOE] What do you intend to do after the Franco  administration, when you leave the Army?    [De Lucena] I am going to try to be a good grandfather.</p>

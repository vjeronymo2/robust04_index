"There is a climate of trust," one guerrilla source  indicated. He added that at the meeting held this morning,  Thursday, the two sides agreed on the agenda for the talks to  reach a peace agreement in Guatemala. The source, however,  refrained from revealing the points in the agenda.    "We are advancing much more than we expected. The meeting  has been very productive. The climate in cordial," a government  source commented in regard to the preliminary meetings that are  to last four days and which were called by the United Nations.  The meetings, which are being held in a leading hotel in Mexico  City, are attended by eight government members (three military  officers, three civilians, and two advisers), three URNG Command  representatives, two URNG Political-Diplomatic Commission  delegates, and the UN-designated mediator Jean Arnault.    The preliminary meetings, which were called at the request  of  the rebels and President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's government, are  part of an effort to continue talks that were interrupted in  1993.</p>

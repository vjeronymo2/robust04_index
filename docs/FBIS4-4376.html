			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  DPRK Foreign Ministry today answered questions put by KCNA about  the attempt of the United States to justify its campaign for  pressure on the DPRK by distorting facts with the allegation  that the DPRK did not allow a proper inspection for the  continuity of safeguards.    [KCNA] The United States is now justifying its campaign for  pressure on the DPRK with the allegation that the DPRK did not  allow a full inspection by the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA]. Please tell me about the truth in detail.    [Spokesman] The United States is contending that the DPRK  must accept a full IAEA inspection, alleging that the recent  inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities by the IAEA was not  satisfactory. But this is quite contrary to the fact.    We are in a unique status after a temporary suspension of  the  effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) [haengmugi chonpabangji choyak  taltoe hyorok palsaengul imsi chongjihan tuksuhan chiwie innun  urinun]. So we are not obliged to accept a full inspection by  the IAEA pursuant to the safeguards agreement. Moreover, we have  never agreed with the United States and the IAEA on it.    We agreed with the United States and the IAEA only to an  inspection for maintaining the continuity of safeguards.    When the scope of the IAEA inspection was agreed upon at the  DPRK-U.S. contact in New York in late December last year, the  sides promised that it should be a strictly limited inspection  [chehan sachal] for the maintenance of the continuity of  safeguards, not a routine and ad hoc inspection [chonggi mit  pijonggi sachal] pursuant to the safeguards agreement.    At that time, the U.S. side asked the DPRK not to announce  to  the world that it would be a limited inspection to save its face.    At the New York contact in February, the U.S. side clarified  its position that if an IAEA inspection was made, it would come  out to the third round of talks with the DPRK, irrespective of  the results of the inspection.    The United States which had promised a limited inspection  and  asked the DPRK not to open it to the public and stated it would  have talks with the DPRK, irrespective of the results of the  inspection, is now urging the DPRK to accept an additional  inspection, charging that it refused to accept a full inspection  by the IAEA pursuant to the safeguards agreement. This is a  self-contradictory act.    This fully shows how faithless the United States is.    [KCNA] What does the United States really seek in reversing  the DPRK-U.S. agreed conclusions and kicking up a row of  pressure on the DPRK?    [Spokesman] I think it was motivated by the U.S. trite  hostile policy toward the DPRK [kutaeuiyonhan taejoson choktaesi  chongchaek].    Admittedly, we have honestly discharged our obligation  according to the agreed conclusions reached between the DPRK and  the United States at the New York contact.    The United States, however, had made false promises and it  took no action in actuality.    Nevertheless, the United States is resorting to pressure on  the DPRK and war provocation moves, alleging that the DPRK has  failed to implement the agreement. How can it be construed  otherwise?    As we have declared more than once, if the third round of  the  DPRK-U.S. talks had been held and the nuclear issue resolved in  a package deal [haengmunjeui ilgwal tagyorani songsa  toeoddoramyon], the IAEA's routine and ad hoc inspections of the  DPRK would have been resumed and the exchange of special envoys  between the North and the South would have been possible.    But the United States intentionally foiled the third round  of  the talks, which would be the key to the solution of the nuclear  issue, setting unjustifiable preconditions. This clearly proves  that the United States has no intention to resolve the nuclear  issue through negotiation and it is only using the talks to  stifle the DPRK and, further, promote its strategic interests in  the Asia-Pacific region.    [KCNA] Now that we have undergone an inspection enough for  the continuity of safeguards as we had agreed with the IAEA, the  UN Security Council has no reason or justification to discuss  our issue, does it?    [Spokesman] Of course not. The continued discussions of our  issue at the UN Security Council under this situation only give  the impression that the international organisation is courting  the favor of a country.    And this may be a living example that even international  organisations are used for the attainment of the U.S. egoistic  aim.    The IAEA Secretariat made haste with the adoption of a  "resolution" distorting the results of the inspection after  carrying out the inspection of enough scope for the continuity  of safeguards, and now the UN Security Council is discussing our  issue. All this is manipulated behind the scene by the U.S.-led  forces to stifle [apsal] the DPRK.    If the UN Security Council follows the United States, it  will  seriously harm its authority as an international organistion  whose lifeblood is impartiality.    If the UN Security Council truly wants to discharge its  mission, it must not argue about the DPRK, the victim, but argue  about the acts of the United States, the assaulter, and put  pressure on it.    If the UN Security Council, departing from the principle of  impartiality, defends the United States, the assaulter, for the  reason that it is a big power and puts unwarrantable pressure  upon the victim for the reason that it is a small country, the  small countries will no more trust the United Nations.    The UN Security Council must not be used as a rostrum for  putting unreasonable pressure upon the DPRK over the nuclear  issue.    [KCNA] What measures are needed in your opinion for paving  the way for a solution to the nuclear issue?    [Spokesman] The United States must no more pursue a hostile  policy toward Korea, first of all.    Since the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused  by  the U.S. policy to stifle our system, as mentioned above, if it  is to be solved, the United States must take measures first for  removing the nuclear threat to us and giving up the hostile  policy.    Still today when the nature of its anti-DPRK moves has been  brought to light, the United States is resorting to the row of  pressure against us, calling for UN "resolution" and the like.  This cannot be justified with anything.    The South Korean authorities must ponder over the lot in  which they would find themselves while running about reckless,  not knowing their position as now.    The United States must sincerely implement the agreed  conclusions reached at the contact with us.    It is a violation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed conclusions and a  mockery of our sovereignty for the United States to demand a  full inspection of the DPRK by the IAEA and the exchange of  special envoys between the North and the South, not implementing  its own obligations at all.    Pressure can never be a way of the solution of the problem  but it only makes the situation complicated.    It is nonsensical to urge us to accept an additional  inspection since we have already accepted, fairly and squarely  [chongjong tangdanghage], an inspection of a scope enough for  the continuity of safeguards according to our agreement with the  United States and the IAEA.    If the United States continues to misuse [agyong] our  sincere  efforts to resolve the nuclear issue, we would no longer pin  hope on the DPRK-U.S. talks and will counter [massonagal gosida]  any pressure to the end.    But if the United States put a stop to the international  pressure campaign against the DPRK and proceed with the  reestablishment of the foundation of the DPRK-U.S. talks we  would not oppose a negotiated solution to the issue through  negotiations.    Consistent is our position to resolve the nuclear issue  through dialogue.    The future developments and a peaceful solution to the  nuclear issue entirely depend on the attitude of the United  States.</p>

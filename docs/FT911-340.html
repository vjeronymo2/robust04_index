			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Management: Food for thought The most seductive claim made by advocates of customer service - that it promises huge pay-offs in terms of profitability - is also the most elusive to measure. As intuitively appealing as the relationship between service levels and profits may be, the only data a manager has is usually the 'hard' data concerning costs. Decisions about the level of quality to build into a given package - including product, service and value - have been largely based on those figures and, as Harvey Shycon, a consultant with Arthur D Little, notes, 'hunches'*. Shycon defines customer service as part of a total package comprising three elements: the product itself, the service that comes with it, and, inextricably linked with these two, value. The pay-off is defined as the incremental profit received - both from increased market share, sales and revenues as from reduced costs - as a result of better service. He claims that Little has developed a way of measuring both the costs and revenues of different levels of service which allows companies to design a total quality package to optimise return on investment. During the course of its work for a large food products company, which had a US market share of 38 per cent, Little found that the company had a 41 per cent share of a customer's business. This compared with 32 per cent for its nearest competitor, and its higher share appeared to be linked to the greater frequency of deliveries. More frequent deliveries was good for this customer, a large regional food chain; it reduced inventory, labour costs and improved the freshness of the products it sold. For the food products company, it meant a higher cost of service, but improved margins and volume of sales. This translated into an 8 per cent increase in sales volume and an almost 15 per cent improvement in profit. There appears to be proven benefits in the case of this customer, but would the same level of benefits apply nationally? Little set out to determine the value to the customer of specific service elements provided by the manufacturer. 'By comparing those service elements with the service packages provided by major competitors and determining how the customer spilt its purchases among several suppliers, we could determine how the customer valued the total service package in all its aspects and what level of service the customer was willing to pay,' Shycon said. The study suggested that the behaviour of the regional food retailer - that more frequent deliveries would induce it to pay higher prices and increase purchases from the company - was common to all food retailers. Detailed statistical work was done to determine more precisely the value to the customer of each element in the service package. The bottom line? Two additional market share points nationwide boosted revenues by Dollars 15.8m a year, of which Dollars 4.75m was additional profit. *Measuring the pay-off from improved customer service, Prism, Quarter 1 1991.

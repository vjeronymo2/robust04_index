			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 14 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] A senior official of the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry [MITI] disclosed on 13 June a plan to submit  a proposal at Japan-U.S. semiconductor talks due to be held in  Tokyo on 15 June to abolish the Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord.    The official said: "The effects of abolishing the  semiconductor accord will considered beneficial." Both  countries are supposed to decided by the end of July whether or  not the accord should be retained.    The official added: "The accord sets a bad example, and  gives the United States an excuse to impose sanctions against  Japan."    It seems, though, the Tokyo meeting faces heavy weather  because the United States sees the accord as an example of a  successful agreement between Japan and the United States.    The main purpose of the Tokyo meeting is to see if progress  has been made in allowing foreign companies make inroads into  Japanese markets. Prior to government-level discussions, a  meeting of specialists began on 13 June to calculate the  semiconductor market share enjoyed by foreign companies in the  February-March period in 1994.    Japan has decided to look at the possibility of abolishing  the semiconductor accord because it believes the United States  should not "threaten us by hinting at the possibility of  imposing sanctions on the grounds of market share."</p>

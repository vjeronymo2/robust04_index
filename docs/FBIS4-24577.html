			<p>BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Four days of trade talks  in the U.S.A. this month by representatives of Gansu Province  have resulted in agreements for considerable foreign investment  in this north-west China province.    During the Los Angeles talks, the province's team signed  with  foreign partners 46 million U.S. dollars worth of contracts in  imports and exports, together with seven technology agreements  and eight promised projects, bringing in 135 million U.S.  dollars and 204 million U.S. dollars, respectively.    Experts regarded the talks as a new page in Gansu's  cooperation with the U.S. and other countries, such as Canada,  Mexico and Argentina.    The inland province is a main energy and raw materials  centre  in China, abundant in resources like power and coal. Its  non-ferrous products and chemical engineering machinery have  nationwide brand recognition.</p>

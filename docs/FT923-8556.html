			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Bombay mix for US investors - The planned launch of an India country fund AN India country fund is to be launched later this year, following the announcement of a joint venture between a leading US money manager and India's biggest mutual fund group. The partners are the US investment firm Alliance Capital, which has Dollars 62bn of mutual fund assets, and Unit Trust of India, the government-owned mutual fund group which, with Dollars 10bn in assets and 21m unit holder accounts, dominates the Indian money management business. The result of their partnership is the Bombay-based investment management company Unit Trust Alliance Asset Management (UTAAM), the first joint venture of its kind in India. The partnership has two purposes: to provide Indian investors with Alliance's know-how learnt in more developed investment markets, and to sell Indian securities to overseas investors through new country funds. These country funds will compete alongside two existing UTI-managed vehicles, the India Fund, listed in London and the India Growth Fund in New York. UTAAM hopes for fresh demand for Indian securities around the world by concentrating on privatisation issues. It is a policy that has worked well in Mexico, Argentina and other countries where governments have been selling off state-owned assets. Alliance believes investors will be drawn by the growth potential and attractive pricing of privatised issues. In the past year, the Indian government has sold Dollars 1bn of equity in public enterprises, and another Dollars 1bn of nationalised holdings is due to be sold off in the coming year. The first UTAAM fund is to be launched later this year in New York, Boston, Tokyo, Hong Kong, London, Paris and Zurich. However, the volatile performance of the New York-listed India Growth Fund, which stands at a discount to net asset value after falling sharply in the wake of the Bombay stock market scandal, is a bad advert for potential investors in the new fund. Although emerging market country funds are notoriously volatile, and because of their ups and downs have lost some of their attractiveness, they remain a draw for sophisticated investors with an appetite for risk. As Mr Thomas Herzfeld, a leading US authority on closed-end funds, says: 'The time to buy country funds is when they are at a discount. It's a game for contrarian investors.' It is a point echoed by Mr Dave Williams, chairman of Alliance, who does not think the volatility, and occasional scandals, of emerging markets will greatly deter potential customers of UTAAM. He says: 'Investors in emerging markets come to expect the unexpected. It goes with the territory.' In the US, UTAAM is not entering a particularly crowded market. US investors interested in India have only a few vehicles to choose from. Apart from the India Growth Fund, there are a handful of regional funds. About 5 per cent of the Scudder Group's New Asia fund is in India, much the same as the Indian market's share of the Asia Pacific fund run by Prudential. The latter offers access to Hong Kong, Malaysian, Thailand, Singapore and Korean equities, and with three new China funds launched just last month, and Philippine, Taiwan and Malaysian country funds also quoted in New York, there is more choice for investors interested in the emerging markets of the Asian and Pacific Rim regions.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / World Trade News: Italians in Greek power contract A CONSORTIUM led by Ansaldo Gie, the Italian engineering group which is part of the Iri state holding company, has won the contract to build a new turnkey power station in northern Greece. The L550bn (Pounds 229m) deal is for the Aghios Dimitrios 5 plant at Kozani, about 100 miles from Salonika. The new coal-fired station will produce 350MW of electricity and 70MW in heat as part of a linked, long-distance heating project. The new plant, probably to be financed via an international bond issue by Greece's Public Power corporation, should be ready in four years. Ansaldo's share, worth over L300bn, involves turbines, generators and related control equipment. Austria's Wagner Biro will furnish the boilers and Aegek of Greece will be responsible for construction. Ansaldo Gie and Siemens of Germany have won a contract worth over L200bn for electricity generating equipment to complete one of the world's biggest hydro-electric power stations. Each company will supply five water turbines, generating a total of 1,600MW, for the Yacireta plant on the Parana river separating Argentina and Paraguay. The new units complete a project, devised in the 1960s, which will generate 3,100MW of electricity via 20 water turbines.</p>

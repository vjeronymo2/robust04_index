			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE PHARMACEUTICAL AND VIDEO DISTRIBUTOR;  </P> <P> BERGEN BRUNSWIG'S EARNINGS SURGE 37%  </P> <P> Benefiting in part from rising drug prices, Bergen Brunswig Corp., a leading  distributor of pharmaceutical products and home video cassettes, reported on  Monday a 37% increase in net earnings for its last fiscal year.  </P> <P> The Orange-based firm posted net income of $47.6 million on sales of $3.92  billion for the year ended Aug. 31, in contrast with net earnings of $34.7  million on sales of $3.49 billion for the previous year.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, the company posted net earnings of $10.7 million, up 39%  from $7.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1988. Fourth-quarter sales  increased 11%, to $998 million from $899 million for the same period the year  before.  </P> <P> Bergen Brunswig is riding a wave of rising sales among pharmaceutical  distributorships. John McRae, vice president of Baer Stearns &amp; Co. Inc., an  investment banking firm in New York, said industry consolidation has reduced  price competition, as larger regional firms have bought up the smaller ones.  </P> <P> Moreover, McRae said, new drugs are coming on the market at premium prices  because of the vast amount of research that has gone into their development.  </P> <P> And the prices of other drugs are increasing, he said, which is passed on to  distributors, who generally get a percentage cut of the wholesale price of the  drugs.  </P> <P> Also, George E. Reinhardt Jr., Bergen Brunswig's chief financial officer, said  many hospitals and drugstores that once bought drugs directly from  manufacturers have been shifting to using wholesalers in a bid to reduce costs  associated with maintaining large inventories.  </P> <P> The new customers, Reinhardt said, want to better match their stock to changing  market demand. While pharmaceutical firms generally sell drugs in bulk, such  wholesalers as Bergen Brunswig will make smaller deliveries on a daily basis,  he said.  </P> <P> McRae said Bergen Brunswig has succeeded in expanding its market share by  offering customers the convenience of a computerized order entry system that  keeps track of their sales and current inventories.  </P> <P> Also, McRae said, Bergen Brunswig has improved its profit margins through the  automation of warehouses, which has allowed the company to consolidate  operations and cut labor costs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Commtron Also Grows  </P> <P> Commtron Corp., the home video and consumer electronics side of Bergen  Brunswig's business, has also had growth. Sales totaled $550 million for the  1989 fiscal year, up 16% over $475 million in 1988.  </P> <P> Operating earnings of $11.3 million represented an 88% improvement over $6  million in fiscal 1988. The company credited in part the release of new home  videos, especially "Rain Man" -- the hit movie starring Dustin Hoffman -- in  the fourth quarter, and more cost-efficient operations.  </P> <P> Reinhardt said Bergen Brunswig also cut costs in fiscal 1989 by converting $135  million in debentures to common stock. That move, he said, significantly  lowered the corporation's long-term debt and eliminated about $10 million in  annual interest payments.  </P> <P> BERGEN BRUNSWIG PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> (In millions of dollars)  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.54IN:2.00IN:2.00IN:2.55IN:2.55IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 12 months  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 12 months  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 4th Qtr.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 4th Qtr.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Ending  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Ending  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Aug. 31, 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Aug. 31, 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Revenues  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $998  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $899  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $3,920  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $3,490  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net Income  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 47.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 34.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Per Share (in dollars)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.37  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.33  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.85  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.51  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Bergen Brunswig Corp.  </P></p>

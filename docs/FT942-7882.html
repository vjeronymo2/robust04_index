			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UN envoy calls off Kigali visit Mr Iqbal Riza, a United Nations special envoy, yesterday called off a trip to the Rwandan capital Kigali, saying warring parties could not guarantee his safety, Reuter reports from Mulindi, Rwanda. 'Both sides seem to have difficulty in securing our security. So we cannot go along the route into Kigali,' he told reporters before driving back into Uganda. He said he hoped to try and fly into Kigali from Uganda today. Mr Riza was to have travelled from northern Rwanda by road to Kigali to meet the government side after talks with rebels on ending seven weeks of violence in Rwanda in which an estimated half a million people have died. Fighting appeared to have resumed in Kigali in earnest after combatants agreed a truce to allow the envoy to visit. The talks with the rebels failed to agree on the key issue of the number of UN troops needed in Rwanda. Mr Riza said he had no mandate to alter the UN force figure of up to 5,500 authorised by the Security Council last week. The Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels insist on at most 2,500. A rebel spokesman said the RPF turned down Mr Riza's appeal that it enter talks with the interim government, which took over after President Juvenal Habyarimana was killed along with his Burundi counterpart in a rocket attack on their aircraft on April 6. That tragedy sparked the current massacres in Rwanda, blamed largely on Mr Habyarimana's troops and militias from his majority Hutu tribe.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: JMD plans change of direction JMD Group, the greeting cards maker and novelty products merchandiser, yesterday accompanied its interim results with a capital reorganisation, a move into computer and video games retailing and a change of name. Mr Bev Ripley and Mr Terry Norris, formerly chairman and managing director of Cityvision are to join the board as executive chairman and managing director respectively. The USM-quoted group reported pre-tax losses more than doubled in the six months to end-June, from Pounds 70,000 to Pounds 150,000. Turnover increased from Pounds 1.15m to Pounds 1.26m. Losses per share emerged at 0.19p (0.09p). The group plans to raise some Pounds 3.9m, net of expenses, by way of a placing and open offer of up to 32.2m new 5p shares and a subscription for a further 2.6m shares. Under the reorganisation, shareholders will receive one consolidated ordinary share for every five existing shares held. The open offer entitles qualifying shareholders to 25 new shares for every 12 consolidated ordinary shares at 12 1/2 p apiece. It is proposed to change the name of the company to Rhino Group.</p>

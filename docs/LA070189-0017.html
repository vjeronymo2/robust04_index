			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S BARELY ROOM FOR SPORTS IN SPORTS SECTIONS THESE DAYS  </P> <P> All the legalisms and legalese involving Pete Rose, his bookmaker, Commissioner  Giamatti and Judge Nadel are much ado about nothing, simple delays in a drama  fast becoming stale. As the judge said, a 14-day delay will hurt neither major  league baseball nor the public. This thing's already gone on longer than  Kareem's farewell tour. Either Rose will be able to explain away the hard  evidence, especially the betting slips, or he will not. If he cannot, he should  be gone.  </P> <P> For God sakes, let's play ball!  </P> <P> CHARLES CHICCOA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

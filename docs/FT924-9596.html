			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: UBS sees impetus from international operations UNION BANK of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, expects its international operations will continue to drive its profit growth. Mr Robert Studer, chief executive, said he was 'pleased' with the results so far this year. 'We are anticipating an improvement in consolidated cash flow for 1992 as a whole,' Mr Studer said, adding that he expected a further increase for 1993. Cash-flow last year was SFr3.4bn (Dollars 2.50bn) and net income SFr1.2bn. Provisions for bad loans, most of them in Switzerland, would be no higher than last year's SFr1.7bn, he said. Mr Studer said that 'the international side of our business must contribute an increasing share of our overall result'. Mr Matthis Cabiallavetta, executive vice-president responsible for trading and risk management, indicated that UBS' London subsidiary had done extremely well during the recent European currency turmoil. Leu Holding, part of the CS Holding banking group, said third-quarter net income was 'satisfactory'.</p>

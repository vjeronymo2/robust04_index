			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UN gives go-ahead to boost Bosnian force THE United Nations Security Council last night approved plans to send about 5,000 more peacekeeping troops - including British soldiers - to the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The UN vote came after heavy fighting flared up again yesterday in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, which has been besieged by Serb forces since April. The upsurge in fighting cast further doubts on plans for international peace talks to resume in Geneva on Friday. The extra UN troops - already offered by Britain, other European countries and Canada - are being sent to help protect relief convoys and ensure the safety of Moslem and Croat detainees freed by Serb captors from prison camps. The UK has offered up to 1,800 soldiers. The UN already has 15,000 peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslavia, including 1,500 in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The Security Council voted 12-0 to increase the size of the force, with three member countries abstaining - China, India and Zimbabwe. The resolution also stressed the importance of air security measures, such as a ban on military flights over Bosnia by the Serbian-controlled Yugoslav federal air force. Rapid implementation of such measures could 'reinforce the security' of international humanitarian operations in Bosnia, it said. Meanwhile Serbs and Moslems blamed each other for the latest violence in Sarajevo - the worst outbreak for several weeks - and for attempting to torpedo the peace talks due to be held in Geneva. At least four people were killed and 50 wounded, and reports from the city said heavy artillery had been used despite last weekend's agreement to put it under UN supervision to determine who was firing first. Mr Rusmir Jahic, commander of units loyal to the Bosnian government, said the old part of the city was shelled, and mortars had fallen on the Holiday Inn, where many journalists are staying. Bosnian commanders also reported that the suburbs of Hrasno, Breka and Bjelava were under fire. Mr Ermin Taric, a Serb, and one of the Bosnian commanders in Hrasno, said Serb irregulars were trying to gain control of the suburbs by using tanks. He added that the local childrens' hospital was also shelled. Before the upsurge in violence, the Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, wrote to Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, to say his government would not attend the peace talks because of continued fighting. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has also threatened to pull out of the talks if an air exclusion zone over Bosnia is imposed. Mr Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the international peace conference, are insisting that leaders of the three Bosnian communities attend the Geneva talks. Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the two co-chairmen, said that on their visit to the region last week Mr Vance and Lord Owen had got 'solemn, personal and unconditional commitments' from all the warring parties that they would go to Geneva. Mr Vance, who represents the UN, and Lord Owen, the European Community representative, 'expect all sides to be present at senior level on Friday', Mr Eckhard said. Representatives of the three communities are due to meet UN officials in Geneva today to agree security and confidence-building measures that would permit resumption of a UN airlift into Sarajevo. The airlift was suspended nearly a fortnight ago after the downing of an Italian transport aircraft, apparently by missiles, and food stocks in Sarajevo are dwindling. Mr Eckhard, briefing reporters, said UN monitors were now based at 11 heavy weapons sites controlled by Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo. This was in accordance with the agreement between Mr Karadzic and the conference chairmen which puts heavy weapons around four Bosnian cities under UN supervision. There had been 'some resistance' by local Serb commanders at Bihac and Jajce to inclusion of 82mm mortars, as the accord stipulates. This, and the status of heavy weapons near Gorazde, where Serb forces have lifted their siege, are now the subject of negotiations with UNPROFOR, the UN monitoring force. UNPROFOR was also negotiate with Bosnian government forces in Sarajevo to put their heavy weapons under UN observation, Mr Eckhard said.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Shops see ghost of free-spending past Sheffield's Meadow Hall centre came up with a novel way of making sure shoppers reached its stores this Christmas. It set up its own radio station giving constant traffic reports so people could find the most congestion-free routes and car parks. The move paid off. The number of shoppers visiting the centre this week was 4 per cent up on last year. Even shops and shopping centres that did not go to such lengths are reporting a considerably better Christmas than last year. Central London has mounted a particularly strong recovery. Queues were reported yesterday outside Marks and Spencer's food hall and Selfridges on Oxford Street even before they opened their doors. In Essex, the Lakeside shopping centre had a different problem. 'We've had people queueing to get into the car park at 7.30 in the evening,' said Ms Heather Davies, marketing manager. She added that Lakeside's trading tended to peak earlier in December and the last week had been quieter. In south-western England and Wales trading was quieter. Retailers said sales had improved on last year but spending was restrained. By yesterday trading had passed its peak and many shops were discounting to attract last-minute shoppers. Mr Colin Antrobus, manager of Regent Arcade in Cheltenham, said: 'It has been a steady Christmas, but it is debatable whether there has been a significant uplift. There are plenty of people about, but actual spending is up only marginally on last year, and that was a very bad Christmas.' St David's Centre in Cardiff reported visitors were up 6 per cent on last Christmas. But shoppers started to peter out on Wednesday and some discounting was starting. Mr Geoff Witcher, finance director of Trago Mills, which runs two out-of-town centres in Devon and Cornwall, said the Christmas shopping period had started earlier this year, at the end of October. 'Probably people are wanting to spread the burden over two monthly pay cheques,' he said. Trading was also quieter in the Midlands. Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley said yesterday that it was 'busy but not packed to the doors. It's like a good Saturday'. Mr Michael Stephens, of Cathy Stephens Jewellery in Leicester, said trade this week was 'ok, but no big deal'. The company has been making more unit sales, although at a lower individual value than last year. At Beatties, the Wolverhampton department store, sales on Wednesday, the traditional late-night shopping day in the town, were 4 per cent higher than on the comparable day last year. Further north, Manchester's Arndale Centre, which recorded a record 1.2m shoppers last week, was 'shoulder to shoulder' with shoppers yesterday. Mr Ken Hunter, general manager, said most shops were running between 10 per cent and 20 per cent up on sales this year. Mr Hunter added: 'The difference from previous years is that shoppers are using cash, not plastic.' In the north-east, the number of visitors since Monday to Gateshead's MetroCentre, Europe's largest shopping centre, was set to pass 500,000 by the time the mall closed last night, and managers were anticipating a busy day today. 'We call it the turkey trot,' said one. Retailers in Scotland reported similarly buoyant trade. Mr George Ritchie, general manager of Glasgow's St Enoch Centre, said: 'Where they are finding the money from, I don't know, but they are certainly spending it.' The newly opened Gyle shopping centre in Edinburgh said Christmas had exceeded all expectations. 'For five or six weeks there's been no let-up at all,' the centre said. It was receiving 90,000 to 95,000 visitors a day, compared with the 300,000 a week it had forecast. Some retailers will have only Saturday and Sunday to rest before their new-year sales start on Monday. In addition to looking for bargains on larger items, retailers say many shoppers will actually start next year's Christmas shopping next week - only to be found out by friends and relatives in a year's time when they try to get an exchange or refund. Computerised product numbers give the game away, leaving the recipient of the present crestfallen. 'Aunty Nelly brings it back to us for the money back or to change it,' said Mr Brettle of Littlewoods, 'and we have the dreadful task of telling her it's a year old.'

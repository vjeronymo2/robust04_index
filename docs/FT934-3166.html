			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Argentine rivals near to deal Celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of Argentina's return to democratic rule today are being overshadowed by the conclusion of negotiations between the ruling Peronist party and the opposition Radicals to change the country's 140-year-old constitution. Ten years ago today, Mr Raul Alfonsn was sworn in as Argentina's 32nd president this century, ending seven years of military rule. This is the longest period of democratic rule Argentina has seen since the early 1930s. It has suffered six military coups since 1930 and endured 13 military presidents. President Carlos Menem, whose six-year mandate ends in 1995, wants to stand for re-election. This requires lifting a constitutional ban on consecutive presidential terms. To do so, he needs the support of Mr Alfonsn's Radical party. Mr Menem and Mr Alfonsn are now reported to have overcome a dispute about the powers of a prime ministerial figure being introduced with the new constitution. Mr Menem had demanded the prime minister should not encroach on the president's authority. The two sides are close to agreement on a reduction of the prime minister's powers and new rules for presidential elections. The government wants to send the amendments next week to Congress, which must approve changes to the constitution with a two-thirds majority. Mr Menem is in a hurry because Argentina virtually closes down between December and March for the southern hemisphere summer.</p>

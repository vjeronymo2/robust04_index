			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held in  Pyongyang to mark the 40th anniversary of the publication of the  famous work of the great leader President Kim Il-song "On the  Immediate Tasks of the Workers in the Field of Transport".    President Kim Il-song published the famous work at a  conference of model transport workers on May 11, 1954, 40 years  ago. In the work he reviewed the successes and experiences  gained by the railway transport workers during the war (June  1950-July 1953) and put forward highly important tasks to  develop railway transport after the ceasefire.    Yi Yong-mu, chairman of the Transport Commission, in his  report said the great leader's work served as an inspiring  banner in powerfully arousing all the transport workers to  performing shining feats again in the postwar rehabilitation and  construction in the same spirit and stamina as was displayed in  the wartime.    The great leader made sure that May 11, 1954, was set as the  day of railway workers, which marked an occasion in bringing  about an epoch-making turn in the development of railway  transport, and has shown deep trust and loving care to railway  transport workers, he said.    He stressed that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il set  forth a policy of making revolution in transport and led the  whole party, the whole country and the entire people to give a  powerful assistance to the railway transport so as to further  strengthen the material and technical foundations of railways  and thereby effected a new revolutionary upswing in the railway  transport.    He called upon all the railway transport workers to work  with  the conviction of sure victory and firm will in the same  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude as was  displayed by the transport workers during the war and achieve  brilliant success in the fulfilment of the first year tasks of  the period of adjustment to add lustre to the Korean-style  socialism centred on the popular masses.</p>

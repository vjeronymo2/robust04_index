			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The other edits involved data that appeared unusual and had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be verified by the intermediary. Only 74 providers had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data elements that were unresolved as of March 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the unresolved data elements fall outside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established edit parameters and require verification by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediary. None of the unresolved data elements failed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical edits (that is, edits indicating serious data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> errors that affect the wage index computation).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The wage file used to construct the proposed wage index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes data obtained in late January 1994 from the HCRIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> database and subsequent changes we received from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediaries through March 14, 1994. We have instructed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the intermediaries to complete their verification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questionable data elements and to transmit any changes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wage data, via HCRIS, no later than June 15, 1994. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expect that all outstanding data elements will be resolved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by that date and that we will be able to reflect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrected data in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, the hospital wage index data file was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to the public until mid-May. However, to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals more time to evaluate the wage data used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construct the proposed hospital wage index, on March 16,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994, we made available to the public a diskette containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the raw hospital wage data that were used to construct the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FY 1995 wage index. We advised State and national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital groups of the availability of the data. We also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructed all fiscal intermediaries to inform the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment hospitals they service that we would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be sending out hospital-specific wage data as we had for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FY 1994 wage index, but that we would make the FY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991 data available on a diskette. The fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediaries were instructed to advise hospitals of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of the data either through their representative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital organizations or directly from HCFA using order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forms provided to them. Additional details on the cost and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ordering of this file will be found below in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VIII. B. of this proposed rule, Requests for Data from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we note that Table 3c in the Addendum to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this proposed rule contains each hospital's inflated average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hourly wage used to construct the wage index values. By  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backing out the applicable inflation factors (set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below in section III.B.3.), a hospital can determine its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uninflated average hourly wage as reflected in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index. This table will also be included in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. If a hospital believes, based on its review of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data contained in Table 3c, that its average hourly wage is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent with the data submitted on Worksheet S&hyph;3, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital should contact its intermediary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Requests for Wage Data Corrections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above we will use cost report data from FY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991 (that is, cost reporting periods beginning on or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1990 and before October 1, 1991) for the update  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the wage index. As such, we believe hospitals have had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ample time to ensure the accuracy of their FY 1991 wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data. Moreover, the ultimate responsibility for accurately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completing the cost report rests with the hospital, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must attest to the accuracy of the data at the time the cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report is filed. However, if a hospital believes that its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1991 wage data have been incorrectly reported, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital must submit corrections along with complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting documentation to its intermediary in time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow for review, verification and transmission of the data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the development of the final wage index. To allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient time to process any changes, a hospital must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit requests for corrections to its fiscal intermediary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by May 15, 1994. The request should include all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation necessary to support the requested change. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be reflected in the final wage index, any wage data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrections must be reviewed by the intermediary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmitted to HCFA via HCRIS on or before June 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

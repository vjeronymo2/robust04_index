			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the  Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland  [CPRF] in its Information No. 651 issued Thursday stressed the  Kim Yong-sam group's suppression of the South Korean Federation  of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) must be stopped  immediately and the illegally arrested patriotic students be  released at once.    Recalling that the Kim Yong-sam group has launched a roundup  campaign against Hanchongnyon Chairman Kim Hyon-chun, former  chairman of the organisation Kim Chae-yong, Chairman of the  National Reunification Committee of Hanchongnyon Yang Tong-hun,  former chairman of the committee Kim Pyong-sam and other  hardcore members of the organisation, ruthlessly suppressing the  righteous struggle of the students affiliated with the  organisation, the information says:    Hanchongnyon is a vanguard organisation of progressive and  patriotic students who are courageously fighting for national  sovereignty and social democratisation and national  reunification in South Korea which has been reduced to a U.S.  colony.    All its activities are righteous deeds for the country and  the nation, which can by no means be a target of fascist  suppression.    The CPRF Secretariat bitterly condemns the South Korean  fascist clique's suppression of Hanchongnyon as an unpardonable  anti-national criminal act to destroy the organisation now  active as a vanguard in the movement for independence, democracy  and reunification in South Korea and thus bar the advance of  pro-reunification democratic forces and prolong the remaining  days of the pro-American flunkeyist traitorous "regime".    If the South Korean rulers persist in their reckless  sword-brandishing against justice and patriotism, it will only  precipitate their own destruction.</p>

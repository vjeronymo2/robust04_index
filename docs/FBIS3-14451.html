			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, 25 Mar (INA) -- Iraq has called on the  United Nations to implement Security Council Resolution 778  requiring all countries that hold deposits representing proceeds  from Iraqi oil sales or products, paid in or after August, 1990,  to transfer these funds from the suspended guarantee account  [hisab al-daman al-mu'allaq] as laid out in Resolutions 706 and  712.    This came in a letter from Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id  al-Sahhaf to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    The letter emphasized the need to observe the general rules  requiring that Iraqi money deposited in the suspended account be  invested efficiently and that the proceeds be added to the  principal.    Following is the text of the letter:    Your Excellency Butrus Butrus-Ghali,    UN Secretary General,    New York    Regarding UN Security Council Resolution 778 of 1992, I  would  like to point out the following:    1. Paragraph 1 of the said resolution decided that all the  countries that hold deposits of money for the Iraqi Government  which represent proceeds of Iraqi oil sales or oil products,  paid in or after August 1990, must transfer the funds as early  as possible to the suspended guarantee account, as laid out in  Resolution 706 and 712 of 1991.    Inasmuch as the money put into the Iraqi deposit accounts  cannot legally come under this heading, since, although it  represents the proceeds of oil sales, having become part of the  account it loses this capacity. The money thus becomes Iraqi  deposits, in view of the fact that the source of the debt  changed from a sales contract to a bank deposit. Consequently,  the money does not represent oil sales as stated in the  resolution.    The argument stated above supports Paragraph 2 of the same  Security Council resolution referring to the proceeds from oil  sales before they are added to any account. This means the sale  price must go into the suspended credit account.    2. According to banking transaction rules, a suspended  account owner, in our case the Iraqi Government, does not lose  it. Accordingly, as the legal proprietor of the account, the  Iraqi Government's opinion must be taken into consideration in  all that affects the account.    3. It must also be taken into account that the general rules  require funds deposited in the suspended account to be invested  efficiently and their proceeds added to the principal.    From the above, it is obvious that the provisions of the  said  Security Council resolution are illegal; indeed, they flout  established banking norms that form the foundations of  international trade.    Kindly distribute this letter as a document of the Security  Council. Regards.</p>

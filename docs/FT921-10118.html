			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Plea to press after Ashdown revelation: Labour and Liberal Democrats launch inquiries into recent break-ins at party offices NEWSPAPERS were yesterday asked to show restraint by Lord McGregor, chairman of Press Complaints Commission, following revelations about the private life of Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats. His plea came as City police charged a man with burglary and handling stolen goods in connection with the break-in at the offices of Mr Ashdown's solicitor. It was a document taken from these offices last month that led to the revelations about Mr Ashdown's private life. A woman was also helping police with inquiries. Meanwhile, Labour and the Liberal Democrats launched investigations into break-ins at offices in Westminster and throughout the country to discover whether they were simple burglaries or had a more sinister motive. Scotland Yard said it would consider setting up a 'dirty tricks' squad to investigate whether the spate of break-ins had been politically motivated as soon as a formal request for such an inquiry had been received. In a personal statement, Lord McGregor warned newspapers of 'the dangerous consequences in the pre-election period, of mixing political reporting with irrelevant commentaries upon the private lives of political figures'. He reminded newspapers that the Calcutt Committee report on privacy had given the press 18 months to prove that self-regulation could work and that the 18-month period would run out in July. He said: 'A return to the pre-Calcutt performance will certainly result in a law of privacy and a statutory body with legal powers to enforce the sanctions against the press.' Mr Ashdown's staff said he was seriously considering making a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission about the behaviour of some newspapers. Lord McGregor's warning came amid concern that, because some newspapers pay large sums for compromising material, this might in turn have led to a growth in the theft of personal papers and computer records. Most politicians have inclined towards the theory that the break-ins were unrelated incidents rather than a conspiracy by a political party or the security services. However, there are a number of puzzling aspects to the burglaries. For example computer disks with membership and canvassing details, but with little commercial value, have been taken. The theft of damaging personal papers last month from Mr Ashdown's firm of solicitors lent initial credence to the conspiracy theory, but City of London police said they regarded the discovery of the papers by the thief as a fluke. The Liberal Democrats published a list of burglaries at party offices, including some in marginal seats, and intend to call for a co-ordinated police inquiry when more details have been collated. Mr Graham Elson, the party's chief executive, said some stolen material, such as membership records, would be particularly useful to opponents during an election campaign. At least seven Labour MPs have had their Westminster offices burgled in the past six months, but the number of break-ins at local party offices is not known. Ms Joyce Gould, the party's director of organisation, is writing to all regional offices seeking details of thefts and break-ins over the past two years. The party said: 'We do not wish to sound alarmist, but the facts speak for themselves. Someone has been breaking into our MPs' offices and stealing things of little value to the ordinary burglar.' Among the catalogue of crimes at Westminster have been the thefts of computer disks, party documents and private correspondence from Mr John Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, and Mr John Prescott, transport spokesman. Also listed is interference with the computers of Ms Marjorie Mowlam, City spokeswoman, and Dr John Reid, a member of the shadow defence team. Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, whose personal computer password was bypassed, suspects a political motive and has criticised the lack of security in the Commons. 'Once you get into the Commons, past the security barrier, it's open house. Nobody locks their doors,' he said. Conservative Central Office provided a list of 35 constituency office burglaries over the past 18 months, including one in Bath, the constituency of Mr Chris Patten, party chairman. It said there was no discernible pattern among the break-ins and rejected the theory that they could have been politically inspired. Its view was that the latest crime was computer theft, and all offices, including those of political parties, were obvious targets.

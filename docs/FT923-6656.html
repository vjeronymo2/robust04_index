			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar falls to all-time low The dollar fell through its all-time low against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday, despite concerted central bank intervention to support the currency, writes James Blitz. The US currency fell through its historic low against the D-Mark of DM1.4430 at around 1630 London time. Although foreign exchange trading was thin, the currency fell fast after breaking support at that level. Within minutes it had lost over a pfennig, but bottomed out at DM1.4345. European currencies lost ground against the D-Mark in the dollar's wake. Sterling closed at DM2.7970 against the D-Mark, setting another record low since Britain joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism in October 1990. The Italian lira was also weaker, closing at L762.2 from a previous close of L760. These are uncharted territories for the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate and dealers are uncertain of what will happen to the dollar next week. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London, says that the dollar could easily break support at DM1.40. The dollar's fall came despite intervention earlier in the day from sixteen central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve. They had intervened in a generally thin market at around 1430 London time, buying the dollar when it was at DM1,4480. Four more rounds of intervention followed. Yesterday's operation appeared to be modest in size. Several dealers suggested that central banks had spent between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn in the market, although the Bank of Italy said that the intervention had been 'massive.' An economics analyst at a commercial bank in London also said that his dealing room had seen intervention on a far greater scale than normal. An important requirement to turn the market is that dealers should be short of the supported currency, so that when its exchange rate starts rising there is a run to buy it. However, the market was well sated with dollars yesterday, and one commercial bank reported some marked selling against the intervention by corporate dealers. The market has also shown a marked reluctance to buy high-yielding currencies like sterling or the Italian lira on a Friday for fear that these currencies could be devalued over the weekend. With sterling now only a pfennig above its floor against the D-Mark in the ERM, analysts expect the Bank of England to intervene to support the currency early next week. However, the market is not necessarily short of sterling and some dealers feel that intervention could be limited in effect. The British Chancellor would then have no choice but to raise UK base rates.</p>

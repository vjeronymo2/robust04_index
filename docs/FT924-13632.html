			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Strong Far East demand for World Bank yen issue THE World Bank's second global yen bond offering, launched yesterday, met strong demand from Far Eastern investors, but the reception from European institutions was less enthusiastic. The Y225bn offering of five-year global bonds is due to be priced early today at a yield spread of 24-26 basis points above the No 105 five-year Japanese government bond. Dealers reported unusually strong interest from US investors, as well as aggressive buying by Japanese and South East Asian accounts. 'This issue shows the worth of the global bond concept,' said one underwriter. 'A deal of this size could not have been smoothly executed in the Eurobond market.' The deal, arranged by Daiwa, Nomura and Goldman Sachs International, could be set at the low end of the indicated range as a result of the strong Far Eastern demand. But further supply in the Euroyen sector is not likely to follow, unless European interest picks up. The recent widening of yield spreads in the Euroyen sector has eradicated the trading differential between Euroyen bonds and domestic bonds launched in the Japanese market. As a result, the spread on the World Bank offering appeared more attractive to domestic investors than for the last global offering. The previous global deal, a 10-year offering launched in March, is now trading at a spread of 37 basis points over the 10-year benchmark (which is trading very tightly compared with other JGBs.) Yield spreads in the Euroyen sector have widened by about 10 basis points in the last month, and by 20-30 basis points since the start of the summer. World Bank Eurobonds received a blow last month, when the Italian government repealed a withholding tax exemption for Italian investors. However, few yen bonds were held by Italian investors, and the impact was concentrated on the World Bank's dollar and D-Mark deals. Meanwhile, the flow of issues in the D-Mark sector continued yesterday, with deals for Toyota Electric Power Company and the European Coal and Steel Community. In addition, Sweden's large DM2bn issue, launched on Monday was increased to DM2.5bn due to strong demand for the paper. Despite being priced at the low end of the indicated spread range - at 45 basis points above the curve - the paper sold out rapidly, with strong demand from international and domestic institutional investors boosted by a rising bund market. The 8 per cent bonds, initially priced at 100.28, traded strongly to close at 100.43 bid. Other issues, such as Tepco's DM1bn 10-year deal priced to yield 27 basis points over the 10-year bund yield, fared less well, and will take rather longer to place, dealers said. Also in the D-Mark sector, the European Coal &amp; Steel Community launched a DM105m five-year offering via Bayerische Vereinsbank. In the dollar sector, Toyota Motor Finance launched a Dollars 250m three-year deal, under its medium-term note programme, via Lehman Brothers. The deal was considered fairly priced at 55 basis points over the curve, and is not expected to add to congestion in the dollar sector.</p>

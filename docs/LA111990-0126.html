			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ERIC DAVIS HAS KNEE SURGERY  </P> <P> Cincinnati Reds outfielder Eric Davis underwent arthroscopic surgery today to  shave rough edges from the underside of his right kneecap.  </P> <P> Dr. Michael Lawhon, the Reds' team physician, performed the surgery this  morning at Christ Hospital.  </P> <P> Reds spokesman Joe Kelley said Davis was judged able to leave the Cincinnati  hospital in a matter of hours to return home and continue recuperating.  </P> <P> Lawhon said he found evidence of wear and tear on the kneecap's underside.  </P> <P> "There was no major ligament or cartilage damage," Kelley said.  </P> <P> Davis, 28, is still recovering from the kidney injury he suffered while diving  for a ball in Game 4 of the Reds' World Series sweep of the Oakland Athletics.  The Reds say Davis is expected to be fully recovered from that injury by spring  training.  </P></p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Sport: Captains of contrast - Golf SINCE 1983, when Europe lost the Ryder Cup to the US by a single point in Florida, there has never been more than a blade of grass between the two sides. What Europe have lacked in depth they have made up for in spirit and astute captaincy. Tony Jacklin, who captained the side from 1983 to 1989, was responsible for much of this resurgence. He realised that if things were to change on the course, things off it had to change too. 'Before I took the job,' says Jacklin, 'I demanded that certain conditions were met. You wouldn't believe how far behind the Americans we were in terms of preparation. I made sure the little things were right, as only then could we hope to compete on equal terms.' Jacklin's part in the European success in the 1980s, should not be underestimated. He led by reputation, and was hugely respected. He also introduced a fiery competitiveness which rubbed off on his team. 'I still love beating the Americans more than anything else in the world,' he says with boyish enthusiasm. 'There is something about their over-confidence which gets me going.' The man who succeeded Jacklin, Bernard Gallacher, is a different animal. They are as different as a birdie is from a bogey, one an Englishman living in Scotland; the other, a Scotsman living in England. Gallacher never won a major championship. Jacklin won two. Gallacher has still never tasted success in the Ryder Cup. Jacklin has. Gallacher has six or seven players in his team who are better golfers than he ever was. Jacklin probably only ever had one (Seve Ballesteros). A large part of the captain's work is dealing with the press. Gallacher admits that he does not enjoy this side of his job, and is deeply suspicious of the media. Jacklin loves dealing with journalists, and they love him, because he says what he thinks, and what he thinks is usually quotable. 'I think there is a case for not having a captain as we have one today,' says Jacklin. 'It might be more appropriate to have a manager, much as they do in cricket, who would be entirely press-related. The captain would play, and deal with what happens on the course.' The job of captain is certainly less important now that Gallacher is the incumbent. He is shy and introverted, a private, family man. He does not seem, on the outside anyway, to be a great motivator. By his own admission, he took a considerable time before deciding that he wanted to take the job. Gallacher said in February that he would be happy to have a rule which made him pick the top 12 on the money list, as he found selecting three wild card players an awkward task. Jacklin says he would have liked, when captain, to have had all 12 picks himself, so confident was he of picking the right players. Gallacher was not to blame for events at Kiawah Island two years ago. He was not to know that Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam would play well below - rather than under - par. Gallacher must assert himself more than he did two years ago. Then, controversy seemed to follow him at every turn. His defence was to run from the spotlight. He became moody and monosyllabic, in contrast to the ever-approachable Dave Stockton. As a result, people suggested that Seve was more in charge of the European team than Gallacher was. Seve may not even make the team this time, but whether he does or not, Gallacher must be more convincing if Europe are to recapture the Cup at the Belfry in September.</p>

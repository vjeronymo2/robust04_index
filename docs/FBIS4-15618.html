			<p>BFN     [By UKRINFORM correspondent Sergey Kravchenko]    [Text] Kiev April 8 -- Deputy head of the Ukrainian  Environmental Ministry's Nuclear and Radiation Safety department  Konstantin Rudya categorically refuted today press reports  claiming Ukrainian extraction and processing of uranium is not  controlled.    "Some would like to force Ukraine out from the uranium  market  and make an impression things do not go smoothly in this  sphere," he said. "In fact, the branch has its problems both in  Ukraine, Russia, Estonia and other former Soviet republics, the  problems which were inherited from the semi-classified Soviet  Ministry of Medium Machine-Building." Rudya stressed the  republic is correcting the past mistakes. For instance, it is  creating a system of early warning radiation control and much  better decontaminates the environment, dumps and tailing dumps  in the areas of uranium workings.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Private company aids tax reforms THE INLAND REVENUE has awarded a private management consultancy a 10-week contract to help with its plans for reforming the personal tax system. P-E International, based in Egham, Surrey, has been awarded an initial Pounds 150,000 contract for five staff to review the Revenue's strategy and make recommendations on how it will be implemented. If the work meets with Revenue approval, the company is likely to be awarded a further three-year contract believed to be worth about Pounds 2.25m. The second stage will cover support, analysis and advice on the changes required in Revenue processes, internal organisation and information technology. It will primarily focus on simplification of the self-assessment personal tax system, but also provide support for wider aspects of the current internal restructuring of the Revenue. The proposals for self-assessment of personal tax - which will affect up to 4m self-employed people and a similar number of other taxpayers - have been heralded in two consultative documents and most recently in the chancellor's Budget speech. They are due to be introduced for the 1996-97 tax year. The appointment is the result of a recent public competition for the contract, and follows wide-ranging proposals for reforms of the system of self-assessment. The system will introduce a method that is already in place in some countries, such as the US, by which taxpayers estimate their own tax liability and submit their tax forms to the Revenue along with payment. At present the Revenue makes an assessment after taxpayers have returned their forms, and a request for payment is sent out. The Revenue hopes that the changes will reduce the demands on its time and manpower from inquiries by taxpayers.</p>

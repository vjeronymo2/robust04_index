			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 Apr (MENA)--Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin has praised President Husni Mubarak's role in supporting  and promoting the Middle East peace process.    In a statement to the weekly AL-MUSAWWAR to be published on  Friday [22 April], Rabin said President Mubarak helped greatly  to continue the process and remove the obstacles in its way.    On the negotiations with Syria, the Israeli prime minister  said he does not believe peace with Syria can be achieved  without secret meetings. He pointed out that Israel held talks  with the PLO in Oslo for six months and that that helped to  achieve the Declaration of Principles.    He added: Our government was the first in Israel to accept  Resolution 242 as a basis for peace with Syria, entailing  withdrawal on the Golan [min fawq al-julan]. But Rabin added  that the geographic scale of the withdrawal cannot be specified  before Israel knows exactly what the Syrians mean by full peace.    Asked about the failure to implement the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement and the reason for the postponement, Rabin said: We  have not postponed negotiations. We are ready to continue the  talks indefinitely to reach an agreement that would achieve the  goals of the transitional stage, overcome opposition by  particular forces on both sides, achieve security for the  Israelis, and grant the Palestinian council the authority to  administer the Palestinian people's affairs.    Asked about ways to solve the problem of settlements, Rabin  said that the agreement is very clear: It provides that all the  settlements will stay where they are during the transitional  stage. The PLO signed this agreement and we will discuss the  settlements issue when we negotiate over the final solution.    Asked about negotiations with Jordan and Lebanon, Rabin  said:  We believed that we were close to an agreement with Jordan but,  regrettably, our efforts did not succeed. We have virtually no  territorial problems with Jordan. He stressed that Israel has  no territorial problems with Lebanon but there is a security  problem because the Lebanese Government cannot muster  sovereignty over all its territory. We do not covet one inch of  Lebanese territory and all that we hope is that the Lebanese  Government can disengage the private military organizations.    On the possibility of holding a meeting between him and  Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat, Rabin said: We must  prepare for such a meeting because if we meet and fail to sign  an agreement, our failure would cause disappointment and  frustration and defeat our purpose of reaching an agreement that  can be implemented.</p>

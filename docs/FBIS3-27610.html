The bed of the Hongze River is higher than the surrounding  areas as a result of silt caused by the overflowing of the  Yellow River in the past.    A 67.25-km-long dam has been built to prevent leakage of  water. The dam is five to nine meters higher than the ground  level.    According to Lu Senlin, director of the Hongze River  Harnessing Committee, the government has organized the local  people to dig and renovate irrigation ditches, dredge the mouth  of the Huaihe River, and build three major floodgates to allow  floodwaters to drain off at a rate of 11,800 cu m [cubic meters]  per second since the 1950s.    While diverting water to irrigate farmland, local people  have  made full use of the water resources.    A survey shows that the output of aquatic products amounted  to 71,000 tons last year, an increase of 4.7 times over 1985.</p>

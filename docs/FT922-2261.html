			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Family companies shine THE SHARES of family-controlled listed companies have outperformed the Financial Times All-Share Index by 30 per cent during the past 21 years, according to a survey published today by accountants Stoy Hayward. A Pounds 1 investment in 1970 in the 71 family companies in the survey would have grown to Pounds 11.11 by 1991 compared with Pounds 8.72 for an investment in the All-Share Index. Controlling family shareholders attributed that better performance to their ability to pursue consistent management objectives and take a long-term view. Family companies were less vulnerable to takeover bids and under less pressure to deliver short-term returns. Family businesses were defined as those where a family or family interests controlled 25 per cent of ordinary shares, but companies dominated by one individual were excluded. Three quarters of British companies are family-controlled. More than 40 per cent of the family companies surveyed achieved a more than 10-fold rise in their share price while seven companies achieved a 50-fold increase. Companies in which a family owned more than 40 per cent performed less well than those where the holding was smaller, the survey found. Family Business Index.

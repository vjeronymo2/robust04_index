			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROADS PANEL TO ACT TODAY ON NEW VENTURA FREEWAY LANES  </P> <P> If state transportation officials give their approval today, work could begin  as early as October on widening the heavily congested Ventura Freeway through  the heart of the San Fernando Valley, highway planners said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The $41.3-million widening project, which still might be held up if clean-air  crusaders follow through on a threat to sue, is to be considered by the  California Transportation Commission, which is meeting today in the northern  California city of Fremont.  </P> <P> Commissioners, who are appointed by the governor, are expected to approve the  project.  </P> <P> But the Coalition for Clean Air, which last year vowed to block the freeway  widening in court unless it was redesigned to include a "diamond lane"  restricted to vehicles with more than one occupant, will not decide until next  week whether to sue.  </P> <P> However, a spokeswoman for the Santa Monica-based organization indicated  Wednesday that the group's determination to sue seems to be wavering.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Issue Fought 2 Years Ago  </P> <P> "There's a feeling among some of our people that this issue was fought and lost  two years ago and ought not to be reopened," said Jan Chatten-Brown, president  of the coalition, which 11 months ago filed the legally required notice of  intent to sue Caltrans on the issue.  </P> <P> Caltrans planners say that redesigning the project to include a diamond lane  would take at least a year.  </P> <P> The 22-month project calls for the Ventura Freeway, which varies from 8 to 10  lanes, to be widened to a uniform 10 lanes from Topanga Canyon Boulevard in  Woodland Hills to Universal City and then south on the Hollywood Freeway to  Lankershim Boulevard.  </P> <P> To lessen the impact on the 277,000 vehicles that use the freeway daily, most  work would be done at night.  </P> <P> But many on- and off-ramps would be closed at different times, "inconveniencing  some motorists," said Mark Archuleta, Caltrans project engineer.  </P> <P> The new lanes would be created by shrinking the existing 12-foot-wide lanes by  one foot each and using the median.  </P> <P> The project has been delayed for years by a shortage of funds and by a fierce  debate over whether the new eastbound fifth lane should be a diamond lane.  </P> <P> The new westbound fifth lane was designated as a general-use lane from the  outset.  </P> <P> Caltrans initially promoted creation of an eastbound restricted-use lane as a  means to increase the freeway's capacity by inducing motorists to share rides.  </P> <P> Without such a restricted lane, Caltrans officials said, the freeway will  return to heavy congestion within a year or two after it is widened.  </P> <P> But in the face of 12,000 mailed protests, mostly from West Valley and Ventura  County residents, Caltrans in February, 1987, backed away and said the lane  would be open to all vehicles.  </P> <P> Since then, the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the Federal  Highway Administration have unsuccessfully sought to force Caltrans to include  a diamond lane in the project.  </P> <P> The clean air coalition contends that the federal Clean Air Act requires the  construction of 74 miles of diamond lanes, including a Ventura Freeway lane,  because the network is included in the region's 1979 Air Quality Management  Plan. The coalition has successfully sued regional agencies on clean-air issues  in the past.  </P> <P> Caltrans, which has three diamond lanes in California and is building or  studying more than a dozen others, contends that such lanes are needed because  the state has neither the money nor the room to expand existing freeways.  </P> <P> Critics contend that the lanes are unproven as a device for inducing motorists  to form car pools or ride buses, and that they are unfair to those who travel  at varying times and cannot share rides.  </P></p>

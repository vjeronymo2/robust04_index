			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: A GRILLING ON THE SUBJECT OF BARBECUING  </P> <P> There are more than a few places in this beautiful nation of ours where the  word barbecue -- no matter how you spell it: B-B-Q, Bar-B-Q, barbeque, barbecue  or just plain Q -- is more than a description of a cooking method,  much-much-more.  </P> <P> In North Carolina, the word is a noun, bar-be-cue; it means pork slow-cooked  over hickory or oak coals for hours. It means something similar in Memphis, at  least in May. In Texas, it's beef, usually beef brisket cooked long and slow,  not over but alongside mesquite coals. Mesquite burns hot and the secret of  Texas Q is to cook the meat with the smoke of the wood, not the heat of it.  </P> <P> We use a lot of mesquite in California, too, but there are those who would  argue (me among them) that what we do with it is not true barbecue, but rather  grilling, and there is a big difference. More on that a little later.  </P> <P> There is probably no place in the nation where barbecue in all of its forms is  better understood than in Kansas City, Mo. They even have a society there --  I'm a member -- the Kansas City Barbecue Society (KCBS), with its own  newsletter, "The Bull Sheet," to keep members " . . . up to date in Kansas  City" about what's new with barbecue.  </P> <P> The mouth-watering aroma of barbecue is in the air everywhere in Kansas City.  Kansas Citians in every neighborhood from downtown to the suburbs love to cook  out in almost any weather. When they can't cook out, they are very apt to "go  out" for B-B-Q. Bill Venable III (Wild Bill) lists 46 barbecue restaurant  locations in his book, "Kansas City Barbecue." He also sets us right on what is  and what is not barbecue:  </P> <P> "There are several types of outdoor cooking that seem to have been lumped into  the category of 'barbecue.' When you get home from work and you throw a steak  on the back yard cooker, some call this barbecuing. Let's set the record  straight, the aforementioned act is 'grilling.' When you cook anything outside  for a period of less than an hour, this is, again, grilling. When we cook a  chicken, brisket, or other larger piece of meat, it will take a little longer,  we'll use a lot cooler fire, and the sweet smell of smoke will penetrate the  meat. This, class, is 'barbecue.' "  </P> <P> Another "Pig Out Publication," the unofficial "bible" of the Kansas City  Barbecue Society, titled the Passion of Barbecue, organizes cookout recipes  according to "the Bone System." The "One Bone" section describes grilling  techniques and provides recipes for quick preparation. Sub-titled "Home by Five  -- Barbecue by Seven," it contains meat, poultry, and seafood recipes that take  from 15 minutes to an hour.  </P> <P> "Two Bone" creations require more time. Sub-titled "a Well-spent Afternoon,"  the recipes in this section require one to four hours of slow cooking in a  covered cooker.  </P> <P> "A Smoke Marathon" is the sub-title of the "Three Bone" section which contains  hard-core barbecue recipes for large cuts of meat that require 5 to 15 hours to  prepare.  </P> <P> If you are sincerely interested in barbecue cooking and/or eating, I recommend  that you become a member of KCBS. For more information and a membership  application (there are restrictions -- you must be at least sort of in favor of  general foolishness), contact the Kansas City Barbecue Society, 11514 Hickman  Mills Drive, Kansas City, Mo. 64134, (816) 765-5801.  </P> <P> The following is a "Two Bone" recipe for baby back ribs that is guaranteed to  have you smackin' your lips and smellin' of smoke.  </P> <P> BARBECUED PORK LOIN BABY BACK RIBS  </P> <P> 1 slab pork loin baby back ribs  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chicken stock  </P> <P> 1/2 cup soy sauce  </P> <P> 1/4 cup oil  </P> <P> 1/4 cup vinegar  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> Dry Spice Rub  </P> <P> Skin ribs. Remove thin membrane on bone side of slab so smoke can permeate  meat.  </P> <P> Combine chicken stock, soy sauce, oil, vinegar, sugar and garlic and mix well.  Add ribs and marinate in refrigerator 2 hours to overnight.  </P> <P> Remove ribs from marinade. Sprinkle with Dry Spice Rub. Cook over medium coals,  225 degrees until internal temperature registers 160 degrees on meat  thermometer, about 4 hours. Baste with marinade or sprinkle lightly with dry  seasoning every 30 minutes during cooking process. Makes 4 to 6 servings.  </P> <P> Dry Spice Rub  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon garlic powder  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons black pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon paprika  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon thyme  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon oregano  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon rosemary  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Combine garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne, paprika, thyme, oregano, rosemary  and salt.  </P></p>

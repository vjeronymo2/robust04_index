			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oil switch Enterprise Oil saw its share price fall below 400p as one securities house advised shareholders to switch their holdings into Lasmo ahead of the deadline for the former's hostile takeover bid. Enterprise shares were also unsettled by reports that the company might try to buy 10 per cent of Lasmo in the market next week if it feels it will be unable to acquire the necessary 50 per cent through straight acceptances. The company was fighting a strong rearguard action as its US roadshow wound down yesterday. A company spokesman said: 'We had quite a good reception from the US institutions and we go into the final week confident that we will win.' Hoare Govett said the bid had 'no real industrial or financial synergy' but recommended buying Lasmo because 'on a medium-term view Lasmo should outperform Enterprise if the bid fails'. Enterprise fell 14 to 399p while Lasmo was steady at 148p. Chemicals group Hickson International fell 13 to 160p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 2m shares in the wake of a swingeing forecast downgrade by Hoare Govett. The securities house cut its current year forecast by 20 per cent to Pounds 19m. The new figure is well below the previous range of analysts' forecasts of Pounds 24m to Pounds 29m. The change is believed to reflect concerns among institutional fund managers over the current trading outlook within the company. Chemicals group BOC was one of the few Footsie companies to remain in positive territory during the day as traders stressed the company's defensive qualities. However, the share price could not resist the final onslaught on the market and saw its gain of 3 trimmed back to close unchanged at 700p. Broker downgrades hit Cadbury Schweppes as analysts reacted to a cautious meeting with the drink and confectionery group's joint venture business with Coca-Cola. Cola wars with own-label goods topped the agenda and analysts reckoned on a hit to profits of up to Pounds 30m in the current year. Lehman Brothers lopped Pounds 15m from its current year forecast, down to Pounds 455m, while for 1995 its estimate was cut from Pounds 525m to Pounds 495m. NatWest Securities and Cazenove were also said to have reduced their forecasts. The shares slid 11 to 412 1/2 p. After weak sessions following Tuesday's profits warning, Hazlewood Foods rallied 4 to 129p on speculation of a bid from Unigate. The dairy company is said to be considering selling its stake in Dutch group Nutricia, which could net Unigate around Pounds 250m. The shares were steady at 366p. A Pounds 36.5m property deal provided some support for Ladbroke before the shares trailed off 3 to 156p. There was brief activity in Savoy with speculation over a new chairman. The shares jumped before falling to end the day steady at 965p. Thorn retreated 29 to 1014p on dollar worries. Euro Disney, the French theme park operator, lost 18 to 135p on concerns over the outcome of its recent rights issue. Airtours gained a penny ahead of results next week. Property agency Chesterton, which came to the market at 100p on Thursday, slipped a penny to 99p. The poor market trend curtailed an early advance in British Aerospace which followed reports that British Airways was to buy Airbus jets. The shares closed 10 lower at 445p. BAe builds the wings of the Airbus aircraft and is a 20 per cent stake holder in the Airbus consortium. The press report that BA plans to replace its entire fleet of short-haul Boeing 737 with Airbus jets, left shares in the UK carrier trailing 13 to 374p. The weak dollar exacted a toll on engineering group Siebe which derives a large part of its earnings from the US. The shares fell 18 to 516p. Rolls-Royce gave up 7 to 174p, in trade of 4.9m with Strauss Turnbull said to have urged investors to 'sell' the stock. Eurotunnel firmed 2 to 280p, with dealers encouraged by news that most of the outstanding stock from the company's Pounds 858m rights issue had been successfully placed.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mayflower more than trebles to Pounds 5.38m Mayflower Corporation, the specialist automotive engineering group, reported pre-tax profits more than tripled from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 5.38m in the year to end-December. Operating profits from continuing operations before acquisitions rose by 58 per cent to Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 3.6m), while total operating profits increased by 47 per cent to Pounds 5.2m. Mayflower has grown rapidly since 1991 following the acquisition in that year of Motor Panels and the purchase last year of International Automotive Design (IAD). The group is now established in both the UK and the US as an integrated design, engineering and production operation for truck cabs and low-volume specialist car bodies. Group turnover jumped by 50 per cent to Pounds 102m (Pounds 67.8m). Sales from continuing operations rose by 16.4 per cent to Pounds 74.6m (Pounds 64.1m) and Pounds 26.1m was added through acquisitions. Earnings per share more than doubled to 2.59p, and a final dividend of 0.9p is proposed raising the total for the year to 1.35p (1.25p). IAD, which was acquired from the receiver, has been extensively restructured and achieved profits of Pounds 257,000 in the eight months from April on a turnover of Pounds 24m. The IAD workforce worldwide has been reduced from about 1,000 to 650, including 200 contract staff. The lossmaking IAD subsidiary in France has been sold, while in the UK the main IAD operation in Worthing, West Sussex, has been sold to Daewoo Motor, the South Korean car maker. Daewoo paid about Pounds 1m for plant and equipment from IAD, which continues to hold project contracts with the new owner. At home IAD has opened offices in Essex and Coventry, and has recently won new contracts from Ford and Saab. Group turnover and pre-tax profits are expected to continue to rise strongly in the next couple of years as new contracts are brought into operation including: The supply of bodies for the Aston Martin DB7 luxury sports car to be launched this summer; The supply of bodies for the new MG sports car to be launched by the Rover group in the summer of 1995; The development and manufacture of cabs for a series of trucks for Ford in the US, which could be worth more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 205m) over a 15-year period. The engineering and prototype programme for the MG sports car, code-named PR3, has been completed, and Motor Panels is currently installing the assembly facility. It is investing Pounds 24.2m in the project. Mayflower is forecasting annual sales of Pounds 1.5m from the Aston Martin contract, Pounds 20m from the MG contract starting next year, and Pounds 14m from the Ford US truck contract. Mr John Simpson, Mayflower's chief executive, said the group had 'healthy order books' and could expect a period of 'strong organic growth.' It continued to look for acquisitions, he added.</p>

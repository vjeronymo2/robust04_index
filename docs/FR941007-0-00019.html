			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Intending immigrants who could not meet the adjustment requirements have been obliged to leave the country and apply for an immigrant visa at a United States consulate or embassy abroad. They then were immediately eligible for admission as lawful permanent residents upon returning to the United States. By virtue of the requirements of sections 245(a) and 245(c) of the Act, these persons were putatively required to leave the United States and United States consuls abroad have been burdened with immigrant visa issuance that would not otherwise have been necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Public Law 103&hyph;317 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 506(b) of the Department of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1995, Pub. L. 103&hyph;317, was enacted August 26, 1994. It temporarily lifts many of the restrictions on adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act on applications filed on or after October 1, 1994, although it does not affect persons adjusting under other sections of law. This law adds a new section 245(i) to the Act, which allows a person who is physically present in the United States and would otherwise have been eligible for immigrant visa issuance abroad, to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident under section 245 of the Act. Applicants may be subject to a financial penalty, since the law requires most persons seeking adjustment of status under the new law to pay an additional sum in excess of the standard adjustment of status filing fee. The provisions of the new section 245(i) of the Act cease to have effect on October 1, 1997. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Persons Who Remain Ineligible To Adjust Status <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 245(i) of the Act does not waive all requirements for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act. An applicant must be eligible for immigrant classification and have an immediately available immigrant visa number through a qualifying family or employment relationship, or other means. The person must also show that he or she is not included in any of the classes of persons listed in section 212 of the Act who cannot be admitted to the United States, or must show that any basis for excludability has been waived. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 245(i) of the Act also does not waive several other grounds of ineligibility for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act. An applicant seeking adjustment as an immediate relative of a United States citizen or as a preference alien, but who is not the beneficiary of a valid unexpired visa petition, remains ineligible for adjustment. A person who is currently a lawful permanent resident also continues to be ineligible for adjustment. An applicant who was admitted to the United States as a K&hyph;1 fiance(e) but did not marry the United States citizen who filed the petition, or who was admitted as the K&hyph;2 child of a fiance(e) parent who did not marry the United States citizen who filed the petition, is also barred from adjusting status under section 245 of the Act. A person who is seeking adjustment based on a marriage entered into while the applicant was under deportation, exclusion, or related judicial proceedings may not adjust status, unless the person provides clear and convincing evidence of a bona fide marriage or has resided outside the United States for two or more years after the marriage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Payment of Additional Sum <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This temporary adjustment provision continues to encourage intending immigrants who are abroad to comply with the immigrant visa issuance requirements, by making adjustment of status under the new provision much more expensive than immigrant visa issuance abroad. Most applicants for the new benefit will be required to pay the standard adjustment of status filing fee, plus an additional sum of five times the standard filing fee. Thus, persons currently applying for adjustment of status under the provisions of the new section 245(i) of the Act must pay the standard filing fee of $130.00, plus an additional sum of $650.00, for a total of $780.00. Any future modifications of the standard adjustment of status filing fee will change the amount of the additional sum, as well as the total cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

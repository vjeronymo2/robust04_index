			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN SPENDING CAP PUT ON HOLD  </P> <P> The Oxnard City Council will wait until after the November election to discuss  voluntary limits on campaign spending, despite objections from one member.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Dorothy Maron proposed that council members informally agree to  place limits on how much they spend on their election campaigns.  </P> <P> But City Atty. Gary L. Gillig, who researched the issue for the council, said  that although state and federal laws limit campaign contributions, laws  limiting spending are unconstitutional because they violate the First  Amendment.  </P> <P> Candidates could agree to limit how much they spend on their races, but the  council could not penalize candidates who do not want to participate, Gillig  said.  </P> <P> Maron suggested limiting spending to 50 cents per voter or about $23,000 per  campaign but was less adamant about the actual amount than about the need for a  limit.  </P> <P> She said the council should establish the limit now to exert political pressure  on challengers to spend less.  </P> <P> But Councilman Manuel Lopez questioned whether council members should speak for  potential candidates.  </P> <P> "How can we make an agreement for someone we don't know is running?" Lopez  said.  </P> <P> Mayor Nao Takasugi, whose campaign budget in 1988 exceeded $68,000, opposed  setting up regulations for other candidates and said campaign reform should be  made by an outside citizens committee.  </P> <P> "I will not give up my constitutional right to what I can do to keep my seat in  office," Takasugi said.  </P> <P> Maron questioned whether candidates can ethically vote on issues when they have  received donations from people supporting those issues.  </P> <P> "Are they voting their conscience or are they voting their debt?" Maron asked.  </P> <P> Although official announcements have not been made, Maron is expected to run  for mayor in November. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Air Products in further charge Air Products and Chemicals, the US industrial gases group which last week took a Dollars 60m after-tax charge in its second quarter to cover losses on five derivatives contracts, is to absorb an additional Dollars 9m charge in the next quarter to cover the cost of closing out the contracts. The Pennsylvania-based group said it terminated the interest rate swap contracts to reduce the company's earnings exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Air Products is the fourth US company to take a charge against its earnings this year because of problems with derivatives sold by Bankers Trust, the New York bank.</p>

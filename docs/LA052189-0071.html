			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: 4 WORLD PREMIERES ON S.F. BALLET SEASON  </P> <P> Four world premieres, a new, full-length "Sleeping Beauty," and the U.S.  premiere of a work by the late Kirov choreographer, Leonid Jakobson, are  highlights of the 1990 spring season of San Francisco Ballet, recently  announced by Helgi Tomasson, artistic director of the Bay City troupe. This  57th consecutive subscription season by the company opens Jan. 27 and ends May  6; performances are again scheduled in War Memorial Opera House.  </P> <P> Tomasson's new "Sleeping Beauty" production, to be designed by Jens-Jacob  Worsaae, who collaborated with Tomasson on the company's 1987 "Swan Lake," will  be unveiled March 13. Brand-new works in the season will be choreographed by  Lisa de Ribere, Brenda Way, David Bintley and Val Caniparoli, the ballet's  resident dance maker. Jakobson's "Rodin," being seen in this country for the  first time, will be danced at performances beginning April 11.  </P> <P> Also listed on the eight repertory programs: Balanchine's "Serenade,"  Tomasson's "Menuetto" and "Variations de Ballet," the collaboration (1960) of  Balanchine and Lew Christensen.  </P> <P> Announced at the same time is San Francisco Ballet's first engagement at the  Orange County Performing Arts Center, Oct. 17-22, 1989.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Joffrey's '89-'90 season is due to be announced Monday. Stay  tuned.  </P> <P> BRUHN PRIZE: Announced just five days before the final competition, the  decision of American Ballet Theatre not to send dancers to the just-concluded  International Competition for the Erik Bruhn Prize in Toronto, seemed to  discombobulate the annual contest, which draws its talent from only four  companies: ABT, National Ballet of Canada, Royal Ballet, and Royal Danish  Ballet.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, with only six (instead of eight) finalists in contention, the  judges chose Silja Wendrup-Schandorff of the Royal Danish Ballet and Stephen  Legate of the National Ballet of Canada for the top prizes: $6,000 to each  dancer, plus a statuette.  </P> <P> Wendrup-Schandorff, 20, performed the pas de deux from Balanchine's "Agon" and  a new work, "Hommage a Bournonville," with Henning Albrechtsen of the Royal  Danish Ballet.  </P> <P> Legate danced the pas de deux from Marius Petipa's "Le Corsaire" and the second  movement of Glen Tetley's "Sphinx" with Jennifer Fournier, another National  Ballet dancer.  </P> <P> The other competitors were Belinda Hatley and Sergiu Pobereznic of Britain's  Royal Ballet.  </P> <P> The week before the competition, Mikhail Baryshnikov, artistic director of ABT,  sent word that "there are no suitable candidates in the designated age category  (18-23) that are currently available to compete." Robert Pontarelli, speaking  for ABT last week, told The Times he felt that statement needed no elaboration.  </P> <P> About ABT's nonparticipation in the 1989 competition, Celia Franca, founder of  National Ballet of Canada, which hosts the contest, said: "We sincerely hope  they will join us in the future."  </P> <P> The late Erik Bruhn left funds to establish the prize in a codicil to his will.  He specified the competitors be a male and female dancer between the ages of 18  and 23 and come from four companies with which he was closely associated -- the  National Ballet of Canada, the Royal Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet and American  Ballet Theatre. Bruhn was artistic director of National Ballet of Canada for  the three years before his death in 1986.  </P> <P> COMPOSERS: Ed Applebaum, since 1971 on the faculty of UC Santa Barbara, will  this summer move to Florida Strate University in Tallahassee , where he will  serve as professor of composition and director of the New Music Ensemble. . . .  Jeffrey Rockwell will write the music, J. Sherwood Montgomery the libretto, for  "Rip van Winkle," an opera for children commissioned by San Diego Opera on the  occasion of its 25th anniversary. The world premiere of "Rip van Winkle" is  scheduled in October . . . A roster of 15 composers will meet in the mountains  of Colorado, Aug. 18-20 for Composer-to-Composer, a three-day gathering "for  discussions, demonstrations and performances of new work and work-in-progress."  The composers are Ricardo dal Farra, Jin Hi Kim, Louis Andriessen, Joan La  Barbara, John Cage, Anthony Davis, Tom Johnson, Tania Leon, Annea Lockwood,  Steve Reich, Morton Subotnick, Trimpin, Walter Zimmerman, Julio Estrada and  Conlon Nancarrow.  </P> <P> AND OTHER PEOPLE: Kate Tamarkin has been appointed associate conductor of the  Dallas Symphony. A 1978 graduate of Chapman College in Orange, Tamarkin also  holds degrees from universities in Illinois and Maryland. . . . Frank Augustyn,  longtime principal dancer of National Ballet of Canada, will become artistic  director of the nine-year-old Theatre Ballet of Canada, the small (budget under  $1 million), Ottawa-based company which gives 55 performances annually, on July  1. . . . Richard Bradshaw, formerly resident conduct at San Francisco Opera  (1977-87), has been appointed chief conductor of Canadian Opera in Toronto. . .  . Violinist Andres Cardenes, who has been active as a free-lance concertmaster  on the West Coast, and has served on university faculties in Indiana and Utah,  will become permanent concertmaster of the Pittsburgh Symphony beginning in  August. Cardenes, a native of Cuba trained in this country, has been guest  concertmaster of the Pittsburgh orchestra in 1988-89.  </P> <P> CORRECTION: Contrary to information published in this space last Sunday, the  two operas to be performed by the touring Alexander Spendarian State Opera of  Armenia at the Wiltern Theatre five times this week will not be receiving U.S.  premieres. Armen Tigranian's "Anoush" has previously been produced in Southern  California, as well as around the nation. About Dikran Tchoukhadjian's "Arshak  II," records are inconclusive -- but chances are it has been performed on the  West Coast. What is incontrovertible is that the troupe's recent productions of  these works are new to our eyes. More information: (213) 465-6168.  </P></p>

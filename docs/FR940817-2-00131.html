Cappelli, M.D. (Respondent), of Los Angeles, California, proposing to revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, BC2901230, as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). Specifically, the Order to Show Cause alleged that between January 1992 and February 1993, Respondent allowed an unauthorized person to order controlled substances by permitting this person to use Respondent's DEA number; this person also used Respondent's DEA number to issue unauthorized prescriptions during this time period in question; this person used the controlled substances obtained in this manner to perform unlawful abortions, one of which resulted in the death of one of the patients; and Respondent dispensed controlled substances at an unregistered location during the time period in question. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Order to Show Cause was sent to Respondent by registered mail. More than thirty days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was received by Respondent and the DEA has received no response thereto. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d) and 1301.54(e), Respondent is deemed to have waived his opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator now enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based upon the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In January of 1993, the Santa Ana Police Department discovered the body of a female in an alley, at or near a medical clinic, the Clinica Femenina (clinic). Subsequent investigation revealed that the death of the female was caused by a failed abortion attempt performed at the clinic by the owner who was not authorized to practice medicine (and thus not licensed to perform abortions) in the State of California. An autopsy revealed that diazepam, a Schedule IV controlled substance, was in the deceased's system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A search warrant was served on the clinic by the Santa Ana Police Department on January 21, 1993. The search revealed that the owner had ordered over 8,000 dosage units of controlled substances using Respondent's DEA number. The search also revealed that the owner issued prescriptions for various controlled substances using Respondent's DEA number. The clinic was not Respondent's DEA registered location and, in fact, did not have a DEA registration. The owner was subsequently arrested by the Santa Ana police and charged with manslaughter and the matter is pending trial at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Shortly after the search warrant was served, Respondent was interviewed by the Santa Ana police and an investigator of the California Medical Board. Respondent admitted to them that he allowed the clinic to use his DEA registration number to order controlled substances to obtain drugs used in conjunction with abortions. Respondent explained that he was hired to perform abortions on an as needed basis and was paid $80 for each abortion. He performed an abortion about once a week or every other week. He was aware that the owner was not a licensed physician. He was not aware that the owner had issued controlled substance prescriptions using his DEA number. Respondent also noted that there were occasions that the owner called him to perform an abortion on short notice but that Respondent was unable to make the appointment. When Respondent inquired of the owner how the operation had been performed, she simply explained that the patient ``had been taken care of''. Respondent also explained that the owner had witnessed him perform abortions on numerous occasions and that she could probably perform the operation, barring any unforeseen complications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In evaluating whether Respondent's registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration would be inconsistent with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator considers the factors enumerated in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). They are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

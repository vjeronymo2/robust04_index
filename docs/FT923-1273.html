			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Battle lines drawn among Serb leaders THE United Nations decision to exclude the rump Yugoslav federation from the UN general assembly will sharpen divisions inside Serbia and could decide the fate of Prime Minister Milan Panic, his advisers said yesterday. The resolution went through late on Tuesday night by an overwhelming majority in the general assembly. Its aim is to put pressure on the Belgrade government to end its support of Serbian militia forces fighting Moslem forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina and to co-operate with UN and European Community efforts in bringing peace. The resolution made clear that Belgrade must reapply to the UN if it wants membership of the general assembly. Mr Panic, who earlier this week pleaded with western governments in New York not to 'undermine a man of peace', faces renewed criticism from hard-line Serb nationalists who call the Californian businessman a 'traitor' and a 'CIA spy'. Behind criticism levelled at Mr Panic in the socialist-dominated federal parliament, and on television still controlled by Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, the political battle lines are being drawn between the two men. On Mr Panic's side is General Zivota Panic, army chief of staff; the fractured urban democratic opposition; and young entrepreneurs. So far, the military has supported Mr Panic in the belief he can turn the army into a professional body. Mr Milosevic, now rarely seen in public, is flanked by Mr Vojislav Seselj, leader of the far right-wing radical party, state-run factory managers, and the rural community. Earlier this week, Mr Seselj accused Mr Panic of manipulating the army into agreeing to the UN peace plan to withdraw its forces from Prevlaka, a large strategic military base on Croatia's Dalmatian coast. In this way Mr Seselj hopes to win over a section of the army. Sandwiched between the two sides is Mr Dobrica Cosic, a respected writer and president of Yugoslavia. Once Mr Milosevic's mentor - he drew up the blueprint for a greater Serbia in 1986 - Mr Cosic now believes the Milosevic policies have brought shame and ruin to the Serbian people. By throwing his authority behind Mr Panic, Mr Cosic hopes this will attract public support, isolate Mr Milosevic and lead to lifting of sanctions. But Mr Seselj and his nationalist supporters are determined to use Mr Panic's failure to get sanctions lifted, or to prevent Yugoslavia from being excluded from the UN general assembly, as a means of ousting the prime minister. Mr Panic is gaining grudging support inside Serbia, largely because more Serbs believe there is no practical alternative to him. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said yesterday there was no need to renew the mandate for the UN peacekeeping force in his republic when it expires next March, Reuter reports from the UN. More than 13,000 UN troops are stationed in parts of Croatia with large Serb populations. More UN soldiers, including up to 1,800 from Britain, are being sent to neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina. Croatian authorities want the UN force to quit the republic so they can exercise sovereignty over the areas where the force is based, according to one official at the UN.</p>

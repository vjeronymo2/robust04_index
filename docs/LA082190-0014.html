			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DASCENZO HELPS CUBS EXTEND REDS' SLUMP TO FIVE  </P> <P> Doug Dascenzo got three hits and robbed Paul O'Neill of a two-run homer Monday  night as the visiting Chicago Cubs handed Cincinnati its fifth consecutive  loss, beating the Reds, 3-1, in a game called in the ninth inning because of  rain.  </P> <P> The Reds, swept at home in a four-game series by Pittsburgh during the weekend,  had their lead cut to 5 1/2 games over the Dodgers, who beat the Philadelphia  Phillies, 2-1.  </P> <P> Cincinnati Manager Lou Piniella was furious when the game finally was called  after three delays totaling 3 hours, 12 minutes.  </P> <P> "I wasn't even informed," Piniella said. "It was a very irresponsible action,  as far as I am concerned -- extremely irresponsible.  </P> <P> "We're talking about a 3-1 ballgame where we have a chance to come up in the  bottom of the ninth and win a ballgame," he said. "There's no excuse for  something like that, and the league office will hear about it tomorrow."  </P> <P> Dascenzo was the hero for Chicago, going three for three with a double, a run  batted in, a walk and two stolen bases.  </P> <P> In the third inning, with the score 1-1, Dascenzo reached over the center-field  fence to catch O'Neill's drive.  </P> <P> Cub pitcher Mike Bielecki (5-8) gave up three hits in seven innings for his  first victory as a starter since May 27. In his previous 12 starts he was 0-5.  Norm Charlton (9-7) was the loser.  </P> <P> The Cubs got an unearned run in the second when Shawon Dunston got an infield  single, stole second, went to third on shortstop Barry Larkin's two-out error  and scored on Dascenzo's single.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 7, Houston 1 -- Neal Heaton pitched six shutout innings to gain his  first victory since June 24, and Gary Redus hit a two-run homer to lead the  Pirates at home.  </P> <P> The victory, coupled with the New York Mets' 3-1 loss to San Diego, gives  Pittsburgh a three-game lead in the National League East, its biggest since  June 22.  </P> <P> Heaton ended his six-game losing streak as the Pirates (72-49), 23 games over  .500 for the first time since 1979, matched their longest winning streak of the  season -- six in a row.  </P> <P> The Pirates, coming off a weekend four-game sweep in Cincinnati, took a 4-0  lead in the first inning against Jim Deshaies (5-11) to help Heaton (11-8) end  his losing streak.  </P> <P> Heaton, making his 200th major league start, gave up three hits, struck out  three and walked two. The losing streak matched the longest of his nine-year  career.  </P> <P> San Francisco 4, Montreal 2 -- Don Robinson pitched a four-hitter, Will Clark  hit his 16th homer and Kevin Mitchell drove in two runs to lead the Giants at  home.  </P> <P> Robinson (9-4) ended a personal three-game losing streak with his third  complete game of the season and first by a Giant since Trevor Wilson beat the  Dodgers Aug. 4. He struck out seven and walked one.  </P> <P> Montreal, losing its fourth of five games, dropped nine games behind Pittsburgh  in the National League East.  </P> <P> Kevin Gross (8-10) lost his sixth consecutive decision, matching the longest  skid of his career. He is winless in 10 starts since a 5-0 victory over  Philadelphia June 11.  </P> <P> Clark's homer was only his second in 157 at-bats.  </P> <P> San Diego 3, New York 1 -- Bruce Hurst pitched seven shutout innings and  Roberto Alomar homered as the Padres beat the Mets at San Diego, dropping the  Mets three games behind in the National League East. New York has lost six of  its last nine games.  </P> <P> Hurst (8-8) gave up five hits, struck out seven and walked four before Craig  Lefferts got his 20th save.  </P> <P> Darryl Strawberry opened the Mets' ninth with his 28th home run, tying for the  league lead with Bobby Bonilla and Ryne Sandberg. The Mets got another hit off  Lefferts, but could not score again.  </P> <P> Sid Fernandez (8-10) gave up two runs on two hits in six innings. He struck out  eight and walked one.  </P> <P> Jack Clark tripled to lead off the Padres' second and scored on Benito  Santiago's sacrifice fly. Alomar started the sixth with his fourth home run of  the season to give San Diego a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> St. Louis 7, Atlanta 2 -- Ken Hill pitched a six-hitter and Rex Hudler got  three hits and drove in three runs as the Cardinals defeated the Braves at St.  Louis.  </P> <P> Hill (4-1) won his third consecutive decision. He struck out six, walked two  and retired 10 batters in a row before Dave Justice hit his 19th home run to  lead off the seventh.  </P> <P> Hudler, making his first start in six games since sustaining a bruised  shoulder, had a two-run single in a four-run first inning, singled in the third  and fifth and had an RBI groundout in the seventh. In his last nine starts,  Hudler is batting .419 (18 for 43).  </P> <P> Tom Glavine (6-10) gave up six runs and seven hits in four innings to lose his  fourth consecutive decision. He is winless in his last seven starts.  </P> <P> Justice's home run gave him 11 in his last 16 games. He is 26 for 65 with 23  RBIs in 17 games since Aug. 5, the day after the Braves traded Dale Murphy to  Philadelphia. Justice leads major league rookies in home runs.  </P></p>

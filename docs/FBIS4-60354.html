			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 May (MENA)--AL-AHRAM newspaper reports  that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the  region this week was highlighted by the considerable change in  Syrian and Israeli stands regarding a peaceful settlement. It  notes the clear discussions regarding Israeli withdrawal from  the Golan Heights and the possibilities of normalizing  Syrian-Israeli relations in the future.    AL-AHRAM's editorial for tomorrow, Saturday 21 May, says  that  the current talk on the many differences between the stands of  the two sides is only natural with such complex and intricate  negotiations. It notes that on the other hand, this means  negotiations now address many of the detailed issues and are not  merely confined to generalities and principles that govern the  negotiations process.    AL-AHRAM affirms that Egyptian-U.S. efforts will continue to  provide hope for moving the Syrian-Israeli course along and  clearly pushing it forward despite all appearances to the  contrary.</p>

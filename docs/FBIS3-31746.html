			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The Hungarian Government's controversial  decision to incorporate the army's high command into the Defense  Ministry was an unexpected development, indicated journalist  Akos Tomory in the 22 January issue of the weekly HETI  VILAGGAZDASAG (HVG). Tomory said that the merger was announced  in January, shortly after the National Assembly passed the new  defense law by a vast majority, because the government wanted to  "strike while the iron is hot" and take full advantage of the  stipulation in the new law that gives the defense minister the  authority "to develop the high command of the army." Although  the law does not specifically call for the merger, the  government's view, Tomory said, was that the "six-party  consensus" on the law--forged during two years of difficult  interparty negotiations--provides a broad-based mandate for the  reorganization. The move is the latest "in a series of  successes," Tomory said, for the political leadership of the  Defense Ministry, which took an active part in negotiating the  defense law and managed to "reach a consensus with the military  policy experts of the parliamentary parties without having to  give in" on key points relating to the authority of the Defense  Ministry.    The government's plan, according to statements made to HVG  by  Rudolf Joo, administrative state secretary in the Defense  Ministry, calls for two major divisions within the Defense  Ministry: a "civil service-state administration department,  which is headed by the administrative state secretary," and a  separate "department consisting of the officers of the ex-army  command." The latter, according to Joo, will be headed by the  highest-ranking officer, who will have the rank of state  secretary and will be subordinate to the defense minister. Thus,  Tomory commented, "two parallel hierarchies seem to be  developing within the Defense Ministry, which will have a  civilian character by virtue of the fact that the minister of  defense holds the two halves together."    The article reports that in some quarters the plan has been  received with considerable skepticism. The government's goal of  "ending parallel commands" and "strengthening civilian control  over the military" could be "self-defeating," critics claim,  because it creates the "danger" that "the ministry will be  militarized." In fact, Tomory reported, according to some  military "experts" who "do not wish to be named," it is not even  clear "which organization is being incorporated into the other  one." Moreover, in the opinion of these critics, the plan to  have two separate organizational departments within the Defense  Ministry will be difficult to work out in practice. "At the  moment, it is not even possible to know what kind of subordinate  and supervisory relations might develop between the  civil-service civilian employees and those transferred from the  military command." It appears that "one-half to two-thirds of  the employees of the new Ministry of Defense (presently 320  employees work in the Ministry of Defense while 800 work at Army  Headquarters) would stick out of the usual ministerial  hierarchy."    While the restructuring details are unclear, it is certain  that the merger enables the government to get rid of high-level  holdovers from the communist-era military command. The  government has already announced, Tomory reported, that the  present commander of the army, Colonel-General Kalman Lorincz,  will be retired as soon as he reaches the minimum retirement age  of 55 this month--thus ending the controversy that erupted two  years ago over whether or not the government has the right to  fire him. According to State Secretary Joo, Tomory reported, one  proof of the "correctness" of the merger is that it facilitates  the personnel changes that the former communists want to avoid.  The Hungarian Socialist Party--which is a successor of the  formerly ruling communist party and which has a chance of  winning the May election--is the one party that wants military  leadership changes to take place "only after the next election,"  Joo asserted.</p>

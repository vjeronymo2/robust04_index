			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Heinz Vielain: "Number of First Drugs Consumers </F> Increases By 20 Percent"]    [Text] Bonn -- The number of narcotics addicts in Germany  is growing, the Federal Government reports. The number of first  consumers of drugs increased to 4,538 between January and May.  That is 20.4 percent up on the same period last year.    The government's drug expert, State Secretary Eduard  Lintner,  told WELT AM SONNTAG that in the first five months of 1994, 643  people were killed by drugs. He warned against "misinterpreting  the Karlsruhe ruling on liberalizing small amounts of drugs for  personal use."    Lintner fears that "the danger of a clear increase in  consumption will be played down if prosecution is predictable."  From the beginning of January to the end of May, 566 kg of  heroin were seized in Germany. In addition, authorities seized  246 kg of cocaine, 1,540 kg of cannabis, 125 kg of marijuana, 45  kg of amphetamines, and 7,121 LSD doses.    Asked about the ongoing discussion about small amounts of  hashish or marijuana for personal consumption going unpunished,  the drugs expert said: "Guidelines that clearly determine small  amounts in absolute figures lead to prosecutions also being  predictable for dealers and their instigators." Dealers could  disguise themselves as consumers of small amounts. That way  they could easily evade the police.    Since North Rhine-Westphalia's SPD [Social Democratic Party]  government decided in May to liberalize the possession of small  amounts of heroin, cocaine, and other narcotics, Federal Health  Minister Seehofer (Christian Democratic Union--CDU) has examined  whether the narcotics law needs to be amended. An additional  struggle among the parties can be expected, because Frankfurt's  SPD Mayor Andreas von Schoeler wants to have the courts  decontrol the possession of heroin for heavy addicts.    On the activities in Frankfurt, which is governed by a  red-green alliance, the parliamentary manager of the CDU/CSU  [Christian Social Union], Juergen Ruettgers, told WELT AM  SONNTAG: "Liberalization of heroin means giving the go-ahead for  the drugs mafia in Frankfurt; with Frankfurt a city that has  almost 10,000 drug addicts, of whom some 5,000 are consumers of  hard drugs. With 146,000 criminal offenses a year, Frankfurt is  a stronghold of crime in Germany."</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BET OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> FOOD;  </P> <P> DRY-CURED FOR THE HOLIDAYS  </P> <P> CHAMPAGNE, CAVIAR and silky, smoked salmon are the little black dress and  pearls of luxurious entertaining. The caviar and the bubbly are easy to get,  but finding that perfect piece of smoked salmon can be tricky.  </P> <P> Now, just in time for the holidays, there's smoked salmon, one of L'Ermitage's  signature dishes, which is made at the restaurant in a custom-built  cold-smoker.  </P> <P> Chef Michel Blanchet starts with whole fresh Norwegian salmon, filets it and  then dry-cures the fish in a mixture of sea salt and fresh herbs. "When you  dry-cure salmon, the texture is a lot nicer," he says. "Most salmon is  brine-cured, and the texture is a little mushier. When you dry-cure, you lose a  little weight because of the water that comes out, but you gain a lot in  quality." The salmon is then cold-smoked in a combination of hardwood sawdust,  bay leaves, rosemary and thyme sprigs. The result ($18 a pound) is one of those  perfect, simple dishes -- a piece of fish that is as buttery smooth as it is  flavorful.  </P> <P>  L'Ermitage Restaurant, 730 N. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles; (213)  652-5840.RUSS PARSONS  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Mexico City, 16 Jan (AFP) -- The political and  military situation in southern Mexico this Sunday remains  unchanged in anticipation of the guerrillas' reply to the  government's dialogue proposal, which, according to rebel  leaders, could happen "very soon."    In interviews published by local media today, "Major Mario"  of the Zapatist National Liberation Front (EZLN) announced that  he will reply to the official dialogue proposal and will respect  the unilateral truce decreed by the government. "We are  respecting the cease fire. We will not attack the government,  but we will respond if they come to harass us," Major Mario  asserted. Mario is a 21- year-old Tzeital Indian who spoke to  a group of reporters "somewhere in the Lacandona jungle" in  Chiapas state.    The rebel chieftain asserted that "very soon the EZLN Indian  Clandestine Committee will answer the government," although "we  will not stop the war" until the 10 conditions presented by the  guerrillas have been met, including a total cease-fire, a halt  to the bombing, and official recognition of the EZLN as a  belligerent force.

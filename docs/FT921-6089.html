			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Arcadian Intl achieves sharp reduction in losses ARCADIAN International, the property development company formed by Mr Robert Breare and Mr Jeremy Priestley, who built up Parkdale Holdings in the late 1980s, reduced its pre-tax loss from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 592,000 in the six months to October 31. Arcadian, which reversed into Westminster and Country Properties in 1990 and then raised Pounds 5.5m in a rights issue to buy Smithfield Developments, has been selling its commercial property portfolio and setting up leisure developments in France, Spain, Italy and the UK. It is chaired by Sir Peter Parker, as was Parkdale. Turnover fell to Pounds 2.41m (Pounds 8.4m) as a result of the disposals. The operating loss was Pounds 445,000. Mr Breare said operating costs would be covered once it obtained equity partners and other funding for its projects, for which it receives management fees. The main one remaining to be financed was a resort near Euro Disney, outside Paris. Net debt currently stood at Pounds 900,000, gearing of about 14 per cent. This followed a Pounds 2m convertible preference share issue. Mr Breare said no account had been taken so far of the increased value of the sites. Losses per share were 6.7p (16.8p).</p>

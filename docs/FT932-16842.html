			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / The news isn't all bad: New faces at the top of ITN indicate that the news service is emerging from a difficult period If Independent Television News were a manufacturer of dustbins, bicycles or tomato ketchup rather than an award-winning British news organisation, there is little doubt that the receivers would have been summoned two years ago. Its costs were clearly out of control. Some industry observers even talked of a 'black hole' in the accounts as losses mounted. There were unfortunate diversifications into computers and property. And ITN's shareholders found it almost impossible to agree on what action to take to arrest the slide. Although the survival of the company was not in doubt, and the quality of its journalism did not suffer, the company was forced into a difficult and often painful restructuring from which it only now appears to be emerging. On Monday, ITN's flagship programme, News At Ten, will be able to report: The formal appointment of a new ITN chief executive, Mr David Gordon, chief executive of The Economist magazine; The completion of an ownership restructuring and the arrival of new shareholders including Reuters and Carlton Communications, which took over the London weekday franchise from Thames Television; The completion of a news-supply contract with Channel 4, which adds to the five-year Pounds 268m deal signed in December with ITV; An outline of ITN's strategy as a profit-making business. Until recently, ITN, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the ITV network, has provided a news service without being expected to make a profit. ITN's transition is best symbolised by the changing faces at the top of the organisation. Sir David Nicholas, the supreme television journalist, handed over his chief executive's role in 1991 to Mr Bob Phillis, who began the process of cutting costs and making ITN more commercial. This task will now be taken forward by Mr Gordon, who is both a former journalist and a businessman. When he arrived at ITN, Mr Phillis - the new deputy director-general of the BBC - inherited a Pounds 10m overspend. During his two-year tenure he was forced to cut staff from 1,100 to 650. 'Bob Phillis has done an effective job in stabilising ITN and reducing costs,' says Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central Independent Television and an existing director of ITN who will also be a board member of the restructured company. The pressure for change was a direct result of the 1990 Broadcasting Act, which required ITN to sell off 51 per cent of its shares to non-broadcasters by the end of next year. The franchise round, when ITV licences were put out to competitive tender in 1991, increased instability when three ITN shareholders - Thames, TVS and Television - lost their franchises. When their successors - Carlton, Meridian and Westcountry - took over, they found that losses on the lease of ITN's London headquarters were running at the rate of about Pounds 5m a year. The ITV companies had hoped to make a profit by letting out unused floors in the Gray's Inn Road building. Instead, with the collapse in the commercial property market, most remained empty. In response to this potential crisis, Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications who takes over as chairman of ITN, put together a four-member consortium to take over the group - Carlton, Central, London Weekend Television and Reuters. They were later joined by Granada, Anglia and Scottish Television. Members of the consortium hope that the restructuring, with the possible addition of a US network as a minority shareholder, will be enough to make the government waive the 51 per cent requirement. The consortium not only made a commitment of Pounds 30m to fund ITN but also organised a Pounds 74m buy-out of the building. But can ITN be turned into a wholly commercial business without compromising editorial standards? 'Absolutely,' says Mr Gordon who is interested in exploiting international opportunities. 'The exact form that this will take and with which partners, is something that will be preoccupying me over the next few months,' he adds. A link with a US network is possible. The move to profit has already started. In the 17 months to the end of 1992 it is believed ITN made an operational profit of between Pounds 7m and Pounds 10m, compared with Pounds 3m for the 12 months of 1991. The improvement is expected to continue. In addition to the ITV and the Channel 4 contracts, Mr Gordon is keen to expand ITN's video sales operation and its programming activities, which include making news documentaries for ITV. He also believes that rapidly changing technology should allow further savings. 'ITN has further to go along the Bob Phillis road of reducing costs and increasing efficiency,' says Mr Gordon. 'The whole point is to be able to put the money on the screen and hire first-rate reporters and editors to convert pictures into programmes.' The evidence so far is that cost-cutting has not reduced the quality of ITN's news operation - although the November revamp of News at Ten - featuring a brash blue set, heavy use of graphics and Trevor MacDonald as the single anchorman - has led to accusations of a plunge down market. ITN's editor-in-chief, Mr Stewart Purvis, produces counter-evidence. The demographic profile of the viewership, he points out, has held steady. In November 1990, 41 per cent of the News at Ten audience came from professional and managerial groups; the percentage last February remained at 41 per cent. News at Ten's share of the main evening audience during 1992 averaged just under 52 per cent, and climbed to 53 per cent in the first quarter of 1993, a nightly average of 7.1m viewers. Channel Four news has averaged more than 1m over the same period. In terms of quality, an ITN reporter last week picked up the news organisation's 10th British Academy award since 1980 for her coverage of Serbian prison camps. As Mr Purvis put it recently: 'Yes, we've cut costs; yes, we want more people to watch our programmes; but, no, we haven't cut the quality of our coverage.' And finally . . . Mr Hill of Central has a clear idea of what he wants from ITN. Apart from a return on his investment, he says: 'I favour trying to use ITN's strength to be news supplier to the world.'</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: Bookshelf but what exactly do they eat? Sue Style tells us in her excellently written and presented A Taste of Switzerland (Pavilion, Pounds 15.99, 160 pages). There is culinary life beyond the fondue and Style has put together the elements that make up Swiss cuisine dealing in her usual authoritative and engaging way with the country's food, wines, gastronomic traditions and history. Style's book is good value but many food books in that price category are not, so it is nice to be able to point to a clutch of decent food books costing under a tenner. For those who like good writing as well as good eating Virago has published a food anthology, Loaves and Wishes (Pounds 7.99, 152 pages). It brings out a variety of responses to the request to write something - anything - about food to mark Oxfam's 50th anniversary. Anger, wit, fantasy, storytelling, poetry and more are interspersed with recipes. Authors include Maeve Binchy, Germaine Greer, Doris Lessing and Virginia Woolf. Glenfiddich-award winner Lynda Brown has experimented with a variety of crops and ways of growing them organically. Her practical tips on planting and harvesting make up The Cook's Garden (Pounds 8.99, Vermilion, 256 pages). Bean salads, scarpaccia and ways of tackling that most recalcitrant of vegetables, the brussels sprout, make up a guide which even seasoned kitchen gardeners will find worthwhile. Last, but not least, a delightfully illustrated first series from John Midgley - The Goodness of Beans, Peas and Lentils, Potatoes and Root Vegetables, Garlic and Olive Oil (each 65 pages, Pounds 4.99, Pavilion). Each book has 30 recipes and a basic information section. Ian Sidaway's watercolours makes them top value.</p>

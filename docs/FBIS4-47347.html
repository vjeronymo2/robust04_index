Finogenov, N.S. Rogov, All-Russian </F> Institute of Aviation Materials, Kiev; UDC 620.192.46:668.31]    [Abstract] The utility of long-term crack resistance  measurements during stress-induced aging, usually accompanied by  the development and realization of several combinations of  adhesive and cohesive glued joint failures as a result of  cracking, and the relative ease and accessibility of the wedge  method for crack resistance testing in an aging-inducing  environment, e.g., for glued rectangular slabs, prompted the  selection of the crack propagation work in the glued joint per  unit of linear measure or the energy release rate at separation  as the crack resistance criteria. The energy release as measured  by the wedge method rate is calculated and a formula is derived  whereby the crack resistance criterion is expressed as a  function of the wedge and slab thickness, crack length, and the  slab metal modulus of elasticity. The proposed criterion and  testing method make it possible to analyze the crack resistance  of virtually any structural adhesive and determine its  compliance with the safety requirements which ensure the  operational reliability of the glued structure. It is noted that  in mechanical engineering, the energy release rate in machines  at which the crack virtually does not grow is used as the  long-term crack resistance criterion.

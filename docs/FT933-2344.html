			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (21): Be wary of taxes and lawyers - Property abroad / In Europe, the purchase price is only the beginning EUROPE'S SINGLE market is now in place, but it has not yet made the purchase of residential property across borders much easier. Buying a house in another EC country can be as fraught with complications, unexpected costs and differing legislation as it would be further afield. Most buyers of second homes abroad are smitten with a place or a particular property while they are on holiday, and many are tempted to hand over their money there and then. This is when the unprepared start tumbling into the numerous pitfalls lurking in unfamiliar property markets. Advice is essential. The Federation of Overseas Property Developers, Agents and Consultants* has fact-sheets on the legal aspects of buying property in Spain, France, Portugal and Switzerland. Guides for Italy and Malta are in the pipeline. The fact-sheets give basic advice on how the process works and the main pitfalls, and also an indication of the cost components; but the federation strongly recommends prospective buyers to instruct a local lawyer to guide them through the transaction. It can refer buyers to a suitable lawyer in most countries. The price-tag on a property is not the only factor to take into account. Taxes, lawyers' fees and other costs involved in the house-buying process can add considerably more to the price than in the UK. In some countries, it is customary for the purchaser, rather than the vendor, to pay any estate agent's commission, though this may be included in the price quoted. The Woolwich building society, which also has a European operation, earlier this year carried out a survey of house purchase costs in Europe, and found that Britain was the cheapest place in which to buy. Additional costs put only 2 per cent on to the purchase price, on average, while in Spain and Portugal the extras pushed up the total by more than 10 per cent. Spain still accounts for by far the largest proportion of UK-owned residential property overseas, though France, the US, Portugal and Italy are also very popular. A new tax regime, intended to combat widespread tax evasion, is raising protests from foreign owners of property in Spain. The law means that, even if you do not let your Spanish property, you are liable for tax on deemed income from letting, calculated on a percentage of the house's value. This applies even if the property sits empty all year. Another problem in Spain, as well as other places, is that debts can be attached to a property rather than its owner. New owners can be presented with bills for back taxes, or threatened with repossession if the previous owner did not clear a mortgage on the property. It is absolutely essential to get your lawyer to check that the house is free of charges. What would happen if you died may not be the first thing on your mind when you are buying a holiday home abroad, but arrangements made at the start can avoid later inheritance problems. Unlike British law, where a Will is binding when it comes to the disposal of property after death, laws in some other countries lay down that your children are each entitled to a share of the property, no matter what your Will says. France is where most British buyers experience this problem. There can be ways round these laws, such as owning the property through a company, but this needs forward planning, and may be best done at the time the property is bought. Double-taxation treaties between the UK and other countries should usually mean that you will be able to offset any income tax, capital gains and inheritance tax you have to pay in the country where you have your second home against your UK tax liabilities. However, there are exceptions; so seek advice from the Inland Revenue or an accountant if you are unsure. The property markets in most EC countries are now relatively free of restrictions for EC buyers; Denmark is one exception, effectively banning the sale of holiday homes to non-Danes without a residence permit. Elsewhere, however, there can be severe constraints on who can buy what, and where. Switzerland imposes a number of restrictions on outside buyers, including annual quotas for foreign purchases in each canton. This year, non-Swiss buyers will be allowed to buy about 1,420 properties, but owning a home there does not entitle you to residency. Foreign purchasers or their immediate families must occupy the property for a minimum of three to six weeks a year, and there may be a maximum number of weeks it can be let each year. The property cannot be resold within two years, except in extreme circumstances, and there is no guarantee that it can be sold to another non-Swiss. Jersey is for the really seriously rich: strict regulations mean no one with an income of less than about Pounds 500,000 a year need apply to buy a house. Permission must be sought from the island's housing committee, which allows five to 10 people to take up residence every year, on the basis of the social or economic contribution they can make to the island's welfare. With income tax at 20 per cent, the minimum expected tax contribution is Pounds 100,000 a year. The not-so-wealthy but famous also stand a chance, if it is considered their image would be good for Jersey. Guernsey is less limited, but is still a place where money talks. Most dwellings on the island cannot be bought by outside purchasers, but about 10 per cent are available on the open market. Open-market properties start at about Pounds 200,000, and go up to well over Pounds 1m. Income tax in Guernsey is 20 per cent, and there is no capital gains tax. * Federation of Overseas Property Developers, Agents and Consultants. PO Box 3534, London NW5 1DQ. Tel 081 744 2362.</p>

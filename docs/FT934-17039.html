			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Sport: Cash and carry - Rugby Union BATH rugby club is in a win-win situation. In January, the Department of Environment will rule on whether or not their training ground at Lambridge can be sold to Tesco's for Pounds 17m. The ground lies at the edge of the city at the junction of two of the busiest roads. If Tesco's planning application is turned down, the city council must build a park and ride on the site. Sadly for the club this will mean they only receive, depending on who you talk to, a cool Pounds 5m, or after the third bottle, a rather less modest Pounds 14m. In some ways, the club has stopped thinking about the 'what-if' situation. It has already taken an option on another training ground but is in a quandary about whether it should keep playing at the Recreation Ground, move up the hill to the university and build a 20,000-seater stadium or opt for an even more spectacular solution, perhaps with Bristol Rovers soccer club. The problem is that the club does not own its ground. It is leased from the city until 2065, and other sporting organisations share it, including Somerset County Cricket Club whose square limits building possibilities. The shift to four-day county matches has made Bath Festival Week less attractive financially to Somerset. If the county retreats entirely to Taunton, this would allow the rugby club a freer hand. Bath rugby club probably wants to stay at the Recreation Ground and see the site fully developed. But this is unlikely. The city council, though more supportive of late, would not welcome an all-seater stadium. The compromise? Well, just to stand still, the club hopes to raise Pounds 1.5m by the end of the year to build a new stand on the south face of the hideous sports centre the council built by the pitch in the 1970s. The money was more or less committed but last week Courage, the brewer, withdrew Pounds 500,000 of sponsorship for the stand. The stand will hold seating for 400 and 19 hospitality boxes which are being offered at Pounds 10,000 a year  -a minimum of 20 home games. Even sub-let for one match the price compares favourably with Gloucester, Pounds 1,000 per match day and Harlequins, Pounds 2,500, albeit for groups of 25 or more, or, outside rugby, with Pounds 1,200 at Arsenal and Pounds 1,600 at Surrey cricket club.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wheat sales renew anger at subsidy wars - David Dodwell, World Trade Editor, examines the reaction to the widening of the EEP United States trade officials have justified President Bush's decision to dump 29m tonnes of subsidised wheat on world markets in the coming year as 'a crucial tool' in forcing the European Community to the bargaining table in the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation. If there is a grain of truth in this, then that is about the limit of it. Cynics will argue that the planned sale, announced during an election campaign rally for mid-western farmers at the start of the month, has more to do with winning votes than squeezing the EC. In any case the real victims are likely to be wheat exporters in Canada, Australia and the developing world, where governments cannot afford to join the US and the EC in their profligate export subsidy regimes. The US and EC subsidy regimes, which cost them Dollars 34.7bn and Dollars 83.6bn respectively in 1991, have made them the world's leading farm exporters - but at terrible cost to their competitors. World commodity prices fell for the third consecutive year in 1991, to hit an all-time low, as high levels of production from subsidised EC and US farmers created surpluses that have had to be dumped on world markets. Out of total wheat exports of 103m tonnes in 1991-92, the US accounted for 33.5m and the EC for 23.5m - most sold at world prices 25 per cent below the price guaranteed to farmers at home. Throughout this week, Mr John Kerin, Australia's Trade minister, is in Washington lambasting US officials over what Australians see as US perfidy on wheat exports. His government has already drafted a note to the Council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) in Geneva calling for collective action against the US. It has been signed by Canada, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. In recent weeks, angry Australian newspapers have branded the US as 'public enemy number one' - an honour historically reserved for the EC, whose farm dumping policies in recent years have played a lead role in depressing world wheat prices, and forcing non-subsidised exporters to seek new and marginal markets. The US administration has so far been unrepentant about the subsidised wheat offer, which provides for subsidies of up to Dollars 1bn in the fiscal year to July 1993. The programme is an extension of the Export Enhancement Programme (EEP), which has been in place since 1985. It adds a total of 28 new target markets to those already receiving EEP grain. These range from Pakistan and South Africa to Brazil and South Korea. Mr Stephen Censky, acting administrator of the US Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service, accepts the non-subsidising wheat exporters are likely to get hurt in the crossfire between the EC and the US: 'Any time countries are competing against subsidised prices on the world market, that is going to have a price lowering effect,' he said in Canberra last week. 'We try to limit that, but there is a negative effect on world prices.' The US insists that it will try to limit damage by targeting EC markets, by limiting the size of sales in any one market, and by winning assurances from purchasers that they will not reduce imports from non-subsidised suppliers such as Australia, Canada or Argentina. In Australia, these claims have been greeted with derision, however. After four major infringements by the US into Kuwait, Yemen, China and Pakistan - all important markets for Australian wheat where the EC is a marginal or non-existent exporter - Canberra now feels it was duped by the US into previously reserving blame for the EC. Australian wheat export earnings have fallen from a peak of ADollars 2.56bn (Dollars 1.85bn) in 1989 to ADollars 1.58bn last year - a decline aggravated by drought in eastern Australia. In Canada, the world's leading wheat exporter after the US and the EC, damage has taken the form of lower prices and heavier spending on promotion. The recent expansion of the EEP brings 95 per cent of Canada's markets within the ambit of US subsidies. As income from wheat sales has fallen, so the Canadian Wheat Board, which oversees all of the country's wheat exports, has reported a deficit for 1990/91 of CDollars 673m (Dollars 547m) - only the third shortfall in its 49-year history. Canadians also pour scorn on US claims that the extended EEP is targeted at EC markets. For example it includes Brazil and South Korea, which have become significant markets for Canadian wheat, but which buy little grain from the EC. The Canadian Wheat Board has been forced to probe painstakingly for new markets that are unaffected by the subsidy war - aided by the fact that the quality of their wheat is second to none. As a result, they have edged their way into markets such as Japan, the UK, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. Argentina, among the world's lowest-cost farming nations, has lost three key export markets through the subsidies war, the government claims. The CIS, China and Egypt all used to import wheat from Argentina, but today import none, according to first half trade export figures from the agriculture department. Mr Alieto Guadagni, international economic relations secretary, said farm subsidies now cost Argentina Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 1.5bn a year in lost export revenues. The impact of subsidies on Argentina's exports is clear: wheat exports peaked in 1983 at 10.2m tonnes, with record revenues of Dollars 1.47bn. By 1988 they had fallen to 3.7m tonnes, worth Dollars 361m. Exports now hover at around half the 1983 level, with revenues running at one-third of the 1983 record. Argentina forecasts exports of 5.7m tonnes in the current 1991-92 harvest, up 21 per cent on the previous year. However, it projects exports of just 5m tonnes in 1992-93. By targeting Brazil, Argentina's biggest wheat market, accounting for about a quarter of exports, for 500,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat under the EEP initiative, the US is expected to dent export prices by at least 10 per cent, according to Argentina's agriculture department. This would lead to a loss of Dollars 45m in export revenue. The agriculture department is also sceptical about US claims that its cheap exports are aimed at damaging the EC. Buenos Aires says the EC has not targeted Brazil, which has already bought 1.3m tonnes of Argentine wheat in 1991-92. Furthermore, the new EEP programme aims to sell 3.1m tonnes of subsidised wheat to Bangladesh, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Brazil, South Africa and Venezuela - six countries which together imported 1.6m tonnes of wheat from Argentina in 1991-92. Although Argentina's Menem administration has stabilised the economy through market-based policies and is privatising infrastructure, farmers complain that low international prices plus high production costs and punitive interest rates are driving many of them into bankruptcy. The government says there are 200,000 small family farms that are no longer viable units and face the threat of being bought out by larger, more capital-intensive farmers - a plight faced by small farmers in many other developing countries as a result of depressed commodity prices. Unhappily, these countries have found themselves as impotent in the face of US and EC wheat dumping as Australia, which, apart from 'strong protests', has murmured implausibly about reviews of air traffic rights and closure of US naval bases in Australia. Nor is the completion of the Uruguay Round likely to bring relief: cuts in EC farm subsidies appear unlikely to have any significant impact on world prices for many years to come, and in the meanwhile the US is likely to be unrelenting in its tit-for-tat subsidy war.

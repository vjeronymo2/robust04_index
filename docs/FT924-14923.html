			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Marking the moment It is difficult to imagine after the upheavals in the ERM, but a few months from now the D-Mark could be perceived as a weak currency. Yesterday's figures for west German unemployment and industrial orders confirm the impression of a softening, though not yet recession-bound, economy. Unification will doubtless be seen as an even greater social and economic burden if the downturn becomes pronounced. That is not a recipe for a strong currency, especially given the discreet shift in the stance of the Bundesbank. It is becoming clearer by the day that the Bundesbank's determination to hold money market rates below 9 per cent is more than just a short-term response to ERM pressures. As if to emphasise this, it offered money market liquidity yesterday at 8.9 per cent. Admittedly the arrangements carried only a 14-day maturity, but we are past the point where money rates could credibly rise again once ERM pressures subside. Markets might prefer an explicit signal in the form of a lower Lombard rate, but the change is real enough. Three-month Euromarks yield a quarter-point less than sterling even after the cut in UK base rates. Of course, the Bundesbank may not be in a hurry. It is still worried about inflation and would certainly take fright if easier short-term money drove long-term rates higher. That may ultimately matter less as the message sinks in than the simple perception that the turning point has finally come. Expectations of an easier German policy could produce a redirection of investment flows towards the US once the presidential election is over. On past experience, one would expect sterling to rise on the dollar's coat-tails. That would secure for the UK chancellor some of the freedom he hoped to gain by leaving the ERM.</p>

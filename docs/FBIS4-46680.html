			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report prepared by B. Sidorenko: "International Forum of </F> Airports"]    [Text] It was held in Moscow for the third time and  was devoted to the problem of reconstruction and technical  supply.    Organizers of the airport conference, which took place  in the Sheremetyevo hotel Novotel from 13 through 15 April, were  the Aeroport Association, the European branch of the Council of  the ASI [expansion not indicated]-Europe, the Ministry of  Transportation of the Russian Federation, the Government of  Moscow, and the international airport Sheremetyevo.    The conference was opened by the president of the  Aeroport Association, L. Shcheglov. Those who were gathered  there were welcomed by Minister of Transportation of Russia V.  Yefimov, general director of ASI-Europe F. Khamon, and the  chairman of the Interstate Aviation Committee T. Anodina.    Speeches and reports were presented by the department  chief of the Department of Air Transportation of Russia Yu.  Baranov, first deputy director of the Aeoroporty Ukrainy  Association A. Trotsenko, chief of the Aeroproyekt Institute V.  Ivanov, executive director of the American company Leman Brazers  R. Brown, chief of the commercial division of the Italian firm  Kodest P. Gella, chief of the department of foreign relations of  the Aeroport de Paris H. Rouaud, chairman of the  Rosaeronavigatsiya Agency and Deputy Minister of Transportation  of Russia V. Shelkovnikov, vice president of the Association of  Air Transportation Operators Ye. Chibirev, and others.    The discussions that developed touched upon questions  of world practice of construction and reconstruction of  airports, the prospects for the development of airports of  Russia, the CIS, and the Baltic countries, and also problems of  their technical supply.    One of the days of the conference was entirely devoted  to the work of the exhibition of technology and equipment. Many  European firms that had made a good name for themselves on our  market participated in it. Among them were the Swiss Rolba and  Boshung, the German ABB and Kelner, the Finnish Idman, the  French Thomson, the Czech Elektrosignal, and a number of others.  In addition to producers of ground technology and equipment,  construction firms also participated in the exhibition. A  special time was set apart for presentations from firms and  business negotiations.    The exhibition was viewed by members of ASI-Europe. And  then a meeting of this representative of this European agency  was held in Moscow for the first time.    We are presenting some of the reports and speeches  heard at the conference in abridged form for the readers'  attention. They are published on pages 2-3.  <H5>  State Support for Renovation of Airports of Russia </H5>   Yu. Baranov, department chief of the Department of Air  Transportation.    State support for airports has a special purpose and is  aimed  primarily at providing for the development of their  infrastructure and introducing advanced systems and technologies.    Mechanisms for state support are based on the following  principles:    --the object of support is not the enterprise itself but the  specific transportation services, facilities, or systems;    --for objects of state support there will be monitoring of  costs and results and also mechanisms providing for  unconditional utilization of funds only for their direct purpose  will be applied;    --airports will receive state support, as a rule, on a  contractual basis and according to principles of competition.    The investment policy is aimed at priority support for key  projects and programs and provides for reduction of direct  budget financing through the development of new forms of  investment activity.    The network of airports of the Russian Federation, which in  practice was formed during the preceding period, at the present  time includes about 1,000 airports of various classes. The basis  of the network is made up of 67 of the largest airports, which  are considered to be federally significant. These airports  handled 78 percent of the overall volume of dispatches in Russia  as a whole.    Right up until 1990 the growth rates of the transportation  volumes were increasing considerably but the volume of capital  investments in the construction of airports lagged behind  significantly.    At the present time a number of enterprises require  expansion, reconstruction, and technical retooling. Some of  them, because of ecological and production factors, must be  moved outside the built-up urban area. The average level of  provision of production capacities for buildings and structures  at the present time does not exceed 69 percent.    The network of international airports is actually poorly  developed. They do not have the necessary conditions,  corresponding to the world level, for servicing airline  passengers and handling freight.    The ground production base of the airports does not meet  advanced and current requirements for economy in supporting the  transportation process.    In the future there must be a slowing up of the rates of  reduction of volumes of transportation work that is observed at  the present time with further stabilization of shipments and  subsequent growth of their volumes (by the year 2000--by 28  percent, and by the year 2005--by 85 percent of the 1995 level  for passenger transportation). Because of this, the need for  intensive development of the production base of airports  continues to be crucial. Changes in the geopolitical situation  and the development of direct international communications among  certain airports require improvement of the structure of their  network and also support for international transportation with a  level of service that corresponds to the world level.    Taking the above into account, the most important need at  the  present time is for improvement of the system of state  regulation of the development of airports. One of the  instruments for this regulation is the Program for Development  of Airports of Russia. It was developed taking previous plans  and program documents into account and is a constituent part of  the State Program for Development of Air Transportation in  Russia up to the Year 2000.    The implementation of the program, which is based on the  actual condition of the production base of airports and the  scale of the measures and also the considerable volume of  necessary budget allocations, is envisioned in three stages.    The first stage is stabilization of the economic situation  (1993-1995) and the implementation in airports of program  measures for providing for stable functioning of air  transportation.    The second stage is active implementation of the state  structural policy (1996-2000). The implementation in priority  airports of comprehensive and balanced development of fixed  production capital and the growth of production capacities of  buildings and structures in keeping with the future structure of  the fleet of aircraft and taking into account the volumes of air  transportation work, bringing the average level of support of  the facilities up to the normative level. This will be carried  out through large-scale construction and reconstruction of  production facilities, providing for the operation of future  mainline aircraft like the Il-96 and Tu-204 and expansion of the  geography of flights of aircraft like the Il-86, Tu-154M, and  Yak-42; bringing the airfields up to the requirements of the  Norms for Summer Suitability and development of categorized  airfields; development and expansion of the network of  international airports (including reserve) with the construction  of facilities that meet the world level for serving  international airline passengers and freight; implementation of  an extensive complex of environmental protection measures.    The third stage is economic growth (2001-2005), the  implementation of a complex of program measures envisioned for  the second stage in airports that are not included in the  priority group.    Simultaneously during the time period earmarked for the  program, individual airports that do not meet ecological  requirements will be moved outside city limits: Omsk-2  (completion of construction), Syktyvkar-2 (completion of  construction), Rostov-on-Don, Bykovo (moved), and Saratov, Perm,  and Irkutsk.    Investments in the program are expected to be made from the  republic budget, investment credit, municipal (regional)  budgets, bank credit, the internal funds of the enterprises,  foreign investments, the creation of joint-stock companies, and  issuance of other kinds of securities.    The basic directions for the development of the ground  material and technical base during 1995-2000 include the  following projects:    --construction and reconstruction of 19 artificial takeoff  and landing strips, including in the airports of Sheremetyevo,  Khavarovsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Anadyr, Kaliningrad, and  others;    --startup of airline terminals and airline terminal  complexes  both for domestic lines and for international ones and also for  international sectors with an overall handling capacity of  36,000 passengers per hour (Sochi, Vnukovo, St. Petersburg,  Novosibirsk, Mineralnyye Vody, Yekaterinburg, Arkhangelsk,  Tyumen, Yakutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and others, and  also the Mosaviatsentr complex in Moscow);    --the introduction of 740,000 square meters of production  space in hangar facilities for technical servicing of aircraft  (Yekaterinburg, Vnukovo, Pulkovo, Magadan, Blagoveshchensk,  Mineralnyye Vody, Novosibirsk, Tyumen, Yakutsk, Magadan, and  others).    In order to develop mainline airports of federal  significance, taking into account their role in the development  of the economy of the Russian Federation, and to include the  airfields of these airports in federal property, there is to be  state support with a tendency toward reduction as a result of  the utilization of funds of the enterprises themselves as well  as other sources. This is confirmed by foreign practice in  investment in the development of airports.    Beginning in 1993 the Ministry of Transportation of Russia  introduced a contract system for state support of investment  projects in order to increase the effectiveness of these  processes in transportation and also to bring the mechanisms of  state support for transportation enterprises, regardless of  their forms of ownership, into compliance with conditions for  radical economic reform.    The contract system envisions granting funds for state  support, as a rule, as an additional source of financing  projects, keeping in mind the specific obligations of the  enterprises to mobilize their own funds for these purposes and  also the enlistment of additional nonbudget sources of  financing; guarantees of the utilization of the financial  sources that are granted strictly for their intended purpose and  fines for violation of the requirements of the contract;  conditions for repayment of funds granted for investment  projects; conditions for granting in exceptional cases funds for  state support on a nonreturnable basis.    The investment projects are aimed at the development  (modernization) of airports and their construction with shared  participation of the state.    Within the framework of investment contracts, the following  mechanisms are envisioned for repayment of funds from state  support: granting of special-purpose credit with the mediation  of commercial banks, including preferential credit; granting  investments in exchange for shares and other securities;  granting means of transportation and other equipment through  leasing, including preferential.    In order to collect payments and interest on credit and  conduct operations with securities issued by recipients of state  support and to conduct leasing operations, banks, investment  institutions, and leasing companies are enlisted on a  contractual basis.    The priority areas and the maximum amount of state support  offered on a contractual basis to airline enterprises shall be  established for the corresponding period by a directive of the  Ministry of Transportation. The authority to conclude and  monitor the fulfillment of investment contracts for granting  state support shall be assigned to the Department of Air  Transportation.    Contracts will be concluded on the basis of consideration by  a commission of applications from airline enterprises which  contain their proposals for carrying out investment projects  requiring state support, taking into account the recommendations  (findings) of regional air transport administration. Investment  contracts, including innovational ones, may be concluded on a  competitive basis.    In 1993, 135.5 billion rubles [R] were spent on the  development of air transportation from all sources of financing,  including R52.3 billion (38.6 percent) from the federal budget.  An important aspect was the reimbursable basis of state  allocations allotted for the construction of air transportation  projects. The limited state allocations were used only for the  construction of the most important objects.    This provision led to a situation where the aviation  enterprises spent R82 billion of their own funds or 60 percent  of all the sources of financing to pay for equipment and the  development of the ground base for airports.    State support was provided for the construction of the most  important facilities, including: three complexes of airports--in  Omsk, Syktyvkar, and Vorkuta, six takeoff and landing strips,  five airline terminal buildings, three production facilities for  plants, five aviation-technical bases, and other air transport  facilities. The largest of them were: the takeoff and landing  strips in St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Nizhniy Novgorod, and  Volgograd, the airline terminal buildings in Khabarovsk and  Sochi, the international sectors of airline terminals in Chita  and Samara, production facilities in Krasnoyarsk and Khabarovsk,  hangars in Krasnoyarsk, Arkhangelsk, Irkutsk, and Vnukovo, and a  fuel and lubricant warehouse in Magadan.    International sections of airline terminal buildings were  introduced in Chita and Samara. In Khabarovsk they introduced an  international section and the largest airline terminal in the  Far East that will handle 1,500 passengers per hour, airfield  paving in Kaliningrad, a fuel and lubricant warehouse in  Magadan, and other facilities.    An important part of the development of airports of Russia  is  the enlistment of foreign investments. In spite of the absence  of clearcut legislation providing guarantees for foreign  investments in the Russian aviation market, the number of  facilities in which foreign investors participate is increasing.    At the present time the joint Russian-German enterprise  Aeroport Moskva is reconstructing the Sheremetyevo-1 Airport. In  conjunction with Japanese firms they have built the building for  the international section for passengers in Khabarovsk. The  joint enterprise of the airline company Air Russia, created by  the Domodedovo Production Association and the airline company  British Airways is completing preparatory work on the  construction of an international airline terminal with handling  capacity of 1,000 passengers per hour in the Domodedovo airport.    Agreement has been reached between the aviation enterprise  and corporations of the United States concerning the intention  to build an international airline terminal in Pulkovo (St.  Petersburg) in 1994. Reconstruction of the international  terminal in the Chita airport has been completed by the firm  Union Engineering (Republic of Serbia) and work is being done on  reconstruction of the takeoff and landing strip, the taxi  strips, and parking places for aircraft.    In keeping with the agreement between the Ministry of  Transportation of Russia and the U.S. corporation Leman Brazers,  technical and economic justification is being drawn up for the  development of the Moscow aviation center.    Planning work has been completed for the creation of a  multifunctional state complex called Mosaviatsentr with the  participation of the Main Agency of Air Communications and the  Aerosital and Aerodroma joint ventures (Italy). The first part  of the Center is to be started as early as 1994.    Work is being done to prepare technical and economic  justification for the development of the international airport  in Murmansk.    The improvement of state regulation and support for airports  of Russia will continue in 1994.    Unfortunately, the practice of utilizing revenues from  various taxes and fees exclusively for the needs of civil  aviation adopted in other European countries is not yet in  effect. The aforementioned factor is a significant source of  state support for the development of airports.    In conclusion it should be noted that only a comprehensive  approach and the creation of a favorable investment climate,  acceleration of the transformation of state aviation enterprises  into joint-stock companies taking into account their separation  into airline companies and airports, and the accompaniment of  effective legal and administrative measures can provide for  proper renovation of airports of Russia.  <H5>  Problems of Ground Service: The Operators' View </H5>   Ye. Chibirev, vice president of the Association of Air  Transportation Operators.    We are living through a time of large-scale reformation of  civil aviation. There is the formation of market relations, the  creation of a competitive environment, the transformation of  forms of ownership and methods of management, the separation of  airline detachments into airline companies and airports, and the  generation of new management principles.    Unfortunately, these processes are taking place in an  unfavorable economic, political, and social situation. Moreover,  they are impacted negatively both by objective factors related  to difficulties with the establishment and development of the  new and by subjective ones caused by shortcomings in the  activity of administrative organs, managers, and collectives.    There are many problems. The majority of them do not have  simple solutions. Some of them cause conflicts of positions,  aggravate contradictions, and lead to a struggle of interests.  Interrelations among airline companies and airports are no  exception here.    I wish to share my views on a number of issues which, in our  opinion, are crucial.    Separation into airline companies and airports    The need to separate airport complexes from the combined  aviation detachments as independent enterprises is not disputed  by anyone today.    This is a necessary measure dictated by the logic of the  transition to market relations. It provides for elimination of  the technological monopoly of the combined detachment or  production association, encourages the formation of a market for  airline transportation and the development of competition, and  also creates preconditions for manifestation of businesslike  activity and enterprisingness.    But the separation of the airports should not lead to the  other extreme--the appearance of structures that have the  ability to dictate arbitrarily to the airline companies. Today's  practice shows the active manifestation of precisely this  tendency, which frequently not only blocks the entry of airline  companies into the market but also places them on the verge of  destruction.    The AEVT [Association of Air Transportation Operators] takes  the following position here: The processes of separation of  airports and their acquisition of independence should not be  artificially retarded but should not develop spontaneously  either.    Civil aviation airports, taking their natural monopolies  into  account, should remain in the sphere of state control and  regulation.    Recognizing the transition to free rates as a progressive  step, we nonetheless think that under the conditions of the  absence or restriction of competition, the corresponding  counterbalances must exist and function.    State management organs in conjunction with the AEVT and the  Aeroport Association could develop proposals, taking world  experience into account, for state regulation of airport fee  rates and structures of expenditures when forming them.    The question of interrelations between airports and base  airline companies has not been completely regulated yet. In  addition to the contradictions that are manifested among them  when dividing up property and the desire to encroach on the  property interests of the airline companies, complications of a  production-technological nature sometimes arise.    The AEVT is in favor of granting the airports the right to  economic management both of the areas of land they actually  occupy and of the areas of land in the zone of their future  development.    But we are against allowing the airports to take advantage  of  this right to impose exorbitant conditions on the base airline  companies for allotment of land for their aircraft.    In general, in keeping with international practice, certain  airports grant certain privileges to the base airline companies.  Possibly we should adopt this practice.    The question of the prices of airline fuel remains critical.  Perhaps the world has never known such price "disparities" in  the various regions, such price hikes, such unregulated price  setting. The situation of the airline carriers in this chaos  requires no comment.    We are assuming that prices of airline fuel should be  regulated by the state and the value added tax on it should be  abolished.    The creation of Rosaeronavigatsiya and the formation of  IVP [expansion not indicated] and UVD [air traffic control]  enterprises    The AEVT does not support the aspiration of  Rosaeronavigatsiya to take over all the means of radio technical  support and communications.    We think that this would cause serious harm to civil  aviation. Air traffic control services, radio technical support  for flights, and communications in the airfield zone (takeoff,  landing, circuit) should remain with the airports. This will  make it possible to provide for renovation and modernization of  airport means of air traffic control and also maintain unity of  the technological process.    Discriminatory practice of airports with respect to  domestic airline companies    We most decisively object to this.    The cost of airport fees on aircraft of Russian airline  companies in the Russian Federation exceeds severalfold the cost  of fees on aircraft of foreign airline companies or domestic  aircraft and helicopters leased by them.    The cost of one hour of parking of an aircraft of a Russian  airline company in an airport amounts to 25 percent of the cost  of takeoff and landing. At the same time the cost of parking an  aircraft carrying a foreign flag for 24 hours is only 10 percent  of the cost of takeoff and landing. For example, in the Vnukovo  airport 10 hours of parking an An-12 of a Russian airline  company costs R1 million and for 24 hours parking of an An-12  under a foreign flag--only $77 (R89,000)--less than half as much  for parking more than twice as long!    Nonstate airline companies groan under this burden and are  forced to pay for a foreign flag in order to avoid such fees.    We think that the policy for forming prices for airport fees  and services should correspond to the principles of the various  possibilities indicated in Article 15 of the Chicago Convention.    Interrelations between airline companies and  airports    Now they do not have a clear-cut normative-legal base and,  consequently, clearly designated obligations and  responsibilities of the parties.    This has a negative effect on the art of service to the  passengers, the safety of flights, and the economic effect.    Unfortunately we cannot say that separating previously  consolidated airline detachments into airline companies and  airports has already produced positive results with respect to  these extremely important criteria.    The airline company and the airport are closely connected  technologically and efforts, say, to improve the art of service  of passengers on board could be nullified by the lack of the  same on the ground.    Apparently it is time to resolutely change to a contractual  basis for interrelations.    The airport is obliged to guarantee and provide for a  certain  list of conditions and services for airline companies just as  the airline company has obligations to take certain actions when  continuing a trip in an emergency situation, when an aircraft is  malfunctioning, when there is no aircraft fuel, etc.    And agreements between the aviation base and the airline  company making flights through the airport, naturally, must vary.    The AEVT is prepared to become involved in the work for  preparing drafts of standard agreements.    Information support    So far we do not have a necessary and sufficient field of  information for successful operation of airline companies.    Airport fees, the prices of aircraft fuel, the conditions  for  service, the list of services rendered, etc., with constantly  changing values, are making the adoption of decisions to make  air shipments by airline companies a task with many unknowns. It  is no accident that attempts to make these decisions end up in  losses. It cannot be ruled out that the airports are also losing  a great deal here.    Possibly we should jointly think about a system and  mechanism  for information support for airline companies and airports  taking their needs and interests into account.    Structural rearrangement    We think that in the stage of separation of consolidated  aviation detachments it would be inexpedient to separate them  into more than two independent enterprises (airport and airline  company). Separating the ATB [aircraft maintenance base] into an  independent enterprise would be inexpedient in this case. The  exception might be cases where centers (regional) for technical  service and repair of aircraft are created.    As for subdivisions of shops for operational technical  service, ideally they should be attached to the airport. If they  belong to the airline companies and there is no such service in  the airport, it places them in a monopolistic position.    But in this stage, in our opinion, the task is hard to carry  out. Therefore the base airline company must be an object of  special antimonopoly control and regulation.    Regarding these and many other questions the AEVT could  cooperate productively with the Aeroport Association. The basis  for our interaction has been laid. It is now a matter of  developing it.  <H5>  Paths to the Development of Airport Complex of Ukraine </H5>   A. Trotsenko, first deputy director of the Airports of  Ukraine Association    The Ministry of Transportation of Ukraine has approved a  plan  for administration of civil aviation enterprises. In order to  provide the conditions necessary for its establishment and  development, the effective use of aviation equipment, the  development of a ground base, and improvement of its ability to  compete, on the basis of enterprises of the former Ukrainian  civil aviation association the following have been formed: the  Ukrainian civil aviation association Airports of Ukraine; the  Ukrainian state airline company Airlines of Ukraine; the airline  company International Airlines of Ukraine; the airline company  Cargo Airlines of Ukraine; and the airline company Application  of Aviation in the National Economy. In November 1993 the  concept was approved for dividing the OAO [expansion not  indicated] into independent state enterprises--airports and  regional branches of airline companies. The concept envisions  the division of the functions between airports and airline  companies and the corresponding division of services and  property of the OAO as well as division of funds and facilities  for social purposes.    This method has already been used to single out 12 airports,  and this process is continuing. Leaders of five OAO's  (Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa, Lvov, Donetsk, and Lugansk) did not  agree to the division in the first stage.    With the ministry's consent they are creating the consortium  Ukrtransavia made of these OAO's with subsequent division and  separation of independent airports. This way they will prolong  the process of separation by two or three years.    The Airports of Ukraine association, which includes 12  airports, has been instructed by the Ministry of Transportation  to handle questions of capital construction, reconstruction, and  retooling for all civil aviation facilities of Ukraine.    It must be noted that civil aviation in Ukraine, as in other  CIS states, is experiencing great difficulties. This was brought  about by the breakdown of economic ties, and the large increase  in the cost of energy resources, above all aircraft fuel.  Therefore the volume of air shipments within Ukraine during the  past three years has decreased 10-fold, which has caused them to  operate at a loss. At the same time the amount of air freight is  increasing on international lines. There is also a larger number  of airports with access to international airlines.    At the present time we are working out a concept for the  development of civil aviation of Ukraine which envisions:  reconstruction and retooling of the ground base for airports in  Borispol, Odessa, Lvov, and Kharkov; reconstruction and  retooling for international flights at airports of Donetsk,  Kharkov, Uzhgorod, and Dnepropetrovsk; the construction of new  airline terminals in Kiev (Zhulyany), Sumy, Khmelnitskiy, Lvov,  Kharkov, Odessa, and Borispol; the construction of takeoff and  landing strips in Kirovograd and Borispol.    Until 1992 there were four airports in Ukraine with the  status of international: Borispol, Simferopol, Odessa, and Lvov.  As of today 14 of the 36 airports of Ukraine are conducting  regular or chartered international flights to countries of  Europe, Asia, and America.    A government decree and the Ministry of Transportation of  Ukraine have earmarked reconstruction and building of airline  terminals for international airline travel in 30 large  population points of Ukraine, and it will be necessary to do a  considerable amount of construction and installation work in the  airports of Zaporozhye, Kirovograd, Poltava, Sumy, Ternopol,  Zhitomir, Lutsk, Berdyansk, Izmail, Kerch, Severodonetsk, and  others.    The concept for the development of civil aviation of Ukraine  envisions the reconstruction of the Borispol airport, which will  be done in two sections. First it is planned to complete  reconstruction of the existing airline terminal, takeoff and  landing strip No. 1, and the construction of the new airline  terminal. A second section includes the reconstruction of  takeoff and landing strip No. 2 and the construction of the  cargo terminal and the hangar facilities.    An international auction was announced for reconstruction of  the first section in which the following participated: the  American firm Hughes, the German Hoftiech, the French Spi  Batilol [name as transliterated] and Bung, the British Costain,  and a number of others. One of the main requirements under the  conditions of the auction was the organization by the firm of  the acquisition of credit in Western banks for the Borispol  airport. The bidding commission, appointed by the Government of  Ukraine, awarded first place to the French firm Bung. The  results of the auction were announced in March 1992. For six  months the Bung firm, which won the bidding, was not able to  document the acquisition of credit for the Borispol airport and  a new decision was made: to complete the reconstruction of the  first section facility by facility.    Credit for reconstruction of the terminal was granted by the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Eximbank.    An auction in conjunction with the EBRD was also declared  for  the delivery of equipment for the airline terminal.    About 30 foreign firms participated in the auction with  concrete proposals for the delivery of technological equipment  for the airline terminal complex.    According to the conditions of the auction the firms have to  deliver, install, adjust, and release their equipment turnkey.    In the near future bidding will be announced for  participation in investment in the reconstruction of Borispol  takeoff and landing strip-1 and the delivery of equipment for  this facility.    According to the contract, the reconstruction of the  existing  airline terminal should be completed in 1994, and in 1995-1996  it is intended to complete the reconstruction of takeoff and  landing strip No. 1, which will be lengthened to 4 kilometers  and equipped with a system for aircraft landing that will make  it possible for the Borispol airport to receive all the large  modern aircraft of both domestic and foreign airline companies.    Improvement of the ground base for the airports is an  inseparable part of raising the level of effectiveness of the  work of air transportation. It is important to the passenger not  only to fly from one geographical point to another, but also to  do this with maximum convenience. The size of the aircraft fleet  in and of itself cannot guarantee the flourishing of air  transportation and its prestige. It is not a matter of aircraft  but of the effectiveness of their use and the quality of  service. It is very important to proceed from the idea that  reconstruction and retooling of airports with the introduction  of principally new technologies provide for the greatest results  from the operation of air transportation; reconstruction of  VPP's and equipping them with the latest means of landing and  air traffic control will increase the safety and regularity of  the flights; the compliance of systems of lighting equipment and  electrical supply circuits with the requirements of the world  level is one of the constituent parts of the guarantee of  regularity and safety of flights; supplying the airports with  new technology, equipment, means of mechanization and automation  for serving passengers and maintaining airline terminals  increases the comfort and the art of service for the passengers.    As we know, in the financial activity of foreign airports  aviation fees make up 60-70 percent. The remainder--30-40  percent--the airports obtain from extensive non-aviation  activity. Reconstruction and retooling of existing production  capacities of airports offer many possibilities for creating  sources of income for the airport. They include: the hotel  business, ground transportation, leasing of space, buildings,  and GSM capacities, commercial stores and kiosks, leasing  points, motor vehicle parking places, and other kinds of  services.</p>

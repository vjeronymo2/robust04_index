			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / World Trade News: GEC-Alsthom backed in Indonesia power bid GEC-ALSTHOM, the Anglo-French supplier of electricity generation equipment, has gained support in the Indonesian parliament, in the bitter fight to win contracts for two 300MW power stations. Mr Erie Soekardja, deputy chairman of the Indonesian parliamentary energy commission, has called on the government to explain why a rival bid has been favoured, even though it is significantly higher than that tendered by GEC-Alsthom. PLN, the country's state-owned electricity company, recommended last May that the German operation of ABB, the Swiss-Swedish group, and Mitsubishi of Japan should build the gas-powered stations, at Muara Tawar in West Java and Pasuruan in East Java. Some Dollars 23bn of investment in new capacity for the power network is planned in the period 1994 to 1999, and, according to one industry official, the companies 'are playing rough and ready business politics' to win a share of it. Antara, the state-owned news agency, says GEC-Alsthom has written to Indonesian President Suharto, setting out its bid of Dollars 500 per kilowatt, valuing the stations at Dollars 150m each, and a commitment to complete them by September of next year. The bid by ABB and Mitsubishi, it claims, represented Dollars 623 per kilowatt, valuing the plants at Dollars 187m each, and offered completion by March, 1995. PLN says that its recommendation was based on the proven track record of ABB and Mitsubishi in Indonesia. Industry officials also suggest that technical variations in the proposals could account for the cost difference.</p>

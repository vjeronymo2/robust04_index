			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Wang creditors back plan for reorganisation WANG Laboratories, the US office computer systems company, yesterday filed a wide-ranging reorganisation plan aimed at enabling the company to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The plan, jointly sponsored by a committee representing unsecured creditors, would transfer ownership of the company to creditors through an issue of new stock. It also calls for substantial reductions in operations, with the loss of 3,300 jobs. Secured and priority creditors would be paid in full, or as agreed by the parties. Unsecured creditors would be issued shares in the reorganised company and warrants would be issued to current shareholders. The plan had been endorsed by representatives of equity holders, Wang said. Wang, an early leader in office computer systems, failed to keep pace with changes in the industry. It filed for bankruptcy protection last August. 'We have truly invented a new Wang,' said Mr Joseph Tucci Wang, president and chief executive. Wang would emerge from Chapter 11 free of a substantial portion of the structural burden and debt that had impeded the company's efforts to restructure and regain profitability, the company said. Wang plans to close its manufacturing operations and focus on software and services. Corporate operations would be streamlined and the company would 'dramatically reduce its infrastructure,' Wang said. 'This plan allows Wang to capitalise upon its leadership in integrated imaging and office software and network integration and support services,' said Mr C. Hall Swaim, counsel to the creditor's committee. The 'new Wang' does not intend to develop or manufacture open systems computers. Instead, it would resell computers manufactured by other companies - including International Business Machines, which formed an alliance with Wang two years ago, and Hewlett-Packard, which reached a joint marketing and development agreement with Wang two weeks ago. Wang officials said the company expected to return to profitability in fiscal year 1994. For the current fiscal year, it anticipated revenues of around Dollars 1.25bn to Dollars 1.3bn, declining to about Dollars 1bn in 1994. The job losses involved are higher than expected, however. Wang had more than 13,000 employees before it filed for protection, at which time it said it hoped to preserve 8,000 jobs. Yesterday, however, it announced it would reduce its workforce from 9,300 to 6,000.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Observer: Foggitt due Bill Foggitt, the Thirsk weather sage whose accuracy at forecasting easily outshines that of Punxsutawney Phil, the Pennsylvania groundhog, is basking in the prediction he made of Britain's hot summer. After the hottest July since 1983, he said, the rest of August would produce a mixed bag of rain, sun and thunderstorms. Thirsk has had two thunderstorms in the past fortnight and more are on the way, said Foggitt, a thunderstorm enthusiast. He can recall one storm on August 29 1930, the day Princess Margaret was born, that lasted the whole night. While that was the longest, the most violent he can remember was in September 1965, when a flash of lightning put his telephone out of order. 'I would have been killed if I'd been there at the time,' he said. Was that a rumbling in the distance? No answer. Foggitt had hung up.</p>

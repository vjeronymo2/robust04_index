			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Economic Viewpoint: A country with a fix-price culture When unemployment exploded in the early 1980s and then continued to climb more gradually, ministers suggested that the phenomenon was related to excessive pay increases. Indeed, the Treasury issued a mustard-coloured paper, The Relationship between Employment and Wages, in January 1985, with the unusual by-line 'Review by Treasury Officials', presumably to show respectability. Respectable or not, the thesis is true - although there is much room to argue about how far the trouble is with money wages, how far with real wages and how far with something more elusive, like real pay objectives. The Treasury paper, written when ERM was under veto, concentrated on real pay and estimated that for every 1 per cent it rose above some appropriate level, employment would fall by  1/2 to 1 per cent (other things being equal, which they are usually not). Ministers were, therefore, puzzled and almost embarrassed when unemployment virtually halved, falling from 11.1 per cent of the workforce in 1986 to a low of 5.6 per cent in 1990, without any visible wage moderation and indeed some modest reacceleration as the last boom got going. The answer to the puzzle is, I am afraid, that part of the fall in unemployment in the late 1980s was unsustainable. Economists who had no political axe to grind hesitated to say this for good reasons. They hoped that there had been a sufficient productivity breakthrough, and not just a temporary boom-related upsurge, to raise the warranted rate of pay growth consistent with high employment. They also hoped that the labour market had become more flexible - that is, more responsive to supply and demand changes - so that pay would respond to any required application of the economic brakes without having to endure agonies of massive unemployment first. These hopes have obviously proved too optimistic, but more definitely on labour market flexibility than on productivity. The official estimates showing annual UK labour cost increases of 11 per cent, based on a 2 per cent fall in productivity for the whole economy are as suspect as the trade figures were before the statisticians found missing invisibles (see below). Productivity has always moved with the business cycle; but the statisticians may well have underestimated even year-on-year productivity, which the CBI puts at nearly 4 per cent in manufacturing. Even with that correction, British labour costs are still rising by about 5 per cent, compared with 1 per cent in Germany. The real disappointment is that pay should have taken so long to respond to the slowdown in demand which has been going on for more than two years. Employers and unions appear to have responded not to fundamentals but to a backward-looking glance at the headline Retail Prices Index. There are two aspects of perverse labour markets. One is the rate of unemployment required to maintain in being any reasonably low and stable rate of inflation, once it has been achieved (the so-called NAIRU, or non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment). The second relates to the even higher transitional unemployment costs of moving from one rate of inflation to a lower one. Recent academic estimates of the UK NAIRU have varied from 6 per cent to 9 per cent, or 1.8m to 2.5m. Although much too high, it has, if anything, been slightly less than actual average EC unemployment. The real British disease has been the even higher transitional unemployment required to achieve each percentage point reduction in inflation. The late Sir John Hicks used to distinguish between flex-price and fix-price economies. Flex-price economies respond to a slackening of demand by reductions in pay and prices or in their rate of increase. In fix-price systems, wages and prices have a large inertia and adjustments are made by means of quantity. Stocks pile up, outside purchases are curtailed, and workers are laid off. The UK is by and large a fix-price economy. This is shown not only in the stickiness of wage inflation, but of price inflation too in many sectors. Employers respond to difficulties by cutting outside purchases, trimming staff; but they reduce list prices or wages only as a last resort. Eventually, of course, prices and margins do get trimmed and pay increases do come down to what the international competition can justify. But after a painfully long interval when many jobs have disappeared. Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs is very likely right in pointing to the parallel with the corresponding stage of the 1980 recession when both the headline RPI and pay settlements suddenly fell with astonishing speed - the latter from 16 1/2 per cent to 9 per cent in the course of the year. This time Davies expects a drop from 10 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent. The headline RPI will not, of course, be the basic cause of wage de-escalation, but the fig-leaf which will be used to justify it. But what a cost this fall in pay settlements will have exacted on both occasions. Unemployment is now rising by some 300,000 a quarter and is likely to be within spitting distance of 3m before the rise tapers off, even assuming a gradual recovery from recession from mid-year onwards. Eventually ERM membership should acquire enough credibility to speed up these adjustments. In any case a change in business culture is as important as changes in laws and incentives. The Thatcher years may have laid the ground for this change. But it has not yet happened.</p>

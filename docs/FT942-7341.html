			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Unctad's exporter database The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has launched an electronic pocket-book for exporters on CD-Rom, enabling users to call up comprehensive information on trade flows, tariffs and trade rules for more than 5,000 products in the world's main markets, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. The CD-Rom version of Unctad's Trade Analysis and Information System (Trains) unites six separate databases and includes information on 50 markets accounting for more than 85 per cent of world imports. The Trains CD-Rom 'has everything an exporter or negotiator needs to know about the market access conditions for a product,' according to Unctad. CD-Roms contain up to 650 megabytes of information, equivalent to 450 normal computer diskettes, and the falling cost of CD-Rom drives (now less than Dollars 400) has made the technology widely accessible. Trains covers tariff and non-tariff trade measures, including details of preferential schemes, detailed import data, names and addresses of importers for selected product categories and markets, and other general trade documentation.

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Malaysia may buy Dollars 700m Mig fighters THE cold war might be over but the arms race continues. For the past two days Mr Alexander Rutskoi, vice-president of Russia, has been acting as an arms salesman in Malaysia. The Malaysian air force wants a new generation of fighter aircraft. After considering French and Anglo-German-Italian fighters, the choice has come down to the Russian Mig 29, the General Dynamics F-16 or the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18. The value of the initial fighter contract is estimated at anywhere between Dollars 700m (Pounds 493m) and Dollars 1bn. This increasingly hard-nosed battle between Russia and the US comes at a time of growing defence spending in many Asian countries. Nervousness has set in following the closure of US bases in the Philippines. There is concern that conflicts might arise over ownership of the Spratlys - a group of islands in the South China Sea claimed by China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei. The increasing power of China's armed forces is worrying many in the region. China purchased nearly Dollars 2bn worth of arms from Russia last year, including advanced Su-27 fighters, and is considering buying a Russian aircraft carrier. Yesterday, in a meeting with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, Mr Rutskoi is believed to have offered to set up various spare parts and technical facilities in Malaysia for the Mig. Malaysia's defence spending is rising by more than 20 per cent this year. 'It is in our interests to see that there will be no vacuum in the region, as it may result in a new area of conflict,' says Mr Najib Abdul Razak, Malaysia's defence minister. Last month Malaysia signed a memorandum of understanding with India on defence co-operation. India, which already builds and operates the Mig 29, may help Malaysia establish its new fighter force. McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics have countered by offering what are said to be considerably reduced sale prices for their fighters. A US delegation was here last month in an effort to thwart the Russian bid. Initially the Malaysian air force is expected to buy between 16 and 20 fighters, with options on 40 more. Russia is also believed to be offering to sell Malaysia a number of its large Mig 35 helicopter gunships and a variety of other weaponry. The Russians say the Migs can be delivered within six months. US manufacturers are likely to take considerably longer. Russia is also reported to be willing to accept some form of barter payment from Malaysia for a portion of the sale - possibly palm oil. Military analysts say that by buying the Migs Malaysia would upset a growing trend towards air force co-operation inside the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean). Other Asean air forces have western equipment. If Malaysia does buy Migs it will be the first big arms sale by Russia in the Asean region. Indonesia, the Philippines and Burma are all at present being courted by Russia's arms dealers. Earlier this year Indonesia announced plans to buy 39 vessels belonging to the former East German navy, all made in what was the Soviet Union.</p>

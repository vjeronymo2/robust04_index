Different news  media have dispatched various reports that indicate new  developments in Afghanistan. On the basis of these reports, the  opponents of Borhanoddin Rabbani have made his removal from  power a pre-condition for ending the fighting in Kabul.  Analysts predict that in this way the situation in Afghanistan  is in the throes of unpredictable events. The question being  asked by analysts is whether such a demand will be.    In any case, even if power passes hands in Kabul, one cannot  expect fundamental changes to occur in the course of events in  that country. The only difference would be that the tragic  fight for power in Afghanistan would be repeated in a different  form, because none of the groups wish to reach a total and  comprehensive agreement. On the contrary, each group looks into  the future of Afghanistan only through the prism of its own  interests. One can find the evidence for this in many  agreements that have been signed during the past two years,  especially the Islamabad and Jalalabad agreements.    There is very little flexibility in the positions adopted by  various groups. The whole country is awash with weapons and  armed forces. The forces under the commands of various leaders  do not obey them in practice. The leaders themselves distrust  one another, and each agreement is invalid in the eyes of  others. The combination of these factors prevents one from  making a positive assessment about the developments in  Afghanistan.    The truth is that what the people of Afghanistan need at  present above all else is security. Any development that will  not bring about secruity for the people of Afghanistan is to be  rejected. The two-year war among various rival political and  military groups has destroyed the resources and capabilities of  Afghanistan, has denied security to the people, has caused death  and injury of thousands of people, and has turned many more  thousands into refugees. Even now one cannot look forward to a  bright future for that country.    Political analysts believe the problem of Afghanistan does  not consist in what group holds power in that country. The  problem is that whatever group comes to power in Kabul, other  groups raise the banner of opposition to it. It seems that the  only solution to this problem is for all the rival groups to  sincerely lay down their arms and to sit round a negotiation  table with the aim of achieving the interests of their country  and to disarm the irresponsible military forces. Then, each  group should accept some responsibility in proportion to its  ability and aptitude. In this context, each group should give  priority to the national interests of Afghanistan above its own  group interests. Otherwise, war will continue until all groups  are worn out. Under such circumstances, the people of  Afghanistan will be the main losers, and foreigners would impose  their conditions on them from ouside.</p>

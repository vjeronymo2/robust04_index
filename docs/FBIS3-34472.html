He saw it as a "document of national  consensus" and said that it "complements" the unity agreement  signed on 22 May 1990. But al-Bid, who was answering a written  question sent to him by AL-HAYAH about the reasons for the delay  in signing the document, pointed out that his party links  signing the document to "real and sufficient guarantees for the  implementation of its provisions." In what seemed like a  warning, he stressed that "history will not turn back," a clear  indication that the YSP refuses to return to the situation which  prevailed before he chose seclusion in Aden since 19 August.    Following is the text of al-Bid's statement explaining the  reasons which have delayed the signing of the agreement:    "First of all I wish to emphasize that the YSP considers the  Pledge and Accord Document approved by the National Dialogue  Committee to be a document representing the common vision of all  the vital forces interested in protecting unity, consolidating  the democratic experiment, and building a modern state in Yemen.    "Having been endorsed by the parties to the dialogue and  received widespread popular support, it is now a document of  national consensus in the sense that it has become the document  of all the good people in Yemen who, without doubt, are the vast  majority of the population. No views, positions, or agreements  on issues pertaining to the Yemeni homeland and people have  received such vast support as has this important agreement  which, we in the YSP believe, complements the unity agreement  signed on 22 May 1990.    "That document (the agreement) was signed by two Yemeni  national parties, namely the YSP and the General People's  Congress, but the Pledge and Accord Document was endorsed by all  the parties operating in the Yemeni national arena, and it in  effect reaffirms protection of the unity agreed on 22 May 1990  and emphasizes the importance of building the unity state, which  was not built during the transitional period and should be built  now, with its roots reaching all the depth and width of the  homeland and its edifice rising into the skies. That is why the  YSP, proceeding from its national unionist outlook and its real  interest in unity and democracy, reaffirms the need for signing  this important national document which has been called the  Pledge and Accord Document.    "Second, while emphasizing the importance of this document,  seeing it as a document which heralds a new era, putting an end  to the era and vestiges of secession and partition, the YSP is  interested in this document finding its way to serious, speedy,  practical implementation so that all aspects of life may  stabilize. Therefore, and in light of its assessment of its  past experience, it underscores -- and it has every right to do  so -- the need for real and sufficient guarantees for the  implementation of that document. The YSP now reasserts this  point which it has been emphasizing since the beginning of the  crisis and since the presentation of the known 18 points. When  these 18 points were submitted, we underlined the importance of  linking the acceptance of these points to commencement of their  implementation and the provision of sufficient guarantees for  that, including the party's proposal at the time that the  dialogue be widened to include all influential forces in the  Yemeni homeland, which later were represented in the National  Dialogue Committee.    "That is why we continue to reaffirm what we had stressed  along with all the forces really and genuinely interested in  resolving the current crisis and eliminating all the obstacles  threatening unity and democracy and their continuation.    "Third, in light of what we have just explained, we should  proceed to sign the document with the presence of guarantees for  its implementation. Anyone who rejects that in fact stands  against the will of the people. The YSP will always uphold the  will of the people, the good people of Yemen who are the vast  majority of our fine people, or rather the entire struggling  Yemeni people.    "Fourth, on the question of who is impeding the signing of  the document, it is the party placing obstacles in the way of  the provision of guarantees for the implementation of the Pledge  and Accord Document which, as I said, has been unanimously  approved by all the people. Those are in fact exposing their  true intentions of rejecting the agreement and insisting on  putting their personal narrow interests before the interests of  the people. What is important is that history will not turn  back."    Meanwhile, Salim Salih Muhammad, Presidential Council member  and YSP assistant secretary general, has stated that "the YSP  welcomes the conclusions reached by the Dialogue Committee of  the Political Forces during its meeting in Sanaa the day before  yesterday." He declared that the "party totally accepts the  committee's decision naming the Jordanian capital Amman as the  venue for the final signing of the Pledge and Accord Document."  [passage omitted]</p>

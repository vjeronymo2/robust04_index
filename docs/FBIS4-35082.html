			<p>BFN     [Text] Raymond Roy, president of the Chamber of Commerce  and Industry, issued a press release on 27 June confirming that  Haitian employers are disgusted with the latest U.S. sanctions  against Haiti. Roy points out that the list of 250 people that  was prepared following the imposition of the financial sanctions  includes handicapped people, children, and even a deceased  person, most of whom are directly or indirectly linked to the  institution. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry notes that it  is disgusted with this carefree and casual attitude and that it  stands with the victims and asks them to keep their heads high  and face this difficult period with dignity. The day will come  when the truth will be told of the dishonest maneuvers leading  to those sanctions, the press release says.</p>

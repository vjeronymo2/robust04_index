			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / EBRD to tighten budget process THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday agreed to tighten its budgetary procedures after pressure from its directors, who represent the countries and international agencies that own it. An EBRD board meeting, attended by all 23 directors, yesterday laid down new procedures for preparing the 1994 budget. A director said the most important change was that the budget-making process would begin in July, several weeks earlier than last year. In addition, the board's audit committee was directed to examine, within six weeks, allegations that the bank's Pounds 55.5m budget for fitting out its new London headquarters was excessive. The committee's investigation will include examination of the Pounds 1.25m spent on marble for the building, which includes Pounds 750,000 for replacing existing marble. A number of directors were also concerned that the bank's control of administrative costs had not been tight enough. From April 1991 to the end of last year the EBRD spent more than Pounds 200m on its running costs and fitting out its building. The bank's president, Mr Jacques Attali, will today meet Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister and chairman of the EBRD's governors, in Bonn. An EBRD director said he 'could not imagine' that Mr Waigel would ask Mr Attali to resign. He added that although Mr Waigel did not want to ignore German public opinion that the bank's costs should be tightly controlled, he was anxious to avoid any public blood-letting before the annual meeting later this week. Germany's stance on the EBRD is particularly sensitive in view of Mr Attali's close links with President Francois Mitterrand. Any suggestion that Bonn was seriously displeased with Mr Attali's stewardship of the bank could have deep repercussions on the Franco-German relationship. Mr Waigel and Mr Attali are expected to concentrate on discussing the general operations of the bank, rather than going into detail on the allegations of EBRD overspending.</p>

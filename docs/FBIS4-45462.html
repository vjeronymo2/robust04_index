			<p>CSO     [Text] Ahmedabad, May 14 (The Times of India News  Service) -- The investigation into the seizure of Mandrax  tablets worth over Rs 55 crores by the directorate of revenue  intelligence (DRI) from trucks, on the Rajkot-Junagadh highway  during the early hours of Wednesday has revealed that a  notorious smuggler, Haji Haji Ismail, who was also involved in  arms smuggling, was the alleged brain behind the transportation  of the tablets, according to DRI sources.    The place of seizure was falsely declared to be on the  highway near Jamnagar by top DRI officials for operational  reasons. In fact, the trucks were intercepted near Jetpur on the  Rajkot-Junagadh highway around 6 a.m. on Wednesday.    DRI sources said that the involvement of Haji Haji Ismail  came to light during the interrogation of the four persons,  Yusuf Rajak, Dhimaraj Gadhvi, Dinesh Harijan and Suda Hussain,  who were detained from the trucks.    The truck drivers disclosed the names of the two  transporters  of Jamnagar, Khafi alias Karo Gafar Suleman and Ali Sumra, who  provided the trucks for transporting the Mandrax tablets. They  were also the main transporters involved in arms smuggling of  Haji Haji Ismail a year ago.    The DRI officials raided the premises of Khafi and Ali in  Jamnagar. Both the culprits are absconding for the past one  year. Haji Haji Ismail and his two transporters, Khafi and Ali,  are also wanted in some of the cases being investigated by the  Jamnagar police.    The investigation revealed that the trucks were sent from  Jamnagar by Khafi and Ali on May 9 to Visavadar town for lifting  the steel drums containing Mandrax tablets. The trucks reached a  particular farm on the outskirts of the Visavadar town, where  the drums were hidden by some associates of Haji Haji Ismail.  The name of the owner of the farm has been kept secret by the  officials.    The drums were loaded into the two trucks by the four  drivers  and around 100 wheat bags were used by the culprits to cover the  drums. The trucks left for Jamnagar late at night on May 10. It  was further revealed that the drums were to be sent to Bangalore  in vessels through Salaya Port with the help of some of the  landing agents.</p>

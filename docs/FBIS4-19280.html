			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 14 (A.A.) -- Interior Minister Nahit  Mentese on Thursday [14 April] said that Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad assured him that if necessary PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] terrorists near the border would be arrested.    He was speaking to reporters in the plane on his way back  from Syria where he met with al-Asad to discuss security issues.    Mentese said that he has also asked for the return of the  chief of the PKK terrorist organization, Abdullah Ocalan.    During the three-hour meeting, al-Asad brought up the  subject  of water, to which Mentese said that there was no need to worry  on this issue.    He said that he has stressed time and time again that the  terrorist chief is organizing ethnic groups in Turkey by  ordering them either from Syria or Lebanon, but al-Asad neither  confirmed nor rejected this.    "At the leaders" level, Turkey has asked for the return of  the PKK terrorist chief and the members of the terrorist  organization,' he said.    Mentese said Greece is among those backing the PKK and it  was  determined that that country is making efforts to hinder Turkish  tourism and this is an inhuman behavior.    "It does not fit friendly or neighborly relations," he  added.</p>

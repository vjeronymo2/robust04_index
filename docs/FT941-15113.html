			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Heineken withdraws from spirits Heineken, the Dutch brewer, is to withdraw from its last remaining activity in spirits by selling its share of a distillery joint venture to its partner, the Dutch food and beverages group Bols Wessanen. Bols Benelux, a 50/50 joint venture, was set up in 1989 as a way for both companies to combat the decline in consumption of spirits. The venture, the biggest distiller in the Netherlands with brands such as Bols, Bokma and Coebergh, is managed by Bols Wessanen, which wanted 100 per cent control so that it can pursue further international expansion. Heineken, which expects to book an unspecified extraordinary gain on the transaction, noted that distilled spirits were always a small part of its total business, which is firmly focused on brewing beer.</p>

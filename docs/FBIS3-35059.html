Because they all failed to refer to the law. If  they did, the situation in the country would not have reached  its present state."    This came in an exclusive statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT by  the Yemeni minister, in a discussion of the legal and  constitutional dimensions of Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas' decision to appoint Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad -- one of  former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad's men, former Abyan  governor, and an uncooperative member of the General People's  Congress [GPC] General Committee (Political Bureau) -- as  governor of Abyan again, and the Presidential Council's decision  revoking al-'Attas' decision a few hours later. He described  the two decisions as "bombs and rockets" in a battle whose two  parties are about to meet in Amman to sign the Pledge and Accord  Document.    Karman stressed that "Yemen is not governed by the law, but  by political quarrels." [passage omitted]    He added: "They insulted the decisions and laws, and hence  themselves. Because they -- the authorities -- are responsible  for the decisions and for implementing the laws. And neither  history nor the people will have mercy on them." He urged GPC  and Socialist Party leaders to "have mercy on the Yemeni people  and refer to the law." He accused all those who signed the  Pledge and Accord Document of "violating legitimacy and  forgetting the signal of the parliamentary elections held on 27  April, which resulted in the formation of the present House of  Representatives and hence the ruling coalition."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Lubbers Withdraws'"] </F>   [Text] Brussels/Bonn -- During yesterday's European  Peoples' Party (EPP) summit in Brussels, Prime Minister Lubbers  is said to have agreed to withdraw his candidacy for the  presidency of the European Commission tomorrow evening.    German participants at the EPP summit consultation say that  Lubbers does not want to risk a tough confrontation at the Corfu  summit since he does not stand a chance against Belgian Prime  Minister Dehaene.    The EPP summit agreed that as soon as a substantial majority  is reached in favor of one of the candidates at the European  Union summit, the one who looks likely to lose will withdraw.    In this way a consensus can be reached on who should succeed  Frenchman Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission.    The EPP did not agree to promote any Community  Christian-Democratic candidates. Before the meeting began,  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called on Lubbers and Dehaene to  embrace "so show that we are all friends."</p>

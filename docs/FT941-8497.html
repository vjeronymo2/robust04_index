			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Societies hit by big outflow of retail funds Personal savers seeking better returns on their money contributed to a net outflow of retail funds from building societies for the first January ever, according to figures released yesterday by the Building Societies Association. The association said net receipts last month fell by Pounds 265m compared with a Pounds 363m inflow in January 1992. Mr Adrian Coles, the association's director-general, attributed part of the outflow to the launch of the pensioners guaranteed income bond during January, and warned it was likely to have an impact on the figures for February as well. 'Further pressure on building society accounts will occur in February as the second instalment on the British Telecom third share issue falls due on March 1,' he added. The figures underscore continuing difficulties for societies in attracting retail funds, at a time of low interest rates, against competition from savings products such as unit trusts. In each of the last two quarters of 1993, societies suffered a net outflow of funds. In November not even the interest credited to accounts could prevent a fall in total retail funds for only the second time in societies' history. Some societies are not too worried about the state of the retail savings market because demand for mortgages is so slack they do not need to raise large amounts of retail funds. If there were a significant increase in mortgage demand while interest rates remained low then societies might have to turn more to the wholesale markets for funds. At present, wholesale funds are cheaper than retail deposits. There is, however, a regulatory limit on the proportion of wholesale funds that societies can raise, though none is close to it yet. More evidence of competition in mortgage lending came in falls for gross mortgage lending and net new commitments. Gross mortgage lending fell from Pounds 2.7bn in December to Pounds 2.1bn last month, while net new commitments fell to Pounds 1.8bn from Pounds 2.1bn. But net advances - the difference between gross mortgage lending and repayments - increased to Pounds 672m. Personal finance, Page IV</p>

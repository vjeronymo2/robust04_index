Senior officials from the Defense Agency [DA] and the  Chinese Ministry of National Defense [CMND] will hold talks in  Beijing on 1 March. Officials of the Russian Ministry of  Defense [MD] will visit Japan on 28 March for exchanges on  defense studies with Japanese officials. Because Japan and  China have not held regular security consultations before, they  intend to take the opportunity to build a regular and continuous  framework for exchange of views.    Among those who will attend the Japan-China security talks  are: Ken Sato, DA's defense councilor; Toshimasa Fujiwara, chief  of the fifth section of the DA Joint Staff Council; and senior  CMND officials. They will exchange views on the whole situation  in the Asia-Pacific region, including the DPRK's (North Korea's)  suspected nuclear development. The prevailing view within the  DA is that "China will become the largest unstable factor in the  Asian region from a medium-to-long perspective," (as stated by a  senior DA official). At the time of the upcoming talks, the DA  intends to establish a stage for dialogue with Chinese military  authorities to promote mutual understanding.    Defense study exchanges between Japan and Russia are hosted  alternately by DA's National Institute for Defense Studies and  the Military Strategic Center under the Russian General Staff  Office. The upcoming exchanges will be the third case and will  also be the first since February last year. Russian officials  who will visit Japan include: Lukyanov, acting chief of the  International Treaty Directorate of the General Staff Office,  and Zolotorev, chief of MD's Information Analysis Center.</p>

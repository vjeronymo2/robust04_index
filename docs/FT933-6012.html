			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / China's wounded spirits It is Saturday night in a gloomy Beijing hall. Dozens of men and women line the walls, observing and chatting while a few couples waltz to the music of Strauss. This is a Beijing singles club, and the atmosphere could hardly be further removed from the raucous karaoke bar culture that has mushroomed in Chinese cities: nor does the scene bear much relation to the image of modern China projected by the media. To an extent, the club is a casualty ward of the enormous social change sweeping China that is producing its share of wounded spirits and broken dreams. Madam Wen, a 37-year-old accountant, becomes tearful as she explains that, after 12 years of marriage, her husband has abandoned her for another woman. 'Traditional values are being swept away,' she says. Madam Wang Xingjuan, a women's activist and founder of the Beijing singles club, believes that, while economic liberalisation and opening to the outside world have brought many benefits to China, some women have been victims of change. For a start, the divorce rate has gone up sharply, especially in urban centres like Beijing, rising from 2.1 per cent of marriages in 1981 to 17.7 per cent in 1992. Nationally, marriage failures reached 8.7 per cent last year, low by international standards, but a big increase on previous rates and still rising. One of the main causes of the rapid increase in the divorce rate, according to Madam Wang, is growing affluence, which is loosening family bonds. 'Men are better off and are looking for lovers. They are losing their sense of responsibility,' she says. 'They are being influenced by western television programmes with their sexy scenes. Extramarital sex is commonplace.' Prostitution on a fairly big scale has also returned to Chinese cities, perhaps further complicating family relationships. According to Madam Wang, some 200,000 prostitutes were detained last year throughout China, but she estimates that numbers of prostitutes nationwide exceed 1m. Reaction to a National Women's Hot Line reveals a widespread desperation among urban women over the enormous change in their lives. While life might have been fairly drab in the past, there was more certainty, more stability. Forty per cent of callers wish to talk about marriage problems, including divorce. Madam Wang and her assistants urge conciliation, but if the marriage has broken down irretrievably they advocate divorce, which has become much simpler in China since the passage in 1980 of a new divorce law. Previously, social and political pressures, plus the difficulty of securing legal approval for a divorce, had condemned many unhappy couples to stay together. During the Mao era divorce was denounced as bourgeois, and the careers of those who dared to separate were jeopard-ised. Madam Chen Yiyun, a sociologist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and one of China's leading researchers on women's issues, says that, before China's opening to the outside world in 1978, there were basically two categories of women: urban and rural. Now she identifies four types of urban women. These include those who have gone into business themselves or who work for joint venture companies; middle-aged women who are relatively uneducated and who have most difficulty coping with change; professional women who are established and do not feel threatened by the changes; and older women whose marriages and lives are fairly settled, and therefore are relatively unaffected. It is women in the second category who are proving most vulnerable. 'Many of these middle-aged women feel lost and confused,' says Madam Chen. 'Many have worked in state-run factories, but have been fired. It's very hard for them to find a job, and start a new life.' Estimates suggest there are 20m excess labourers in Chinese factories, 70 per cent of whom are women. Another problem in urban Chinese society is the surfeit of well-educated single women, and this in turn is adding to pressures on existing families. This excess of women in their 30s and early 40s can be attributed to several factors, among them that many young men sent to the countryside in the 1960s during the Cultural Revolution never returned to the cities. Thousands of men have also drifted away from cities like Beijing to make their fortunes in the booming southern coastal towns like Shenzhen and Hainan island. Of the 1,000 members of the Beijing singles club, 60 per cent are women, and almost all are professionals. Most, if not all, are looking for a husband. Typical is 39-year-old Miss Sun, a magazine editor, who feels under pressure from her family to marry, but has been unable to find the right man. 'The situation is difficult for women today in Chinese society,' she says. 'We are still governed by traditional values, where society looks up to men and down on women. In the allocation of housing, for example, women are always last to get their own place.' Miss Sun is obliged to live in a dormitory, sharing a room with another girl. Madam Chen says that while it seems that men have benefited from the radical changes in Chinese society more than women, many men are feeling stressed by the pressures of the new consumer age. 'You get so much, earn so much, but you also sacrifice so much,' she says. 'Men are complaining that their wives are buying more clothes and cosmetics. Before, men did not feel so pressured.' At the Beijing club each Saturday, couples in their best clothes dance on, hoping that this might be their lucky day.</p>

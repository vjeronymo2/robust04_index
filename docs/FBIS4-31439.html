"In a way, this is the government proposed by Mr. Qiriazati  in his letter for Micotaqis," the newspaper stresses, going on  that the program of the government publishes since two years ago  in the Greek papers and in a part of the Albanian ones, which  stay silent now just like a person who feels guilty, waiting  anxiously for any possible exposition of any duty charged them  by this government.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- A pro-Pyongyang of Koreans  living in Japan said Wednesday [15 June] it will urge police to  probe and take preventive measures against the growing number of  discriminatory acts they are encountering [sentence as received].    The General Association of Korean Residents in Japan  (Chongnyon) announced the move after issuing a statement showing  some 120 discriminatory cases reported since April. The cases  include verbal abuse and physical harassment such as knifing of  clothing worn by Korean students. Female students of schools  run by Chongnyon wear traditional Korean clothes for uniforms,  which could make them a target.    Chongnyon called the situation "vicious violence," comparing  it to the aftermath of the 1923 great Kanto earthquake, in which  many Koreans were killed. Chongnyon officials told a news  conference that discriminatory actions have noticeably increased  since March in line with the international focus on North  Korea's suspected nuclear arms development. The number of such  actions reported to Chongnyon's Tokyo headquarters totaled about  25 in April, but jumped to about 45 in May and some 50 for the  first half of June, the officials said.</p>

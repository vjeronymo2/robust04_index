			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Trade and the World Economy (34): A host of future problems - Population / Bronwen Maddox analyses results of the Cairo conference Alarm and hope: those are governments' twin reactions to the latest batch of projections from the United Nations on how many people will be occupying the planet in the next century. One message behind the figures is that high population growth in developing countries remains a threat to their prosperity, and through migration, to that of developed countries as well. But other messages are that growing populations need not represent the apocalypse which has been predicted by many, and that there is much governments can do to slow down the increase. This month's UN conference on population and development in Cairo, the first to tackle the contentious subject for a decade, stirred up controversy on many fronts. The Vatican formally registered its reservations to nearly half the chapters in the final text, on the grounds that it condoned abortion as a form of contraception. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), which organised the conference, denied that the text had that interpretation, but several Catholic countries in Latin America also lodged reservations to sections. However, despite an informal alliance between the Vatican and Moslem governments in the run-up to Cairo, governments achieved a much greater degree of agreement at Cairo on responses to the threat of population growth than seemed possible at the previous UN conferences in 1984 or 1974. The final document set a target for annual spending on family planning of Dollars 17bn a year by 2000, from national programmes and international aid, which marks a threefold increase on present levels. Most governments acknowledged at Cairo that it is in their own interest to take steps to help people limit the sizes of their families, given the formidable projections of the world's population. According to the UNFPA's annual report, published in August, the total is set to reach a sobering 10bn by the middle of the next century, up from 5.7bn at present. The UNFPA's projection assumes that the average number of children born to each woman will continue to fall, as it has done for several decades; other assumptions, only slightly different, produce estimates of the total number of people in 2050 between 7.8bn and 12.5bn. These increases will put increasing strains on natural resources of all kinds, both global resources, such as the atmosphere and seas, and regional. Water, in particular, may prove 'an increasing cause of friction' between countries and regions, the UNFPA suggests. The implications of these projections for the distribution of wealth between countries and continents are also considerable. The World Bank estimates, in a report released ahead of Cairo, that 61 per cent of the world's population will live in countries with per capita incomes of below Dollars 350 a year (in 1990 money values). That compares with 57 per cent in 1985. Over the same period, the proportion of people living in countries with per capita incomes over Dollars 19,590 will fall from 16 per cent to 11 per cent. Moreover, the bank warns that by 2100, 10 out of 11 people will live in the developing world, compared to four out of five at present, and two out of three in 1950. Much of the increase will come in Africa: the present annual growth in the continent's population of 2.9 per cent a year is the highest in the world. That rate outstrips by some way the annual Asian and Latin American growth of less than 2 per cent, according to the UNFPA. Within developing countries, people will drift to the cities in search of jobs, prompted by competition for land and water in rural areas. The World Bank estimates that in 2025, 57 per cent of the population in developing countries will live in cities, compared to less than half now. As a result of those pressures, developed countries should prepare to face growing pressures for immigration, the bank warns. As their populations are growing slowly, they should expect their share of the world's population to shrink. While North America's population is edging up at 1 per cent a year, the rate is only 0.5 per cent a year in the former Soviet Union and 0.3 per cent a year in western Europe. Meanwhile, their populations are ageing: the UNFPA expects the proportion of people aged 65 and over in industrialised countries to rise from the present 12.7 per cent to 18.4 per cent by 2025. To set against those threats, UN figures provide some ammunition to counter fears of a global food shortage, of the kind voiced by the 'Club of Rome' school of forecasters some 20 years ago. The UNFPA observes that 'during the past 10 years, the world's food production has increased by 24 per cent, outpacing the rate of population growth'. But the improvement in food production has been unevenly distributed, the UNFPA also points out. In Africa, food production fell by 5 per cent while population rose by a third. While the UN maintains that food supplies 'should be sufficient to meet all needs for the foreseeable future', the poorer regions and countries will face severe shortages. Reason to worry, then; but the past two decades also provide grounds for hope that governments can help bring down population growth rates. Most developing countries - even, in the past few years, those in sub-Saharan Africa - have seen fertility rates fall. According to UNFPA officials, a decade ago many African countries saw growing populations as a useful tool to increase prosperity. Now, seeing the growth jeopardise the fruits of investment in health, education, infrastructure and agriculture, they are showing a greater readiness to promote family planning. The UNFPA says that governments now appreciate that making contraception more widely available helps bring down fertility rates, even if economic development has been slow. Demographers' new message is that if people are given the means to control the number of children they have, even in the poorest countries they frequently choose to have fewer. The past decade has shown governments the threat which uncurbed population growth can pose to prosperity. But it has also helped generate confidence among governments that growth rates can be tackled, and broad agreement on ways to do that.</p>

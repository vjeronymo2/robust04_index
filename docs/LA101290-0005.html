			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAVE WE DULLED OUR EDGE?;  </P> <P> THOSE DISTRESSING REPORTS FROM THE GULF ON EQUIPMENT UNRELIABILITY  </P> <P> The Pentagon likes to say that U.S. armed forces are the best equipped in the  world. Americans can only hope that evaluation is right, more than ever now  that some 200,000 U.S. members of those forces in the Persian Gulf area are  facing the prospect that their equipment could be put to wartime tests.  </P> <P> What's best, though, isn't necessarily determined only by high cost or  technical complexity. Above all, the tools of war must be reliable. Troubling  questions have arisen about the reliability of certain key weapons, questions  that may have been given even more ominous significance by the recent spate of  air crashes in Saudi Arabia that forced a temporary grounding of all training  flights.  </P> <P> A new congressional report, for example, finds that at any given time only half  the Army's Apache helicopter fleet is ready to do its job, against the Army's  goal of having 70% of its Apaches "mission capable." That goal is being  defeated by breakdowns that on average require major maintenance on the copters  every 2 1/2 hours. The Apache, armed with anti-tank weapons, is being heavily  counted on in the event of war to offset Iraq's large numerical superiority in  armor.  </P> <P> Army specifications call for the M1-A1 tank to be able to operate for 101  minutes without a mechanical or electronic failure. In practice, something  breaks down in an M1-A1 every 21 minutes. The catalogue of failed expectations  doesn't stop here. The Air Force has problems with some of its advanced planes,  the Navy with some of its ships.  </P> <P> Some of the reasons have long since been identified: Technological and  performance goals that were set too high by the military itself, sloppy work  and -- as we now know -- in some cases flagrantly dishonest testing and  evaluation procedures by military contractors. The consequences, whatever the  primary cause, are equally worrisome. American armed forces are depending for  their success and maybe even their survival on a qualitative edge that in some  cases may prove not to be there.  </P></p>

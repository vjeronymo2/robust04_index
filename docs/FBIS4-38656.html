			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 31, RIA -- The assassination of  Lieutenant-Colonel Vladimir Borisenkov, a senior staff member of  Russian frontier troops in Tajikistan, has been described as  "vile and filthy" by the Russian Foreign Ministry.    Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin, who  read  out the document at a news briefing for journalists, noted that  this was not the first act of terrorism against Russian  servicemen.    "These acts are planned and executed," said the diplomat,  "by  those who are not interested in defusing the situation in  Tajikistan and who want to drive a wedge in Russian-Tajik  relations".    The statement points to the need for the Tajik authorities  thoroughly to investigate the murder, and catch and punish the  perpetrators. The Foreign Ministry expressed condolences to  Borisenkov's relatives.    Russian diplomatic sources told RIA that within minutes of  the act becoming known, Emomali Rakhmonov, the Tajik head of  state, phoned to the Russian frontier troop headquarters and  said all measures would be taken to catch the criminals and  asked to convey condolences to the family of the killed man.</p>

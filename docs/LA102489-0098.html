			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OSTRICHES FIND HOME ON THE RANGE, HELP RANCHERS FEATHER THEIR NESTS  </P> <P> A 9-foot-tall male ostrich is a strange sight in the West Texas oil fields,  especially when it's trying to scare interlopers and attract females, but to  Cooper Campbell, there's gold in them there quills.  </P> <P> "Careful," he said, handing a visitor an off-white, pebbly surfaced, 3  1/2-pound ostrich egg the size of a human baby's head. "That's worth $1,500."  </P> <P> If the egg is fertile and the embryo survives its 42-day incubation and the  chick survives the critical first three months -- the odds of everything going  right are about 50% at best -- the 2-foot-tall baby bird can command more than  $5,000.  </P> <P> A pair of fertile, productive adults can bring $30,000 to $50,000.  </P> <P> Campbell is manager of the Yellow Rose Ostrich Ranch south of Odessa, part of a  business taking its first steps in the United States.  </P> <P> Potential profits attract ranchers all over the country, especially in Texas,  Oklahoma and the Pacific Northwest, although the hardy birds can be raised in  almost every state and even above the Arctic Circle in Canada.  </P> <P> Just a few years ago, ostriches in the United States could be found only in  zoos and in the pastures of exotic-animal collectors. Now the U.S. commercial  ostrich population is 4,000 to 8,000, said Tom Mantzel, executive director of  the Fort Worth-based American Ostrich Assn.  </P> <P> "It's growing, growing, growing at a phenomenal clip," said Mantzel, who  promotes the ostrich industry with a preacher's zeal. About 500 ranchers belong  to the organization, three-quarters of them in Texas. Most of the rest are in  Oklahoma.  </P> <P> Mantzel estimated the country's adult ostrich population will have to reach at  least 75,000 before it makes economic sense to slaughter them for their hide,  feathers and meat. Until then, which he estimates will be in the mid-1990s, the  birds are more valuable as breeders.  </P> <P> The hide is used to make western boots, belts, other items of clothing and  luggage. The feathers are used in dusters. South Africans and Europeans eat the  meat, which looks, feels and tastes like beef and is low in cholesterol and  fat.  </P> <P> Ostriches are slaughtered at 12 to 14 months, when they weigh about 300 pounds  and carry about 80 pounds of meat. The hide, feathers and meat are worth $400  to $500, Mantzel said.  </P></p>

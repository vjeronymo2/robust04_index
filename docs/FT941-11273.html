			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Kleinwort trust oversubscribed The public offer for Kleinwort Benson's European Privatisation Investment Trust was more than Pounds 380m (Dollars 575m) oversubscribed, confirming its position as the largest UK investment trust launch. Applications for Pounds 560m-worth of shares were received during the public offer, which closed on Wednesday, giving the fund a potential size of Pounds 880m, as Pounds 320m had already been raised through an institutional placing, but it was capped at Pounds 500m. However, the Mercury European Privatisation Trust, which closed its placing on Wednesday, has set its maximum size at Pounds 575m, so it could soon beat Kleinwort's record. The Mercury fund raised Pounds 325m in its placing, and is seeking a further Pounds 100m from an intermediaries offer, closing on February 25, and Pounds 150m from a public offer, closing on March 2. Applications for shares in the Kleinwort trust are being scaled back by about two-thirds. Mr Simon White, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Trusts, said the company was disappointed not to be able to satisfy demand in full, but it believed that Pounds 500m was an appropriate size given the state of development and liquidity of the target investment area. If all the disappointed investors from the Kleinwort offer now apply for the Mercury fund, it will also be oversubscribed. Investors who applied for the minimum 2,000 Kleinwort shares will receive 700. Applications for up to 2m shares will be allocated approximately 31.45 per cent, and applications for more than 2m shares will receive 31.45 per cent of the first 2m and 25 per cent thereafter. Shares in the trust are partly paid, with 50 per cent paid initially and the balance due on August 1. One free warrant will be issued with every five shares. Interim share certificates and cheques for returned balances will be sent out on February 8, and dealings in the ordinary shares and separate warrants are due to start on February 9.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Dutch bank sells 400 tonnes of gold THE DUTCH central bank surprised the gold market yesterday by revealing it had sold one quarter of the gold in its reserves - some 400 tonnes, equivalent to about 20 per cent of all gold mined in the western world last year. This intensified fears that the central banks, with 35,500 tonnes of official gold in their vaults - or 15 years' output from today's mines  - would become important suppliers of the metal to the market and hold back price rises. The market, already plunged into gloom because the gold price in US dollars started 1993 at the lowest level for seven years, initially reacted with relief that so much gold had been absorbed without causing more disturbance. At yesterday's prices the gold sold by the Dutch central bank was worth Dollars 4.3bn. The gold price closed in London at Dollars 330.05 a troy ounce, up Dollars 2.70. 'There is a strong, steady demand for gold that ought to take the price higher, but this supply from a non-traditional source is limiting the upward potential,' said Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, part of Banque Bruxelles Lambert. Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, said the Dutch central bank had acted 'after several months' deliberation' so 'this was not a panic sale. It was premeditated. It was strategic, not tactical, yet the bank sold when the price was near seven-year lows. The gold market will be asking: which bank will be next?' The Dutch bank was following the example set by Belgium which sold 127 tonnes of gold from its reserves in March 1990, and 202 tonnes last June. A Dutch central bank official said the gold was sold last year through the London market to bring Dutch gold reserves into line with those of other main gold-holding countries. Permission for the sale was received from the Finance Ministry at the end of October and the price was an average of Fl 18,000 a kilo. Analysts said this suggested the dollar price was between Dollars 324 and Dollars 334 an ounce. They believed some of the Dutch gold was bought by another central bank. The sale reduced gold from 59 per cent to 40 per cent of the Dutch bank's total reserves. Prices, Page 26</p>

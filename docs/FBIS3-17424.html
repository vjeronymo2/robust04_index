Implementation of the Federal Budget in the First  Quarter of 1994 Analyzed"]    [Text] The Russian Government has analyzed the conduct of  the budget policy in the first quarter of this year and sent a  note on the matter to the State Duma. This document notes in  particular that state expenditure was funded mainly from tax  revenue to the tune of 8.5 trillion rubles [R] and Central Bank  credits to cover the deficit totaling R7.5 trillion. The issue  of state securities provided the budget with R1.1 trillion.  Another R1.6 trillion was collected from additional sources.    As of 15 March, R13.1 trillion out of the R17.6 trillion  expected during the first quarter had been allocated from the  federal budget to fund expenditure.    A priority sphere of state policy in the sphere of  expenditure was the funding of measures ensuring the social  protection of the population, and also giving support to  individual sectors of the national economy. According to  preliminary data, in the first quarter industry received R909  billion; R969 billion went into state investments; R1,109  billion into social and cultural measures; R3,627 billion into  defense; and R1,077 billion into the law enforcement organs.  Territorial budgets received considerable support -- R2,080  billion.    Moreover government experts note that the 1994 budget is  being implemented in the face of continuing negative trends in  the economy: The decline in production is continuing, and  reciprocal unpaid debts are increasing. For these reasons, tax  payers are delaying the transfer of funds into the federal  budget. During January-February, payments to the tune of R4.7  trillion came into the treasury. In March the total will not  exceed R3.3 trillion.    The extreme strain on the budget can in many respects be  attributed to the poor financial discipline displayed not only  by enterprises but also by certain Federation components. Thus,  in January 1994 Bashkiria's [Bashkortostan's] arrears to the  treasury were R52 billion, Tataria's [Tatarstan's] -- R37  billion, and Yakutia's -- R32 billion. Apart from that, over  R20 billion of income from foreign economic activity was paid  into territorial budgets, whereas these funds should have been  paid into the federal budget in their entirety.    According to the Finance Ministry specialists, the  implementation of the budget in the first quarter can be called  more or less stable. Neither the government nor the State Duma  adopted decisions which might "blow up" the expenditure entries.  This enabled the financiers not to go beyond the limits of the  credit emission established by presidential edict back in 1993.  At the same time, admittedly, it must be borne in mind that  despite the promise given by the head of the Cabinet to settle  accounts fully with the peasants and defense industry workers in  terms of last year's debts (R4.6 trillion), it did not prove  possible to do so.    Millions of Russians have experienced for themselves the  results of the moderately tough credit-monetary policy and the  government's fairly successful maneuvers between the threats and  demands of sectoral and regional lobbyists -- primarily through  the reduction in the rate of inflation. As compared with  January, the increase in prices in February-March fell to a  record low of 9.9 percent. For the first time the increase in  wages, which reached 10 percent in February, overtook inflation.    The Finance Ministry experts call the relative regulation of  the funding of the social sphere a second achievement. This  should be understood to include the prompt payment of wages to  people whose work is funded from the budget, a growth in social  allowances for children and invalids, and support for  institutions of higher education. It is noted in addition that  the majority of expenditure on the social sphere is borne by  local budgets, whose state is far from the optimum. The  discrepancy between the local and federal income and expenditure  entries in budgets is often the reason for "failures" in  funding, which causes people rightful dissatisfaction.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / BCCI fraudster is jailed: Judge mitigates Virani sentence Mr Nazmudin Virani, the former property entrepreneur convicted of fraud over his business dealings with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, was jailed for 2 1/2 years at the Old Bailey yesterday. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Hutchison said the gravity of the offences Mr Virani had been found guilty of demanded an immediate prison sentence. However, the judge said the mitigating circumstances in Mr Virani's case, such as his charity work and impressive character references, meant he was reducing the sentence from the level he had initially considered. These references included one from Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, commending Mr Virani's work for the Asian community. Mr Virani was convicted earlier this month of six counts of furnishing false information to Price Waterhouse, the BCCI auditors, and one of false accounting. By signing bogus audit confirmation reports which deceived Price Waterhouse and pretended companies in the Virani group owed money to BCCI, Mr Virani was able artificially to boost BCCI's profits by some Pounds 11m. Mr Justice Hutchison said that in the context of the massive fraud perpetrated by BCCI and its senior management, the offences committed by Mr Virani were relatively modest. However, their gravity was demonstrated by the fact that he had deceived Price Waterhouse into thinking the bank's financial health was far greater than it was. Other people had contributed to the fraud on a much grander scale, the judge said. Yet he told Mr Virani: 'I cannot exclude the possibility that yours was the brick in the wall that kept the edifice standing longer than it would have done otherwise.' There was also no doubt that Mr Virani had benefited from the fraud by receiving very favourable treatment from BCCI, he said. The judge did not disqualify Mr Virani from being a company director in future and dismissed a claim by the businessman's lawyers that prison would 'break' him. 'I don't believe that. I believe you are of sterner stuff. I believe that on your release you will resume an honest and useful life in the business community,' he told Mr Virani. Earlier, he had said that Mr Virani had earned considerable respect for the way he had built up a successful business career after being expelled from Uganda. 'That fact makes all the more tragic your fall,' he said. The judge also made no order for Mr Virani to pay part of the Pounds 2.2m costs incurred by the Serious Fraud Office in bringing the prosecution. The court heard that although Mr Virani had two Swiss bank accounts containing a total of Pounds 3.6m, these had both been frozen and his debts to the BCCI liquidators totalled almost Pounds 7m. His Pounds 800,000 house in south London had been transferred into his wife's name in 1992. Mr Virani's lawyers afterwards said that they intended to appeal against both his conviction and sentence.</p>

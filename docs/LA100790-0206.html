			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUELING LAWSUITS OVER DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> Here is depressing food for thought after reading the latest article on dueling  lawsuits between the understanding members of the Los Angeles City Council and  the caring members of the Culver City City Council.  </P> <P> Why don't they ask the hundreds of residents who live within a mile of the  Marina Place Project and the Channel Gateway Project how they feel about these  projects? Ask the parents of small children about the increased traffic.  </P> <P> Ask the elderly who are worried about crime. Ask the healthy and not-so-healthy  about air pollution. Ask the city about sanitation problems.  </P> <P> This is quite sad, isn't it? The ones who fought the hardest for the welfare of  their neighborhood can only idly stand by and watch as our faithful politicians  hold grudge matches against each other.  </P> <P> Isn't the bottom line who is going to reap all the revenues? I think we know  who is going to benefit the least!  </P> <P> JILL PRESTUP  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Accord over aerospace subsidies The world's aircraft-producing countries agreed yesterday to exchange information on the aid they give their industries, after failing to make progress on European demands that the US accept tighter international disciplines on indirect subsidies to civil aircraft. It is hoped the information can be collated by September, and discussed at the committee's next meeting scheduled for late October. However, officials are increasingly pessimistic about prospects for reaching a Gatt agreement to limit indirect industry aid, such as defence-related support, in the face of US resistance. In bilateral talks with US negotiators this week, EU officials also strongly criticised Washington's subsidies for a supersonic civil aircraft project and its role in winning a large civil aircraft order from Saudi Arabia this year.</p>

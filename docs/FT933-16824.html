			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Late rise sees Footsie close at 2,900 THE LAST trading session of the half-year saw UK equities stage a strong late move to regain the 2,900-level on the FT-SE 100 index, shrugging off the effects of what was initially seen as a disappointing outcome to the latest gilt auction. The catalyst for the recovery in equities was the announcement in the early afternoon of Hanson's acquisition for Dollars 3.2bn of Quantum Chemical, the US polyethylene manufacturer and the subsequent rally in gilt-edged stocks after the market had time to rethink its views of the gilt auction. In Germany the Bundesbank lowered its repurchase rate from 7.59 per cent to 7.58 per cent, a move which did nothing to dispel market hopes that a reduction in Germany's key discount and Lombard interest rates could be on the cards today when the Bundesbank's policy making council meets in Leipzig. Senior dealers in London said the faltering recovery in the US and the French unemployment figures pointed to further reductions in international interest rates. 'Even if the Germans don't cut tomorrow, they will before July is out,' said one trader. The FT-SE 100 opened around two points easier, unsettled by Wall Street's overnight decline, but quickly moved into positive territory during the first hour of trading following an upturn in the FT-SE future and the appearance of some keen buying interest in the leaders, notably in the financial sectors. However, news that the record Pounds 3.25bn gilts auction was subscribed for only 1.1 times, against expectations of 1.5 to 2 times, undermined confidence in gilts which came under pressure before staging a good rally. Only marginally higher over the lunchtime period, the FT-SE 100 moved into overdrive when the Hanson acquisition news was announced. The index settled 14.0 up at exactly 2,900 at the close, easily outpacing the more sluggish FT-SE Mid-250 index, although the latter kept up its good run, ending the day 6.6 higher at a peak 3,235.7. Turnover in equities totalled 550.4m shares, marginally down on Tuesday's level. After dipping below the Pounds 1bn on Monday, the value of customer business in the market increased to Pounds 1.1bn on Tuesday, according to Stock Exchange figures. The market's latest newcomer, Devro International, staged a sizzling debut, at one point racing up to a 26p premium on the 170p flotation price before easing back. Bank shares raced higher, led by Barclays after a joint research document prepared by Robert Flemings and Dun and Bradstreet focused on the 63 per cent proportion of Barclays' property book in the South East. TSB moved higher amid dubious stories that the bank's Hill Samuel merchant bank was about to be sold for Pounds 780m. Standard Chartered stood out as a lone poor performer in the banks, following rumours that Lloyds may be about to unload its 4.68 per cent stake, acquired during its unsuccessful takeover bid for standard in the 1980's. Traders adopted a much more bullish view of UK equities following the Hanson deal, which it was said transformed the mood of the market. 'Hanson set the tone and moving into the third quarter we expect more support from the institutions,' said a senior marketmaker at a leading UK house.</p>

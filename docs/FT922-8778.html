			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Tension marks Israel's talks with Community A DISPUTE between Israel and the European Community yesterday over the EC's role in Middle East peace negotiations cast a shadow over annual talks between the two sides as well as the latest multilateral stage of the regional peace process. Israel objects to full EC participation in the talks on disarmament. It is also boycotting two of the five multilateral Middle East discussions  - on refugees and economic co-operation - because Palestinians from outside the occupied territories were invited, 'I hope this is not a crisis. I hope this is only tension,' said Mr David Levy, Israel's foreign minister, on his way to the meeting in Brussels. He said he would clarify Israel's position, but offered no concession beyond a low-level Community presence at the seminar convened in Washington to launch the disarmament talks. Israel's defence establishment, backed by Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, has strongly resisted an EC presence at the talks, arguing that the Europeans tend to be pro-Arab and would seek rights to inspect Israel's secretive nuclear programme. The EC has demanded a status equivalent to that of the US and Russia, co-sponsors of the peace talks, because of its geographic proximity to the Middle East. Talks on the issue with the EC in Tel Aviv last month were said to have deteriorated into angry exchanges. The row is the latest in a series of political disputes which have dogged Israel's relationship with the Community in recent years. Israel wants to extend economic ties with the EC, its biggest trading partner, beyond the terms of a 1975 free trade agreement. It is seeking the same integration into the European Economic Area as extended to the European Free Trade Association countries. Mr Levy thought he had won such a commitment in return for allowing the Community to participate in last October's Middle East peace conference in Madrid. But a succession of statements by EC ministers and officials have made it clear that consideration of such a move depends on substantive Israeli concessions in the peace process, if not on an actual peace settlement. EC officials say one problem is that several Arab countries also want closer integration with the Community and would object to concessions to Israel. Dealing with all on a pan-Mediterranean basis is impossible until peace is established. Israel and Brussels have made progress, however, on a dispute about appointing an EC representative in the occupied territories whose main task is to administer direct Community aid to the Palestinians - worth about Ecu70m (Pounds 49m) over the past year. Israel has blocked establishment of an EC office there, but will give the representative diplomatic status. The EC says it is insisting that its disbursement of aid should not be subject to any Israeli control.</p>

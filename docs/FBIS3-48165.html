			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hanoi, Jan 24 (AFP) -- A conference of Vietnam's  ruling communist party, which started last week, has revealed  divisions among its delegates on the country's economic reforms,  the party daily Nhan Dan reported Monday.    Most of the 647 delegates expressed their support for the  results of the policy of "doi moi", or renovation, that was  launched in 1986, but there was sharp debate on how to assess  future problems and how to resolve them, it said.    The delegates wind up their meeting in Hanoi on Tuesday.    Debate, which began Thursday, has focussed in particular on  "the importance of ideological work and the pursuit of the  communist party's renovation," as well as "more energetic"  action against corruption, it said.    They also discussed steps aimed at speeding up  share-ownership of public enterprises, agricultural development  and the state's policy towards rural dwellers, who make up 80  percent of the population.    "It is time for Vietnam to enter a new period of development  towards industrialisation and modernisation," the delegates  said, according to the newspaper report.    The six-day mini-congress will also see the delegates elect  about 15 alternate members to the central committee, and replace  a number of figures who have died, become senile or are in  disgrace.    The party's politburo last week added four members,  including  Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, a general and a vice president  to national assembly, a move that could herald major changes in  the political line-up in the next party congress, in 1996.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Unions cool on fresh Tube deal LONDON Underground has failed to win over rail union negotiators in spite of an 11th-hour improvement in an offer of compensation to staff for the biggest shake-up in working practices and pay for 40 years. The offer of an additional 1 per cent means that the compensation would add 5.8 per cent to the pay bill. London Underground is one of the few public utilities to have escaped radical reform of working practices in recent years. Previous attempts have failed partly because the workforce is highly unionised and industrial action causes chaos for the capital's workforce. The offer came on the last day of a week of negotiations during which the two sides met from morning until night at the Watford Hilton in an attempt to kick-start talks that have been stalled for months. The package aims to improve productivity through more flexible work practices and simplified pay and grading structures. It means the loss of 5,000 jobs over five years. All three rail unions say they still have reservations about the deal, which means 21 per cent of staff face pay cuts while 71 per cent would gain. The employment package includes some improved benefits such as travel concessions for gay and lesbian partners of London Underground staff. Aslef, the train drivers' union, said it believed the package was unacceptable but it would consult members. The RMT, the biggest rail union, said: 'Even with the extra 1 per cent, there are still too many losers.' The TSSA white-collar rail union said it had found the week disappointing, but was still studying the proposals. London Underground said there was no prospect of the plan failing.</p>

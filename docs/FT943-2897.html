			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Nat Express in black with Pounds 0.5m The long decline in the number of coach travellers has finally been reversed, according to National Express. The transport group yesterday announced a return to the black with interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 552,000. The return, struck on sales up 31 per cent at Pounds 69.6m (Pounds 53.1m), compared with losses last year of Pounds 407,000. Mr Adam Mills, deputy chief executive, said passenger numbers had increased by about 3 per cent throughout the group's network. This was the first rise for at least two years. The benefit was being felt from people switching to coach services during the British rail strike, but the underlying trend was still an improved one, Mr Mills said. However, the need to discount fares to meet competition from other coach operators and rail services meant that increased volumes had little effect on interim profits. On average, National Express cut fares by about 3 per cent, mostly in England. The largest contribution to profits came from the group's newest business - East Midlands airport. Purchased for Pounds 27m in August last year, it contributed Pounds 1.5m in operating profits. There were no comparative figures, although Mr Mills said much of the savings effected by National Express were being passed on to the airlines in an attempt to increase the volume of traffic through the airport. Passenger numbers rose 18 per cent. The main UK coach business, known as National Express, reduced losses in the six months to June 30 from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 869,000. The British Rail strike had little impact on first-half results, but was expected to benefit the latter part of the year. The European coach operation benefited from the acquisition of a Dutch business. Operating profits rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 460,000. The contribution from airport coach services almost halved from Pounds 182,000 to Pounds 93,000. The dividend was increased by 8 per cent to 2.7p. Earnings per share of 1p compared with a loss of 0.5p last time. COMMENT The rise in coach passengers might take some pressure off National Express, but not much. This is not a spectacular growth market, and price increases are difficult, if not well-nigh impossible. So the move into airports looks better all the time. Yet the company has found it much more difficult than it thought to follow its East Midlands success. Local authorities, which own many of the desirable airports, have been alerted to the potential value and prices are not cheap. Still, the benefits of East Midlands have not yet been fully realised and an acquisition is almost certain at some stage. Forecasts are for about Pounds 11.7m in profits this year, which leaves the shares trading on a prospective p/e of about 17 times. The premium rating is well-deserved.</p>

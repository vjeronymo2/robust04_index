			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Body Shop profits up despite ethics row Body Shop International, the cosmetics retailer, said yesterday recent criticism of its 'green' credentials had had little impact on sales, as it reported a 23 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 10m to Pounds 12.3m . Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said there was a 'very small, almost unnoticeable drop in (UK) customer numbers at one point, but the recovery was almost immediate'. In the US, sales had not been affected. The controversy was sparked by a US magazine article which questioned Body Shop's treatment of franchisees, its ethical trading and animal testing policies, and product ingredients. Body Shop rejects the criticisms, but said it was not planning to take legal action. Mr Roddick added that the company stood by its animal testing policies, but was bringing in an unnamed 'European organisation' to carry out an independent assessment of its policies. It is also bringing in consultants to carry out a 'social audit', examining such issues as human resources, relations with franchisees, and third world trade activities. Mr Roddick said he hoped criticism of the company, which last year won a libel case against the makers of a Channel 4 television, documentary, would now die. Mr Stuart Rose, managing director, said Body Shop's results for the half year to August 31 - which were towards the top of market expectations - reflected the 'stability' provided by having operations in 45 countries. Total sales increased 18 per cent to Pounds 208.1m, while sales through Body Shop's company-owned shops increased 13 per cent to Pounds 93.5m. Second half trading was following a similar trend. Total UK sales increased 7 per cent to Pounds 60.7m, with US sales up 31 per cent at Pounds 38.1m. Turnover elsewhere increased 21 per cent to Pounds 109.3m. Like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, increased 5 per cent in the UK, but fell 1 per cent in the US. Like-for-like sales elsewhere increased 14 per cent. Body Shop plans to increase customer awareness in the US through 'documercials', or paid-for information films during off-peak periods on cable television. It has hired its first advertising agency, Chiat/Day, which is investigate new forms of media advertising for the company, including using the Internet. Some 83 new shops were opened in the period, taking the total to 1,136, with 80 more planned for the second half. The interim dividend was increased from 0.75p to 0.9p, with earnings up from 3.4p to 4.2p per share. Lex, Page 18; People, Page 13; Observer, Page 17</p>

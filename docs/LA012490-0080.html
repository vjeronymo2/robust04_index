			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRYSLER EXPECTED TO POST 4TH-QUARTER LOSS  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp., which is retrenching in the face of a slumping and bruisingly  competitive auto market, is expected to report a large loss for the fourth  quarter, the first since 1982, industry analysts say.  </P> <P> They say Chrysler's poor performance underscores the dreary state of the U.S.  auto industry in 1989, a year in which sales were strong for much of the period  but then collapsed.  </P> <P> They said Chrysler could report a loss of as much as $280 million, or about  $1.20 a share, in the final three months of 1989, due mainly to more than $300  million in writeoffs from staff cutbacks and a plant closing.  </P></p>

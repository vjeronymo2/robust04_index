			<p>CSO     [Text] Nagoya--The Chubu Electric Power Company-affiliated  Chubu Telecommunications Company (CTC--located in Nagoya City;  president, Mitsuo Tanaka) and which plans to launch information  communication services for the commercial sector, will begin  construction of the "Nagoya Information Highway" during this  fiscal year. About 20 of Nagoya City's principal convention  centers such as the Nagoya City International Display Center and  Fukiage Hall will be linked with optical fiber cable, enabling  broadcasting firms, including urban cable television firms, to  utilize two-way image transmission services.    CTC was established in 1988 and has already installed an  optical fiber cable network in the Chubu region which extends  for 6,000 kilometers. The highway concept will include the  existing network to form one which circles the inner city.    The network will link the principal convention centers and  the respective broadcasting firms will be able to transmit  images by merely plugging cameras into the image-transmitting  cable outlets. Installation costs will total 200 million yen and  the project is scheduled for completion in two years. CTC  expects annual usage to hit 1,000 transmissions and hopes to set  rates at a lower point than that which is feasible with  dedicated lines.    Dedicated circuits exist in both the Tokyo and Kansai areas  to link convention centers, but CTS claims, "There are no other  networks which cover such a wide area as the `Nagoya Information  Highway.'" CTC says that if this concept works well, it will  consider building a "long-distance information highway" which  will operate on an intercity basis.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Manoj Joshi: "Shadow and Substance--India-U.S. </F> Relations Today"]    [Excerpts] Indian-American relations seem to operate in  Kondratiev cycles with an inevitableness which no amount of  goodwill or diplomatic effort can influence. Even as there  appear signals to suggest that the two are trying to repair the  damage, that superlative fighter, the F-16, is once again set to  send New Delhi's ties with Washington to a new low.    After a long winter of discontent, Indian and American  relations were about to look up with the U.S. assistant  secretary of state for South Asia, Ms Robin Raphel, whose  remarks on the accession of Kashmir to India began the downward  spiral, deciding to visit India to clear the air. Her trip,  though not quite in the spirit of Henry going to Canossa, is  being touted as part of an effort by the Clinton administration  to restore the credibility of its South Asian policy. By  engaging her Indian interlocutors, it is hoped that the bad  feelings about her and her boss President Bill Clinton's remarks  will be ended.  <H5>  Sticks &amp; Stones </H5>   So far New Delhi has comforted itself by the thought that  words do not break bones. But it would now appear that  Washington might be taking recourse to sticks and stones as  well. The proposal for a "one-time" waiver of F-16 aircraft and  other military equipment for Pakistan not only creates an  enormous "public relations" problem for a government trying to  keep its relations with Washington on an even keel, but will  affect the military balance, thereby compelling a response in  kind. An expenditure of $2 billion in the next two years in  purchasing military hardware would almost certainly torpedo Dr  Manmohan Singh's economic reform programme, if nothing else  will. [passage omitted]    It is not clear why the United States expects India to sign  on the dotted line. While it has on occasion dampened  Indo-Pakistani tensions arising from the Kashmir problem, it has  not shown itself to be a particularly impartial or even mature  actor. Having resisted the Pakistani effort to internationalise  the issue in Geneva, New Delhi cannot be expected to cave in and  accept an international conference to resolve the dispute. Even  if the Rao government was willing, it would find its room for  action circumscribed by the Parliament resolution on Kashmir.  <H5>  Short Memories </H5>   Nor is it likely that the Rao government will be able to  accept any new non-proliferation move being initiated by the  Americans. Public memories tend to be short, but not short  enough to forget that in the 1980s F-16s were supplied to check  Pakistan's nuclear ambitions and when they failed to do so for  three years American Presidents lied to Congress and the world  by annually certifying that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear  explosive device. In any case, capping will not take into  account devices and fissile material that may have been produced  since 1987, when, according to Mr A.Q. Khan and, more recently,  the former Pakistani army chief, General Mirza Aslam Beg,  Pakistan first made the bomb, and now.    There is little alternative for India but to engage the  United States in a dialogue even while spelling out clearly that  it will not undertake policies that fall below the threshold of  India's national interests, be it in Kashmir or elsewhere. On  non-proliferation, the Prime Minister has already outlined  India's wider concerns about Russia and China. As soon as the  proposed international convention to ban the production of  fissile material for weapons comes into force, India will, as  its leading supporter, accept inspections of its nuclear  facilities. But in asking India to do so as part of the "F-16s  for capping" agreement, Washington is asking it to bear the  obligations while rewarding Islamabad. It was not India but U.S.  law which blocked the aircraft from going to Pakistan. Asking  New Delhi to pay the price for Washington's convoluted Pakistan  policy is insulting, to say the least, and no embassy or  high-level visit is likely to be able to convince anyone  otherwise.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Amphetamines have done such  great damage to people's lives and property that everyone is now  aware of their terrible effect. But even though a tough  amphetamine control law has been promulgated, this has had  little effect on either producers or users. Terrible accidents  stemming from amphetamines occur frequently.    Mr. Sanchai Singhonglaka, the Region 1 chief judge,  expressed  concern about this problem, saying that the number of  amphetamine cases tried in Region 1 courts has increased. Today,  even though the court is handing down stiff sentences to those  who violate the 1975 drug act, particularly those convicted in  amphetamine cases, the number of amphetamine cases has continued  to increase.    He said that since the beginning of 1993, a total of 1,241  amphetamine cases have been heard by Region 1 courts. Of these,  1,049 were charged with illegal possession, and 192 were charged  with possession with intent to sell. The courts in Region 1 have  rendered verdicts in 1,132 of these cases, and are still  deliberating the other 109. In those cases that have been  completed, the courts found 1,121 of the defendants guilty and  six innocent. Four jumped bail, and the case against one was  dropped because the defendant died. The courts in Region 1  trying the largest number of amphetamine cases were the Saraburi  provincial court, 337 cases, the Thanyaburi [as published]  provincial court, 202, and the Ayuthaya provincial court, 125.    Mr. Udom Buntham, the director of the Legal Affairs and  Crime  Detection Division, Office of the Narcotics Control Board  [ONCB], talked with reporters about the new law, which calls for  stiffer penalties in amphetamine cases. He said that at present,  sentences for those convicted of selling or producing  amphetamines are rather light. This is because the present law  is very outmoded. To ensure that things are in accord with the  actual situation, the ONCB will ask the government to make the  penalties for producers and traffickers the same as those  imposed in heroin cases. This is now being considered by  prosecutors before being submitted to the cabinet. Also, rewards  leading to seizures will be increased. That is, for pure  amphetamine powder, the reward will be increased from 3 baht to  10 baht per gram. For amphetamine tablets, the reward for 1-50  tablets will be 200 baht. For 51-1,000 tablets, the reward can  be as high as 5,000 baht. In cases involving the seizure of more  than 1,000 tablets, the person will receive an additional one  baht per tablet up to a maximum of 100,000 baht.</p>

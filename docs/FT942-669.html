			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: French group may take over Ferranti division Thomson CSF, the French defence electronics group, has agreed in principal to acquire Ferranti's industrial systems division from the administrative receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of Arthur Andersen. Ferranti went into receivership in December after GEC withdrew a 1p a share rescue offer for the company following its due diligence inquiries. Yesterday's agreement, which is subject to contract, covers price - which was not disclosed - and other 'critical factors'. Negotiations to finalise the sale are expected to be completed next month. Ferranti's industrial systems division, which manufactures process controls, has operations at Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, and Dalkeith and Aberdeen in Scotland. GEC acquired Ferranti's main UK defence businesses, which include Ferranti defence systems integration and Ferranti simulation and training, from the administrative receivers last month. Negotiations covering the sale of Ferranti's remaining civil and communications businesses are expected to be completed next month. After that the receivers will re-open negotiations covering Ferranti's components manufacturing plant at Cairo Mill in Oldham.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado responded in a letter dated August 4, 1993, by submitting additional explanatory information and a revised amendment (administrative record No. CO&hyph;559). Specifically, Colorado proposed additional revisions to (1) Rule 1.04 (103a) to include a definition of the term ``reasonably available spoil''; (2) Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), regarding a demonstration by the applicant in writing that an existing highwall was in place prior to August 3, 1977, and that the volume of all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the highwall and face-up area so as to achieve a safety factor of 1.3; (3) Rule 4.14.1(2)(f)(i), regarding the requirement that all reasonably available spoil in the permit area be used to backfill a highwall; (4) Rules 4.14.1(2)(f)(iii) and (g)(iii), regarding the requirement that the operator demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Division that a highwall remnant is stable; and (5) Rule 4.14.1(2)(g), regarding the allowance for incomplete highwall elimination for remaining operations that contain a preexisting highwall where the operator demonstrates in writing to the Division that the volume of all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill a reaffected or enlarged highwall so as to achieve a safety factor of 1.3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM announced receipt of the revised amendment in the August 30, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 45467), and, in the same notice, reopened and extended the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing on the adequacy of the amendment considering the additional materials submitted (administrative record No. CO&hyph;570). The comment period closed on September 14, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Director's Findings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After a thorough review, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, the Director finds that the proposed amendment, as submitted by Colorado on March 19, 1993, and as revised by it on August 4, 1993, is no less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Nonsubstantive Revisions to Colorado's Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado's proposed revisions to the following previously-approved rules are nonsubstantive in nature and consist of minor editorial, punctuation, and codification changes. Corresponding Federal provisions, if any exist, are listed in parentheses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 4.14.1(2)(h) (30 CFR 816.102(d) and 817.102(d)), placement of spoil on the area outside the mined-out area; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 4.14.2(1)(a) (30 CFR 816.102(b) and 817.102(b)), general slope grading requirements; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 4.27.4 (30 CFR 816.102(a)(1) and (2), 817.102(a)(1) and (2), 816.133(d) and 817.133(d)), limited variances from AOC requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the proposed revisions to these previously-approved Colorado rules are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director finds that these proposed Colorado regulations are not inconsistent with SMCRA and are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director approves these proposed rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Rule 1.04(103a), Definition of ``Reasonably Available Spoil'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At newly-created Rule 1.04(103a), Colorado proposed to define the term ``reasonably available spoil'' that would apply to backfilling and grading operations and highwall elimination on continuously mined areas (Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), finding No. 3) and on remaining operations on previously mined areas (Rule 4.14.1(2)(g), finding No. 4). Colorado proposed to define ``reasonably available spoil'' to mean ``spoil and suitable coal mine waste material generated by a remaining operation, or other spoil or suitable coal mine waste material located in the permit area that is accessible and available for use and that when rehandled will not cause a hazard to public safety or significant damage to the environment.'' Colorado's proposed definition is substantively identical to the corresponding Federal definition of the term ``reasonably available spoil'' at 30 CFR 701.5. Accordingly, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rule 1.04(103a) defining the term ``reasonably available spoil'' is no less effective than the corresponding Federal definition of ``reasonably available spoil'' at 30 CFR 701.5. The Director approves the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

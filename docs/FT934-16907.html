			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Where Gatt's Dollars 200bn really comes from Supporters as well as opponents of freer world trade have been bemused by the much repeated figure of Dollars 213bn as the annual gain to world income resulting from a successful conclusion to the Gatt negotiations. This figure is a bona fide estimate, which underestimates the likely gains. It comes from a joint OECD-World Bank study, which has appeared in a variety of forms culminating in the present study; and the net effect has not been user-friendly. For, like so many modern researchers, the authors find it terribly difficult to strike a middle way between exhaustive technical description and excessively short executive summaries, in which numbers are thrown out on a take-or-leave it basis. The first and simplest question is: to what does the figure refer? The more precise estimate of Dollars 213bn is the difference between world real income in the year 2002 based on the projecting of existing trends, and world real income assuming a successful conclusion of the Gatt round - all expressed in dollars of 1992 purchasing power. Is it a high or low number? If you want to make it seem high you can say that it is about half the present income of China. If you want to make it seem low you can say that it is about three-quarters of a per cent of estimated world GNP in 2002. A fractional increase of this size is not in fact small. It is nearly a third of a normal year's growth in a typical OECD country. Moreover it is completely wrong to compare it, as some politicians do, with a monetary or fiscal boost, or business cycle spurt, of comparable magnitude. It is an efficiency gain which gradually accumulates over a decade; and unlike a short-term boost, is unlikely to be reversed. The study assumes that a successful Gatt round is roughly equivalent to a 30 per cent cut in effective protection both for agriculture and for industry. But because the agricultural barriers are now much higher than industrial tariffs, the bulk of the gain comes from freeing agriculture. There are some subtleties in the analysis. For the greatest early gains are associated with increases, rather than decreases, in the world price of cereals and other main temperate products. This is because subsidies and other distortions artificially depress prices on international markets, but often raise those at home. For example, the domestic price of cereal crops in the EC is 50 per cent higher than the world one. This difference, which some economists call 'the wedge', was 250 per cent for Japan, largely due to the heavy protection of indigenous rice producers. Many of the initial gains will come from removing such price distortions, which discourage consumers from spending their income in a way which reflects the opportunities open to them in the international markets. Ultimately the producer gains will follow too, as resources are switched from, say, uneconomic European farms to products in which European countries have a true advantage. In the EC, the average consumer paid in 1992 Dollars 450 for agricultural protection. In the US he paid Dollars 360 and in Japan Dollars 600. It is because these losses are so high that the greatest gains are shown to these parts of the world. The main losers are a few developing countries which are also heavy food importers; but they have loyally supported the trade talks. Why is the study an understatement? Most obviously, because it excludes services and industrial import quotas, which are difficult to quantify but feature largely in the Gatt talks. Moreover most such studies concentrate on essentially locational changes in the composition of consumption and production and cannot really quantify the possibly large dynamic gains as those emerging from more competition for sleepy producers. One benefit which the authors do try to quantify is the beneficial effect on jobs from higher real income. The idea is that if real incomes are boosted by lowering protective barriers at given rates of wages, European workers will be less likely to insist on pushing wages above market clearing levels; and economies will be able to run with lower reserves of unemployment without incurring runaway inflation. But because the forces behind unemployment are so controversial and little understood, the authors wisely leave out such effects from their main projections. Meanwhile it is a reflection on the cramping influence of pressure group politics and bogus rural romanticism that the countries which would gain most from freer agricultural trade are proving most obdurate in the current talks.  ----------------------------    ANNUAL GAINS FROM TRADE    LIBERALISATION BY 2002     (IN 1992 DOLLARS BN)  ---------------------------- Low income Asia                      1.8 China                    37.0 India                     4.6 SUB TOTAL                43.4  ---------------------------- Upper income Asia                     20.6 Indonesia                -1.9 SUB TOTAL                18.8  ---------------------------- Other Africa             -0.6 Nigeria                  -1.0 South Africa             -0.4 Maghreb                  -0.6 SUB TOTAL                -2.6  ---------------------------- Mediterranean            -1.6 Gulf region               3.1 SUB TOTAL                 1.5  ---------------------------- Other Latin American            4.4 Brazil                    3.4 Mexico                    0.3 SUB TOTAL                 8.0  ---------------------------- US                       18.8 Canada                    2.5 Australia/New Zealand     1.1 Japan                    25.9 EC                       80.7 EFTA                     12.8 SUB TOTAL               141.8  ---------------------------- Eastern Europe            1.4 Former Soviet Union       0.8 SUB TOTAL                 2.1  ---------------------------- TOTAL                   213.0  ---------------------------- Source: OECD  ----------------------------</p>

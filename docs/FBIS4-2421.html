			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] The Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] has asked  Mainland China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Straits [ARATS] to hold an emergency meeting about the Chientao  [Qiandao] Lake tragegy. Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] Chairman  Huang Kun-hui said Friday [8 April] if the mainland side failed  to respond favorably, the government is ready to make a proper  review of relations between two sides. He did not elaborate.    A tourist boat reportedly exploded in flame while crossing  Qiandao Lake in Mainland China's eastern province of Chekiang  [Zhejiang] on 31 March. Thirty-two people, including 24 Taiwan  tourists, were killed. All urged mainland authorities to make  public the cause of the incident and measures being taken to  cope with the aftermath. They should give the victims' families  a clear detailed account rather than making excuses like causes  of death unknown.    In addition, government spokesman Jason Hu said the  government will call a series of international press conferences  to recount the inhuman treatment the Taiwan visitors suffered in  the Qiandao Lake incident.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Indonesian Foreign Minister </F> Ali Alatas by TEMPO correspondent Fikri Jufri in New York --  date not given]    [Text] [Jufri] To what extent has progress to solve the  East Timor issue at the international forums been made?    [Alatas] There has been no breakthrough through the formal  tripartite talks involving Indonesia, the United Nations, and  Portugal. The talks are not stalled, but progress has been made  at a very slow pace. We are now discussing the issue of CBM or  Confidence Building Measures.    However, outside the formal tripartite talks, several  breakthroughs have been made. The first breakthrough occurred  last year with the establishment of EPIFA or European Parliament  Indonesia Friendship Association]. We certainly welcome the  establishment of this association, which was able to thwart  Portugal's motions at the European Parliament. The second  breakthrough took place even within Portugal itself with the  establishment of the Portugal-Indonesia Friendship Association  by Macedo and his friends. While business was the initial  motivation, the association later also engaged in political  activities. We certainly welcome this development. The third  breakthrough occurred was when Araujo, a former leader of  Fretilin [Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor] now  living in Portugal, decided to contact us and expressed his wish  to meet with his old friends in Indonesia. Of course we had to  double check his sincerity, and it turned out that he was  sincere. We certainly welcomed his initiative.    [Jufri] If that is the case, why do we still hear protests  on  East Timor?    [Alatas] The protests come from those who feel they are  being cornered, namely the hardline group opposed to Araujo's  initiative. Who are these people? They are Ramos Horta and his  friends, who are supported by the Allan Nairn group. I also  believe that the film entitled Pilger was produced in a hurry so  it could be shown before the annual meeting of the UN Commission  on Human Rights in Geneva. This is understandable becuse they  are worried about the impact of the breakthroughs mentioned  above. Therefore, we are now in a unique situation: On the one  hand, we see bright prospects, but on the other hand, we also  notice that our opponents are also intensifying their activities.    [Jufri] Do you think that the upcoming meeting of the  Indonesian community in the United States organized by the Asia  Society will produce another breakthrough in that country?    [Alatas] It is hoped that the meeting will be able to  introduce Indonesia in its totality to the U.S. society,  especially to those whose knowledge on Indonesia are limited to  issues like human rights and environment. This meeting is aimed  at approaching not only the U.S. Congress, but also the U.S.  media, which are responsible for building public opinion.    [Jufri] Therefore, this meeting is a kind of public  diplomacy?    [Alatas] Yes, because present-day foreign diplomacy is no  longer restricted to traditional diplomatic forums.</p>

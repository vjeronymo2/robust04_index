			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Chadian Government and the Federation of  Chadian Trade Unions [UST] are to meet again this afternoon.  According to our correspondent Rene Bila Yombiri, their main  concern will be the suspension of the general strike.    [Begin Yombiri recording] The social pact, which is the  cause  of the general strike, has still not been signed, with the main  bone of contention being the preconditions. The UST, which  launched the strike, has demanded the pullout of ghost labor  unions from the negotiations, the withdrawal of security forces  from the Labor Exchange -- headquarters of the country's two  labor federations -- and, especially, the abrogation of a decree  controlling strikes in Chad, which was enacted at a cabinet  meeting in view of the current strike. The government has  refused to abrogate the decree so the UST has called for its  suspension pending the establishment of the administrative  court, which alone is entitled to abrogate or maintain the  decree. If the decree is suspended, the UST promises to suspend  the general strike for two weeks in order to examine and sign  the social pact. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

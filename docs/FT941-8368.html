			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: British music and Mahler - Orchestras in London James Levine's three Festival Hall concerts with the Philharmonia - his first encounter with a London orchestra for nearly two decades - are proving a big draw: for the second, Mahler's Third Symphony on Wednesday, the queues for returns were not much less than Karajan-length. Any account of this longest of Mahler symphonies is always an event: in no other did Mahler more ambitiously or more abundantly argue his conviction that a symphony should amount to a 'whole world'. Levine's credentials as a Mahlerian, solid enough, are backed up by his substantial experience in Wagner - a conductor who has found ways of sustaining all of The Ring (as this conductor has in his New York Met home) is unlikely to suffer uncertainties in mounting this vast edifice or in tracing its Wagner-inspired progression from earthly depths to spiritual heights. Levine's authority was, indeed, never in doubt. He understands how the work's two mighty outer movements and its four picturesque inner ones hang together; he commands their individual sound-worlds and dramatic canvas. His insistence on seating the orchestra traditionally (violins opposite each other, not all bunched together) immeasurably clarifies the sense and blend of the scoring; traditional too, although perhaps less justified, was the interpolation of an interval after the first movement. Yet in spite of its many strengths, this Mahler Three exposed a gap between promise and fulfilment that grew ever wider as the evening passed. The Philharmonia seemed not yet entirely at home with the conductor's beat - the very slow tempo for the finale found the strings not radiant but somewhat heavy-footed in movement from note to note. More to the point, I could detect in the reading little in the way of spiritual energy. The mighty adventure of a Mahler symphony is dulled when its intensities of emotional expression - lamentation, yearning, meditative rapture - are left unfathomed. There was, however, one vividly emotion-inspiring aspect to the performance: the singing of its alto soloist, Christa Ludwig. This was her final London concert, after nearly four decades of regular appearance here; in the Nietzsche setting her calm, generous, easy flow of tone and her unforced responsiveness to atmosphere and colour touched Mahlerian depths otherwise absent from the whole experience. In the same hall the following evening, a BBC Symphony Orchestra concert of English music struck a vivid contrast. Under Andrew Davis the BBC orchestra is now an exciting virtuoso band, and the elements of dash, vivacity and risk-taking in both Tippett's Piano Concerto (Peter Donohoe the fluent, not always poetic soloist) and Walton's Belshazzar's Feast unfairly highlighted the earthbound character of Levine's Mahler. The London premiere of Mark-Anthony Turnage's Momentum (1991), a brilliantly blues-coloured orchestral showpiece written for the opening of the Birmingham Symphony Hall, set off the evening's exhilaration.

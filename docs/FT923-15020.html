			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / A head-on collision over rules of the road: The French government is in reverse because of its tough, new driving regulations The burly Lyons lorry driver barely flinched at the sight of the riot police. 'We're not looking for a fight, but if the police come we'll do what we have to,' he said. 'The same goes for the Belgians and the Dutch. No one's tougher than the French truckers." For the past four days the roadblocks erected by the Lyonnais and his fellow truckers have been causing chaos throughout France. At first the television images of lorry drivers munching baguettes beside their roadblocks seemed almost comical. But the situation swiftly became more serious as supplies of food and fuel ran short in many cities, factories laid off workers and thousands of foreign tourists were trapped behind roadblocks. The dispute could scarcely have come at a worse time for the French government, which is desperately trying to improve its poor performance in the opinion polls in the approach to the Maastricht referendum in September and next year's general elections. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, yesterday summoned ministers to an emergency meeting to try to end the dispute this weekend. Even if the roads are cleared, the government will be left assessing the long-term damage of the protest. The crux of the dispute is the government's apparently laudable attempt to reduce France's frighteningly high rate of road accidents. There were nearly 9,600 deaths on French roads last year, twice as many as in the UK and at least 2,000 more than in Germany. A new driving licence system was introduced on Wednesday as the linchpin of the government's campaign to curb dangerous driving. Under the new system all drivers are allocated six points on their licences. If they commit an offence they forfeit a number of points - three for drunken driving or two for speeding. Once drivers lose six points they forfeit their licences for at least six months. Similar systems have already been introduced - without controversy - in Germany, Britain, Japan and some US states. But it has caused a furore in France. The truckers have made the biggest fuss. They argue that they should be awarded extra points, because as professional drivers they run a higher risk of losing their licences and their livelihoods. They have been grumbling on and off for months. But this week their protests began in earnest. Roadblocks were erected on most of the main motorways. The cities of Lyons and Toulouse were virtually inaccessible for four days. Since Wednesday, there have been reports of petrol rationing and food shortages across France. On Thursday a Peugeot factory was forced to lay off 1,200 of its 2,200 workers because of a parts shortage. But the lorry drivers are not alone. Paris taxi drivers staged a one-day strike against the new system last month. Their counterparts in Lille held a protest yesterday. The usually sedate motorists' association also opposes the system, which differs from those of some other countries in that drivers could lose their licences through parking offences alone. When a television chat-show host asked his studio audience whether they approved of driving points, the answer was a resounding 'non'. At first glance the protest seems surprising. France is a highly centralised, very bureaucratic society. The logistics of the points system pale beside the complexity of renting an appartment or qualifying for a driving licence. But France is also a country where macho motoring is a way of life. Jumping traffic lights, parking cars on pavements and overtaking from either side of the opposing car are commonplace. Motorway cafes are crammed with drivers knocking back their lunchtime plonk. There are so many crashes around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris that accidents there are not covered by most insurance policies. The government is running a public information campaign to spell out the consequences of this cavalier approach to road safety, but apparently with little effect. Although the French may not agree with the detailed demands of the lorry drivers - the motorists' association has threatened to erect its own roadblocks if the government caves in to the demand for extra points  -there is general sympathy for the central theme of attacking the points system. As a result, the truckers' dispute, which coincides with farmers' demonstrations, dockers' protests and airline strikes, has not stirred up much ill-feeling in France. Some French newspapers have even buried the story on their inside pages. This is not the case in other countries. The Daily Mail newspaper in Britain slapped 'Fed up with France' across its front page on Thursday. There were similar, if less overtly francophobic, headlines in the German, Dutch and Belgian press. The British Embassy in Paris has issued the type of travel warning usually reserved for war zones. The French government has been left in an embarrassing position. Mr Beregovoy has offered a string of concessions to the truckers. He has even set up a committee to review the points system. He has also threatened to revoke their licences unless they disperse. By yesterday morning some barricades had come down and many roads, particularly in the north, were cleared. Ministers hope the rest of the roadblocks will be taken down by Monday. The transport ministry has dispatched regional representatives to remonstrate with the militant truckers. By early afternoon yesterday enough roads had been cleared to give the government the confidence to suspend the usual weekend ban on heavy-goods traffic to speed up the distribution of supplies to shops and factories. It may take longer to mop up the political mess. Mr Beregovoy has been at pains to avoid controversy in the run-up to the Maastricht referendum. This week he even postponed a potentially tricky piece of medical expenditure legislation until after the vote. Last weekend Mr Beregovoy was basking in the reflected glory of President Mitterrand's flight to Sarajevo. He will spend this weekend counting the cost of a week in which France - and its government - has virtually been held hostage by a bunch of truckers.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] An article published on page 4 of the 21  January Ho Chi Minh City SAIGON GIAI PHONG in Vietnamese reports  that in mid-December of last year, the Binh Thanh Market  Management Unit discovered a Daihatsu van which was going from  Ho Nai to Ho Chi Minh City, carrying 18 bags containing "black  color bars of a rather soft substance," weighing 814 kg.  Subsequently, a lab analysis showed that each kilogram was 9.65  percent morphine.    According to the local anti-drug center, based on the color,  smell, and morphine content, the substance was actually crude  opium. Each kilogram of the crude opium currently costs about  $462 (5 million dong). The case has been turned over to the  public security office for further investigation.</p>

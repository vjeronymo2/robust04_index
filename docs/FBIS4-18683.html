			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri stressed that "the  functions of the Italian observers in Hebron will essentially be  political, and to provide security for the local population."    "The fact that all the sides asked for our soldiers to take  part in the operation along side troops from Denmark and  Norway," Fabbri added, "shows how much prestige Italy has  acquired during these peacekeeping operations."    Referring to Somalia, the minister said, "It was the most  demanding operation that our troops have taken part in since the  Second World War, because of the loss of life that we endured."</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Foreign investors drawn back to German capital markets FOREIGN investors returned to the German capital markets last year, contributing DM62bn (Dollars 37.5bn) of the total DM275bn business volume, the Finance Ministry reported yesterday. They were drawn back, after pruning their portfolios by DM2.9bn in 1990, by 'faith in the stability of the D-Mark, attractive interest rates and the prospect of exchange rate gains,' the ministry said. The ministry said continued stability of the currency was crucial if markets were to continue to flourish and federal finance policies were to withstand testing times in the coming years. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, urged the 16 state governments to protect the D-Mark by following Bonn's example and reining in their budgets. Overall volume was down from the record DM293bn of 1990, due mainly to a drop of DM16bn in domestic securities business. Share issues fell to DM13bn from DM28bn. Virtually all the growth in foreign dealings was in the bond markets, which recovered strongly from April after a spell of relative weakness for the D-Mark, fears of increased inflation and concern over the future of the former Soviet Union, the ministry said. Falling bond yields in the US and Japan, coupled with the second-half 17.5 per cent appreciation of the D-Mark against the US dollar helped pull in investment. Domestic dealings benefited from increased private sector savings. West Germans salted away DM221bn during the year compared with DM210bn in 1990.</p>

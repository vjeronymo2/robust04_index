			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (12): The grey suits you see in every capital - A look at the growing international interest in Latin America Latin American companies are continuing to raise large amounts of capital on international equity markets - despite turbulence in world markets and big blips in investor confidence earlier this year. Over the last few weeks, greater stability in the US financial markets and positive political developments in Latin America - in particular in both Mexico and Brazil - have boosted confidence. There are hopes in some quarters that the total volume of new issues could come near to last year's record Dollars 6bn and certainly match the Dollars 4.6bn raised in 1992. In addition, there are some signs that international interest in Latin American companies is widening - with sectors such as retailing and electricity distribution attracting attention. Investors are also prepared to consider deals in countries such as Peru that would have been considered marginal until very recently. 'There is just unbelievable competition,' says one US banker. 'There are 200 investment bankers in Mexico City today but you will see grey suits and blue suits in every Latin American capital.' Even so, bankers acknowledge that the pace of new issuance has slowed significantly earlier this year, following successive increases in short-term interest rates. Investors were also troubled by signs of political instability, especially in Mexico, where a presidential candidate for the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party was assassinated in March. Indeed, during the second quarter, a number of deals were withdrawn because of a lack of investor interest. For example in June, the Argentine government had to drop a planned Dollars 150m IPO of its remaining 25 per cent stake in TGN, a privatised gas pipeline company, because of insufficient demand. Even so, interest picked up during July and by the beginning of August, Latin American companies had raised a total of Dollars 3.27bn in 47 separate issues, only five less than for the whole of last year, according to figures collated by International Financing Review. And last year, the total figure was boosted by the launch of a very large share offering from YPF, the Argentine oil and gas company. The Argentine government sold a 45 per cent stake in YPF in June 1993, raising a total of Dollars 3bn which included an international tranche of some Dollars 2.3bn. Sentiment has been buoyed by signs of stability in the US bond market but also by developments on the political front. In Mexico - which saw some of the greatest activity last year with 26 new issues raising a total of Dollars 2.71bn - the apparently clean victory of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the presidential candidate of the governing PRI, has revived confidence. Even though the local markets had discounted a PRI victory, stock prices have risen, and a number of new issues - including the sale of the government's remaining stakes in two of the country's largest banks, Bancomer and Banamex - are again on the agenda. Grupo Elektra, a retailing group which pulled an international offering earlier this year, is also said to be looking at the international markets. In Brazil, the continent's largest economy, markets have been encouraged by the success to date of the Real plan, an economic stabilisation package introduced in July, and the lead in the opinion polls built up by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the plan's architect and former finance minister, ahead of presidential elections next month. Among Brazilian issues expected - ahead of October's elections - is Usiminas, the steel company, which is said to be seeking some Dollars 500m. Elsewhere, investors are increasingly positive about economic prospects in Peru. Several new Peruvian issues - including an issue for some Dollars 45m to Dollars 50m for Banco Wiese, the country's second largest bank, are expected in the autumn. There is also optimism about the prospects for some smaller economies. Fieldstone Private Capital Group, for example, a merchant bank which specialises in energy-related business, is seeking to raise some Dollars 32m to Dollars 33m for a Bolivian electricity distribution company, the Cochabamba Light and Power Company (ELFEC), by selling a 70 per cent government shareholding to private investors in November. Some of the money will be raised locally - incidentally creating one of the La Paz stock exchange's first equity issues - but Fieldstone is also applying to have the stock listed in London, and aims to raise money from both retail and institutional investors through an offer for sale. 'Until now, there has been no possibility of buying Bolivian stocks so there is considerable pent-up demand with large sums already deposited for this purpose in New York and London,' explains Mr Peter Earl, a consultant with Fieldstone in London. The interest is leading to increasing competition for Latin American mandates, say bankers. 'The markets are still growing. The hard part is winning the mandates, not getting the deal done,' suggests one New York-based Latin American financier. Mr Francis Coles, head of Latin American corporate finance at Baring Brothers in New York, says 1994 has been much tougher than 1993 but concedes that more recently 'political factors have had a positive influence. There are quite good conditions for getting deals done. There is a lot of potential supply. I think there are some quite good companies out there,' he adds. Referring to two successful recent deals, Mr Coles says: 'The pricing wasn't over-aggressive. It is a clear demonstration to us that it is possible to do deals successfully if they are in a sector where the investor wants to be.' Certainly, the interest is leading to greater competition among investment and merchant bankers involved in the deals, with fees under pressure, especially in deals involving privatisation in the bigger economies. 'At the end of 1992 lead underwriters were generally collecting a commission fee of between 3.75 and 5.25 per cent,' points out one New York banker. 'But in several deals this year the commission has fallen below 3 per cent of the amount raised,' he adds.</p>

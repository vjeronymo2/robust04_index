			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): Wall Street is sanguine despite prospect of rise in interest rates The US stock markets not only ended 1993 on a firm note, but also opened the new year in an equally upbeat mood. In the final week of last year, share prices set a series of record closing highs, and that upward momentum spilled into the first week of 1994, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 3,800 for the first time ever. Investors hoped that the strong early start to the year would prove a herald of things to come. The consensus on Wall Street is that the stock market should do well in the first quarter of 1994. The bullish factors supporting stocks will be: a further improvement in corporate earnings; strengthening economic growth; and low inflation. Also, the market should be untroubled by an interest-rate hike from the Federal Reserve, which is more likely to come later in the year. If the forecasts are anywhere near on target, the first quarter should bring better gains than investors achieved in the final quarter of 1993. In that period, the Dow rose 5.6 per cent during the three months, to end the quarter and the year at 3,754.09. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fared less well, gaining only 1.7 per cent to 466.45, while the Nasdaq composite index firmed 1.9 per cent to 776.80. The outperformance of the Dow during the quarter was evidence that investors were favouring stocks that would benefit most from the accelerating pace of economic activity - the so-called 'cyclical' stocks such as transportation companies, paper manufacturers and carmakers. This strategy made sense, because throughout the last three months of 1993 government statistics consistently pointed to a rapidly improving economic climate. While the cyclicals prospered, other sectors languished. Interest-sensitive stocks, such as utilities, banks and securities houses, which did so well earlier in 1993, were hit by the jump in bond-market rates. The rise in long-term Treasury yield, which climbed from under 6 per cent to 6.4 per cent during the quarter, stopped the broader market from matching the gains achieved by the Dow. The final quarter of 1993 also saw national and international politics affect market sentiment. Concern that the North American Free Trade Agreement might be blocked by Congress unsettled stocks briefly, before President Clinton's last-minute lobbying effort brought home a victory. Overseas events, notably the uprising at the Russian parliament, which President Boris Yeltsin quashed in early October, the success of far-right extremists in the December Russian elections, and disturbing developments in North Korea, also kept traders and investors on their toes. On the corporate front improved quarterly company earnings, and the continued revival in the mergers and acquisitions business (in particular, the prolonged bid battle for control of Paramount Communications and the acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc by Bell Atlantic) lifted sentiment. Both situations lured speculators to the media and telecommunications sectors, where prices surged in anticipation of more bid activity, and raised hopes that a buoyant M&amp;A market would support share prices in the first quarter of 1994 and beyond. In Canada, the dominant themes of the quarter were the general election  - which turfed out the Conservatives and replaced them with the Liberals, but which had little ultimate impact on investor sentiment - declining interest rates, and the still-modest economic recovery. The result was solid gains in share prices, with the Toronto Stock Exchange composite index climbing 8.2 per cent to end at 4,321.43. In Mexico, the big story was Nafta. Optimism about the positive impact the market hoped the treaty would have on the Mexican economy, combined with the success of the government's fight against inflation, the continued huge flows of foreign investment into the country, and investors' approval of the ruling party's nomination of Luis Colosio as its presidential candidate, all helped the Prices and Quotations Index post a 41 per cent increase during the quarter to 2,602.63.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Tighter planning controls announced The government yesterday announced tighter planning controls on houses in conservation areas. The proposals will give wider powers to local planning authorities wanting to restrict homeowners' ability to make changes to the outside appearance of their properties. Authorities will be required to publicise their proposals in advance and pay regard to the views of local people. The measures are a response to last July's consultation paper on the protection of conservation areas issued by the environment and national heritage departments.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEBANON'S AOUN VOWS TO OUST SYRIANS  </P> <P> The leader of Lebanon's embattled Christians vowed Friday to drive Syrian  forces out of the country whatever the price.  </P> <P> As an Arab League peacemaker shuttled between Muslim West Beirut and the  Christian east side of the capital, Gen. Michel Aoun told a press conference  that he would not settle for "anything less than a Syrian withdrawal from  Lebanon."  </P> <P> "I am not afraid of the results of the battle," the 53-year-old leader of the  mostly Christian Lebanese army said. "It's true that the Syrians are stronger  militarily . . . but the battle will cost them a high price."  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Seek Foreign Help  </P> <P> Dressed in battle fatigues as he spoke to reporters at the presidential palace  in suburban Baabda, Aoun, who heads a military Cabinet rejected by Lebanon's  Muslims, pledged to seek foreign help to oust the Syrian forces, which number  25,000 in Lebanon.  </P> <P> "If the United States and Europe are not interested in our cause, other  countries are," he said.  </P> <P> He mentioned no names. Iraq, Syria's longtime enemy, is an active supporter of  the Christian forces. The army has also received training from the United  States.  </P> <P> Earlier Friday, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Beirut said a military technical  assistance team of three American officers was being pulled out of Lebanon.  </P> <P> "We are withdrawing the . . . team at the Defense Ministry as part of the  embassy's policy of reducing American personnel due to the current situation,"  the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Beirut and its suburbs have been rattled by artillery battles for more than two  weeks. At least 80 Lebanese have been killed and more than 250 wounded in the  shelling, which began when Aoun imposed a blockade on harbors run by the  country's sectarian militias.  </P> <P> The so-called War of the Ports was aimed at re-establishing government control  -- and taxation -- at the harbors.  </P> <P> The Muslim artillery of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt and Aoun's Christian  gunners have done most of the shelling, but this week there have been  unconfirmed reports that Syrian artillerymen have fired on Christian targets.  </P> <P> The Syrians entered Lebanon during the 1975-76 Muslim-Christian civil war -- to  protect the Christians -- at the behest of the Arab League.  </P> <P> Friday, a new Arab League peace effort was under way to stem the fighting and  to try to work out a lasting political settlement in Lebanon. Ahmed Jassim, the  Kuwaiti ambassador to Syria, crossed the dangerous line from east to west and  back for talks with Lebanon's two rival ad hoc governments: Aoun's in the east  and a caretaker Muslim government headed by Salim Hoss in the west.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Central Government  </P> <P> The country has not had a central government since late last year, when a  parliamentary quorum could not be raised to vote on a replacement for outgoing  president Amin Gemayel, a Christian.  </P> <P> Jassim would not discuss details of his talks but disclosed that they centered  on the current fighting.  </P> <P> A Good Friday lull in the artillery battles eased tension in the capital and  people who had taken cover in basements and other shelters emerged and pressed  shop owners to open and enable them to stock up on food before the fighting  resumed.  </P> <P> And, after a 14-hour lull, the fighting did resume. Hundreds of rounds fell on  both sides of the line dividing Beirut and on Druze and Christian towns in the  mountains overlooking the capital, police said.  </P></p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: The FT and the British election - wrong, wrong but for the right reasons, and right Sir, I was dumbfounded by the conclusion reached in your leader on Election Day. Britain is a capitalist country. One only has to look at the shadow Budget to see that its effect would have been to erode the basis of capitalism. It would also have turned inward investment into outward investment, which would have been a disaster for the growth of the economy.

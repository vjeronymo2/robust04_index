			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: IHL rejects ADollars 133m bid from Davids Holdings Directors of Independent Holdings (IHL), the Australian wholesaler, yesterday rejected the ADollars 133m (USDollars 97.7m) bid for the company launched on Friday by its rival Davids Holdings. The managing director of IHL, Mr John Patten, said he supported rationalisation in the industry, but the Davids bid was 'grossly inadequate'. The bid, at ADollars 4.25 cash a share, is the latest in a flurry of corporate activity in the fragmented and incestuous Australian grocery industry. It follows last month's ADollars 501m move on wholesaler Foodland Associated by New Zealand rival, Rank Commercial, and Australian retailer Coles Myer. The bid for Foodland, which controls 18 per cent of IHL, has been blocked in the Australian courts following intervention by the Trade Practices Commission.</p>

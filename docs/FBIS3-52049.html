Alarcon, who is heading a Cuban delegation that began a  visit  to Belgium on Sunday, met this afternoon with the Foreign  Economic Affairs Commission of the European Parliament headed by  Belgian Liberal Deputy Willy de Clerq.    During the meeting, De Clerq expressed the European  Parliament's interest in increasing contacts with Cuba. He  noted that he was one of the supporters of a resolution that  rejected the U.S. blockade, which was approved at the European  Parliament plenary meeting in Strasbourg last September.    During an extensive, lengthy debate on various topics, the  visitor stressed the need to expand cooperation and trade  relations between Cuba and the EU and between Havana and the  member-states of that supranational organization.    Alarcon also met with Egon Klepsch, chairman of the European  Parliament, who expressed interest in the current situation in  Cuba, especially the economic reforms now taking place.    At both meetings he underscored the importance that any  economic measure to be adopted in the current circumstances in  Cuba should have the broadest consensus of the people, who have  been the basic historic backbone of the Cuban project.    Among other activities, the Cuban leader attended a dinner  with Belgian businessmen in which the new product line of Cohiba  1492 was presented by the Sutter Co. -- the Havana cigar  distributor in the Benelux nations.    Ramon Pez Ferro, secretary of the Foreign Relations Standing  Committee of the National Assembly of the People's Government,  and Rosario Navas, Cuban ambassador to Belgium and the EU,  participated in today's meeting.    Alarcon will stay in Belgium until 30 January. During his  stay, he will meet with representatives of the Belgian  Government, the parliament, and European political groups and  friendship with Cuba associations.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Mubarak denounces the terrorists, noting that the  Egyptian people have rejected their motives, which are contrary  to Islam. He adds that the security of the country is the  responsibility of each person. He adds: "The police behavior  toward the enemies of the homeland will remain civilized and  governed by the rule of law and will remain above the methods of  revenge. The police will not punish anyone for a crime  committed by someone else but will put the whole matter into the  hands of a fair and honest judiciary that is not subject to any  authority other than conscience and the law." Mubarak notes that  the terrorist incidents could have been used as an excuse to  impose "emergency measures" but that Egypt's government has  insisted on adhering to the rule of law due to its belief in  democracy.    President Mubarak continues his speech by noting: "The fact  is that some of our national parties have taken a step in the  right direction. They condemn terrorism and strongly call for  eliminating its lairs, causes, and roots. Only some of the  enemies of democracy, who are still hiding behind false slogans  that propagate terrorist ideas and actions, have remained  outside this national consensus." He recalls his recent call  for a national dialogue among political parties and clarifies  that he is not trying to eliminate the differences among  political parties but rather to find a consensus on confronting  terrorism.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Investigation to start into Metallgesellschaft's ex-boss The Frankfurt prosecutor's office has launched a formal investigation into Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the former chief executive of the troubled Metallgesellschaft group, and former finance director Mr Meinhard Forster. Ms Hildegarde Becker-Toussaint, spokeswoman for the office, said the investigation would focus on suspicion of fraud and failure to inform the supervisory board of developments. Metallgesellschaft refused to comment on the investigation yesterday, nor on press reports that Mr Schimmelbusch, a 49-year-old Austrian, had misused company funds. If formal charges were brought as a result of the investigation, the former executives could face fines or up to 10 years in jail. The investigation, initiated after a complaint from a Metallgesellschaft shareholder, follows the sacking of the two executives last month after the group encountered serious liquidity difficulties arising from its activities on the US oil futures market. Since then the scale of the problems afflicting the Frankfurt-based metals and mining group, has escalated. Last week Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the new chief executive, revealed that losses in the year to September amounted to DM1.8bn (Pounds 700m) - five times those originally reported. The group's bankers and shareholders have been given until tomorrow night to support a DM2.7bn injection of new equity capital. The group's bank creditors were told yesterday that they were expected to extend DM700m of new credit to the company - DM200m more than the figure mentioned at last week's crisis meeting. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, urged bank creditors and shareholders to support a swift restructuring. He said this would secure jobs and avoid unnecessary tensions on international metals markets. It is likely the 100-plus banks involved will accept the refinancing. There is unhappiness among non-German banks over the lack of time for considering the plans and the rigidity of the proposals. Banks asked for new credits, Page 24</p>

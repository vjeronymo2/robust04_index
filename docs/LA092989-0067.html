			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: CONSULTANTS NEED TO CREATE A STRONG FIRST  IMPRESSION  </P> <P> The October, 1987, stock market crash was a disaster for many New Yorkers, but  for two entrepreneurs, Black Monday spawned an unusual small business.  </P> <P> At the time, Roslyn Brandt was overseeing the design of a new corporate  headquarters building for the Salomon Bros. investment banking firm. When the  market collapsed, so did Brandt's massive project.  </P> <P> Instead of bemoaning her fate, Brandt met with Diane Barnes, director of  marketing for a prestigious New York architecture firm, and they decided to  form Barnes &amp; Brandt Inc.  </P> <P> By capitalizing on their professional contacts, the pair provide advice to the  design and architectural community. In recent months they have recruited 10  architects for a Sydney, Australia, skyscraper project and coordinated a  management retreat for a troubled architectural firm. They are also under  contract to advise England's largest commercial furniture company on how to  please American tastes.  </P> <P> At first, Brandt said, they worried that "if a company like ours didn't exist,  there had to be a reason."  </P> <P> But, as soon as they decided to take the risk, the response was, "Why hasn't  someone done this before?"  </P> <P> Barnes said many consultants who set themselves up in business fail because  they don't make a strong first impression. Because consultants deal directly  with top decision makers, it is critical to have a professional-looking  brochure, a snappy logo and a passion for selling your services.  </P> <P> "One thing that is particularly crucial for a small business is to establish  your own identity," said Barnes, who hired several graphic artists before  settling on a logo that she liked. Once you find the right logo she suggests  carrying the concept through by putting it on everything from letterheads to  T-shirts.  </P> <P> She also advises small-business owners that they have to spend money to make  money, especially in the beginning.  </P> <P> "People are hesitant to take a $300 plane trip that could bring in a contract  for $30,000," Barnes said. "If your business doesn't get a good strong start,  it will always be coming from behind."  </P> <P> A perfect example of this was when a potential client and his partner flew to  New York to meet with Barnes and Brandt. The women had just started their  business, and money was very tight.  </P> <P> "Dinner for four cost $300 in a top restaurant in New York," recalled Barnes.  "I signed the check and I thought, 'Oh my God, how will we pay for this?' But  ultimately those two became some of our best clients."  </P> <P> Another way to impress clients is to find out what charities your clients  support or what sports they enjoy. "A lot of people support people who support  them," said Barnes. "Why not help a client with their favorite charity or  jointly sponsor a sports event?"  </P> <P> Industry leaders said no one is serving the design community in quite the same  way as Barnes and Brandt.  </P> <P> "They are uniquely positioned with a high level of contact," said Martin  Yardley, a principal in STUDIOS, a San Francisco architecture firm and a  client. "They are equally valuable to the six or seven people involved in a  major construction project."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consultants Need Some Advice, Too  </P> <P> Most people think that consultants are too busy helping others to need help  themselves, but Howard Shenson has built a small business around counseling  consultants since 1971.  </P> <P> Through books, seminars and lectures, Shenson of Woodland Hills helps  consultants build their practices while coping with the changing business  climate. Here are a few of his "101 Proven Strategies for Building a Successful  Practice." The copyrighted booklet is available by mail for $3 plus tax by  writing to Shenson at 20750 Ventura Blvd., Suite 206, Woodland Hills, CA.  91364. Information on his Nov. 1 seminar is also available by mail.  </P> <P> Write a separate brochure for each target market you serve. Concentrate on the  benefits that you provide to each type of client.  </P> <P> Never use a resume to promote your services. You may have to develop a resume  to satisfy the files of an existing client, but it is a disastrous first  marketing piece.  </P> <P> Do not promote your services to the personnel department. Always promote your  services to the executive or manager.  </P> <P> Devote about 15% to 25% of your working hours -- each and every week -- to  marketing and selling. The time to market is not when you have run out of  clients.  </P> <P> Don't bad mouth your competition. Explain why your services are better and the  unique advantages you offer. If you are really better than the competition, it  will be obvious to your clients and prospects.  </P> <P> Dress the way your client or prospect dresses, within reason. Don't be overly  formal or informal.  </P> <P> Don't look upon having to write a proposal as unnecessary drudgery for getting  the business. Research clearly shows that those who write proposals (even when  they don't have to) wind up getting bigger and better assignments.  </P> <P> When writing letters, increase impact with a handwritten P.S. It will result in  your letter being read first and it will instantly grab the reader's attention.  </P> <P> Be listed in all trade and professional directories that reach your target  market. More than half of all directories will allow you to be listed free of  charge.  </P> <P> Charge for travel expenses on a per-diem basis rather than a direct  reimbursement basis. Most clients prefer the simplicity of per diems, and it  avoids any criticism of how you spend expense dollars.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hot Line for Women Business Owners  </P> <P> The American Women's Economic Development Corp. and Citibank are sponsoring a  telephone hot line for the nation's 4.1 million women business owners. Business  owners can receive up to 10 minutes of help from a professional consultant for  $10. Sessions lasting up to 90 minutes can also be scheduled in advance for  $35. Both services, which can be charged to a major credit card, are available  by calling (800) 222-AWED. Callers in Alaska and Hawaii can reach the  counselors at (212) 692-9100. Citibank/Citicorp pledged $120,000 to underwrite  the counseling program for two years, according to a bank spokeswoman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unity Retreat for Small Businesses  </P> <P> Small-business owners and others interested in establishing a national agenda  for small-business interests are invited to attend a National Small Business  United leadership and federal issues retreat in February.  </P> <P> "The issues retreat is a very unique and special event that each year draws  together small-business leaders from all over the country to learn about  economic projections, political developments and legislative proposals which  affect the survival and success of small companies," said Betty Jo Toccoli,  president of the organization.  </P> <P> The retreat is scheduled Feb. 2-4 at the Radisson Palm Springs Resort in Palm  Springs. For information contact Rosa Wright at (202) 293-8830.  </P></p>

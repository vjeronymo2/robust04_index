			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UN condemns Baghdad's defiance THE UN Security Council early today condemned Iraq's removal by force of military equipment from the Kuwaiti side of the demilitarised zone and demanded its immediate return for destruction. In a strongly-worded statement, the council called yesterday's Iraqi intrusion into Kuwaiti territory - the second in two days - a 'direct challenge' to the UN and a clear-cut defiance of the world body. It warned Baghdad of 'the serious consequences that will flow from such continued defiance' of UN mandates. However, the UN's condemnation came in the form of a non-binding statement by Mr Yoshio Hatano of Japan, the current UN president, and no fresh punishment of Iraq was announced. The statement was read out by Mr Hatano after it was approved, then revised and approved again in closed-door deliberations. The Security Council meeting followed warnings from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, that violations and threats against Kuwait could not be tolerated and demands from the US for 'steps that can be taken to ensure that Iraq complies with UN resolutions'. A UN spokesman in Kuwait said about 150 Iraqis had crossed the border yesterday and dismantled several warehouses. Up to 500 had been involved in the seizure of arms from four weapons bunkers on Sunday. Iraqi president Saddam Hussein is also defying the UN by refusing to allow UN inspectors to fly to Baghdad to continue their search for weapons of mass destruction. While the UN talks were under way, there were indications of further movements of Iraqi missiles in both the northern and southern allied-imposed no-fly zones in Iraq. But Mr Robert Gates, head of the Central Intelligence Agency, said it was too early to decide whether the weapons still threatened allied aircraft. The US has already threatened military action if Mr Saddam again orders surface-to-air missiles and radars into the southern air exclusion zone below the 32nd parallel. Last night's UN statement noted a stipulation last November that military equipment in six bunkers in the former Iraqi naval base at Umm Qasr, in Kuwaiti territory, should be destroyed by or under the supervision of the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (Unikom). The council demanded that any future Iraqi retrieval mission should meet the terms set out by Mr Hatano last Friday. The statement also affirmed the council's guarantee of the inviolability of the Iraq-Kuwait boundary recently redrawn by a UN commission. The council stressed that Unikom facilities at Camp Khor should be inviolate and subject to the exclusive control and authority of the UN. The council asked Mr Boutros Ghali to explore urgently possibilities for restoring Unikom to full strength and consider 'in an emergency such as this' the need for rapid reinforcement as well as any other suggestions to enhance the effectiveness of the mission. Mr John Major, the prime minister, warned that he was 'losing patience' with Baghdad. Officials said he would not rule out a military response to the latest Iraqi actions. He will discuss the options with other ministers this morning. But UK officials played down suggestions of imminent strikes against Iraqi forces, stressing that any action would be agreed first at the UN. Baghdad yesterday maintained its defiant public stance, with Mr Ali Hassan al-Majeed, defence minister, insisting that Iraq would free itself from the no-fly zones. He pledged that Iraq's national sovereignty would be fully reclaimed and US military aggression defeated. Saddam pushes UN resolve to the limit Page 4 MPs hear of heavy sales to Iraq Page 9</p>

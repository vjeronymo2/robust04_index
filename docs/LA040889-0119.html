			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> ANTI-ABORTION GROUP SUES L.A. MAYOR, POLICE  </P> <P> Officials with the militant anti-abortion group Operation Rescue sued Los  Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and others Friday,  alleging police used excessive force in arresting hundreds of anti-abortion  protesters last month.  </P> <P> The federal civil rights complaint, filed late Friday afternoon at the Santa  Ana branch office of the U.S. District Court, seeks unspecified damages, an  injunction against future police brutality and a court declaration that  "preborn humans are individuals."  </P> <P> In addition to Bradley and Gates, the suit named Deputy Chief Robert Vernon and  an unspecified number of unnamed police officers as defendants.  </P> <P> More than 700 protesters were arrested during a massive sit-in demonstration  and counter-demonstration by pro-abortion forces outside a Wilshire-area  women's clinic on March 25. The anti-abortionists were arrested when they  refused to disperse from the entrance to the clinic.  </P> <P> The protest was by far the largest in both numbers participating and numbers  arrested in 3 days of Operation Rescue demonstrations in Southern California.  </P> <P> Robert Sassone, an attorney for Operation Rescue who filed the suit, threatened  legal action earlier in the week unless Bradley responded to the group's  allegations of police misconduct.  </P> <P> Bradley could not be reached for comment Friday. His spokesman, Fred  MacFarlane, said in response to the earlier threat of a lawsuit: "Let them file  (suit); we'll talk to them in court."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth responded to the lawsuit,  saying, "Absolutely no excessive force was used."  </P></p>

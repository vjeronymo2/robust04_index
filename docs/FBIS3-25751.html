			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mozambican Foreign Minister Dr. Pascoal Mocumbi has  warned that his government is considering using force to remove  members of the Malawian paramilitary body, the Young Pioneers,  who have crossed illegally into Mozambique last December. Dr.  Mocumbi said his government will ask the Supervisory and Control  Commission, the body in charge of implementing the peace  agreement between the Mozambican Government and Renamo  [Mozambique National Resistance], to become involved. This is  because the government would need to use troops to bring the  Young Pioneers under control, but under the terms of the peace  agreement with Renamo, any such troop movements must be approved  by the commission.</p>

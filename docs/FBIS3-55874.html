Skukin, and ITAR-TASS under the general heading  "We Wish You Success, Russian Parliament!"]    [Excerpts] Following his address at the opening of the  Federation Council's first sitting, Russian Federation President  Boris Yeltsin proposed that, until a chamber chairman is  elected, the "reins" be handed over to the oldest deputy. This  proved to be Peasants Party Chairman Yuriy Chernichenko, elected  from Moscow City District. The chamber members voted that he  take the chairman's seat.    In his turn, Yuriy Chernichenko proposed an expansion of the  structure of elders and invited Yuriy Matochkin and Yevgeniy  Krasnoyarov, heads of administration of Kaliningrad and Sakhalin  Oblasts, respectively, to take their seats behind the presidium  table, "thus encompassing all of Russia, from coast to coast."    Having elected, in accordance with the agenda, the sitting's  first working organ, the deputies heard a report from Nikolay  Ryabov, chairman of the Russian Federation Central Electoral  Commission. Having emphasized that "the elections to the  Federal Assembly were for the first time ever free from  ideological fetters," he briefed deputies on the course of the  election campaign which "disproved the prevailing opinion about  the Russians' passiveness and lack of interest in politics."  The Central Electoral Commission chairman presented a  statistical sketch of the composition of the corps of deputies.  It includes people of 29 nationalities, 76 percent of whom are  Russians. The age of one-half of the chamber's members ranges  between 25 and 50 years. There is a total of nine women. All  have higher education, except two whose higher education has not  been completed. Some 80 percent of deputies have described  themselves as nonparty members. More than 50 percent are  representatives of organs of executive power. The new chamber  contains 49 former Russian Federation people's deputies.    A Credentials Commission was elected to verify the deputies'  mandates.    Our new parliament resembles a large ship, only just  launched  from the stocks to face the gales and storms. The next few days  will tell whether its cruise will be propitious and successful,  whether it will manage to safely navigate the reefs and shoals.    For the time being, however, everything appeared more than  propitious on the surface at the first sitting of the State  Duma, which was held at the former City Hall building on  Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment yesterday, 11 January: Deputies  wore generous smiles and warmly greeted one another. Even  though it is an open secret that the seeds of confrontation were  already sown long before the start of the State Duma's work,  especially as regards the distribution of leadership positions  in the lower chamber and its committees, as well as its standing  orders.    God grant that these seeds do not produce luxuriant and  poisonous shoots! After all, what we need is not a shooting and  maliciously growling parliament, but a lawmaking and sensible  one. Will the State Duma, disbanded on four occasions in the  course of its history, this time manage to at long last adapt to  conditions in the Russian political field?    We addressed this question to Sergey Yushenkov (Russia's  Choice):    "The Duma will survive because, in accordance with the new  Constitution, its functions and powers are clearly defined. It  has two powerful levers to influence the executive branch:  lawmaking and the budget."    Stanislav Zhebrovskiy, deputy chairman of the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia]:    "We will be a constructive force. Our party is in opposition  to the government, but we intend to become a constructive  opposition. We intend to act autonomously, without joining any  blocs."    Vasiliy Lipitskiy (independent):    "There are grounds to assume that the State Duma will  survive. There will be a problem as regards the way relations  will develop between lawmakers, the president, and the executive  branch. I would very much like to see them being proper from  the very first day."    Let us look around us in the few minutes remaining until the  opening of the first sitting. As always, the journalistic  fraternity's attention is focused on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. He  is surrounded by a solid crowd of photographers, television  reporters, and correspondents with their tape recorders, making  it impossible to get close to him. One of our colleagues sadly  remarked: "We are creating his own image."    LDPR member Georgiy Lukava opened the sitting on behalf of  the State Duma elders. He congratulated the deputies on the  start of their work and expressed the hope that it will be  fruitful and coordinated.    Georgiy Lukava then gave the floor to Russian Federation  Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin. [passage omitted  covered by referent item]    Aleksandr Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the Central  Electoral Commission, delivered a report on the results of the  December elections to the Federal Assembly and the referendum on  the Constitution. He announced that 439 deputies of the 444  elected to the State Duma have been registered as present.    Let us return to the topic raised earlier in this reportage.  Despite the diversity of political views, most deputies assume  that the State Duma will actually prove capable of functioning.  This is what the well-known economist Pavel Bunich said:    "I think that the technological market laws, which are most  important for the country, will 'gallop through,' as the saying  goes. The ideal and, in my view, attainable result in politics  is to achieve neutrality."    Independent Deputy Anatoliy Dolgopolov, field ataman of  Labinskiy Cossack Okrug, also advocates consolidation:    "The main point is to change course from the destructive  tendencies in reform implementation to constructive politics.  We cossacks uphold the Russian people's interests and support  firm presidential rule. We would like to work the land, not to  fight as Zhirinovskiy would have it.    "We have spent so long fighting, that it is time to start  rebuilding that which has been destroyed."    The agenda of the first sittings includes questions  concerning the ratification of the provisions of the State  Duma's Standing Orders on factions and deputies' groups and the  formation of factions and deputies' groups, the election of  State Duma chairman and deputy chairmen, the formation of  committees and the election of their leaders, the adoption of  the State Duma Standing Orders, and the ratification of the list  of urgent questions for the State Duma's first session.    The evening sitting was adjourned indefinitely due to the  chairman's total incapacity and incompetence. Deputies proposed  that Chairman Georgiy Lukava be replaced and that the future  chairmanship of sittings be assigned to the State Duma  Secretariat.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> BRANFORD MARSALIS, THE ORIGINAL, SHOWS HIS STUFF AT THE COACH HOUSE  </P> <P> "Those of you who want to hear tunes from my last album should go home and play  it," Branford Marsalis announced at the beginning of his show Saturday at the  Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. "We're not going to play any of them."  </P> <P> The mostly new originals that followed used the famous Miles Davis quintet of  the mid-'60s as their touchstone, the songs showing the same involved style of  composition and soloing that Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, Tony Williams and  Herbie Hancock brought to Davis' band on albums like "ESP" and "Miles Smiles."  But where Miles moved on to electricity and funkified bass lines, Marsalis has  headed out in an acoustic direction, extending Davis' cool posing with  emotionally charged solos and heads-up rhythmic interplay.  </P> <P> Though Marsalis' band (Kenny Kirkland, piano; Robert Hurst, bass, and Jeff  (Tain) Watts on drums) used Miles as a structural reference point, its  inspiration came from another '60s band: the John Coltrane quartet.  </P> <P> Much of this association is based on the drumming of Watts, whose circling  onslaught recalled the polyrhythms laid down by Elvin Jones for the Coltrane  band. Marsalis' deep, dark-roasted sound on tenor was similar to Coltrane's  large, open tone and some of the late saxophone giant's abundant technique was  also apparent. But where Coltrane would cut loose with screams, squawks and  high-end antics to get his point across, Marsalis stuck to the middle register,  delivering his story lines with all the smart timing of a good stand-up comic.  </P> <P> The saxophonist announced the set's first three numbers then proceeded to work  through them without interruption.  </P> <P> "Mr. J. C." featured a ringing solo from Kirkland while Watts leaned into his  drum set to get the smoke going. Bassist Hurst used double stops and tight,  playful pauses to get a rise out of the crowd, who seemed to appreciate his  silences as much as what he plucked.  </P> <P> After a big Coltrane-like ending with Watts crashing away on his cymbals, the  group moved into Hurst's "Dark Night," a sultry theme that would make an  appropriate sound track for a Raymond Chandler novel. Marsalis began at the  tenor's bottom range, then worked his way up with rippling trills and quick,  greasy lines before handing off to Kirkland who built his solo on a mountain of  block chords.  </P> <P> Marsalis' "Wrath of Tain," a vehicle for the group's drummer and the only  previously recorded composition heard this night, gave Watts a chance to show  his melodic approach to a drum solo. Much like Max Roach, Watts suggests a  tune's theme and rhythms while building a solo that is rich with wit and the  use of dynamics. Switching to soprano for the number, Marsalis showed a  considered approach that avoided fireworks in favor of introspection.  </P> <P> The saxophonist's reserved soprano style backfired on Kirkland's "Revelation,"  as his smooth flow seemed to lag at times, lacking direction and excitement.  Kirkland came to the rescue, plugging the gaps with chordal echoes and  embellishments that held the piece together.  </P> <P> A Monkish number entitled "Spartacus" found Kirkland and Marsalis, still on  soprano, stating the quirky theme in unison. The saxophonist seemed more at  ease with the quicker tempo, dropping in a couple of lines from Monk's  "Brilliant Corners" before turning the proceedings over to Watts and his  rolling tom-tom attack.  </P> <P> Hurst picked out a little Michael Jackson riff ("Bad") before the group moved  into a Coltrane dedication called "Mr. Steepy." Marsalis wisely avoided any  overt reference to the late saxophonist, which seems to bolster the contention  that he's now developing his own direction.  </P> <P> The territory he explored at the Coach House guarantees the journey will be an  exciting one.  </P></p>

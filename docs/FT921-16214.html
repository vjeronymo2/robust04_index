			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong achieves another record high IN A generally firm day for the region, Hong Kong stood out on interest rate optimism. Tokyo, Taiwan and New Zealand remained closed. HONG KONG rose to its fourth consecutive record high, buoyed by hopes of a reduction in local interest rates. The prime rate, at 8.5 per cent, was expected to be cut by a half-point at the Hong Kong Association of Banks meeting later in the day. The Hang Seng index rose 5.35 to 4,307.13, up 1.7 per cent on the week, in turnover of just HKDollars 966m against Thursday's HKDollars 1bn. Trading, already light because of the absence of many fund managers, was further thinned by anxiety over the US-Sino trade tensions. Most actively traded were Cheung Kong, unchanged at HKDollars 19.80, HSBC Holdings, up 25 cents at HKDollars 36.00 and China Light, up 30 cents at HKDollars 23.50. SEOUL ended sharply higher on active buying by foreign investors who were allowed to invest directly in the local market for the first time yesterday. Foreign investors were estimated to have placed buy orders worth Won100bn, most of the session's turnover, which totalled Won104.17bn against Won366bn on December 26, the previous full day's session. The composite index rose 13.31 to 624.23, up 2.2 per cent on the week. Foreign investor interest focused mainly on smaller-capitalisation issues. Buying pressure was further concentrated by investment ceilings of not more than 10 per cent imposed on foreign holdings of South Korean stocks. Only 780 Korea Mobile Telecommunications shares changed hands before the issue hit its day limit-up of Won2,500 and activity ceased. It ended at Won78,900. Similar cases were Lotte Confectionery, up Won1,300 to Won36,900 and Ankuk Fire and Marine Insurance Co, also up Won1,300 at Won39,400. AUSTRALIA started lower, then rebounded on expectations that the Reserve Bank will cut cash rates by one percentage point to 7.5 per cent, probably after a board meeting on Monday. The All Ordinaries index rose 12.0 to 1,659.9, 4.1 per cent higher on the week, in turnover of ADollars 114.2m. A weaker currency gave resource shares an added lift with the miner CRA gaining 34 cents or 2.8 per cent to ADollars 12.54. CRA also benefited from its Hamersley Iron unit which announced a record 50.17m tonnes of iron ore production for 1991 compared with 43.87m a year earlier. SINGAPORE closed higher on late bargain hunting in blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index closed at 1,480.89, up 1.54 on the day and 0.9 per cent on the week. Share volume was a moderate 30.73m, nearly half of this generated in the last hour of trading, against 24.45m on Thursday. KUALA LUMPUR recovered in the afternoon to close mixed in thin trading. The composite index ended 0.83 higher at 552.99, fractionally higher on the week. MANILA was encouraged by the positive sentiment prevailing at home and on Wall Street. The composite index rose 4.1 per cent or 48.38 to 1,221.16, the highest since November 1989 and 6 per cent higher on the week. BANGKOK saw heavy trade in banking shares. The SET index ended 0.21 lower at 711.81, up 1.3 per cent on the week, supported by the firm banking sector. Turnover was Bt3.46bn. Bangkok Bank was the most active stock, ending Bt28 higher at BT468 with Bt538m worth traded. Robinson, a department store chain which made its debut yesterday, was the second most active issue with Bt321m changing hands. The share finished at Bt95.50 against its offer price of Bt50. BOMBAY broke through 2,000 on the BSE index to a new high of 2,007.22 before it closed 27.34 higher at 1,996.50.</p>

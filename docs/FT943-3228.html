			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / TUC offers Ucatt cash support: Guarantee of Pounds 250,000 underlines determination to save construction union The Trades Union Congress has privately promised a Pounds 250,000 guarantee to underwrite Ucatt, Britain's biggest construction union, as it prepares a tough rescue plan aimed at achieving financial viability by the end of next year. This unprecedented decision underlines the TUC leadership's determination to ensure that the union is saved from the threat of financial collapse. It follows the TUC general council's decision to suspend Ucatt's Pounds 180,000 annual TUC subscription to enable the union to send delegates to last week's congress. The union expects to return to financial balance and believes it will not need to make use of the TUC guarantee to Unity Trust Bank. Ucatt officials led by Mr George Brumwell, the general secretary, yesterday met HW Fisher, the union's accountants, and Unity Trust to discuss details of the rationalisation programme which it is hoped can be finalised and approved by the middle of next month. The bank is preparing to provide further financial assistance to Ucatt - possibly in the form of a loan - on top of the Pounds 1.428m overdraft facility it has been providing on condition that agreement can be reached on cuts to bring the union's finances into balance. The union is using its many properties as collateral to the bank, which in reality is ultimately responsible for monitoring Ucatt's finances on a day-to-day basis. Mr Brumwell said yesterday: 'The bank has continued to support us and it has kept a tight rein on our current expenditure, but we have managed within the overdraft facility.' He emphasised that his executive was giving full backing to the new rescue plan. 'We are increasingly confident we can get the union back into line,' he said. A rescue plan drawn up by the union and its accountants last year was found to have taken too optimistic a view of membership income. Instead of rising after two years of decline it has fallen by about Pounds 500,000 this year, about 10 per cent of annual income. The union's members are about to be balloted on a proposal that the union become an autonomous trade group of the TGWU general union from next January. Delegates at Ucatt's conference this summer voted in support of joining the TGWU by only 32 to 30, but Mr Brumwell said he was 'very confident' that the proposal would be approved by members. He said this would make no difference to Ucatt's need to bring expenditure into line with income. It has to meet interest and bank charges of about Pounds 4,000 a week. The main problem has been to ensure that it can establish financial support to meet the cost of staff redundancies and other measures involved in the planned rationalisation.</p>

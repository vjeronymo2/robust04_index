			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ho Chia (6320 0163): "Historical Metaphor of the </F> TV Play `The Tang Ming Emperor'"--first paragraph is  introduction]    [Text] Although Tang Xuanzhong, the "general designer  of opening up and reform" in the Tang Dynasty, created what  history calls an "unprecedented era of prosperity," his absolute  power ultimately led to the absolute corruption of society and  of the autocrat himself. Regardless of how prosperous the  times, they can change to troubled times because of absolute  corruption, which produces what Du Fu's historical pen described  as the tragedy of the nation breaking up, and the people's being  subjugated.    After more than 14 years in prison, Wei Jingsheng [7614 0079  3932] has just been released on parole. The reason for his  sentence was that he raised a self-evident truth: An autocracy  can only hatch a new autocrat under the autocracy, just as an  egg can only hatch chickens; if China does not realize the fifth  modernization--democracy--Deng Xiaoping will have been an  autocrat, identical to Mao Zedong. Therefore, Wei Jingsheng was  jailed by Deng Xiaoping's "imperial edict," but his subject is  something which people seek continuously to prove.  <H5>  People Associate Tang Xuanzhong With Deng Xiaoping </H5>   Recently, mainland Chinese television carried a lengthy  series titled "The Tang Ming Emperor," an exquisite, big-budget  production. In addition to being on mainland TV, this series was  also released on video tape, bringing to the Chinese community  worldwide its story of what happened over 1,200 years ago.  Although Tang Xuanzhong, the Tang Dynasty's "general designer of  opening and reform" had created an historical era of so-called  "unprecedented prosperity," his absolute power still led to  absolute corruption of society and of the autocrat himself. So  regardless of what kind of prosperous era it was, there was a  change overnight to troubled times due to absolute corruption,  with the result being the tragedy recorded by the historical pen  of Du Fu: The nation disintegrated and was subjugated by others.    It could be that the director Chen Jialin [7115 1367 2651]  and the playwrights Zhang Xian [1728 1720] and Ye Nan [0673  2809] were not originally motivated to "borrow the past to  satirize the present"; however, looking at the conclusion of the  series, it does objectively have that effect--relating the tales  of history to let people make comparisons with the subject of  Wei Jingsheng.    Forty-four years after the death of the Tang Ming Emperor,  Bai Juyi wrote the epic poem "eternal regret." At the end of the  poem, Tang Xuanzhong dies in sorrow due to his longing for the  concubine Yang, who had been forced to die: "Heaven and earth  have an end, but this regret is endless." Bai Juyi was a  contemporary poet, so his description of Tang Xuanzhong's  feelings before his death should be credible. Logically, the  ending of "The Tang Ming Emperor" need only adapt Bai Juyi's  poem to the TV screen, which would have been both easy and good,  as well as having a romantic artistic sense. However, the  director and the playwrights purposely ignored Tang Xuanzhong's  passion and grief over his lost concubine Yang; rather, they  purposely exercised their imaginations to express how much Tang  Xuanzhong missed his lost imperial power, his reluctance to be  alone, his attempts to summon his former officials, to see his  people, and his dreams of one day regaining imperial power. Even  when his situation was completely hopeless, he would still sit  on his abandoned imperial chair, dreaming of accepting the  adoration of his officials and subjects, clinging with all his  might to the symbols of the highest imperial power. When Chinese  people view this TV production, so widely divergent from Bai  Juyi's poem, how can they not call to mind the reality that Deng  Xiaoping, a "common party member," still holds the highest power  in the Communist Party? Absolute power is absolutely attractive,  so it produces what Wei Jingsheng tried to prove; i.e., that an  autocracy must produce an autocrat.  <H5>  Rapid Rise of Reform Under Autocracy </H5>   "The Tang Ming Emperor" expresses the idea that Tang  Xuanzhong Li Longji was, in conducting "opening and reform"  through perceptual knowledge, the most brilliant of the more  than 400 emperors in China's history. In the process of viewing  this show, Chinese people will naturally make associations and  comparisons, forming a hazy proof of reality.    When Li Longji first ascended the throne, he immediately  reformed the bad government left over from the harsh regime of  Wu Zetian, which had not been reformed by Zhong Zong and Rui  Zong. In these actions, he was extraordinarily open and  brilliant. He favored equality under the laws whereby "the son  of the emperor should receive the same sentence as a commoner  should he violate the law." He diluted the special privileges of  the imperial family. He dealt strictly with the "politics of  exchanging money for power" by which official positions could be  purchased. He advocated a society of coexisting multiple  theologies; one in which his subjects could freely choose  Daoism, Confucianism, or even the outside religions of Buddhism  and Islam, without the "ideological violence" that comes with a  single sanctioned religion. His economic policy was one of  "opening to the outside," where each of the Western nations had  a flourishing commercial trade with the Great Tang. He was so  open that he even permitted foreigners (such as the Japanese Abe  Nakamaro) to be officers in the imperial government. He was  opposed to witchcraft, paid attention to science, used the  imperial military forces to destroy locusts, ordered the making  of a new calendar, and promoted water conservancy projects;  thus, science and technology were very advanced. He opposed the  policy begun in the Qin Dynasty of stressing agriculture while  ignoring commerce. Rather, he implemented the "economic freedom"  of agriculture and commerce developing together, reformed and  carried out new policies so that throughout the country emerged  the boom era of "flourishing markets" and "the nation strong and  the people rich." He paid considerable attention to  "intellectuals," established an academy of classical learning,  and invited people of talent from throughout the world to  Chang'an, bestowing upon them very high wages and social  position, making China one of the world's leading nations in the  humanities and in science and technology.    Through economic and cultural (but not political) reforms,  Tang Xuanzhong indeed lifted the Tang up to an extremely high  level of prosperity, producing as many talented people as there  were stars in the sky. Tang poetry was the pinnacle of ancient  Chinese poetry, while the poetry of Tang Xuanzhong was the  zenith of Tang poetry. The so-called "poetry immortals" of  history--Li Bai, the "Saint of Poetry" Du Fu, and the "Buddhist  Poet" Wang Wei, etc.--all appeared in the Tang Dynasty. In  addition, there were such masters in the history of poetry as  Zhang Yue, He Zhizhang, Zhang Jiuling, Meng Haoran, Gao Shi,  Chui Jin, and Wang Changling. Wu Daozhi, referred to in history  as the "Saint of Painting," was Tang Xuanzhong's royal court  painter. Both the great calligrapher Zhang Xu, famed for his  cursive hand, and the calligrapher Yan Zhengqing, who created  the "Yan style," displayed their talents in the Tang Xuanzhong  era. The major Chinese composer Li Gui, who had a voluminous  output of vocal music, dancing music, and instrumental music,  was a royal court musician, while the Tang Ming Emperor himself  was a player and composer. Tang Xuanzhong created theater (by  absorbing a great many dances from Western regions), which set a  precedent for Chinese dance. There were such major dancers as  Lady Gong Shun who was adept at wielding the sword, as well as  the sword player Fei Weng. At that time, Fei Weng's sword dance,  Li Bai's poetry, and Zhang Xu's cursive hand were called "the  three peaks of perfection." Among religious specialists, there  was the great monk Jian Zhen, who traveled east to Japan and  established Japanese Ritsu....    There can be accomplishments in reform under an autocracy,  even great accomplishments. It does not matter whether one is  speaking of "Weng Jin's reform" or "Zhen Guan's reform" in  Chinese history, or even the second imperial regime of Napoleon  the 3rd in the period following the great French Revolution. The  latter saw the great achievement of completing the industrial  revolution in France, making France the world's second great  industrial nation, in which there were such literary stars as  Hugo and Flaubert, and such great impressionist artists as  Monet, Degas, Manet, Renoir, Cezanne, and Pissarro, the founders  of modern painting. Associating with Deng Xiaoping in today's  China, although his reform achievements cannot be placed on a  par with Tang Xuanzhong's "unprecedented era" of boom, it is in  degree several figures higher when compared with the Mao Zedong  era. In addition, the pace of economic growth over the past  several years has caused the Western nations, which have been in  a state of decline, to treat China with increased respect. Like  the Tang Ming Emperor, Deng Xiaoping has carried out reform only  in the economy, not in the "imperial regime." Achievements have  obviously been possible, even great achievements.    However, all the boom eras under autocracies in this world  have the same special features--like a rising balloon, the  faster it ascends, the faster it will break. "The Emperor's  achievements" will not last five generations but will frequently  collapse in "his own era."  <H3>  "Rapidly Endangered Syndrome" of Reform Conducted by an  Autocrat </H3>   Comparing Deng Xiaoping with the Tang Ming Emperor, we find  that reform under an autocracy has a "rapidly endangered  syndrome" with the following symptoms:    Corruption. Absolute power must accelerate in a  boom era, leading to corruption of the autocrat himself or his  governing group. Tang Xuanzhong began by corrupting himself. He  indulged in women and song and, especially after he obtained the  concubine Yang, he indulged in "night life" to the point of not  going to the "imperial court to attend to the nation's  business." In addition, when a man made it to the top, all his  friends and relatives made it there with him. This put his uncle  Yang Guozhong in power, and with this relative running things  the entire imperial court was soon corrupted. An era of boom  collapsed in the "Anshi chaos." Although there is nothing about  Deng Xiaoping which compares to the personal corruption of Tang  Xuanzhong or Mao Zedong, the Communist regime, its absolute  power unrestricted by a division of powers and a legal system,  must corrupt rapidly like the imperial regime of the Tang Ming  Emperor. In the 1980s, Deng Xiaoping promised that, "Even though  we risk being shot by people who hide in the dark, we will  attack economic crimes to the end, and no matter who is  discovered, we must punish them by the law." The result was that  even Hu Shiying [5170 4258 5391], the son of Hu Qiaomu [5170  0829 2606], was arrested for committing fraud then released,  arrested again, and finally released again after pressure from  all sides. For other cases, it also is that the law cannot touch  many people, "there are no results." Now, corruption has led to  complaints from people everywhere. Jiang Zemin has conducted an  anti-corruption campaign on his own, trying to save a dangerous  situation. While it is an incurable disease caused by absolute  power, no one can effect a miraculous cure and bring the dying  back to life.    Old and useless powers. Imperial power is a  lifelong system. When the Tang Ming Emperor was 70 years old,  and the An Lushan rebellion broke out, he lacked the talent and  strategy that he had in his youth when he rooted out the power  grabs of Queen Wei and the Princess Taiping. He made many  mistakes as a military commander, which caused the losses of  Tongguan and Changan. So also with Deng Xiaoping: When he had  just regained power, he had a complete doctrine of reform, but  later violated it completely by such actions as abandoning Hu  Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, imprisoning Wei Jingsheng, carrying out  a system of power for life in total disregard of the law, and  the "4 June" incident. Today, he is close to 90, yet still holds  absolute power. This presents 1.2 billion Chinese with a  self-evident truth concerning the old and useless--when anyone  enters old age, they enter an unchangeable process of decreasing  talent until they lose their capabilities completely, the final  stage of life. The wages of old and useless power is often  manifested in the exercise of power by relatives of the royal  court, eunuchs, secretaries, and children. This sort of illegal  power-wielding stems from extreme greed, usually the source of  the most dangerous disorder.    Violent change. For talented people, no matter if  they be in or out of government, there is a feeling of  helplessness when confronted with a situation of social  corruption and treacherous court officials in power, because the  autocrat's power is for life. Moreover, there are no means of  correcting the autocrat's mistakes, such as in a democratic  political system. Therefore, the only recourse is to wait for  the corrupt autocrat's death, or carry out a palace coup and  social rebellion in order to accomplish a violent change in  power. Doing it this way means that society must pay an  extremely high price, with the immediate destruction of an era  of prosperity built up through painstaking efforts.  <H5>  "Tang Ming Emperor"'s Warning </H5>   The "rapidly endangered syndrome" that "The Tang Ming  Emperor" warns of is: We are now 1,200 years removed from Tang  Xuanzhong, and for 200 years there has existed in the world a  modern democratic political system which can cure the absolute  power syndrome. How then can the Chinese still stupidly await  the "new autocrat" who will bring us good fortune? Even the most  brilliant autocrat, who carries out reform and operates the  whole era of boom, will also be like a rapidly rising balloon  which will quickly burst; how can we take a political mirage as  our future? Reform under absolute power is absolutely unreliable!</p>

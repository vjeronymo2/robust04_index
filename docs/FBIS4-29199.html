			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- A majority of the 511  members of the Lower House [LH] have supported an interparty  campaign calling for the next general election to be held under  the new election system combining single-seat constituencies and  proportional representation, organizers of the drive said  Tuesday [14 June].    The organizers have collected signatures of 306 lower house  legislators, including 42 ministers and parliamentary vice  ministers who signed on condition that their names not be  disclosed, they said.    The other 264 signers comprise 60 lawmakers from the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP), 34 from the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [SDPJ-- Social Democratic Party of Japan], 49 from  Shinseito, 42 from Komeito, 28 from the Japan New Party, 14 from  the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), 21 from New Party  Sakigake, Group Seiun and Minshu No Kaze, five from the Liberal  Party, five from the New Party Mirai, three from the former  Kaikaku No Kai and three independents, they said.    The campaign was arranged to prevent the LDP and the SDP  from  proposing a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata that could result in an early lower house general election  held under the still-existing multiseat constituency system,  they said.    The organizers will show Hata the results Wednesday and urge  him not to dissolve the lower house, they said. They will also  meet SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and LDP President Yohei Kono  to brief them on the outcome.    Yuji Tsushima, acting chairman of the LDP Policy Affairs  Research Council, and other organizers representing other  parties met reporters to release the results of the campaign.    The new electoral system, under which 300 out of a reduced  500 lower house seats would be elected from single-seat  constituencies and the remaining 200 through a proportional  representation system, was enacted in January, but it cannot  take effect until boundaries of the 300 new single-seat  constituencies are formally legislated.</p>

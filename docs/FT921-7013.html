			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / US rift with Israel deepens: Threat to Dollars 10bn loan guarantees unless settlements are halted THE US risked a serious rift with Israel yesterday by refusing to provide Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6bn) in loan guarantees unless the Jewish state stops building settlements in Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war. The tough US attitude was spelled out publicly for the first time by Mr James Baker, secretary of state, only minutes after peace negotiations between Arab and Israeli delegations resumed at the State Department. Israeli settlements had already become a key issue at the negotiations. The Arabs had threatened to walk out if the US guaranteed loans which Israel wants to help house immigrants from the former Soviet Union. This is the worst setback Israel has suffered in its relations with the US for many years and could have an impact on the Israeli general election on June 23. Israel indicated it would refuse to back down on settlements, but appeared at pains to find some reassurance for the US. 'We will not capitulate on settlements nor on the loan guarantees,' an Israeli diplomat in Washington said. 'I think a compromise can be reached in a manner which does not violate US policy.' Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, said the loan guarantees were not yet lost and he hoped they could be won with 'joint effort'. Urging calm, Mr Yitzhak Modai, the finance minister, said on Israeli television: 'I would suggest that we don't lose control.' The US has been at odds with Israel over the issue for months. President George Bush created a furore last autumn when he insisted on a 120-day delay in Congressional consideration of the loan guarantee request, in spite of heavy lobbying by US Jewish organisations. Earlier this month Israeli ministers had expressed confidence that the US would agree to their request, although they complained bitterly that the US was constantly shifting its ground in talks about it. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, has always insisted that settlements would continue to be built. Just before Mr Baker's announcement, he accused the US of siding with Arabs and said: 'We cannot under any circumstances go along with the principle that Jews have no right to live in this or that part of the Land of Israel.' Mr Baker, testifying yesterday before the House of Representatives foreign aid appropriations committee, said he was offering Israel a choice. It could stop building settlements and get loan guarantees of up to Dollars 2bn a year for the next five years. Alternatively, a deal could be struck to let Israel complete settlement work under way on, say, January 1, with the cost of completion deducted from the amount the US would guarantee. Mr Baker also made clear he was not referring just to house building when he talked about 'settlement activity'. He also meant clearing land and putting in infrastructure. Mr Baker said if Israel agreed to the terms, the US would insist on monitoring the agreement every 12 months to ensure the terms were adhered to. Israel initially asked for a single agreement to cover five years. Mr Faisal al-Husseini, leader of the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, had said on Sunday the whole process would be in danger of collapse without a clear signal from Washington on the loan guarantees. The Palestinians did not take part in the multilateral peace negotiations in Moscow earlier this month, which were also boycotted by Syria and Lebanon. The arrival of all the delegations in Washington this week suggested they anticipated a more forceful US position. Mr Husseini said if Israel got the loan guarantees 'Washington would be destroying the peace process with its own hands'. Other Arab delegates pointed out that the US decision would not affect more than Dollars 3bn a year in civil and military aid that Israel already got from the US. They said US moves to reduce this amount would be the next logical step if Israel continued building settlements. Mr Baker stressed during his testimony that the US retained its total and absolute commitment to the security of Israel. But the US is also reported to have urged Israel last week to withdraw its armoured forces from southern Lebanon. The Arab delegations are demanding that Israel concede the principle of withdrawing from occupied territories in return for a comprehensive peace as set out in UN Resolutions 242 and 338. Israel has said so far that it has nothing to offer beyond peace.</p>

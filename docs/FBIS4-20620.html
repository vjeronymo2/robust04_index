			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Toru Ito, Research &amp; Development Div. III] </F>   [Text] Toyota Motor Corporation has developed a navigation  system which automatically computes the route to the destination  and guides the driver using a synthetic voice. This navigation  system was developed for the purpose of providing a system  capable of reducing the load on the driver and helping him reach  his destination smoothly and more safely than by conventional  means.    This system has the following features: route information  display by means of digital mapping, present position indication  and guidance timing detection via signals from a satellite and  vehicle-mounted sensors, high quality voice guidance on the  course to take and the intersection name, automatic display of  intersection routing diagram, route re-calculating function,  etc. This paper describes these operations and the navigation  system configuration.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   At present, ways of making vehicles more intelligent are  being energetically studied all over the world. In particular,  the vehicle information system is seen as offering the  possibility of early realization of operational application.  Overseas, Intelligent Vehicle and Highway Systems (IVHS) and  other research projects are being vigorously promoted. In Japan,  Toyota took the lead in 1987 by developing a location system  that indicated the present position with a cursor on a color  cathode ray tube (CRT), followed in 1991 by a navigation system  that calculated and displayed routing to a specified destination  in 1991. Thus, Toyota leads the way in the development of a  vehicle information system. This voice navigation system is a  more advanced version of the conventional navigation  system.[.sup]1[/] Figure 1 shows the progress of these  navigation systems.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-97A>      Figure 1. Progress of Navigation Systems </FIG>  <H5>  2. Characteristics and Functions of the System </H5>   Toyota's voice navigation system has the following  characteristics:    (1) Digital mapping indication using a full color Thin Film  Transistor Liquid Crystal Display (TFT LCD) built into the  instrument panel.    (2) Automatic detection of present position using a hybrid  map-matching and Global Positioning System (GPS).    (3) Automatic calculation of a typical route to the vicinity  of a destination that can be selected and specified from the  address, telephone number and number of point, and on-screen  indication of the route map.    (4) Route guidance in a high quality voice using the names  of  intersections, destination names of the expressways and other  proper names recorded on eight Compact Disc-Read Only Memory  (CD-ROM) discs.    (5) Automatic indication of intersection guidance diagram  that enables the driver to determine which way to go at  intersections and their characteristics.    (6) Route re-calculation function that makes guidance route  changes to be made easily while traveling.  <H5>  3. System Configuration </H5>   Figure 2 shows the installation layout of the parts which  make up the presently developed navigation system. Figure 3  shows the block diagram of the same system.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-98A>      Figure 2. Onboard System Layout </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-98B>      Figure 3. System Block Diagram </FIG>     A 6-inch full color TFT LCD system is installed in the  center  of the instrument panel. The computer, CD-ROM auto-changer, GPS  receiver and TV tuner are installed in the luggage compartment.  The geomagnetic sensor is installed on the lower rear side of  the roof. The front wheel sensor is shared with that of the  Antilock Brake System (ABS). The GPS antenna is a planar  microstrip type of a diversity receiving system. It is mounted  under the instrument panel and the rear package tray so as not  to degrade the body styling. The entire system employs a total  of 10 CPUs.    Principal functions of the main computer (hereinafter  referred to as the computer) are as follows:    (1) Calculating the present position, (2) drawing the  digital  mapping, (3) high-speed route calculation, (4) voice guidance,  (5) indication of other audio and air-conditioning states, (6)  indication of maintenance and other vehicle state information,  (7) interpreting Compact Disc CRt Applied FormaT (CDCRAFT), (8)  diagnosing and other processing.    Hardware includes two high-speed, 16-bit CPUs, 7M bytes  memory, a graphic control processor, video RAM, a speech data  processor, a high-speed communication interface with CD-ROM, a  signal input interface from the vehicle sensor, and a drive  circuit for geomagnetic sensor. The mapping and voice guidance  data are recorded on eight CD-ROM discs in ISO 9660 format. From  the quality point of view, Adaptive Delta Pulse Code Modulation  (ADPCM) is used for recording the voice guidance data. Decoding  of ADPCM is processed by a special LSI. The voice data is  monaurally recorded with a cutoff frequency of 9.5 kHz and  compressed 16 times. The computer accesses the CD-ROM and reads  the ADPCM data to carry out D/A conversion each time voice  guidance is needed. The guidance voice is generated by a  one-channel audio amplifier built into the computer and output  from a speaker mounted in the door on the driver's side. The  volume is adjustable in five stages. When the guidance voice is  output, the radio and/or other audio system output is switched  by relay for this speaker only, enabling passengers to continue  listening to the radio and/or other audio system output while  the route guidance voice is being output.  <H5>  4. Basic Navigation Functions </H5>   Figure 4 shows the block diagram of the basic navigation  functions. The principal navigation functions based on the  digital mapping recorded on the CD-ROM include the following:  (1) mapping display of the present position along with the  sensor, GPS and map-matching, (2) display of reference maps and  destination designations according to the address and/or point  names selected, (3) calculation and indication of the route to  the vicinity of a specified destination from the present  position, (4) guidance to the vicinity of the destination using  voice and intersection guide diagrams.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-99A>      Figure 4. Basic Function of Navigation </FIG>    4.1 Map Indication of the Present Position    The present position is calculated by composing the findings  of (1) geomagnetic sensor, (2) front wheel sensor, (3) steering  angle sensor, (4) speed sensor, (5) GPS and (6) map-matching.  Maps are displayed in 1/20,480 thousand [as published] to  1/10,000th scale (1 cm on the screen is equivalent to 100 m) in  double pitch. The map of the present position is automatically  and instantaneously displayed on the screen by pressing the  ``Present position'' switch. The map scrolls smoothly as the  present position moves.    4.2 Reference Map Indication and Destination  Designation    Seven methods of designating the destination are possible  including specifying of the name of the point, telephone number,  and an enlarged sectional map from the master map of the nation.    There are 23 types of point names including addresses,  stations, hospitals, etc. Moreover, using the touch-switch on  the screen enables the destination to be set from a retrieved  map. If a telephone number specified by the driver is not  recorded on the CD-ROM, the area map is displayed from the  telephone office number. If the ``previous departure point'' is  specified, the system sets the starting point where the last  routing guidance was made the present destination. This function  is effective when starting out from a hotel or other point of  previous destination. When the system is not operated for a  period of time, a ``help'' function is incorporated that  explains the operating method by voice.    4.3 Calculation of Route and Indication    After specifying the destination, the driver sets the  conditions for calculating the route. There are two kinds of  conditions. One is whether the route includes passing points or  not. If included, they are to be specified just as specifying  the destination. The other is whether toll roads are to have  priority or not. If there is a passing point, the route may be  set separately from the present position to the passing point  and then to the destination.    When the route calculation conditions are set, the computer  starts calculating the route to the specified destination.    A map is indicated on the screen in a scale that allows both  the present position and the destination to be covered on the  same screen. For the route calculation method, the modified  Dijkstra's algorithm is used. If the destination is a long  distance away, calculation time is shortened by using  precalculated expressway networks. The cost of road links is  determined by the length of each link, type of road, width of  road, traffic control, and right, left and U-turns.    It takes an average of about 50 seconds for the computer to  calculate and display the route.    If the destination is far away and the area is recorded on a  different CD-ROM disc, the calculation may require 10 to 20  seconds more time to allow the CD-ROM auto-changer to change  discs. When the routing calculation ends, the entire route is  indicated by a red link.    The computer then describes the main roads over the entire  route to the driver by voice, for example, ``Take Route 123.''  When the driver checks the guidance and touches the ``Start  guidance'' switch, an enlarged map (in 1/10,000th or 1/40,000th  scale) of the present position is displayed with a red link.    If the driver takes the wrong route or intentionally detours  from the set route, the screen indicates the ``Recalculate''  switch. When the driver touches the switch, the computer  indicates the calculation for returning on to the initially set  route in an area about 4 km away from the present position.  Figure 6 [not reproduced] shows the recalculation function. If  the driver desires to have the entire route to the vicinity of  the destination indicated anew, he simply touches the  ``Recalculate'' switch one more time. The computer then  recalculates the entire route to the vicinity of the destination  from the present position and displays the result. Helped by  these functions, the driver can easily change the guidance route  at will according to traffic conditions, restrictions and the  current state of the road.    4.4 Guidance on Route    Guidance on the route while traveling or navigating is  basically provided through the coordinated operation of three  guidance modes consisting of (1) display of a map showing both  the route and the present position, (2) display of intersection  guide diagram, and (3) route guidance by voice.    The driver checks the relationship between the route and the  present position or the topography of the vicinity and the  present position according to the map (1).    The driver checks the route and the name of the next  intersection, the form of road connection at this intersection  in detail, buildings that serve as road markers (for example, a  bank), and the distance to the center of the intersection,  according to the guide diagram (2).    The driver thus receives correct information on the  direction  to go ample time prior to arriving at the intersection where  branching is necessary according to the guidance given by voice  (3), enabling him to drive with ease without having to  frequently check the information displayed in (1) and/or (2).  This contributes to safer driving.    The screen automatically changes to the intersection guide  diagram from the map of the present position approximately 300 m  away from the intersection. Figure 7 [not reproduced] shows  typical intersection guide diagram.    The intersection guide diagram indicates an area of  approximately 150 m x 150 m in fixed state (without scrolling)  with the direction of travel to the top of the screen. The  distance from the present position to the center of the  intersection is indicated by a bar graph in the lower right-hand  corner. The circle and the arrow-shaped cursor move in about 50  m steps to indicate the present position. The screen indicates  the route on the intersection road diagram using a separate  colored line. When the vehicle travels about 50 m beyond the  intersection, the intersection guide diagram automatically  returns to the map of the present position.    4.5 Route Guidance by Voice    Normally, the computer provides voice guidance automatically  when needed. If the driver particularly wishes to listen to the  voice guidance, pressing of the ``Guide voice'' switch actuates  the system to respond according to the current situation.    Voice guidance is provided in complete phrases using a  combination of basic guide text patterns, word patterns, and  data on proper names. The basic guidance pattern is determined  by the direction of travel, distance to the next intersection  and the one after it, the type of intersection (a four-way  intersection of an ordinary road, roundabout or expressway  exit), the type of road (ordinary road, expressway, urban  highway or toll road), and the width of the road (number of  lanes), presence of toll gates, etc. Data on the proper names  are used as reference to enable the driver to check the  intersection and the direction of travel. For example, it refers  to the names of intersections, expressways, national routes,  expressway interchanges, and expressway destination guides (road  markers). A female voice is used similar to that of a tour  guide. Figure 8 [not reproduced] shows some examples of spoken  guidance.    On a general road, the system provides guidance on the  direction to travel and the name of the intersection about 700 m  and 300 m before reaching it (in the case of a road having two  lanes and driving on one side), or on an expressway, the name of  the destination on the road sign or the road name about 2 km and  1 km before arriving at the junction. In cases where  intersections appear in succession and no distance is available,  guidance is given for two intersections at the same time. When  the vehicle has to travel a long distance after turning at an  intersection, the computer explains the distance to the next  intersection by saying, ``Continue cruising-along this road for  about 4 km,'' so that the driver can relax and concentrate on  driving. If the driver presses the ``Guidance voice'' switch  during or before the guidance, the system responds by saying,  for example, ``About 500 m ahead, make a right at Toyota Town,''  according to the current distance to the intersection.    Moreover, the system calculates the timing according to the  vehicle speed and the time required to complete the guidance.  Voice guidance is started slightly ahead of time so that the  vehicle will be at the announced distance from the intersection  by the time the guidance ends. The system uses over 120 types of  guidance patterns according to the route and situation. As thus  far described, the computer provides the driver with appropriate  voice guidance in consideration of the road connection form,  distance required for changing lanes, guidance timing according  to the driving speed, difficulty involved in passing through a  series of intersections, road sign matching, and so forth.    It has been verified that this intelligent voice guidance  reduces the number of times the driver is required to watch the  display and the time needed for checking, and lowers the  driver's heart rate before intersections, and the load on  him.[.sup]2[/]  <H5>  5. Navigation Data </H5>   The computer mainly provides maps of roads over 3 meters  wide, road connection data for routing, junction guidance  diagram, guidance voice and index data. Figure 9 shows the  amount of recorded digital mapping data available.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-101A>      Figure 9. Digital Mapping Data </FIG>  <H5>  6. Conclusion </H5>   We have realized an intelligent system for correct  navigation  that reduces the load on drivers by using large-capacity CD-ROMs  and a high performance computer, voice and road data for  guidance based on actual surveys of 160,000 intersections,  optimized voice guidance logic according to route and driving  conditions, flexible modification of the guidance route, and so  forth. Future research problems include the provision of dynamic  route guidance based on traffic information on road congestion  and restrictions fed back by the infrastructure, as well as cost  reduction and standardization of mapping data and the  development of infrastructure. In the future, we expect to be  able to develop more intelligent and practical systems and  expand their use along with the development of the  infrastructure as a means of improving the traffic environment,  economic efficiency and safety.

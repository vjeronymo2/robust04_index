			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANNED LAYOFFS AT MCDONNELL LEAVE TOOLMAKERS UPSET  </P> <P> Toolmakers on the McDonnell Douglas C-17 cargo jet program are in an uproar  over an apparent company plan to lay off some American employees but retain  British employees who were brought in on visas under the claim that the company  could not find any Americans to do the work.  </P> <P> The controversy comes just as McDonnell Douglas and other aerospace firms are  starting massive layoffs in response to defense budget cuts and to improve  their financial performance. McDonnell said Thursday that it would lay off  3,000 white-collar workers at its Douglas Aircraft plant in Long Beach, an  action unrelated to the toolmakers.  </P> <P> With work dwindling everywhere in the industry, the American toolmakers say  they will be hard-pressed to find new employment, and they are outraged that a  defense firm would retain foreign workers in such a downturn. The dispute  points up the rising level of tension among workers amid the approaching  defense cutbacks.  </P> <P> At issue are so-called contract toolmakers or job shoppers, who work under  contract at McDonnell Douglas through an outside placement firm. Douglas  employs about 160 contract workers on the Air Force C-17 cargo jet program. In  addition, Douglas has 70 British toolmakers who are regular company employees  and about 120 other toolmakers who are employees but not British.  </P> <P> An internal memorandum, obtained by The Times on Friday, indicates that company  officials were weighing the consequences of laying off the contractors as early  as last January. The memo said management would have to take into consideration  the "political objections by some contractors if we retain too many UKs  (British toolmakers) and terminate American citizens."  </P> <P> The memo indicated that various management departments within Douglas were  seeking "an agreement on how many (British) we want to keep as opposed to how  many American contractors we want to keep." The concern was that "UKs cost less  than contractors."  </P> <P> In any event, the memo said, "We must reduce head count ASAP (as soon as  possible)." It also indicated that C-17 executives had ordered a 15% cut in  overtime pay. Last year, some toolmakers were working as many as 70 to 80 hours  per week.  </P> <P> A Douglas spokesman said Friday: "No layoff notices have been issued at this  time. The only contractors who have been laid off until this time were let go  because they were marginal or for not following company rules."  </P> <P> The spokesman said the British workers are "regular employees and union  members" and added, "Our agreement with the union requires that we let a  contract person go before a union worker."  </P> <P> But union officials said their position is to support the contract toolmakers,  not the British.  </P> <P> "The British must go because they are imported workers, and American workers  have the first right to those jobs," said Douglas Griffith, president of United  Auto Workers Local 148, which represents Douglas toolmakers. "It is my  understanding that there has been two or three court decisions that imported  workers cannot be in place while a company displaces American workers."  </P> <P> Griffith emphasized that he had no information that the company was actually  planning to lay off any workers, since Douglas still has many tools to make for  its C-17 and MD-11 aircraft programs.  </P> <P> Griffith said Douglas paid $400,000 to a San Francisco law firm earlier this  year to help resolve a problem when the State Department declined to extend the  British workers' visas. Griffith said the union helped get the visas extended  because it was convinced that Douglas was having a hard time finding American  workers.  </P> <P> "There is no objection from us in terms of needing those people when we had  evidence that the company made a countrywide search," he added.  </P> <P> But a Douglas supervisor who has been concerned about the use of British  workers said there are adequate numbers of American toolmakers, but they have  not been hired by Douglas. The American contract workers are worried.  </P> <P> "We are all just waiting for the ax to fall," said Joseph Murray, a 15-year  aircraft industry veteran at Douglas. "I haven't been formally notified, but  the handwriting is on the wall."  </P></p>

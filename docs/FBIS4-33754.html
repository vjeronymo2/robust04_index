			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 12 Jun (PL) -- The Zapatist National  Liberation Army [EZLN] today rejected the peace agreements  proposed by the Mexican Government -- a peace plan that was  designed to put an end to the armed conflict that erupted in  Chiapas State in the country's southern region in January.    Three communiques signed by Subcommander Marcos announced to  the media that in the consultation process with the communities,  97.33 percent voted against signing the government proposal,  while 96.47 percent favored not resuming hostilities.    For this reason, the rebels' General Command reported that  the EZLN has officially declared the San Cristobal negotiations  closed, and it has called on the people to enter a new dialogue  "with all of the progressive forces in the country."    Nevertheless, with the purpose of not interfering with the  upcoming August elections, the guerrillas have ordered their  regular and irregular forces to unilaterally extend the  cease-fire. The rebels also ruled out any EZLN actions against  the Federal Government.    In addition, the rebels will permit the installation of  voting sites in the territory under their control. These voting  sites will be supervised by nongovernmental organizations and  the International Red Cross.    The EZLN has warned that it "absolutely will not accept any  federal, state, or municipal aid and will resist the situation  with its own means and with the assistance of the Mexican  people."    It also warned, "We will continue to fight as long as the  national flag does not fly in democracy, freedom, and justice  over Mexican territory." The rebels also proposed holding "a  national democratic convention" to create a provisional or  transitional government.</p>

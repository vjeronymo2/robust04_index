			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (16): Not so obscure objects of desire - Handbags There are some products which command a loyalty, a reverence which is out of all proportion to their usefulness. These are the ones that somewhere along the line have achieved cult status, that are recognised from Kuala Lumpur to Fifth Avenue, from San Francisco to Tokyo. Each has something to offer which is above and beyond any rational assessment of their worth. THE Hermes Kelly bag was, well, just another bag until the day in 1956 when Grace Kelly, the Hollywood movie star who had just become a Crown Princess of Monaco, appeared on the cover of Life magazine with her handbag placed firmly over her stomach to hide her pregnancy. Hermes received so many orders that it rechristened the bag the Kelly, in honour of its royal patron. The Kelly has been a classic ever since. Year after year thousands of women spend anything from Pounds 1,970 for a basic bag, to Pounds 33,000 for a Kelly with a few little extras, such as a solid gold and diamond encrusted clasp. Why, oh why, do they do it? To its devotees the Kelly is much more than just any old status symbol: it is a compelling combination of style and substance. Everything about the Kelly says that it is elegant and expensive but also practical. A dinky little Chanel bag might be fine for the babes who only need a couple of charge cards and a change of make-up to get them through the day. But the Kelly is a bag for the woman of purpose: big enough to cram in A4 papers and bulky enough to thwack any mugger. The Kelly has its roots in the 1930s when Emile Hermes designed a daintier version of one of his best-selling saddle bags. The Kelly of today is the product of 15 to 20 hours of handiwork by the craftsmen at Hermes' headquarters in Paris. Princess Caroline, once the bump that her mother covered with a Hermes handbag, now carries a Kelly of her own.</p>

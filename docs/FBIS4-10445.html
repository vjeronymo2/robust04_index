			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First of a series of reports by journalist Carlos Santana </F> Ojeda on unlicensed private taxi drivers in Havana; date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] [Santana] Beginning today, I would like to report on  a journalistic research project that is intended to shed some  light on the work of private drivers who provide services to  tourists, especially at hotels. This situation is really  alarming. Tourists usually would rather hire private taxis  rather than licensed taxis. Why is this? Is the work done by one  or the other more or less efficient? These are questions I  intend to answer, one way or another, during the course of this  research within the next few days. I want to begin by  interviewing a private driver, one of those who are usually  called pirates.    [Unidentified driver] No. I am a hired driver.    [Santana] A driver hired by whom?    [Driver] Hired by tourists staying in this hotel.    [Santana] And how can you do this forbidden work?    [Driver] Well, we know that many things are forbidden here;  but we have to do it.    [Santana] How do you do this work?    [Driver] We wait for tourists who leave the hotel and are  looking for a taxi to go somewhere in town. We propose the trip  to them and they agree to hire us.    [Santana] What proposals do you make? Just the price?    [Driver] No. In addition to the price proposal, which is  much  lower than that of the taxi driver, we also propose a trip  through town, to take them to special places.    [Santana] Do you establish fixed prices or do the prices  vary?    [Driver] The price depends on where they want to go in the  Havana downtown area.    [Santana] Are the prices low or high?    [Driver] Our prices are much lower than those of taxi  drivers.    [Santana] And are you aware of the prices charged by the  taxi  drivers?    [Driver] Sure, we know the prices charged by taxi drivers.    [Santana] Are there many private drivers like you working in  front of the hotels?    [Driver] There are a few of us.    [Santana] And you surely charge the tourists in dollars,  because the tourists do not have Cuban pesos. What do you do  with the dollars?    [Driver] I use the dollars to buy things that are not found  in the market -- soap, oil, and other things not found in the  (?state stores).    [Santana] Where do you buy those items you need?    [Driver] I buy them on the street, on the black market where  they are much cheaper than in the state stores.    [Santana] Do you have children?    [Driver] Yes, I have three children.    [Santana] What do your children do?    [Driver] They study. They are still in school.    [Santana] What is your name?    [Driver] Well, you told me that this would be an interview  without giving names. If I tell you my name, you might [words  indistinct].    [Santana] Where do you work and what is your profession?    [Driver] I am not going to tell you my name or where I work.  But I am an engineer.    [Santana] And what would you prefer to be called: engineer  or  driver?    [Driver] For the time being, because of the work I am doing,  I would rather be called a driver.    [Santana] These remarks by this private driver give you an  idea of the nature of the work and how it affects the economy of  taxi drivers. It is obvious that the currency they earn is  outside the country's funds and therefore is not reinvested in  social programs like health and education. Tomorrow, I will  continue this work by discussing the subject from the point of  view of the official taxi drivers, so we can draw our  conclusions on the causes of this problem.</p>

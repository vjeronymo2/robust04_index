			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: NatWest to open capital markets side in Frankfurt NATIONAL Westminster Bank, the UK clearer, plans to open a capital markets operation in Frankfurt in the first half of next year in the latest move to expand away from its sterling-dominated base. For NatWest, the move represents a renewed attempt to build a broad-based business in the debt markets, after a decision only three years ago to focus almost exclusively on sterling. 'In the long term, we would have to aim at being an issuing house in D-Marks,' said Mr Gary Southern, head of capital markets. 'But we would want to avoid the standard mistake of rushing in when everyone else is rushing in as well.' The weakness of UK banks in the D-Mark was emphasised last month when the UK government chose Deutsche Bank to lead a DM5bn Eurobond issue. British banks similarly played only a minor role when the UK raised Ecus in 1990. The initial purpose of the German operation will be to strengthen contacts with German customers and find ways to arbitrage between the domestic German and international markets, said Mr Southern. The bank is currently seeking approval from the German authorities for its plans. The derailing of the Ecu bond market in recent weeks has forced many banks to review their strategies in the European capital markets, forcing them to put more resources into their coverage of domestic markets, Mr Southern said. 'We've upgraded our thinking on markets in Europe,' he said. 'My sense is that a number of houses feel they have to commit more to domestic markets.' NatWest plans to limit its investment in overseas domestic markets, though, in an attempt to avoid the mistake of overexpansion it and other banks made in the 1980s. The bank recently announced the acquisition of the Milan branch of Continental Bank, bringing it a capital markets presence in Italy, but has no plans to expand into France. 'The French banks do a remarkably good job as trading houses in their own centre. They don't leave a lot of room for foreign banks coming in,' said Mr Southern.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> OCEAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> N. TORRANCE WINS NARROW VICTORY OVER MORNINGSIDE  </P> <P> Tailback Andy Alvillar scored on a four-yard touchdown run and two-point  conversion with 4:05 left to play Thursday night to lift previously winless  North Torrance to an 8-7 victory over Morningside in an Ocean League football  opener at North.  </P> <P> "I feel great. This is a big one for us," said North Coach Don Bohannon, whose  team had given up 93 points in losing its three non-league games to Palos  Verdes, Bishop Montgomery and Rolling Hills.  </P> <P> But against Morningside, considered one of the favorites for the Ocean League  crown, the Saxons were superb defensively.  </P> <P> "Our kids grew up tonight," Bohannon said. "We did tremendously well on  defense."  </P> <P> Bohannon cited the play of defensive linemen Anthony Castro and Dennis Stevens,  linebacker Alvillar, defensive ends Eric Becker and Ken Petty and cornerback  Eric Hansen for helping North upset last year's league champion.  </P> <P> Morningside entered the league opener with three losses but was still  considered a powerful team based on close losses to Hawthorne and Leuzinger,  both ranked in the Southern Section Division II poll.  </P> <P> The Monarchs (0-4) opened a 7-0 lead on a short touchdown run on the first play  of the second quarter, but were shut out the rest of the way. Morningside was  hurt by several penalties and had one player ejected for fighting.  </P> <P> North (1-3) mounted its winning drive midway through the fourth quarter from  about its own 30-yard line. Alvillar, who finished with 22 yards rushing on  eight carries, found success running over the right side of the line.  </P> <P> His scoring run came over the right side, and the 5-foot-11, 165-pound senior  did the same on his winning two-point conversion run.  </P> <P> The North defense, which did a good job of containing Morningside's elusive  quarterback, Ernesto Carmicle, came up with one interception by Castro and two  fumble recoveries, including one by Alvillar.  </P> <P> "This place is just a total disaster," Bohannon said of the post-game  celebration. "We're just so excited."  </P> <P> West Torrance 35, Mira Costa 7 -- West Torrance took advantage of five Mira  Costa turnovers to beat the Mustangs, 35-7, in the Ocean League opener for both  teams at West High.  </P> <P> West quarterback John Walsh connected on 15 of 26 passes for 196 yards and  three touchdowns to lead the Warriors, now 3-1 on the year.  </P> <P> "We self-destructed," Mira Costa Coach Larry Petrill said. His team is now 2-2.  "We turned the ball over in their territory, they had to play on a short field  the whole night." West's longest drive was 50 yards.  </P> <P> The Mustangs' lone score came in the third quarter when Simi Fonua blocked a  Warrior punt, then fell on the ball in the end zone. That made the score 21-7,  but on the Mustangs' first possession of the fourth quarter, quarterback Jeff  Diussa fumbled while pitching on an option play.  </P> <P> West recovered the ball on the Mira Costa 15-yard line. Walsh hit James Kim  from the 15 three plays later to make the score 28-7 and put the game out of  reach. Kim also scored on a 37-yard toss from Walsh.  </P> <P> "Everybody played tonight," West Co-Coach John Black said. "It was a team  victory." GREG GONZALEZ  </P></p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Receivers close Daf chapter with final sale Administrative receivers yesterday completed the sale of the last part of Leyland Daf, the former UK subsidiary of Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker which collapsed last February with debts of more than Fl 3bn (Pounds 1.1bn). The former Leyland Daf test track and technical centre at Leyland, Lancashire, was sold to a combined management buy-out and buy-in team led by Mr Peter Capon, former Leyland Daf product development director. It is understood that the receivers - Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of Arthur Andersen - have raised about Pounds 110m net from the sale of the various Leyland Daf businesses, but it is unlikely that there will be any payment to ordinary creditors. After the payment of preferred creditors, the bank consortium led by ABN-Amro of the Netherlands, which includes National Westminster, Lloyds and Barclays, is expected to receive about Pounds 100m. The new company, Leyland Technical Centre, has financial support from Barclays. The administrative receivers have secured the survival of all the elements of the former Leyland Daf business by splitting it into independent units. Mr McKillop yesterday welcomed emergency legislation to clarify insolvency practice. Without it, he said, the rescue of a business as large and complex as Leyland Daf would not be possible in future. The Leyland centre sold yesterday was completed in 1980 at a cost of Pounds 27m. The new company, Leyland Technical Centre, will employ 53 people and will seek contracts from vehicle and components manufacturers. The first breakthrough was achieved in late April last year when the receivers sold the former Leyland Daf van operations, based in Birmingham, to a management buy-out team, saving about 1,000 jobs. The early rescue last year by the Dutch and Flemish governments of the former Daf heavy truck operations in the Netherlands and Belgium - now trading as Daf Trucks - was the key to the viability of the rest of the UK operations. Daf Trucks is the main customer for Lancashire-based Leyland Trucks, sold to a management buy-out team last June. Daf Trucks also took over the former UK sales and marketing operation of Leyland Daf from the receivers. The receivers created separate rescues for: The former Leyland Daf spare parts sales and distribution business in Chorley, Lancashire with 350 jobs, which is now trading as Multipart Distribution. The components manufacturing businesses in Glasgow and Leyland, now trading as Albion Automotive. The six African subsidiaries sold to local businesses. The engine reconditioning plant at St Helens, Lancashire, sold to British Polar Engines.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- The seventh Sochongnyon or  the Federation of Seoul Area College Student Associations was  inaugurated in a rally held at Hongik University in western  Seoul Wednesday afternoon.    About 2,000 activist students from Seoul National University  and 39 other universities and colleges in the Seoul area  attended the rally.    A student manifesto read at the rally claimed that "the  government has one-sidedly yielded to market-opening pressures  from world capitalist countries, causing threat to the very  survival of workers let alone 10 million farmers."    It also asserted that "the United States continues to pose a  nuclear war threat to North Korea to build up the danger of war  on the whole area of the Korean peninsula."    Yi Chong-uk, a Hanyang University senior, was chosen as new  Sochongnyon chairman at the rally which also set "resistance to  rice market opening" and "anti-U.S. struggles" as Sochongnyon's  major tasks of the year.    Prior to the rally, participating students staged a  demonstration along a 2-km street from the Sinchon intersection  to the Hongik campus, shouting "no war on the Korean peninsula"  and "no market opening."    Large police forces were mobilized in the Sinchon area but  no  clashes were reported during the demonstration.</p>

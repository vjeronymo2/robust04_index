			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Curbs on night flights criticised Night flying restrictions for London aimed at reducing noise levels while allowing more flights were announced yesterday by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary. Two constraints will operate, based on noise levels and numbers of flights, and airlines will not be allowed to breach either. Mr MacGregor said in a written Commons answer that quotas on noise levels together with higher limits on the number of night flights - as proposed last November - would apply for four years from October 24. Anti-noise campaigners reacted angrily to the news. Mr John Boulton, of the Heathrow Association for the Containment of Air Noise (Hacan), described the limits as 'disastrous'. 'The sleep of up to 1m people in west London is being disturbed night after night, and yet the government just steamrolls through with this bad news,' he said. The government's initial proposal to abandon limits on the number of take-offs and landings at Gatwick and Heathrow in favour of noise quotas was overturned by the High Court. The court ruled that the noise quota was outside Mr MacGregor's powers under the 1982 Civil Aviation Act to curb noise. The noise quota was based on a points system, but the government judged some aircraft so quiet that they could not be counted. Five councils in Surrey, Berkshire and London argued in the High Court that this could mean a rise in night flights from 5,750 a year to about 24,000. The government responded to the High Court ruling by reintroducing a limit on the number of flights. It also reclassified aircraft so that even the quietest would count as 0.5 of a point towards the parallel noise quota. The transport department yesterday described the new system as 'providing a double safeguard for residents while also acting as an incentive to airlines to use quieter aircraft'. In an effort to satisfy airlines' demands for extra capacity, the government has also reduced the hours of night restrictions by 30 minutes so that they will run from 2330 until 0600. Airlines have since lobbied for further rises in the limits and quotas and were yesterday disappointed at the government's decision to stick with last year's proposals. Mr Richard Hedges, of Britannia Airways, said: 'It is going to be very tight operating the flights we had planned.'</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Breaking with its Democratic allies, the Liberal Party in New York City  endorsed Republican former U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani for mayor, calling  him a "fresh" alternative to Mayor Edward I. Koch. The endorsement virtually  assured Giuliani a place on the ballot in November even if he loses the  Republican primary. It also improved his chances of becoming mayor in a city  where Democrats outnumber Republicans 5 to 1. The former prosecutor gained  national attention by prosecuting major organized-crime figures, Wall Street  inside traders and corrupt public officials. He resigned in January. Giuliani  is expected to announce his candidacy officially next month.  </P></p>

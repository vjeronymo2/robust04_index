This final action only deals with the oxygenated gasoline program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The MPCA noted that the officially designated nonattainment area for CO does not include Superior, Wisconsin, or St. Louis County, but only the City of Duluth, Minnesota. At this time, the State does not plan to enforce the oxygenated gasoline program in Duluth, which has been meeting standards since 1989. Also, it does not plan to enforce in the remaining portion of St. Louis County, which is largely a wilderness area and has never had a modeled or monitored ``CO'' problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This issue is moot. The State of Minnesota requested that USEPA redesignate Duluth to attainment for CO. Minnesota submitted a draft request to USEPA on October 2, 1992, and a final request before November 1, 1992. USEPA requested additional information several months later, and the State responded to this request by sending the information in early December 1993. The USEPA redesignated the Duluth area to attainment for CO on April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17706) in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional Information: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  During the public comment period, USEPA contacted the MPCA and requested that it withdraw from the Oxygenated SIP, the MPCA Board resolution of October 27, 1992, which was a part of the program plan. The resolution allowed the State to unilaterally take action to eliminate the oxygenated gasoline program upon submission by the State of a request for redesignation. This concept goes against USEPA redesignation procedures and cannot be approved as part of the State's plan. In a letter dated August 12, 1994, the State withdrew the October 27, 1992, MPCA Board Resolution from the requested SIP revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Rulemaking Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this action, USEPA is approving in final the SIP revision submitted by the State of Minnesota. The State of Minnesota has submitted and implemented an oxygenated gasoline program for the existing CO nonattainment area substantially in accordance with the requirements of the Act. The USEPA is, therefore, approving this submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA received no significant public comments on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator reclassified this action from Table 2 to a Table 3 action under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. OMB exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et. seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small business, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements. I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPS on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S. Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307 (b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 5, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of each rule or action. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307 (b)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The Bulgarian-British Prest Project, unveiled during Mr.  Baldry's visit, is intended to promote tourism in Bulgaria's  protected wilderness tracts and national parks with guaranteed  conservation of the natural resources. The project will be  financed by the British Government's know-how fund for  environmentally sustainable tourism in the countries of Central  and Eastern Europe. The British assistance will consist mainly  of equipment and experts.    Yesterday, Mr. Baldry met in Bansko with the mayors of the  municipalities in whose territories the two mountains rise.    "The residents in the national parks' territory need not  worry about the project," Environment Minister Valentin Bosevski  said at Sofia Airport. According to him, people must be  convinced that the implementation of a science-based and modern  policy for the growth of national park tourism will lead to  prosperity of the population in those areas.    Mr. Bosevski and Mr. Baldry discussed opportunities for  joint  waste management projects. Britain promised expertise and  financial support for the organization of an environment  ministers' conference which will be hosted by Sofia next year.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Foreign policy to the fore as Bush raises his TV profile THE political stalemate in Washington can be ended by the election of a Republican congress and president, according to President George Bush. This unsurprising advice was delivered in the course of Mr Bush's gentle introduction to one-on-one television, an afternoon Cable News Network interview mostly devoted, at the president's request, to foreign policy issues. The president declined to answer the one question about Mr Ross Perot, the prospective independent candidate, repeating that he would wait until after the Republican convention in August before taking the opposition on directly. But when asked if the best way to get things done in Washington was to have a Democratic majority in congress working with Mr Bill Clinton, he recalled the history of the Carter administration as demonstrating the fallacy of the proposition. He insisted the opposition of entrenched Democrats had made it harder to get his own ideas and policies on education, the environment, inner cities and crime enacted. In this 'crazy' election year, he said, a new Republican majority was conceivable. Mr Bush said he might appear on some of the more popular talk shows, but said it would be 'beneath presidential dignity' to invite all and sundry to call the White House on a toll-free number. Mr Clinton did two more hours on a breakfast-time show yesterday, repeating his criticism of a black singer who, in his view, was exacerbating racial disharmony. Meanwhile, Mr Perot, temporarily forsaking his chosen talk show genre, was embarking on a conventional speech-making cross-country tour.</p>

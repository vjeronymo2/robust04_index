			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 26 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Mexico City Mayor  Manuel Aguilera Gomez today announced that additional steps are  being taken to bolster security for presidential candidates  while they campaign in the capital. The additional measures are  designed to help guarantee the candidates' personal safety.    "There will be more (police) units at the political events  they (the candidates) attend," Aguilera told reporters. "Some  have accepted this, but others, such as Diego Fernandez de  Cevallos, the presidential candidate of the conservative  National Action Party, oppose the move. I believe it would be  desirable if they all would agree to accept the additional  security."    The move was ordered in the wake of the assassination of  Luis  Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of the Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI) who was killed at a political event in  Tijuana in northern Mexico on Wednesday. All eight opposition  candidates participating in the presidential elections scheduled  for 21 August have condemned Colosio's murder.</p>

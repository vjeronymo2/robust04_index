			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Secret services face new scrutiny THE GOVERNMENT has indicated that it will consider increasing the scrutiny of Britain's overseas and domestic intelligence services, Ralph Atkins writes. Legislation is already planned to put the Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, on a legal basis. But extra clauses to increase the service's accountability to the Commons were not ruled out by Downing Street yesterday. An official at the Foreign Office, which is responsible for MI6, said that consideration of the bill's contents was at an early stage but, 'it is all up for grabs'. Last month, the prime minister confirmed, for the first time, the existence of MI6 and named its chief, Sir Colin McColl. The domestic intelligence service, MI5, was put on a statutory basis in 1989 and, theoretically, is accountable to MPs via ministers. It is probable that any extra scrutiny applied to MI6 would extend to MI5. Some MPs however are demanding that the intelligence services should be accountable to a Commons committee, or a committee of privy councillors.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (22): What price mega-morality? / Finance THE R FACTOR by Michael Schluter and David Lee Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 6.99 276 pages IT IS shocking to discover a book contentedly basking in a fantasy world, when it purports to be a manual for social and personal amelioration. Not that this is a worthless book; far from it. But it has an astonishing disregard for the material and technological underpinnings of late 20th century capitalism. It is happier floating broad scale ideas and moralities. What the authors are trying to do is to generate a 'big new idea' which  - they hope - will take off in business and political circles. Their core idea is straightforward and without attachment to any identifiable major ideological force. It runs like this. We now live in a 'mega-community' in which rapid flows of information, capital and labour have put paid to those networks of stable personal encounters that gave rise to a sense of community and lent life both meaning and security. Anomie and alienation have sprung up in place of fulfilling human relationships. It is claimed that this has not just social and moral costs, but is economically inefficient too. It is a message familiar from a hundred works of fiction and philosophy. That is not to deny the book's veracity, only to pinpoint its weakness, which is that of most exhortatory texts; it identifies the problems and even proffers plausible solutions, but it is disconnected from any obvious means of putting those solutions into practice. We are offered some shaky assertions on which the rest of the edifice is constructed. At one point the astonishing claim is made that 'the news media, the fulcrum of western communications, is efficient because it is omnipresent', which follows soon after a suggestion that we are all 'well informed' by the news media of the 'mega-community'. A moment's reflection tells us, surely, not that we are well informed but that we are pulled by the nose by the mass media in certain directions and utterly ignorant of other events and issues which the same media have decided are not worth noticing. We are partially - and often badly - informed. However, the book's central flaw is too superficial an analysis of the current technologically-induced ills of the contemporary world. The authors correctly touch upon 'virtual reality' technology as purporting 'the ultimate denial of encounter' (and therefore, in their terms, a threat to human relationships). Yet they skate blithely on past it with never a glance backwards after its first mention on page 33. By the end of this century virtual reality will be a household presence; it deserves more detailed consideration than that given here, if only because the scale of the threat it poses to personal encounter as the central element of human existence. Nonetheless, there are moments, particularly in the second half, where the authors raise suggestions that have immediate appeal. One example is a proposed change to Britain's Mergers and Monopolies Commission to restrain 'giantism', which in turn would, they claim, foster a more relationship-oriented economy. 'In view of the massive power available to the big plc, and the extreme difficulties of regulating it, it surely makes sense to shift the burden of proof, so that the predator company (in a takeover attempt) or both companies (in a proposed merger) must be able to demonstrate a clear benefit in terms of efficiency, productivity, or the national interest. The amalgamation of companies . . . should have to be justified in ways meaningful to those outside the closed circle of the AGM.' There are a dozen or more similarly tantalising proposals which deserve a wider airing. Yet ultimately the book - and the charitable foundation which has been set up to promote the 'building of relationships in public and private life' - is probably doomed to become a victim of the social and political ailments it so clearly identifies.</p>

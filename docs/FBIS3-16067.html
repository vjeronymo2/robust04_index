			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Mar 11, BNS -- An ultranationalist Russian  movement, Russia's National Unity, today petitioned the Estonian  Embassy in Moscow for immediate release of Alexander Denisov,  one of the movement's leaders. The petition also asked that  Denisov be allowed to leave Estonia unhindered.    "The relations between the Estonian Government and the  Russian nation in the near future depend on how Denisov's  question is solved," Alexander Roshchitsky, the organization's  spokesman, claimed.    Russia's National Unity maintains that the organization has  a  fellow feeling for Estonians and wants to develop friendly  relations with this nation.    The organization claims the Russian people know Denisov as a  "defender of the White House and of the Constitution" and regard  him as a "national hero."    Denisov was detained on Feb. 15 in the northeast Estonian  town of Johvi. He worked in the early 1980's in the  Kohtla-Jarve police forces. In recent years Denisov fought for  the so-called Transdniester Republic in Moldova and was one of  former Russian parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov's  bodyguards.    Denisov arrived in Estonia illegally late in November.  Estonian authorities so far have charged him only with illegal  possession of firearms.    Russia's National Unity has often been named a fascist  organization. It is led by Alexander Barkashov, and members of  the organization's shock troops are known as "barkashovtsy". In  October 1993 "barkashovtsy", whose emblem closely resembles the  swastika, defended the White House in Moscow side by side with  the hardliners.</p>

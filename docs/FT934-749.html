			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Valuer told to pay Pounds 16m John D Wood Commercial, a commercial estate agent, has been ordered in the High Court to pay Pounds 16m in damages after being found negligent in its valuations on three properties. The case, which was brought by Banque Bruxelles Lambert and Eagle Star, is one of a growing number of negligence claims against surveying practices that stem from allegedly excessive valuations carried out in the volatile property market of the late 1980s. The case concerned a number of BBL's property loans insured by Eagle Star on which the borrowers subsequently defaulted. Mr Justice Phillips criticised the valuers for paying insufficient attention to the buildings' marketing history. The valuations attached to the buildings exceeded the price at which they had earlier changed hands. In one example a building in Westminster, London was valued at Pounds 44.35m after being bought a month earlier for Pounds 25.5m. The judge said BBL had shown contributory negligence, and cut its damages by 30 per cent. He also ruled that valuers could not be liable for the fall in property values that resulted from the collapse in the property market.</p>

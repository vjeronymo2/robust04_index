			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Jim Birdsall, the president of Nor Star Machine Tools, Inc. located in Bellevue, Washington, appraised the Finn-Power FMC Line. Mr. Birdsall represents that he has experience with Finn-Power presses and the present market for this type of equipment. Mr. Birdsall represents that both he and Nor Star Machine Tools, Inc. are unrelated to and independent of the Employer. In an appraisal report dated June 4, 1993, Mr. Birdsall placed the fair market value of the Finn-Power FMC Line at $792,000, approximately eighty percent of its acquisition price of $990,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a subsequent letter dated December 3, 1993, Mr. Birdsall describes certain factors he considered in determining the fair market value. Mr. Birdsall states that the twenty percent discount of the acquisition price is attributable to two years of equal amounts of depreciation on the Finn-Power FMC Line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Theodore Egleston, a national sales manager for E.W. Bliss Company located in Hastings, Michigan, appraised the Bliss 500 ton press. Mr. Egelston states that he has twenty-five years of experience in appraising used Bliss equipment for insurance companies and lending institutions. Mr. Egelston represents that he is unrelated to and independent of the Employer. In appraisal reports dated July 12, 1993 and December 3, 1993, Mr. Egleston placed the fair market value of the Bliss 500 ton press at $436,000, or eighty-four percent of its $520,000 acquisition price. Mr. Egelston's valuation takes into consideration six years of equal amounts of depreciation on the Bliss 500 ton press's acquisition price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Mr. Starr will serve as the qualified, independent fiduciary for the Plan with respect to the New Loan. Mr. Starr represents that he has extensive experience in business and loan transactions. Mr. Starr represents that he is unrelated to and independent of the Employer and its affiliates, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Linton. Mr. Starr states that he understands and acknowledges his duties, responsibilities, and liabilities in acting as a fiduciary with respect to the Plan, based upon consultation with counsel experienced with the fiduciary responsibility provisions of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Starr represents that all payments under the Original Loan have been paid in a timely manner and that there have been no delinquencies. Mr. Starr also states that the collateral to loan ratio under the Original Loan has always been maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Starr has reviewed the terms of the New Loan and all of the documents and relevant information in connection with the New Loan, including the Appraisals. Mr. Starr states that the terms of the New Loan compare favorably with the terms of similar transaction between unrelated parties and would be an arm's-length transaction as evidenced by the terms offered by CityBank (see Item  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> #4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  above). In addition, Mr. Starr adds that the Loan will be secured by a first lien interest on the Equipment, which has been valued in excess of 200 percent of the New Loan amount. Mr. Starr acknowledges his responsibility to quarterly review the Loan and make the necessary adjustments to the interest rate based upon the prime rate of CityBank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Starr has reviewed the current investment portfolio of the Plan and considered the diversification of the Plans assets as well as the liquidity needs of the Plan. Based on this analysis, Mr. Starr believes that the proposed transaction would be in the best interest of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries as an investment for the Plan's portfolio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Starr states that the New Loan would be an appropriate and desirable investment for the plan, based on the New Loan's rate of return, the collateral securing the New Loan, the character and diversification of the Plan's other assets, and the projected liquidity needs of the Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Starr has reviewed the financial condition of the Employer in order to establish its ability to repay the New Loan. In this regard, Mr. Starr states that he has examined the most recent financial statements from the Employee and its credit history. Mr. Starr concludes that the Employer is credit-worthy and, based upon its current ratio and current assets to debt ratio, is financially capable of making the monthly payments required by the New Loan without such payments having an adverse impact on its cash flow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Starr represents that he will monitor the New Loan through its entire duration and will take any appropriate action necessary to protect the interests of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries, include a foreclosure on the Equipment in event of default. Mr. Starr will monitor the condition and adequacy of the Equipment as collateral for the Plan to ensure that the New Loan remains secured by collateral worth at least 200 percent of the New Loan at all times.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Starr will monitor the Plan's assets to ensure that the amount of the Plan's assets will at all times remain less than twenty-five percent of the Plan's total assets. Mr. Starr will require the Employer to provide additional payments on the New Loan to the Plan, if necessary, to reduce the principal amount of the New Loan to maintain an appropriate ratio between the outstanding principal balance of the New Loan and the Plan's total assets. Mr. Starr has acknowledged his responsibility to monitor compliance of all parties with terms and conditions of the proposed exemption, including the twenty-five percent limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) The terms of the New Loan will be at least as favorable to the Plan as those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) the New Loan will not exceed twenty-five percent of the assets of the Plan at any time during the duration of the New Loan; (c) the New Loan will be secured by a first lien interest on the Equipment, which has been appraised by a qualified, independent appraiser to ensure that the fair market value of the Property is at least 200 percent of the amount of the New Loan; (d) the fair market value of the Equipment will remain at least equal to 200 percent of the outstanding balance of the New Loan throughout the duration of the New Loan; (e) Mr. Starr, as independent, qualified fiduciary for the Plan, will determine that the New Loan is in the best interests of the Plan and protective of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries; and (f) Mr. Starr will monitor compliance by the Employer with the terms and conditions of the New Loan and the exemption throughout the duration of the transaction, taking any action necessary to safeguard the Plan's interest, including foreclosure on the Equipment in the event of default.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Kathryn Parr of the Department, telephone (202) 219&hyph;8971.

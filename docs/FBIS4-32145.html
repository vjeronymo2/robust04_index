			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje -- Ljubomir Frckovski, minister of internal  affairs of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], told correspondents that  Macedonian politicians had held a meeting in the Rila Hotel in  Sofia with leaders of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Union of Macedonian Societies [VMRO-SMD]. They  allegedly agreed with them a plan of action during the period  preceding the parliamentary elections in Macedonia. It was  claimed that three groups were set up, to deal with ideological,  propaganda, and military matters, in which the Rakovski Officers  Legion was also reportedly involved. The plans of the  "conspiracy" included setting up a radio transmitter in the  vicinity of the Macedonian border. On the other side of the  border, within Macedonia itself, the "groups" were supposedly  intending to work to overcome the differences between parties  whose stances were close to one another.</p>

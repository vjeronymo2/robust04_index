			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Eximbank financing to include defence The US House of Representatives has passed legislation which would allow Eximbank, the US government export credit agency, to broaden financing to include 'non-lethal' products produced by US defence manufacturers. An identical bill is to be introduced in the Senate. The bill represents an attempt by the Congress to give a boost to defence companies which are converting their factories to civilian uses. Eximbank's charter prevented it supporting defence sales in developing countries. It was changed in 1992 to prohibit military sales everywhere, the exception being for drug interception equipment. The current change arose from the loss of a US bid to sell an air traffic control system to Hungary. Eximbank refused to fund it because the system would also be used by the military. The bill, if passed by the Senate, would allow the financing of equipment and services, primarily for civilian purpose but occasionally used by the military. Eximbank is undergoing a number of changes, as it becomes increasingly a key instrument of US foreign economic policy. Foreign aid is no more popular than it ever was, so it has been up to the bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to take the lead in conveying US adjustment assistance to eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics. It has signed a series of 'project incentive' pacts with Russia, Turkmenistan, Belarus and Kazakhstan, and it is moving into limited recourse project finance. This lending does not require the guarantee of the borrowing company's government. Instead repayment is guaranteed from the revenue stream of the product itself. Another provision of the House bill authorises a Dollars 35m fund to promote the sale of environmental goods and services from small US companies.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBRARIES ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK  </P> <P> In the game Password, one concept leads to another. If one player were to say  "library," the other player would likely say "books." And if a player were to  say "books," the other would likely say "reading." "Reading" might well lead to  "writing" or "learning." President Bush -- who wants to be the Education  President yet proposes a 71% cut in federal library funding -- apparently would  not be a very good Password player.  </P> <P> First Lady Barbara Bush has personally set out to increase literacy in the  United States. You have only to hear her talk of her son Neil, who was dyslexic  as a child, to know that Mrs. Bush's desire to improve learning opportunities  for all children is sincere. In an apparent nod to Mrs. Bush's commitment to  literacy programs, proposed funding for those programs actually increased by $3  million. But, unfortunately, there's this incongruous matter of the rest of the  President's library budget -- such as it is.  </P> <P> The proposed 1991 Bush budget would eliminate two crucial categories of public  library programs. The public library services program, totaling $82.5 million,  and public library construction funds, at $19 million, would be abolished. The  Administration said that federal assistance in those areas are no longer  necessary.  </P> <P> It is true that the federal government plays only a supporting role to state  and local governments in providing money for public libraries. But that does  not make the federal contribution insignificant. It helps buy books and  materials, supports book-mobiles to bring the gift of knowledge to remote or  disadvantaged areas, and, of special interest in California, serves those who  speak little English.  </P> <P> Since Andrew Carnegie, in the early 1900s, looked ahead and realized the  lasting value of the $50 million he gave to build libraries, government and  citizen volunteers have managed to keep the "people's universities" open. But  it has not been easy in recent years with severe cutbacks in local spending,  despite broad-based private donations. That is why the proposed deep budget  cutback sends the wrong message, and an ill-timed one at that.  </P> <P> This is not the first time a President has tried to gut library funds. Because  libraries have enjoyed strong bipartisan support, Congress again may come forth  and save them from the executive budget knife. But Congress should not have to  rescue public libraries -- not from the Education President.  </P></p>

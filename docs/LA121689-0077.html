			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLOMBIAN POLICE KILL DRUG LORD;  </P> <P> WAR ON NARCOTICS: RODRIGUEZ GACHA WAS A LEADER OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL. U.S.  HAILS THE 'FIRST BIG BREAK WE'VE HAD.'  </P> <P> In their single biggest victory in the drug war, Colombian police Friday shot  and killed notorious narcotics trafficker Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, who as a  leader of the Medellin cartel waged a campaign of terror to maintain the  world's biggest cocaine empire.  </P> <P> Rodriguez Gacha and six others, including his son, Freddy Rodriguez Celades,  had resisted a 72-hour siege before they died in a half-hour gun battle with an  elite police unit that had tracked them to a remote hide-out on the nation's  Caribbean coast, Colombian authorities reported.  </P> <P> The death of the man known as El Mexicano reflected a stunning reversal in a  government crackdown that had failed for four months to apprehend any of the  cadre of kingpins most wanted by the United States and Colombia.  </P> <P> "This is the first big break we've had," declared acting Drug Enforcement  Administration chief Terrence M. Burke.  </P> <P> In a hastily arranged news conference in Washington, drug czar William J.  Bennett hailed the action as a symbol of the determination of the Colombian  government to confront the traffickers despite their pledge to wage "all-out  war" on citizens and officials.  </P> <P> Both Bennett and Burke declined to speculate on the potential impact of  Rodriguez Gacha's death on the overall war on drugs. Another official, however,  said that the action had provided an enormous confidence boost to anti-drug  officials, who often before had seen powerful traffickers slip through  Colombian authorities' grasp.  </P> <P> "This is the one we've been hoping for," the official said.  </P> <P> President Virgilio Barco Vargas of Colombia officially informed the United  States of Rodriguez Gacha's death in a late-afternoon telephone conversation  with Bennett, the Bush Administration's top anti-drug official.  </P> <P> According to Bennett, Barco stressed that the operation was "very important  psychologically" for a Colombian people traumatized by months of bombings and  assassinations ordered by cartel leaders who seemed invulnerable to the  much-touted government crackdown.  </P> <P> "President Barco now believes that doubts about the Colombian government's  resolve and ability to defeat the cartel should now recede," Bennett said.  </P> <P> Together with his Medellin cartel associate Pablo Escobar, the 42-year-old  Rodriguez Gacha ranked as the trafficker most wanted by the Colombian  government, which for more than a month has focused its anti-drug crackdown  around operations designed to find the two fugitives.  </P> <P> He was also near the top of a Justice Department list of the "Dirty Dozen"  traffickers targeted by U.S. officials as kingpins whom the United States wants  to extradite to this country to face trial under long-pending indictments.  </P> <P> While his death eliminates Rodriguez Gacha as a potential source of  intelligence, officials expressed no remorse about the violent demise of the  man who reaped billions of dollars from the cocaine cartel accused of ordering  dozens of murders and implicated in the August assassination of presidential  candidate Luis Carlos Galan.  </P> <P> Rodriguez Gacha "was a very significant man -- a man who had killed many  innocents -- men, women and children," Barco said in the message relayed by the  U.S. officials late Friday afternoon.  </P> <P> "President Barco remains determined to pursue cartel fugitives," Bennett said.  "And the United States remains determined to do everything in its power to  support President Barco and the government of Colombia in this effort."  </P> <P> The death of a single trafficker -- even one as powerful as Rodriguez Gacha --  is unlikely by itself to have an adverse impact on an enterprise as vast and  sophisticated as the Medellin cartel, analysts cautioned.  </P> <P> "You can cut off the head, but this body keeps kicking," said one congressional  source.  </P> <P> But they said that the death of Rodriguez Gacha could further disrupt the  trafficking operations by driving home to other narcotraficantes the message  that the government crackdown knows no bounds.  </P> <P> Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman (R-N.Y.), the ranking minority member of the House  Narcotics Committee, described the cartel leader's death as an indication "that  enforcement is starting to work."  </P> <P> The congressman, who with five other committee members returned to Washington  on Friday from a trip to Colombia, said that the episode should counter  widespread doubts about the ability of Colombia's government to fight the  super-rich cartels, which have used bribery, terrorism and murder to maintain  their power.  </P> <P> "As one of the victims of the bombing of the national police headquarters told  us, 'Don't judge the Colombian people by a few bad apples,' " Gilman said. "On  the whole, I think the top people there don't want to lose their country to the  drug cartels, and they will fight to win."  </P> <P> The Colombian president had come under increasing attack by citizens who were  troubled by his government's apparent powerlessness in the face of the  traffickers' campaign of terror, blamed for bombings in recent weeks aboard an  Avianca jetliner and in a downtown street that together killed more than 150  people.  </P> <P> Reflecting widespread discontent, Colombia's House of Representatives voted  this week to allow voters to decide in a national referendum whether  extradition of the traffickers should continue. But its Senate, by a slim  margin, appeared to have derailed the effort Friday.  </P> <P> The domestic boost that President Barco is likely to win from the successful  effort is also important to the United States, which regards him as a vital  instrument in its stepped-up effort to extend its war on drugs to the Andean  nations that are the source of all but a tiny fraction of the world's cocaine  supply.  </P> <P> Administration officials have freely acknowledged that a success in Colombia,  which has been granted $65 million in emergency U.S. assistance to bolster its  fight, was vital to the prospects of their entire Andean strategy. Indeed,  those officials had turned increasingly testy in recent weeks when asked to  cite indications of progress.  </P> <P> The frustrating manhunt for Rodriguez Gacha and Escobar -- each of whom was the  subject of a $625,000 reward offered by the Colombian government -- probably  allowed other traffickers to resume the massive shipments of cocaine that had  been disrupted in the early weeks of the crackdown, U.S. officials in Colombia  said recently.  </P> <P> But the officials defended the Colombian preoccupation with the two men on  grounds that their records of murder and mayhem made their apprehension  indispensable if the Colombian government was to demonstrate that it had  confronted the cartels head-on.  </P> <P> Rodriguez Gacha was said by security officials to have narrowly escaped  numerous attempts to capture him, including an episode last August when  residents tipped him off shortly before security forces were about to close in  at a discotheque in his hometown of Pacho.  </P> <P> Rodriguez Gacha grew up poor, and his formal education was limited to grade  school. But his friendly manners and ruthless ways made him a success in the  cutthroat world of emerald smuggling, where he made his first fortune while  learning the skills that would make him one of the most powerful of cocaine  traffickers.  </P> <P> Known as El Mexicano because of his fascination with Mexican culture, Rodriguez  Gacha owned a string of ranches with such Mexican names as Chihuahua, Sonora  and Mazatlan.  </P> <P> Among many of his countrymen, he was a popular celebrity whose friends  apparently included national police and military officers. At home in Pacho, an  intelligence official said, "He had the sympathy of the majority of the town."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Don Shannon contributed to this story.  </P></p>

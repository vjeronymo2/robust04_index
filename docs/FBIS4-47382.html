Contact methods  (CTD-photography, track measurements) and remote methods (IR  radiometry, acoustic Doppler measurement of current speed,  satellite sound backscattering studies) were used. The  characteristics of fronts and associated phenomena (meanders and  eddies) are studied. A significant correlation between  hydrophysical and acoustic characteristics is detected.  Surveying was done with 63 hydrological stations in a  quasi-rectangular gird of nine meridional segments, each with  seven stations 10 miles apart. The depth of the studied region  was 200-350 m. Temperature and salinity gradients at the surface  across the front reached 0.5C/km and 0.15 0/00. Data on  individual mesoscale meanders are presented. Eddy regions  displayed the most significant curving of isolines. Maximum  sound scattering values, 10-20 dB, were found at 90-200 m. At  50-90 m the contrast was 10-12 dB; below 200 m the contrast was  no more than 4-6 dB. Analysis of echolocation measurements  indicate the existence of mesoscale structures in the sound  scattering field. Characteristic horizontal scales of regions  with quasi-homogeneous scattering properties were 20-40 km,  which matches the dimensions of dynamic formations. The  transition regions between these zones have high gradients and  the spatial configuration had the structural and dynamic  features of a thermohaline field. Consequently, one can monitor  mesoscale dynamic formations with echolocation equipment on a  moving ship or on ocean bottom platforms. Figures 5; references  13: 8 Russian, 5 Western.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAMP KILPATRICK NOTCHES 8TH WIN  </P> <P> Who needs 11 men on a side to play a great football game?  </P> <P> Certainly not Faith Baptist and Camp Kilpatrick, the Nos. 2- and 3-ranked teams  in the Southern Section Eight-Man Large Division.  </P> <P> The two unbeaten teams tangled Saturday at Faith Baptist and waged a classic  battle, replete with emotion, great plays, and a vocal crowd of about 300  cramped into tiny quarters.  </P> <P> So who won?  </P> <P> Why, undoubtedly, that would be Camp Kilpatrick, 41-30.  </P> <P> After all, one had to like the squad that featured Super- . . . , er, Blockman.  </P> <P> Tayon Blockman, that is.  </P> <P> The Camp Kilpatrick junior quarterback-tailback-defensive back engineered the  exciting come-from-behind win by doing everything but unveiling a red 'S' on  his chest.  </P> <P> Blockman was able to:  </P> <P> rush for 252 yards in 30 carries.  </P> <P> score three touchdowns, including the Mustangs' final two scores in the fourth  quarter to erase a 30-27 deficit.  </P> <P> play defense for the first time all season, and he capped his performance by  breaking up two Faith Baptist passes on the final drive.  </P> <P> "In a tough situation, you go with your best," said Coach Mo Friedman of Camp  Kilpatrick (8-0). "And he's our best athlete, our best competitor, our greatest  leader."  </P> <P> Faith Baptist (7-1) , however, put on quite a show itself. Trailing, 27-17, at  halftime, the Contenders burst out in the second half behind quarterback Gavin  Amos. After the opening kickoff in the third quarter Amos, who finished with  130 yards passing and 68 yards rushing, marched Faith Baptist 63 yards and  scored on an eight-yard run to make the score, 27-23.  </P> <P> After a Mustang fumble was recovered by the Contenders, Amos directed his team  47 yards before throwing an eight-yard touchdown pass to Alex Estrada to make  it 30-27 with four minutes to play in the third quarter.  </P> <P> That set the stage for Blockman's fourth-quarter heroics. "What makes us  proudest is that the team came back in the fourth quarter when we had to,"  Friedman said.  </P></p>

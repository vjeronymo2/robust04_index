			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a communique received at our news desk this  afternoon, through our correspondent Morais Abel, the military  command of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA]  in the Cuanza Norte Military Region has reported the presence in  Cambambe and Dondo of a large number of well-equipped Cuban and  Katanguese mercenaries. According to the communique, these  forces, acting jointly with the People's Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola and the riot police, have the mission of  occupying all areas under control of the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in Cuanza Norte,  particularly the city of Ndalatando, the provincial capital.  The FALA military command said the mercenaries [words  indistinct] will not find a room for maneuvers and will be  repulsed. The military command has warned the international  community of the danger that this Eduardo dos Santos' adventure  represents for the Angolan people and the ongoing peace talks in  Lusaka.</p>

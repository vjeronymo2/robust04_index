			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak slips to Dollars 145m on flat sales EASTMAN Kodak, the world's biggest maker of photographic equipment, yesterday reported a 19 per cent decline in first-quarter net earnings on sales that were essentially flat. The company, in the midst of its fifth restructuring since 1983, had warned in March it would have a 'difficult' first quarter and its recovery would be only gradual. Kodak had net income of Dollars 145m, or 45 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 4.41bn in the first three months of 1992, compared with earnings of Dollars 178m or 55 cents on sales of Dollars 4.42bn a year earlier. Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman and chief executive, said the results were hardly satisfying. 'Respectable margins in health and chemicals were accompanied by poor rates of return in imaging and information, where problem areas are being vigorously addressed.' Mr Whitmore said earnings were hurt by higher costs, unfavourable currency translations, lower selling prices and higher spending on research and development. The results were released after the close of trade yesterday. Kodak's shares closed at Dollars 38 1/2 , down Dollars  1/8 . The issue fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 in March after Kodak suggested its 1992 earnings would be about Dollars 3.50 a share, below the Dollars 4-range most analysts had expected. Mr Whitmore said: 'We look forward to better results with the expectation that sales will continue to recover, particularly in the second half, and that earnings will benefit from actions to restore operating margins to more satisfactory levels.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Jian (6392 0256): "Lu Ping Says, What Is </F> More Important Is That We Rely on the Hong Kong People To  Achieve Smooth Transition and Achieve the Goal of Hong Kong  People Ruling Hong Kong"]    [Text] Beijing, 24 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--During a  meeting with the delegation of the Alumni Association of the  Hong Kong Pui Kui [pei qiao 1014 0294] Middle School in the  Diaoyutai State Guesthouse today, Lu Ping, director of the State  Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, stressed that: In  the wake of the breakdown of the talks on the political system,  we are still striving to cooperate with the British side in  other areas but, what is more important, is to focus our  attention on relying on Hong Kong people to achieve a smooth  transition and achieve Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong in the  future.    Lu Ping said: We hope to cooperate with the British side so  as to achieve the goal of smooth transition. However, if the  British side does not cooperate I believe that, through our  concerted efforts and though this means the work will be a  little more difficult, it will conform with our common  aspirations and will surely guarantee Hong Kong's smooth  transition. Lu Ping added: I have full confidence in this.    Lu Ping stressed: Since reform and opening up, China's  economy has thrived and its overall national strength has  continuously increased. This is an important guarantee for Hong  Kong's smooth transition and long-term stability and prosperity.    Speaking about the Hong Kong airport issue, Lu Ping said: We  hope that the question of financial arrangements for the airport  can be settled at an early date. Our principle is that we hope  it entails low input and produces good efficiency so that it  will not leave an enormous financial burden for the government  of the future special administrative region [SAR].    The guests asked a question about the post-1997 civil  servants and Lu Ping reiterated: Except for the 20 or so senior  officials, I hope that all the other civil servants will remain  in their original posts. I hope everyone will work with their  minds set at rest.    He said: As for the 20 or so senior officials, since they  will have to be nominated by the government of the future SAR  and appointed by the central government, we have no right to  interfere in the matter now.    Regarding the question of real estate prices which is  currently a concern to Hong Kong people, he said, we are  concerned with this question from the angle of hoping for smooth  transition. If real estate prices are too high, it will affect  both the livelihoods of Hong Kong residents and Hong Kong's  status as an international financial and trading center. He  added: We hope that Hong Kong's real estate prices will go down  slowly.    Lu Ping said: The year 1997 is a mere three years away. The  time is very short and yet a lot of preparatory work has to be  done. What we will do is create better conditions for Hong Kong  people ruling Hong Kong after 1997 in political, economic, and  other areas.    Lu Ping said: The work of the Preliminary Work Committee is  also intended to accumulate experiences for Hong Kong people  ruling Hong Kong. He believes that Hong Kong people will  definitely be able to exercise good rule over Hong Kong.    Liao Hui, director of the State Council's Overseas Chinese  Affairs Office, simultaneously met with the 66-person delegation  of the Alumni Association of the Hong Kong Pui Kui Middle School  headed by Zhang Huafeng. They came from Hong Kong, Britain,  Australia, the Philippines, and other places. Liao Hui  explained to them in detail China's consistent policy for  Overseas Chinese affairs.</p>

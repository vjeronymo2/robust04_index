			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / OFT life insurance proposals: SIB plan dismissed as anti-competitive THE Office of Fair Trading has produced two reports. The first, under the Financial Services Act 1986, is a direct reaction to the rules for investment regulation proposed by SIB and Lautro in July. The OFT argues that SIB's proposed rules are anti-competitive because they do not give consumers enough information to make informed choices of brands, products or sales outlets. It suggests changes to these proposed rules in four areas: Disclosure of surrender values in the later years of a policy: under SIB's rules the surrender values investors would receive if they stopped paying premiums only need to be shown for the first five years of the policy. The report finds that surrender values in later years are relevant to a decision on whether to buy the policy in question, 'or indeed any life product'. Disclosure of companies' charges in illustrations of future investment returns: life companies currently publish projections of the likely future returns on their policies on the basis of an average charge for the industry. They are not allowed to publish illustrations using their own charges, even if they are substantially different. The report says these rules mean that investors will 'make different decisions from those they would make if they had better information'. Commission disclosure by independent financial advisers: the report says: 'Without early automatic disclosure of commissions, in actual cash amounts, an investor will not know the price of advice and cannot compare it with that for the advice of other IFAs (including those remunerated by fees).' The commission of agents tied to one company was not within the scope of the OFT's report, and they would not be obliged to disclose commission. Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said there were technical difficulties in forcing disclosure on tied agents but that a method of revealing their commission 'would be something very much to be welcomed'. He added that independent advisers operated in two markets - 'the market for independent financial advice, and the market for selling life insurance'. He said: 'There has to be a price which is paid for that advice, and as nothing else is paid, commission must be regarded as that price. The market doesn't work very well unless people can tell what they are paying.' Differential pricing among tied outlets: life offices are not allowed under current SIB rules to offer the same product at different prices through different tied agents, such as building societies, although the costs involved for the different agents may vary. According to the OFT this limits the likelihood that 'the most efficient means of distribution will prevail and reduce overall costs to investors'. The OFT is happy with the rules for disclosing an adviser's status (whether independent or tied) and dis-closure of product details. In a separate report the OFT sets out a different structure for investor protection in life insurance sales. Here the OFT calls for transparency of persistency rates. Companies would have to tell prospective consumers the percentage of clients who hold their policies to maturity. Sir Bryan suggested that companies be required to disclose two rates; the proportion of policyholders remaining after two years and the proportion which hold policies to maturity. Poor persistency rates are regarded as evidence that companies sell inappropriate policies to consumers. The OFT urges that policyholders should receive annual statements similar to those received by shareholders or unit trust holders. The documents would give policyholders information about the latest investment returns and say whether investments were performing better or worse than expected.

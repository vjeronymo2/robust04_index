			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. and Pak-India Talks"] </F>   [Text] While the perception in Pakistan on the prospects  of an early resumption of dialogue with India is not one of  optimism, the U.S. State Department seems upbeat. Apparently it  has access to some information which is not available to  Pakistan. So far as Pakistan is concerned, it has just the  latest pronouncements of the Indian Foreign Secretary, Dixit and  the Indian Defence Minister [title as published] Chavan, before  it. Mr Dixit, in reply to a question said that the UN  Resolutions on Kashmir are irrelevant. Mr Chavan has said that  Kashmir can neither be given independence or allowed to join  Pakistan. Although the words used by the two are different, they  both refer to the redundance of the UN Resolutions. The U.S.,  however, has reiterated that these Resolutions remain valid.  That may or may not amount to a positive factor, but Pakistan's  Foreign Secretary himself has said that India had conceded  Kashmir's disputed status and the right of the people of Kashmir  to have a say in the future of their land. The question then is  that if the people of Kashmir have a say in the future of their  land. The question then is that if the people of Kashmir have a  say, then how can they express it? According to Mr Chavan they  cannot ask for freedom nor can they favour Pakistan, they can  only be allowed to say that they want to be with India. How will  they say it, assuming that they will be allowed to do so, is not  clear. Curious as the logic of the Indian position is, the  explanations given for it are even more ludicrous. Mr Dixit is  quoted as saying that how can a small number of freedom-fighters  (dubbed secessionists) be allowed to determine the fate of the  whole of Kashmir, and why should Pakistan risk the peace of the  sub-continent for a small piece of land? The assumption behind  the assessment of the number of freedom-fighters is that had  they not come on the scene, the people of Kashmir would have  liked to be with India. It is easy to test that assumption. When  Cambodia went to polls under UN supervision, people did not vote  for the Khmer Rouge. Therefore bring the UN in and let the world  see for itself what the Kashmiris want: India or Pakistan. That  would be the end of the problem once and for all. So far as the  importance of that small piece of territory to Pakistan is  concerned, it is based on the founding principle of Pakistan's  creation. Pakistan's economy and security also depend on it. It  is a Muslim majority state, all Pakistan's rivers flow from it  and it is vital to Pakistan's defence. None of these factors  apply so far as India's claim is concerned. Also, if it is small  and insignificant, why does India want to hang on to it?    It was because of U.S. pressure that Pakistan withdrew its  resolution on human rights from the UN agenda, letting India off  the hook. Now that is clear that India has no intention of  giving the people of Kashmir the opportunity to decide its  future, it is the responsibility of the U.S. to make India see  the light. And if it refuses then use its considerable economic  and other clout against it in the interest of peace in the  sub-continent.</p>

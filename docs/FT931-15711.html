			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Inquiry to study tighter rules on oil tanker routes A SEPARATE inquiry into the Braer disaster is to consider stricter regulation of oil tanker movements off the UK coast in order to avoid a repetition of the environmental damage caused after the vessel ran aground in the Shetland Islands last week. The government said yesterday that Lord Donaldson, former Master of the Rolls, will head the inquiry. The marine accident investigation branch of the Department of Transport has already begun to investigate the causes of the disaster. The Braer continued to be battered by hurricane-force storms yesterday, which caused further damage to more than half of the vessel's oil tanks which were all leaking heavily into the sea. Hopes of recovering any of the Braer's oil before it caused further pollution were diminishing last night as storms continued. Captain Geert Koffeman of Smit Tak, the Dutch salvage company handling the Braer, said: 'We can never be sure we will recover any oil. There is no guarantee, but we are doing our best.' He indicated that the ship could break up within days in some of the worst weather conditions experienced in the Shetland Islands. The Department of Transport's Marine Pollution Control Centre said it had still received no reports of major quantities of oil coming ashore. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said that important breeding colonies for shag and black guillemot could be wiped out by the oil spill. The tanker's US-based operator, Bergvall and Hudner, yesterday promised a 'substantial' contribution to the wildlife clean-up costs on the Shetland Islands. Company officials believe the bill for the clean-up could run into 'hundreds of thousands of pounds'. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, and Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, underlined in the House of Commons the government's determination to ensure that the 'polluter pays'. Mr MacGregor said the Donaldson inquiry has been called 'to advise whether further measures are appropriate and feasible to protect the UK coastline from pollution from merchant shipping. Due consideration should be given to the international and economic implications of any new measures'. He made a cautious response to demands for unilateral action by the UK to restrict oil tanker movements in the English channel and other areas where a collision or other accident would be likely to have disastrous consequences. While stressing that the Donaldson inquiry would be free to make the recommendations it thought appropriate he suggested that concerted action based on an international agreement was likely to produce the most effective results. Mr MacGregor envisaged that Lord Donaldson would be joined by specialist assessors in conducting the inquiry, and said that, if necessary, they would be able to make an interim report on proposals requiring urgent implementation. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said it should be made clear to all oil companies and carriers of hazardous materials that it was 'totally unacceptable' for them to take dangerous routes which, while cheaper and quicker in commercial terms, were potentially more damaging and dangerous. In a renewed attack on the wide use of flags of convenience, Mr Prescott accused some countries of 'prostituting their flags for a few pieces of silver' to enable shipowners 'to use second rate vessels, with second rate crews, following second rate practices'.

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / House buyers' confidence 'fragile' INQUIRIES from prospective home buyers have risen but sales are taking a long time to complete and many would-be purchasers pull out at the last minute, according to a survey of more than 100 estate agents published today. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' survey says: 'Despite increasing levels of buyer interest across the country, we are still a long way from any sustained improvement in the housing market.' Many estate agents appealed to the government to extend the moratorium on stamp duty. They fear that there will be a rush to beat the deadline of August 19 when the temporary suspension of duty on house sales below Pounds 250,000 is due to end, after which sales may fall sharply. Mr Peter Miller, housing spokesman for the institution, said: 'The upward trend of improvement in the residential market is apparent. However, fears regarding job security and local economic factors can easily knock the fragile confidence of buyers. The high level of abortive sales is manifestation of unease in the market.' The institution said that a reduction in the number of repossessed homes for sale had eased pressures on the market. The survey asked estate agents in England and Wales whether house prices had moved during the three months to the end of May. More than 73 per cent said prices did not change, about a quarter said prices fell and 1.1 per cent said prices rose.</p>

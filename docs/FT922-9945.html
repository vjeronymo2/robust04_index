Analysts are expecting a halved figure of 4.4p when it announces results tomorrow. Pre-tax profit, which fell sharply in the first half of last year to Pounds 51.5m, is thought to have improved to between Pounds 53m and Pounds 55m. Davy Corporation, which Trafalgar House acquired last June for an initial Pounds 60m, could have contributed the best part of Pounds 10m to operating profits in engineering and construction. Progress in that division is again expected to have offset declines in property and in shipping and hotels. The Ocean Emerald oil rig, source of Davy's trials, has been completed and Trafalgar House is hanging on to it until it is paid. British Petroleum is still suffering from lower oil prices. Last week's rise in the oil market will be too late to affect its first-quarter results, which will be reported on Thursday. It is estimated that the group's pre-tax profit will drop to about Pounds 70m (excluding stock losses and gains) from a level of Pounds 521m in the same period last year. Tate &amp; Lyle, the sweeteners group, is reporting results for the six months to end March on Wednesday. Analysts expect a slight slippage from the Pounds 94.7m reported last time. Falling prices for high fructose corn syrup in the US will have affected profits from Staley, though there will be a first-time contribution from Bundaberg Sugar, the Australian business bought in June. Thursday sees full-year results from Sears, the shoe shops to mail order retailer, which appointed a new chief executive in February. After interim profits fell from Pounds 62.4m to Pounds 4.6m, weighed down by heavy exceptional costs relating to restructuring and disposals, profits for the year to end-January will be well down on the previous year's Pounds 146.9m. Analysts are looking for profits before exceptional items of around Pounds 92m to Pounds 93m, but this could come down to about Pounds 50m post-exceptionals. The final dividend is expected to be maintained.

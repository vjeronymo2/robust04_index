			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [8 Nov pp 14, 15]    [Text] News Service. Following the publication of the  critical report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group of the  Majles on the activities of the Voice and Vision, the public  relations office of this organization sent a 31-page response in  answer to the first part of the criticism of the Majles Inquiry  and Investigation Group, the full text of which is as follows.  <H5>  Response [Part I] </H5>   Because there are many nonfactual points and ambiguities in  the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, which was  read on 11 and 12 Aban [2, 3 November] in the Majles, in order  to clarify matters for the public, especially the honorable  deputies of the Majles, we declare the errors and accusations as  follows. Before entering the discussion, it is necessary to make  a few points by way of a preface.    A) The issue of inquiry and investigation:    1) The procedures for the absorption and employment of the  revolutionary, Hezbollah forces in the organization.    2) The activities of the honorable director of the Voice and  Vision organization, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, and the procedure for  the selection of subsequent directors and their activities in  spreading Islamic culture, in accordance with the ratified  policies of the organization.  3) Procedures to conform the programs of the Vision with the  standards of the sacred religious law.    4) Reason for broadcasting scenes from the Vision of the  Islamic Republic that show Western culture and result in the  creation of an unsuitable model among various strata,  particularly the young.    The members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group were Mr.  Movahhedi-Savoji, Dr. Hasan Kamran, Mr. Seyyed 'Ali Akbar  Parvaresh, Mr. Mohammad Reza Mavalizadeh, Mr. Mohsen Kuhkan, Mr.  'Ali Yusefpur, and Mr. Lotfollah Zare'i-Qanavati. Holding more  than 50 official meetings, this group spent more than 150 hours  and ultimately in the session on 19/05/1372 [10 August 1993]  approved the report with a majority vote.    The points of the Voice and Vision organization concerning  this part of the report are:    The management of the organization finds it necessary to  thank all the self-sacrificers of the organization who in the  course of eight years of the imposed war and the bombing of  cities, with their active and unassuming presence on the front  lines of the battle front and offering dozens of martyrs and the  broadcast of thousands of hours of war programs, immortalized  the epic resistance of our brave and courageous people. In the  inquiry and investigation report, not only is no mention made of  this, but also with hurtful sentences it interprets all that  effort and self-sacrifice as lack of solidarity with the war.    1) During the first days of the formation of the Inquiry and  Investigation Group, even before the decrees had been issued  officially by the honorable speaker of the Majles, or at least  the copy of the decrees had not been sent to this organization,  Mr. Movahhedi-Savoji in a written invitation invited the  director of the Voice and Vision organization to take part in a  meeting of the group.    The director of the organization went to the Majles at the  appointed time to take part in the meeting. Upon his arrival, it  became clear that the members had not expected the presence of  the director of the Voice and Vision. The understanding was that  the invitation had been extended for the presentation of a  written document, but no cooperation ensued, and from the  members of the group only five persons were present at the  meeting. Mr. Movahhedi-Savoji expressed his thanks and  announced: Since we did not know whether you would attend or  not, some members, such as Mr. Parvaresh, went on a trip and  some were not informed.    In any case, after the usual pleasantries, Mr.  Movahhedi-Savoji, as the chairman of the Inquiry and  Investigation Group, asked Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, the director of  the Voice and Vision, to make a statement.    In this meeting, thanking the Inquiry and Investigation  Group, Mr. Hashemi made the following points:    1) You know that during his life the Imam paid special  attention to the Voice and Vision, and, according to the  supplement to the Constitution, it is operated under the  supervision of the grand leader. Therefore, it has always been  the organization closet to the religious guardian and leader.    2) The Voice and Vision, as the mouthpiece of the Islamic  revolution, has numerous supporters and opponents.    At the head of the supporters of this medium are the Imam,  God rest his soul; the grand leader; the honorable officials of  the regime; the Hezbollah nation; and the Muslims of the world,  and at the head of the opponents of this medium are the  counterrevolutionary groups and those damaged by the revolution,  such as the hypocrites, the leftist minigroups, the Hojjatiyeh  Society, the supporters of the United States and Israel, the  monarchists, etc., who have frequently tried to destroy this  organization under various pretexts.    3) Even though inquiry and investigation is one of the  duties  of the Majles, it is an issue that is judiciary by nature, and  in the Islamic judiciary system, the most important  qualifications of the judge are that he be just and impartial.  Unfortunately, with the presence of Mr. 'Ali Akbar Parvaresh in  the Inquiry and Investigation Group, given his past history in  the Hojjatiyeh Society and the opposition he expressed from 1361  [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] with regard to the management of  Mr. Hashemi, and especially in the course of the events of 1362  [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] in the Voice and Vision, which  resulted in the dismissal of the general manager by the  Supervisory Council at the time and the reappointment of Mr.  Hashemi by the late Imam to his position, Mr. Parvaresh and some  like-minded persons said many things against the interference of  the Imam and his family, which so upset the Imam that in his  letter of 4 Tir 1362 [25 June 1983], he wrote: "It should be  mentioned that it has been heard that some in my household do  things contrary to my knowledge. Because this is not true, the  person who has said such things must repent before God..."    Mr. Hashemi added: The presence of Mr. Parvaresh, with such  a  history, in the Inquiry and Investigation Group has compromised  the "impartiality" of the group. At this point, the present  members, expressing that they had no knowledge of Mr.  Parvaresh's past history and the events in 1362 in the Voice and  Vision, referring to their own past, promised to observe  impartiality and not to allow anyone to influence their vote.    4) The Voice and Vision broadcasts annually about 82,000  hours of radio and 12,500 hours of television programs  throughout the country in more than 19 languages. During the  period under consideration by the group, from 1360 [21 March  1981-20 March 1982], when Mr. Hashemi took over the  responsibility, it broadcast more than 1 million hours of  programs. To examine 1 million hours of programming and express  opinions about them, for that matter responsible opinions, would  be very difficult, and considering the opponents and supporters  of the Voice and Vision, the iNquiry and Investigation Group  cannot base its judgment on what it hears. Rather, in every case  that it intends to express its opinion, it must examine it  directly and look at the documented evidence.    5) In regards to religious issues, the announcement was made  that since the late Imam, in addition to being the owner of the  revolution and the founder of the sacred regime of the Islamic  Republic of Iran, was a qualified religious jurist and a proven  source of emulation, we have acted in accordance with the  jurisprudential opinions of the Imam in the religious issues of  the Voice and Vision, such as the way women appear on television  or in music, and in such cases the committee cannot make a  judgement based on its own views. Rather, it must announce its  opinion on the basis of religious decrees and the opinions of  the late Imam concerning the above-mentioned issues. In  conclusion, he announced that in order to avoid any sort of  doubt about lack of cooperation by the organization that can be  misused by individuals with ill will or those who want to create  doubt, all the information and documents needed by the committee  should be requested in writing, and the Voice and Vision  organization will send the information to you in writing.    6) From the date of 14/07/1371 [6 October 1992], Mr.  Movahhedi-Savoji, the head of the Inquiry and Investigation  Group, in several correspondences requested information from the  Voice and Vision on 88 cases. All the requested information,  which consisted of about 8,000 pages, was forwarded to the  Inquiry and Investigation Group.    In the report that the Inquiry and Investigation Group  broadcast on 11 and 12 Aban [2, 3 November] of this year from  the Majles podium, except for one or two cases (which will be  referred to later), not only is no mention made of the documents  sent, but also the reporters of the group most unfairly have  stated in several places in the report "despite lack of  cooperation by the organization" or "given the lack of  cooperation by the organization..."    7) When reading the report, Mr. Parvaresh announced that  despite the lack of cooperation of the organization, the Inquiry  and Investigation Group obtained its information through  tangible and intangible ways.    8) In the course of the year that the inquiry and  investigation activities were under way, a great deal of  information about the members of the Inquiry and Investigation  Group were given to the Voice and Vision organization, which,  due to compliance with the directives of the late Imam and the  grand leader and in consideration for our belief and faith, we  have avoided revealing. But we will implicitly refer to one or  two points that are very effective in the analysis of the report  of the group, because lack of attention to these points may  seriously compromise the facts.    A) In addition to Mr. 'Ali Akbar Parvaresh, who was active  in  the Hojjatiyeh Society, and we have referred to his ideological  foundations, some of the other members of the organization also  have had a history of cooperation with and activities in the  Hojjatiyeh Society.    B) One of the members of the group married the wife of an  executed Hypocrite as his second wife and presents her as the  wife of a "martyr." But later it became clear that first she was  the wife of an executed Hypocrite, and Second it was the same  wife who had drawn her previous husband into the Hypocrite group.    Hence, the ideological foundations of some of the intangible  elements of the Inquiry and Investigation Group become clear:  the "Hojjatiyeh" and the "hypocrites." Also, the views of the  "Hojjatiyeh" and the "hypocrites" concerning the late Imam and  the grand leader and the supporters of the Imam are quite clear  and requires no further explanation.    With attention to the above-mentioned points, we will now  deal with the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group that  was read from the podium of the Majles on 11 and 12 Aban this  year.    In concluding this preface, the management of the  organization finds it necessary to thank all the  self-sacrificers who in the course of the eight years of imposed  war and bombing of cities, with their active and unassuming  presence on the front lines of the battle, offering dozens of  martyrs, and the broadcast of thousands of hours of war programs  immortalized the resistance of our brave and courageous people  and to which in the inquiry and investigation report not only is  no reference made, but with hurtful sentences all that effort  and self-sacrifice interpret it as lack of solidarity for the  war. The management also expresses its appreciation to all the  committed managers and employees of the organization who,  despite the shortages and minimal resources, in the most  critical conditions operated the Voice and Vision organization  in the best possible manner and were praised frequently by Imam  Khomeyni and the grand leader, Ayatollah Khamene'i, and who are  presented in the inquiry and investigation report as frightened  and alienated people, for certainly the munificent, just God  will never let their efforts go unrewarded.    In the preface, the Inquiry and Investigation Group states:  "The Voice and Vision programs can be produced in three ways,  negative programs, neutral or indifferent programs, and programs  in support of the revolution and Islam."    Voice and Vision's response: This kind of categorization is  a  creation of the Inquiry and Investigation Group. In the general  categorization, in terms of goals, the Voice and Vision programs  have the following objectives:    1) Guiding-instructional    2) Information-educational    3) Entertainment-recreational    Unfortunately, the nation that follows the Imam, on 13 Aban  [4 November], the day of death to America and the day of the  exile of the Imam, must hear from the mouth of one of the Majles  deputies the theory of the "deviancy" of the "Crocodile Tears"  serial. If this is not an actual example of cultural invasion  for the enemy to speak against the opinions of the Imam through  the mouths of the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group  at the start of 13 Aban, then what is it?    In regards to the "Crocodile Tears" serial, the content of  the "Crocodile Tears" serial was against the liberals and the  agents of the United States and was approved by the late Imam.    The program has a guiding-instructional goal, that is,  presenting the message with the intention of educating the  society in the long term, and is based on a single point and the  value foundation is in Islamic principles and beliefs. Programs  with this goal, through instruction to do good and prevent doing  evil, reminders and warnings, result in discussing the  preservation and strengthening of the virtues and negating evil  and prohibited acts both in internal and in social and general  forms. In the programs with information-educational goals,  information is presented in news and general forms. General  information results in an increase in the general knowledge of  the audience and is necessarily not tied to time. News  information is the kind of information that is particularly  important and is tied to time.    Educational programs in classic and nonclassic forms.  Classical education is education that is somehow related to the  official education of the country or assists it, such as lessons  in philosophy, ethics, decrees, mathematics, physics, etc.    Nonclassical educational programs are those which result in  the competence of various people in the society in connection  with various issues, such as: Programs related to the Fire  Department, driving and traffic, health, planting trees,  repairing household appliances, security, work environment,  children's health, etc.    Programs with entertainment-recreational goals: Presenting  messages with the purpose of creating happiness, joy, peace of  mind, and creating a possitive attitude in the audience, and  also creating readiness to accept individual and social  responsibilities and preventing the waste of people's leisure  time.    Hence, the categorizations or definitions given by the  Inquiry and Investigation Group have no basis in the Voice and  Vision organization and have the goal of merely showing the  programs in a negative light.    After this rather erratic preface, the Inquiry and  Investigation Group examines the films and serials and writes,  in other words, from 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985] to 1371  [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], about 900 films and serials have  been broadcast from Networks 1 and 2, of which number about 700  were foreign films and serials, which were produced highly  technically and artistically and subsequently are very  attractive and effective...and of these 700 cases, it only  refers to one motion picture, "Billy Bud," and concludes that  all these films were corrupt and spread Western culture.  <H5>  Voice and Vision Response </H5>   First, according to Paragraph 2 ratified by the Majles, the  subject of inquiry and investigation was the activities of the  general manager of the Voice and Vision, Mr. Hashemi, who was  appointed on 15 Mordad 1360 [6 August 1981] as the general  manager of the Voice and Vision.    It is not clear why the Voice and Vision in this examination  started from 1363, whereas the general manager of the  organization started his work from 15 Mordad 1360.    Second, according to the lists that were sent to the Inquiry  and Investigation Group, from 1360 [21 March 1981-20 March 1982]  to 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], in Vision Network 1 alone  1,552 domestic shows were produced and the names of all the  serials were sent to them. With the method of the Voice and  Vision in rerunning programs, that is, broadcasting a serial  once every three years, on the average, each of these segments  has been shown twice in 10 years. Moreover, serials and shows  that are produced in the provincial centers must be added to  these numbers. During the period under examination, about 3,500  cases alone were domestic serials and shows broadcast from the  two television networks. It is unclear to the officials of the  Voice and Vision why the Inquiry and Investigation Group,  despite having the names of all the programs and the production  statistics, has reduced this number to one-seventeenth of what  it should be. Clearly, what they meant to do was to show the  number and percentage of foreign programs as large and accuse  the television of propagating Western culture.    In this area, the second very important point is that in the  years after the victory of the Islamic revolution, the sources  for the procurement of foreign programs of the Voice and Vision  have been mostly Eastern and Islamic countries, such as Japan,  China, India, Egypt, Algeria, Syria, and Indonesia, and Western  sources have been used less often. Japanese programs have had  the largest share in foreign programs.    Among the foreign serials, those such as "Ezzoddin Qasam,"  "Tariq ol-Qods," "Seyyed Jamaleddin Asadabadi," or films such as  "Mohammad (Prophet of God)," "Fire Under the Ashes," etc.,    [Paragraphing as published] exist, the subject matter of  which is 100-percent Islamic and epic, or serials such as "Away  From Home (Ushin)" and "The Teacher of the Island," which were  not only not educationally misleading but also, with dubbing and  modifications, have been very instructional.    Now, why the Investigation Group in mentioning foreign  programs only chooses to analyze one or two examples or why it  considers all the programs "Western" is unclear to us.    The Inquiry and Investigation Group, after quoting several  errors and lies, concludes that "therefore, in the 14 years that  have passed since the Voice and Vision was established, our  young people have benefitted from foreign culture 75 percent and  our own culture 25 percent!"    In other words, an average of 14.12 percent is the share of  the foreign programs in Networks 1 and 2. With the above  description, although many of these programs have been produced  in other countries, they have values acceptable and respected by  our society.    It must be noted that this situation of 14.12 percent  concerns Networks 1 and 2, which broadcast about 6,000 hours  annually. Also taking into consideration about 6,500 hours of  television programs in the provincial centers, the foreign share  of which is nearly zero, the share of foreign programs in the  programs of the Vision is reduced to about 7 percent. And if we  add to them the radio programs of Tehran and the provincial  centers that have no foreign programs, the broadcast of about  54,000 hours of programs annually, the share of foreign programs  in the Voice and Vision programs is about 1.3 percent.    Let us review the sentence by the Inquiry and Investigation  Group on this matter:    "In other words, after 14 years since the Voice and Vision  was established, our young people have benefitted 75 percent  from foreign culture and 25 percent from our own culture."    However, as was stated, in the total of programs of the  Voice  and Vision broadcast domestically, the share of foreign programs  is only 1.3 percent, and the share of our own programs is 98.7  percent.    If the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group were  not the deputies of the people in the Majles who have promised  on the Koran to sign this oath:    "I take an oath on the Koran before Almighty God to guard  the  sanctity of Islam and preserve the fruits of the Islamic  revolution of the Iranian people and the foundations of the  Islamic Republic; to guard what the nation has entrusted us with  as a just trustee; to observe trustworthiness and piety in  carrying out my duties as a deputy;, and always to be steadfast  in the independence and victory of the country and preservation  of the rights of the people; to serve the people; to defend the  Constitution; and in my speeches, writings, and opinions, to  keep the independence of the country and the freedom of the  people and their interests in mind."    We would not say to them:    Gentlemen, you who are sitting in a position of judgment and  have spent a year, how and with what conscience and piety did  you allow yourselves to increase 1.3 percent to 75 percent and  reduce 98.7 percent to 25 percent?    Is this an example of your piety and your commitment before  the Koran and Almighty God?    In the continuation of the same discussion, the Inquiry and  Investigation Group states: "And this is provided the 25-percent  programs of our own are not cut by the quality control blade.  For example, the serial `The Active Neighborhood' ridicules the  revolution and the regime or the serial, `Crocodile Tears,'  which was made at unbelievable cost but many parts of which were  omitted due to deviant problems and the segments which were  broadcast were the target of widespread protest by the people  due to deviant problems...!"    Voice and Vision response: In the preface, we said  that among the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group  are those who were active in the Hojjatiyyeh Society and have  Hojjatiyeh ideologies and also those who have married  hypocrites, the wife of an executed Hypocrite. Also, Mr.  Parvaresh in the events of 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] of  the Voice and Vision was among the opponents of the general  manager, Mr. Hashemi, and was one of those who had accused the  Imam's family unjustly concerning the reappointment of Mr.  Hashemi by the late Imam. One of the issues that in those days  was the source of conflict was the serial, "Crocodile Tears."  The content of "Crocodile Tears" was against the liberals and in  a most appropriate manner exposed the liberals and those  affiliated with the West, especially the criminal United States.    Some elements of a mind like that of Mr. Parvaresh, who in  those days had sensitive positions in the Voice and Vision,  opposed the serial "Crocodile Tears" vehemently and wanted to  prevent its broadcast in any way possible.    When the fourth segment of the serial was being broadcast,  they had a petition signed to request that the serial be stopped:    Mr. Mohammad Hashemi (the general manager of the  organization  at the time) visited the Imam and asked his honor for  instructions in regards to the issue of the petition and the  stopping of the serial. The Imam said: "In my opinion, the  liberals have deceived those who have signed the petition. The  broadcast of the serial should continue."    The Imam's opinion was reported in the organization and it  was decided that the serial be continued. But a group of a like  mind to Mr. Parvaresh, who were influential in those days in  broadcasting in Network 1, could not tolerate more than six  segments, and after the broadcast of the 9th segment, the 10th,  11th, 12th, and 13th segments of the serial, which in fact  contained the harshest attacks on the liberals and the  supporters of the United States, were summed up in one segment  under the pretext of antireligious scenes and the announcement  was made that the serial was ended.    The Imam, God rest his soul, summoned the general manager at  the time (Mr. Mohammad Hashemi) and announced that the  production and broadcast of the other segments of this serial  were to continue and in response to those who have raised  questions in regards to the religious aspects of the serial  said: "Experts were consulted, they said that there may have  been religious violations in the production of this serial, but  its broadcast was not in violation of religious law." This  announcement was broadcast at that time, after the broadcast of  the last segment of the serial from Network 1 and the Vision.    Unfortunately, now the Inquiry and Investigation Group has  placed its finger on a few instances out of 1,552 domestic  production programs, one of which is "Crocodile Tears."    Mr. Parvaresh and those like-minded people know well that  the  Imam approved this serial despite the opposition at the time,  asked that it be continued, and neutralized the conspiracy that  was instigated by him and those like-minded people in declaring  the serial in violation of religious law!    Unfortunately, the people who follow the Imam, at the start  of 13 Aban [4 November], the day of death of American and the  day of the Imam's exile, must hear from one of the deputies of  the Majles the opinion that the "Crocodile Tears" serial is  "deviant." If this is not an actual example of the cultural  invasion of the enemy expressed from the mouth of the members of  Inquiry and Investigation Group on 13 Aban against the opinions  of the Imam, then what is it?    The Inquiry and Investigation Group writes in the  continuation of this discussion: "Serials are produced at high  cost but with such internal problems that after production they  are declared unsuitable for broadcast, for example, the serial  "Ziba Beauty Salon" or some of the films that are protested to  and declared unsuitable for broadcast, such as "Haji Washington"  and "The Death of Yazdgerd."    Voice and Vision response: First, the broadcast  time of the serial "Ziba Beauty Salon," when it was produced,  was projected to be Fall 1372 [1993]; several segments have been  broadcast so far and no changes have been made to it. Hence, the  tangible and intangible sources of the Inquiry and Investigation  Group here, too, have acted cleverly and mischievously and  forced them to present an untruthful report. Second, as it was  said, the period of inquiry and investigation is the time of  management of Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, that is, from Mordad 1360  [23 July-22 August 1981].    However, the production of the films "Haji Washington" and  "The Death of Yazdgerd" began in late 1357 [21 March 1978-20  March 1979] in Italy and reached Iran about 1358 [21 March  1979-20 March 1980] and they were never broadcast on television.  And if they had been broadcast, it would have no relation to the  period of management of Mr. Mohammad Hashemi. And if the claim  of the Inquiry and Investigation Group is true, that it was  broadcast once and then considered unsuitable for broadcast, it  must be counted as a positive measure in the management of Mr.  Hashemi.    But the question that is raised here is, when the Inquiry  and  Investigation Group reports on the domestic productions of the  Voice and Vision, why does it start from 1363 [21 March 1984-20  March 1985]? In other words, it ignores three years of the  activities of the management to show the statistics as low, but  when it wants to express a negative point, it returns to the  activities of three years earlier, that is, 1357 [21 March  1978-20 March 1979] and 1358 [21 March 1979-20 March 1980]. Is  this another indication of piety and fairness? God is the best  judge.    The Inquiry and Investigation Group in continuation writes:  "Of course, of the 25-percent domestic production, only 8  percent is made by the Voice and Vision and the rest is  purchased from outside the organization."    The Inquiry and Investigation Group shows extreme  sensitivity  toward the program, "The Sinister Conspiracy," and even unjustly  accuses one of the main elements. "The Sinister Conspiracy" was  a show concerning the appearance of Zionism and is against  Israel. This show, due to its valuable content, has been  broadcast three times so far.    Voice and Vision response: As was stated, first,  domestic production is not 25 percent but 98.7 percent.    Second, of this amount, less than half a percent is  purchased  from outside the organization and the rest, that is, 98.3  percent, is produced within the organization. Besides, of the  amount that is purchased from outside, except for motion  pictures, the rest is produced under the supervision of the  Voice and Vision and then purchased.    In this case, in truth, we could not understand what  objective the Inquiry and Investigation Committee is pursuing in  this false report in order to respond to it.    Continuing this discussion, the Inquiry and Investigation  Group deals with the "Hezardastan" serial and criticizes this  serial for not dealing with such clerical heroes as Modarres and  Sheykh Fazlollah Nuri and in continuation writes: In this  serial, the assassin of martyr Sheykh Fazlollah Nuri, in a  cinematic trick, is presented as a brave, free, emotional,  oppressed, justice-seeking, antiforeign, mystical, patriotic  person.    Voice and Vision response: First, the  "Hezardastan" serial began in 1354 [21 March 1975-20 March 1976]  with the name "The Silk Road," and until 1360 [21 March 1981-20  March 1982], when Mr. Hashemi assumed this responsibilities, it  continued under the same name. More than 18 hours were filmed  and a great deal was spent on it (the subject of the serial was  a presentation of Reza Khan, the bully, as the Iranian silk  road). In 1360, the serial was ordered stopped. The Supervisory  Council at the time pursued the issue of the serial and  appointed a committee to review the parts that had already been  produced, study the script, and take the necessary steps to  revise the serial in a way that would make it suitable for  broadcast.    The group selected by the Supervisory Council began its work  under the supervision of the council and after months succeeded  in changing the subject of the serial totally and preparing it  for broadcast in the best possible form and content. Of course,  given the characteristics, the serial was not without minor  problems, but on the whole, with the efforts of the committee  selected by the Supervisory Council of the time, it became  suitable for broadcast.    The Inquiry and Investigation Group continues: "In the  program `The Seventh Art,' where there is a discussion of the  former Soviet cinema (the host of the program is a well-known  Westernized person who has inflicted blows on Islam for years in  the university environment and has been in conflict with  religious forces), the reason for the disintegration of the  Soviet government is mentioned as the setting of rules for  artists and restriction of their freedom, thereby indicating  that the artist must be free to create what he wants, and in  this way tries to misguide the artists to deviate from serving  Islam and the revolution."    Voice and Vision response: Apparently the purpose  of the Inquiry and Investigation Group from this segment is to  unjustly accuse a Voice and Vision host, a retired person from  the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance--as he has  claimed--who teaches in universities.    Of the accusations they have made against him, nothing has  been recorded. His activities in the Voice and Vision have been  positive and if in an artistic program he has mentioned one of  the faults of the dictatorial communist government, that is,  depriving artists of their freedom, how can this be criticized?    Does the Inquiry and Investigation Group believe that in the  Islamic society artists are not free and are forced to make  programs under the pressure of the government? Is this not the  same opinion and analysis that frequently the Hypocrite  minigroup and other counterrevolutionary minigroups made of the  government of the Islamic Republic of Iran?    Have such claims of the counterrevolutionary groups been  able  to affect the committed artists and prevent them from serving  the Islamic society?    Today, one of our best propaganda tools is to make use of  committed artists. The same artists have created thousands of  art works, including beautiful, epic poems to dignified shows  after the revolution.    It is not clear to the officials of the Voice and Vision why  the Inquiry and Investigation Group, despite having the names of  all the programs and production and broadcast statistics, has  reduced this number by one-seventeenth. Certainly they intended  to make the number and percentage of foreign programs large and  accuse the television of propagating Western culture.    Gentlemen, you who are sitting in positions of judgment and  have spent one year, how and with what conscience and piety did  you allow yourselves to increase 1.3 percent foreign programs to  75 percent and decrease 98.7 percent domestic programs to 25  percent?    The program "The Seventh Art" is an instructive program  full of content and attractive for experts.    The Inquiry and Investigation Group has not expressed any  opinion concerning the content of this program. Under the  pretext of this very sensitive program they have tried to show  that "artists in the Islamic society do not have freedom,"  precisely the same accusations that the Hypocrite minigroup and  other counterrevolutionary minigroups have made against the  regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  <H5>  Examination of the Programs of Vision Network 1 </H5>   The Inquiry and Investigation Group refers to the programs  of  two weeks of the Vision Network 1 during the seven years, one  the week of 25/12/1363 to 02/01/1364 [16-22 March 1985], that  is, the New Year programs, and another the programs of the week  of 26/01/1370 to 01/02/1370 [15-21 April 1991], that is, the  week coinciding with the four days of holidays (Fetr celebration  holidays), and concludes that 45 percent of the programs of  Network 1 were in connection with Islam and the revolution and  55 percent of the programs were indifferent to Islam and the  revolution. It also adds that in 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March  1985], foreign films and serials made up 24 percent of all the  programs and in 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] this ratio  increased to 38 percent of all the programs and writes:  "Apparently, the Voice and Vision is gradually losing its  Islamic and revolutionary motivation and is becoming indifferent  and neutral." The Inquiry and Investigation group then examines  the programs of the Vision Network 2. In examining the programs  of the two weeks out of seven years, it points out:    One is the program of the week of 25/12/1363 to 02/01/1364,  that is the 1364 [21 March 1985-20 March 1986] New Year, and  another the programs of 07/09/1371 to 14/09/1371 [28 November-5  December 1992]. And it concludes that in this network, too, 36  percent of the programs have the Islamic messages of the  revolution and 64 percent of the messages are neutral and  unrelated to the revolution and Islam. In the conclusion of this  section, it adds: If we consider the total programs of Networks  1 and 2, of the 85 weekly programs of the two networks in 1363,  39.5 hours concerned Islam and the revolution and in 1370 [21  March 1991-20 March 1992], out of 92 hours of weekly programs of  the two networks, 33.5 hours concerned the revolution and Islam  and 58 hours were neutral and indifferent.    Voice and Vision response: First, the Inquiry and  Investigation Group has examined the programs of one week of one  network during the New Year holidays and generalized them to all  the programs of the Voice and Vision organization over a  seven-year period.    Second, in a few lines on the previous page, they had  claimed  that only 25 percent of the Voice and Vision programs are our  own and 75 percent of all programs are Western and anti-Islamic  culture. If we compare these figures of the Inquiry and  Investigation Group, we realize the contradictions of the group,  because if 39.5 hours out of 85 hours, that is about 45 percent  of the programs even during the New Year holidays, concern Islam  and the revolution, naturally, they were domestic programs.    Third, which fair, impartial, and just group would find it  logical to examine only the programs of one week and one part of  an organization and generalize its findings to cover seven  years, whereas they were supposed to examine the activities of  12 years, and apparently they have expressed their opinion  concerning 12 years. If we convert this ratio to mathematical  figures, the Inquiry and Investigation Group has examined 85  hours out of more than a million hours of programs, and  incidentally, for a specific week, and then makes a judgment  about a million hours of programming.    Is this the meaning of impartiality and precision by the  Inquiry and Investigation Group? And is this the meaning of the  piety that is cited in the oath of the Majles?    Fourth, in categorizing the programs, the Inquiry and  Investigation Group mentions the programs to be unrelated to  Islam and the revolution or neutral, indifferent and deviant.    If we were to make the same categorization about other  organizations, what percentage of their activities would conform  to Islam and the revolution? For example, what percentage of the  ratifications of the Majles are directly related to the  revolution? Or what percentage of the school textbooks are  directly related to the revolution and Islam? Why should the  group engage in such categorization that it would itself find  contradictory and not be able to use in any other case?    Fifth, as was mentioned, the goals of the programs of the  Voice and Vision are guidance related, educational,  informational, instructional, recreational, and for  entertainment. This program has not broadcast one moment of  neutral programs and will not do so. All the programs have a  goal and are instructive, and this is not a claim by the Voice  and Vision, but the opinion that the Imam expressed in Fall 1366  [1987].    In those days, some individuals in newspapers and some from  podiums began to create a climate against the programs of the  Voice and Vision and considered the programs indifferent,  neutral, and educationally misleading, in violation of religious  law.    One of the deputies of the Majles from the Supervisory  Council asked the opinion of the late Imam in writing concerning  the programs of the Voice and Vision. Here, we call to the  attention of the honorable audience the question and answer:    Honorable Grand Ayatollah, Imam Khomeyni,    The Grand Leader of the Revolution and Founder of the  Islamic  Republic of Iran, may his blessings perpetuate.    Respectfully, in connection with the broadcast of some  foreign films or domestic productions and serials, such as "Fall  in the Meadows," "Mirror," and "Influence," as well as the  broadcast of music from the Voice and Vision, some complaints  are sent from the martyr-nurturing nation, especially the  honorable families of the martyrs, self-sacrificers,  missing-in-action, and prisoners of war, to the Supervisory  Council stating that the broadcast of such films, serials, and  music is contrary to the sacred laws of Islam, contrary to the  lofty goals of the revolution, inappropriate for the regime of  the Islamic Republic, and cause the spread of unveiling and  improper veiling and are misleading, not to mention that to  spend the budget on their production is considered waste,  although they may also be instructional, recreational, and  entertaining.    In comparing such instances with the existing decrees in the  scholarly dissertations and writings of Your Excellency and  determining what is allowed and not allowed, there are  differences of opinion and explicit and correct answers cannot  be given to those who raise the questions. Differences in taste  also exist and one does not know what must be done. What must be  done under these sensitive war conditions, which is the most  important of affairs?    Another point is that when the complaints, which are  generally from the nation in whom the revered Imam is interested  and those who have given martyrs and the Hezbollah, are given to  the managers and executive officials they say: "The Imam sees  all these programs and listens to the music; if there are  problems, he will mention them."    Since "investigating the complaints and responding to them  and taking rapid steps to eliminate the deficiencies" is one of  the legal duties of the Supervisory Council, please write your  blessed opinion concerning the above-mentioned issues in order  for us to be able to carry out our grave religious and legal  duties properly and not be responsible before that revered imam  and the divine nation of Iran.    Greetings to you and may the blessings of God be yours    Esma'il Ferdowsipur    Member of the Voice and Vision Supervisory Council  &lt;graphic&gt;     &lt;titl&gt; The opinion of the Imam and the  letter is as follows:&lt;/graphic&gt;     In the name of the Almighty:    Viewing such films and plays is not inappropriate from a  religious standpoint and many of them are instructive and their  broadcast also is proper. Also, films on sports and music are  also mostly appropriate. Sometimes, rarely, the opposite  happens, and more care must be taken. However, two points must  be observed. First, those who apply makeup must be an intimate  [one with whom marriage is prohibited]. A stranger is  prohibited [religiously] from doing this. Second, the viewers  must not perceive these works as lustful. Ruhollah Khomeyni.    Once again, note the question and answer:    The person posing the question writes: "The broadcast of  such  films, serials, and music is contrary to the sacred laws of  Islam, contrary to the lofty goals of the revolution,  inappropriate for the regime of the Islamic Republic, and causes  the spread of unveiling and improper veiling and are misleading,  not to mention that to spend the budget on their production is  considered waste, although they may also be instructional,  recreational, and entertaining."    The Imam responds: "Watching such films and plays is not a  problem from a religious standpoint and many of them are  instructional and their broadcast also is no problem. Also,  sports films or music are also mostly no problem. Sometimes,  violations are seen, rarely, and more care must be taken."    Gentlemen of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, this  opinion of the Imam is from 29 Azar 1366 [20 December 1987],  that is about seven years of the period during which you  examined the Voice and Vision programs.    Honorable gentlemen, in the first meeting of the Inquiry and  Investigation Group, the director of the Voice and Vision  organization announced the opinion of the Imam to you and you  expressed your lack of knowledge. Then he sent you a copy of the  questions and answers with the text of the Imam's statements and  the text of his reverence's decree in letter No.  M/2300/569/5160, dated 21/07/1371 [13 October 1992].    Gentlemen of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, in the  joint meeting with the director of the Voice and Vision  organization, you announced that you are all emulators and  followers of the Imam. What is the meaning of such conflict  between your views and those of the Imam?    The Imam said many of the programs are instructive. You say  they mostly have neutral, indifferent, or deviant messages.    The Imam said there is for the most part no problem. You say  it is mostly problematic. The Imam said violations are rarely  seen. You say, except for a small percentage, the rest are in  violation. Still you claim to be emulators, obedient, and  followers of the Imam?    Honorable gentlemen, the day that Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, the  director of the Voice and Vision, reminded you that with the  presence of Mr. Parvaresh, with his history and his opposition  to the views of the Imam concerning the Voice and Vision, the  group has lost its "impartiality," you claimed that the members  of the group are all obedient emulators and followers of the  Imam and do not allow anyone to influence their opinion and  votes. Was this your impartiality and being followers of the  Imam? In continuing its examination, the Inquiry and  Investigation Group writes about the Vision Network 2: "Network  2 has translated four plays into Persian at high cost and  produced them as television serials, for which 100-percent  similar foreign ones existed, such that one might well imagine  they were imported from abroad. And this is while 79 percent of  films and serials are foreign and Network 2, instead of  producing films and serials in defense of Islam and the  revolution, still has added to foreign problems.    Voice and Vision response: Certainly the dear  audience does not know which plays and films the Inquiry and  Investigation Group is referring to. In order to clarify the  matter, we will mention the name of one film and one play. One  of these films is "Conspiracy," which in a beautiful way shows  the criminality of the Americans, even in hospitals and in  regards to patients.    This film was broadcast about a year ago from Baku  Television, "Azerbaijan," and was strongly protested by the  Americans. The government of Baku at the time was strongly  questioned by the U.S. Ambassador for broadcasting the film. One  of the plays that was referred to is "The Inspector Enters."    This play very beautifully questions and exposes the  judicial  system and Government of England. Indeed, it is not clear to us  why the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, out of  1,552 domestically produced shows whose names were given to  them, place their fingers on a few specific cases which have  upset the Americans and British as well as, as will be described  later, the Israelis.    Indeed, why?    In order for you to see these programs that are contrary to  the revolution and are deviant, soon we will broadcast the film,  "Conspiracy" for you from television. You can judge whether the  film is against the United States and contrary to the  revolution. We believe exposing the criminal United States is  the duty of every revolutionary Muslim today.    In the conclusion of this section, we provide the combined  chart of the goals of the Vision programs and also the combined  chart of the domestic and foreign programs of the two networks.    As you can see:    In terms of the goals, the programs are produced and  broadcast with the three goals of guidance-education,  information-instruction, and entertainment-recreation. Hence, no  program has a neutral, indifferent, or deviant message. In the  charts of the composition of the domestic and foreign programs  of the two networks, as can be seen, 14.12 percent is the share  of foreign programs of the two networks and 85.82 percent the  share of domestic programs. These statistics include all the  programs of the two networks, including children's programming,  shows, films, and serials.    Hence, it can be seen to what extent the claim of the  Inquiry  and Investigation Group and the statistics that they have  presented are untrue and contrary to the facts.    We emphasize, these percentages merely concern the programs  of the two television networks. If the programs of the Voice and  Vision of the provincial centers and Tehran radio are included,  the ratio of foreign programs to domestic ones is about 1.3  percent. In other words, 98.7 percent of the programs of the  Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic are domestically  produced by ourselves, and 1.3 percent of all the Voice and  Vision programs are imported from abroad, whereas the Inquiry  and Investigation Group, as was mentioned, states this ratio as  75-percent foreign and 25-percent domestic.    God willing, God will grant us the ability and fairness to  see the facts and judge accordingly.    As it was said, the Voice and Vision organization during the  period under examination by the Inquiry and Investigation Group  produced 1,552 shows domestically, almost every segment of the  program was broadcast twice, and the names of all the programs  were sent to the Inquiry and Investigation Group.    The Inquiry and Investigation Group has shown sensitivity to  the following programs:    1) Concerning the serial "Crocodile Tears," the content of  the serial "Crocodile Tears" was against the liberals and the  supporters of the United States and approved by the late Imam.    2) In regards to the motion picture "Conspiracy," produced  by  Vision Network 2, the content of the motion picture "Conspiracy"  is against U.S. crimes, even in hospitals and in regards to  patients. When this film was broadcast from Baku Television, the  U.S Ambassador in Azerbaijan strongly protested the broadcast of  this film.    3) The Inquiry and Investigation Group showed sensitivity to  the show"The Interrogator [as published; previously `Inspector']  Enters." This progra questions the British judicial system  beautifully and shows the criminality of the British.    4) The Inquiry and Investigation Committee has shown extreme  sensitivity to the program "Sinister Conspiracy" and even  unjustly accuses one of the main people involved.    The series "Sinister Conspiracy" concerns the appearance of  Zionism and is against Israel. Because of its valuable content,  this series has been shown three times so far.    5) The Inquiry and Investigation Group shows sensitivity  towards the serial "Primrose." The producers of the serial  "Primrose" had the honor to meet with the grand leader, who  expressed his praise for them. Also, the honorable head of the  Judicial Branch, Ayatollah Yazdi, in a letter to the Voice and  Vision organization, expressed his praise for this group. The  honorable speaker of the Majles at the time also met with this  group and praised them.    6) The Inquiry and Investigation Committee has shown  sensitivity to the programs that the organization has produced  and broadcast in connection with the war.    The reporters and narrators of war programs were frequently  commended by the high ranking officials of the sacred regime of  the Islamic Republic, and last year these dear ones received a  Koran and other prizes from the grand leader for their beautiful  programs.    The Inquiry and Investigation Group has shown sensitivity to  the show "The Interrogator Enters." This series very beautifully  questions the British judicial system and shows the criminality  of the British.    7) The Inquiry and Investigation Group has shown sensitivity  to the serial "The Lesson in the Mirror." Those mainly involved  in this serial were commended by the grand leader and other high  ranking officials of the country. For the officials of the Voice  and Vision this question exists: Why out of 1,552 show segments  has the Inquiry and Investigation Group shown sensitivity to  programs that were approved by the Imam, the grand leader, and  other high-ranking officials of the regime, and for which they  have been commended, or those that have been against the United  States, Israel, England, and the liberals. They have shown  sensitivity as best they could. Of course, it can be accepted  that the Inquiry and Investigation Group has not been aware of  some of those instances, but in some instances, certainly the  group, or some of its members, were aware.    Here we find it necessary to make one point, which is that  the officials of the Voice and Vision have never claimed that no  criticism of the programs of the Voice and Vision is warranted,  but have always asked experts to announce to us their opinions  in order to improve the quality and content of the programs. It  has been due to such care and solidarity that the programs of  this organization have always been growing and continue to grow,  and for this reason the organization has been able to gain the  trust of the Islamic nation such that people devote 88 percent  of their leisure time to its programs.    We ask God Almighty not to abandon us, even for a moment.    Amen, Oh Lord of Two Worlds.

The Voice and Vision organization has always protected and  supported the Basij institution located in that organization.  Any organization that itself, as a storming army on the front  line of the battle of right against wrong, has always propagated  Islamic values and reported the bravery and courage of the  self-sacrificing combatants in the best possible manner could  not have been successful in this grand mission without the  sufficient support of the organization.    In the course of the imposed war, the Basij of the  organization have been able to have the following activities by  making use of the sufficient resources of the Voice and Vision.    1) Attracting and organizing forces to train and dispatch to  the front in individual and collective from in most general and  personnel dispatches.    2) Ideological instructions, culture, the Koran, emergency  and other instructions for the Basij forces.    3) Holding of great ceremonies on the occasions of the  blessed 10 days of Fajr, Basij Week, Sacred Defense Week, Unity  Week, the passing away of the Imam, holidays, mournings, etc.    4) Dispatch of propaganda and cultural teams and showing of  films in the course of the eight years of sacred defense to the  fronts in the west and the south.    5) Dispatch of 50-member teams of employees of the  organization to visit the front frequently.    6) Sending cash and material help and collections from  employees and the organization in people's aid convoys to the  front, for example, six tractors.    7) Holding of 12 military training courses for 5 percent of  the employees of the organization in accordance with the  circular letter of the government in the Balal Mosque and the  barracks for 1,700 people.    8) Implementation of ideological, cultural, and political  competitions for all the employees of the organization.    9) Establishment of a Basij unit for the sisters throughout  the organization.    10) Holding exhibitions of pictures, posters, films, and  books on various occasions.    11) Close relationship and constant active presence in all  the programs and ceremonies announced by the Center for the  Basij of offices and factories of the Guard Corps and  coordination with that institution are among the activities of  this headquarters.    Active presence in the Basij ceremonies and moral and  psychological support of the honorable deputy director of the  organization is not unknown to any of the Basij members of the  organization, and this issue is encouraging for the members of  the Basij.    The sufficient support of the organization for the Basij has  always continued without any problem through the honorable  administrative and financial deputy director and the honorable  director general for the expenditures of the activities.    The honorable deputy director for provincial affairs and  Majles affairs of the organization has always strived to create  close relations between the Basij stationed in Tehran and the  Basij bases in provincial centers and to create resources to  establish new bases in provincial cities.    At the present, about 18 Basij bases are active in the Voice  and Vision of provincial cities and seven bases of resistance in  Tehran.    Membership in the logistics headquarters of the war in the  organization was achieved on the recommendation and emphasis of  the director of the organization personally, and the  responsibility for secretary of this headquarters was conferred  on a member of the Basij Council of the organization by him.    At the present time, a number of managers are members of the  Basij of the organization. On the whole, all the managers of the  organization, including the most senior to the middle-management  level, have always helped the Basij in advancing its actions  toward the sacred goals of the regime and participated and still  participate in the seminars held by the Basij.    The latest example is a seminar that will be held in Aban  [23  October-21 November] in the holy city of Mashhad in which  managers from various levels will participate.    Also, the members of the Basij are all employees of the  organization and in addition to usual salary and benefits for  this work enjoy all the legal benefits for combatants and  self-sacrificers.    [9 Nov p 14, Part II]    [Text] Following the presentation of the honorable Inquiry  and Investigation Committee in the financial divisions of the  Voice and Vision organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran,  which was read in the open session of the honorable Majles, it  is necessary to announce certain issues in order to inform the  public concerning the issues raised.    Unfortunately, due to lack of sufficient experience and work  in evaluation and determining the efficiency of the systems,  methods, and activities of the government institutions and lack  of a tradition and history of scientific inquiry and  investigation in Iran, the result is the presentation of the  existing report and the judgment of those who prepared the  report. The report indicates that not only have the persons who  were chosen to conduct inquiry and investigation of the  organization not had sufficient experience in auditing and  evaluation of financial issues, but they also have not even been  aware that the expression of opinion concerning the activities  and evaluation of an organization such as the Voice and Vision  organization with all its complexities require efficient,  effective, and economic cost auditing. If the Inquiry and  Investigation Group had the slightest familiarity with auditing  procedures, they would know that the result of evaluation is  effective and successful when all three aspects mentioned above  are simultaneously examined, evaluated, and judged. They would  then not engage in presenting only a select few items in the  accounts in a most "public deceiving" manner and would not  misguide the path to auditing, evaluation, and control that is  going through the initial steps.    What is important in regard to the report of the Inquiry and  Investigation Group is that despite the fact that the committee  had access to the detailed information of the organization, they  never asked for an explanation from the related officials of the  organization concerning their interpretations and criticism.  Perhaps the explanations of the officials of the organization  could eliminate some of the ambiguities and questions of the  Inquiry and Investigation Group.    Considering the preface, the main points in the report are  referred to.  <H5>  1. Lack of Cooperation by the Auditor </H5>   At the start of the report by the committee, reference is  made to lack of cooperation by the auditor with the committee.  This claim and the statements were based on predetermined  specific goals. The text of the presented report, which involves  the most minor financial issues and instances and accounting  documents and gives opinions about them, indicates the fact that  the committee was given full cooperation in presenting the  information requested, and never has any direct contact with the  auditor received a negative response.  <H3>  2. Verification of the Balance Sheet of the Organization of  the Supervisory Council </H3>   The duty of the financial affairs unit is to prepare and  regulate the balance sheet and the list of annual revenues and  expenditures. In recent years, based on the existing documents  and records, the financial records every year, prior to the  appointed time in a form and content better than the previous  year, and as usual approved by the honorable director of the  organization, have been sent for the approval of the Supervisory  Council of the organization. If the balance sheet is not  approved by the Supervisory Council, it would have nothing to do  with the duties of the financial and executive affairs of the  organization.    Should the organization activities, the financial  operations,  and recording and transfer of account balances from one year to  another stop because the balance sheet of the organization was  not approved by the Supervisory Council?  <H5>  3. The Structure of the Organization </H5>   The structure of the organization, including the financial  affairs organization, was approved by the Supervisory Council of  the organization at the time and the creation of the "financial  activities evaluation unit" in the financial affairs complex of  the organization was done with the approval of the Supervisory  Council. Later, in order to carry out the above-mentioned  duties, the internal auditing unit was projected and approved  within the authority of the director of the organization.    The Inquiry and Investigation Committee has not carefully  studied and examined the laws and regulations governing the  Voice and Vision organization and its ratified organizations.  Hence, it has presented incorrect and untrue information in its  report.  <H5>  4. Income Tax of the Organization </H5>   According to Article 1 of the law of administration of the  Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran ratified in  1359 [21 March 1980-20 March 1981], the Voice and Vision  organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran is an independent  "organization" and... As you can see, contrary to what the  Inquiry and Investigation Committee has understood and  interpreted, the goal of the legislature was not to create a  government company.    In Article 138 of the general national accounting law, the  Voice and Vision organization has merely regarded a "government  company" in terms of the implementation of this law. Hence, in  terms of the implementation of direct tax laws and other laws,  the organization cannot be considered a "government company."  Ultimately, as is clear by the name of the "Voice and Vision  organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran," this is a  government organization that is subject to any law, provided it  is mentioned by name.    According to Paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the direct tax laws  ratified by the Majles, government ministries and establishments  and organizations whose budget is provided by the government as  well as city halls and establishments affiliated with the  government and city halls which have been established in a form  other than a company in accordance with the laws are exempt from  taxes. The Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran  receives more than 95 percent of its financial resources from  the general budget of the government and in the form of aid and,  based on its legal form, which was referred to above, is not  subject to payment of taxes.  <H3>  5. Inspection and Auditing of the Activities of the  Organization </H3>   The report of the Inquiry and Investigation Committee states  that after the revolution, the activities of the organization  have not been injected and examined by any authority. The  honorable committee has not even paid the slightest attention to  the matters presented in its own report either, because at the  beginning of the committee report reference is made to the  efforts of the Accounting Office concerning auditing and  examination of the accounts of the organization. Also, the  National Inspection Organization has established a special  office in the organization and carries out the necessary  inspections of the various activities of the organization in  Tehran and the provincial centers of which the reports are  available. Also, the "Auditing organization" has been in charge  of auditing the financial activities of companies affiliated  with the organization in the past few years and has presented  the necessary reports.    Based on the existing laws and regulations, various reports  have been presented to the related authorities, including the  "auditing and distribution of budget management" of the National  Accounting office, Article 49 of the Constitution, "Central  office and Centralization and Combination of Accounts and  Accounting Methods" of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and  Finance, the Plan and Budget organization, and the "Economic  Accounting Office" of the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic  of Iran.  <H3>  6. Noncentralized System of the Financial Affairs of the  Organization </H3>   The noncentralized financial system of the organization has  been devised with attention to the administration system and the  organizational plan of units and centers of the organizations  approved by the Supervisory Council.    This system that is operated in a noncentralized form is an  accepted scientific system in financial issues and accounting  that has been used to expedite the implementation of activities  and prevent bureaucracy and waste of a great deal of time in  carrying out the various financial affairs of the organization  throughout the country and it is unlikely that this system will  be replaced with another financial system, considering the  scattered nature of the Voice and Vision centers and also the  variety of the activities of the units of the organization.    The fact that the report of the committee states that  because  of this system, no information can be obtained concerning the  activities and accounts of 25 Voice and Vision centers and  Tehran units is astonishing and questionable, because the  honorable committee, the National Accounting office, or any  other authorized organization can refer to the financial books  of the units and centers to examine the accounts of that unit or  the radio and television centers independently. Reference to a  number of accounts of "the financial affairs of the program  affairs" [as published] and "Tehran Accounting office" [as  published] in the report of the committee verifies this matter.  It is unfortunate for this organization that the committee, by  referring to a small number of financial units of the existing  45 financial units and by relying on oral information by certain  persons, has engaged in commenting on the financial situation of  the whole organization.  <H5>  The Budget of the Organization </H5>   The existing records and numerous correspondences that the  Voice and Vision had with the Plan and Budget organization in  the course of the imposed war years and later indicate the  problems stemming from the severe shortage of budget and  financial resources of the organization. The following figures  show the trend of the change in the ratified cash budget of the  organization in the years after the victory of the magnificent  Islamic revolution and the year 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March  1979]:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                                      |Amounts in Millions of Rials          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year                                  |Ratified Budget                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979]    |34,303                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1358 [21 March 1979-20 March 1980]    |18,681                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1359 [21 March 1980-20 March 1981]    |18,756                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1360 [21 March 1981-20 March 1982]    |17,246                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983]    |20,010                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984]    |24,110                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985]    |24,550                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1364 [21 March 1985-20 March 1986]    |25,399                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987]    |26,850                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1366 [21 March 1987-20 March 1988]    |21,317                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1367 [21 March 1988-20 March 1989]    |26,850                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990]    |28,562                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991]    |42,000                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The above chart shows that the ratified budget of the  organization in 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] is less than  in 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979] and if only the inflation  factor (based on the annual statistical book of the country) is  used as the standard in the years after the victory of the  revolution, in the same year a budget of more than 110 billion  rials should have been ratified. In other words, in 1368 [21  March 1989-20 March 1990], without calculating the very high  increase in the activities of the organization compared to 1357,  the budget of the organization was ratified at about one-fourth  of the needed budget, based on the official inflation rates.    On the other hand, the current ratified cash budget of the  organization in the years after the victory of the Islamic  revolution up to 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] was almost  equivalent to the paid salaries and benefits of the organization  in these years.    The budget shortage in the years referred to created  numerous  problems for the organization. Among them we can point out the  lack of resources for production of serious programs, the  creation of obligations and large financial debts, the lack of  maximal use of studios and transmitters, deterioration of  buildings and equipment, etc.    In 1369, for the first time after the victory of the  revolution, the budget of the organization was more carefully  examined under the supervision of the expert committee of the  Plan and Budget organization, and finally a 42-billion- rial  budget was ratified. But even this amount has not been  sufficient for the program production activities planned by the  organization and technical expansion and operations of the  organization. Various correspondences in this regard with the  Plan and Budget organization and the Islamic Guidance and Arts  and Media Committee of the Majles verify this fact.    It should be recalled that about 75 percent of the budget of  the organization in the years referred to has been spent on  paying the salaries and benefits for personnel and only 25  percent of this budget has been unusable in the program  production division, maintenance of radio and television  transmitters, and other activities of the organization.    The increase in the budget of developmental projects during  1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] and 1370 [21 March 1991-20  March 1992] compared to the previous years was merely due to the  increase in the number of developmental projects and the  increased coverage of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic  Republic of Iran throughout Iran and outside the borders. This  matter has always been emphasized by the grand leader and the  Majles.    In 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], due to the budgetary  problems of the cultural and media organizations in countering  cultural invasion and elimination of deprivation, the Majles  ratified the deduction of 1 percent of the total general  national budget in 1372 and its allocation to the  above-mentioned organizations.    It would have been logical for the Inquiry and Investigation  Group to pay attention to the proposal of the Islamic Culture  and Arts and Media Committee (some of whose members are members  of the Inquiry and Investigation Group) and the ratification of  the Majles in this regard before protesting the amount of the  budget of the organization.  <H3>  8. Advertisement Debtors and Other Debtors to the  Organization </H3>   A) Concerning the debt of persons and prepayments from about  a few years ago in accordance with a plan, these accounts were  examined by several groups and every month reports are made and  prepared and the necessary calculations are made to settle these  accounts, for which all the records are available and can be  presented. The debt of persons who have several relations with  the organization, especially those involved in the past regime,  have all been announced to the legal office of the organization  and necessary steps have been taken. Mainly due to lack of  access to these individuals or their property, in practice the  collection of the rights of the organization has not been  possible, and because considering them uncollectible and  eliminating them from the accounts is contrary to the protection  of the rights of the Treasury, so far they have remained in the  accounts as collectible debts to the organization. But  sufficient reserve has been taken into consideration for these  accounts.    Most of the cases that have been considered by the committee  under the heading of futile actions include such cases.    B) In regards to the advertising debts, prior to the  revolution, receiving advertisement in credit form was common in  the organization, and most of these debts are from before the  revolution. After the revolution, the broadcast of commercials  from television and radio stopped for some time, and later too  according to the instructions of the organization advertisements  were handled in cash in order to protect the rights of the  organization. In regards to the settlement of previous debts,  steps have been taken in coordination with the legal office of  the organization to collect the debts to the organization. A  number of advertising agencies have been bankrupt and their  owners of the companies have left the country. In regards to  debtors who have not been accessible, legal prosecution has been  made to collect their debts to the organization and results have  been achieved, the documents for which are available in the  financial affairs unit of the organization.    C) There are also instances that if the organization wants  to  bring a suit against them in the country or abroad, it would  have to spend more than what would be gained. Hence, if the  collection of the debts of these individuals is verified, the  appropriate foreign currency and rial budget must be placed at  the disposal of the organization.    D) In regards to the debt of the factories producing  television in the country, for fees on the rights of expansion,  the following are important.    In the law concerning the collection of fees from producers  of television reception sets, no special methods have been  projected to collect the debts of the companies as well as  late-payment penalties. Hence, at various Junectures in the  payment of the debt of these companies, considering the economic  situation and also financial shortages of these companies, which  are mostly under government control, a halt has been created.    In regards to the repayment of late and current debts of  these companies, the organization has been able to take steps to  retrieve its rights through special planning with the consent of  the management of these companies. The records of this matter  are in the financial offices of the organization.    Of course, if a company is unable to meet its obligations,  the issue is referred to legal authorities for legal claim,  examples of which are available in the legal office of the  organization. The last case of a suit was against Pars Electric  Company.    It should be explained that this organization could sue all  these companies, and in the event that the organization would  win the case, due to financial problems these companies had to  shut down and their factories, which would be sold in order for  the organization to be able to gain its rights. The organization  accepted the hardship of shortage of resources and the  statements in the report of the Inquiry and Investigation  Committee, but did not accept ignoring the rights of thousands  of the workers of the television manufacturing factories with  their closure for the sake of getting its own rights immediately.    Ultimately, the organization has made all its effort to  collect these debts in a manner that the numerous financial  pressures are not imposed on government companies and  subsequently their hard-working personnel.    E) The Inquiry and Investigation Group has criticized the  organization as to why the funds paid to the Central Bank are  included in the debit account of the Central Bank, whereas  according to accepted accounting principles, as long as the  Central Bank has not acted on its obligation in connection with  the request of the organization, it must be acted on in this way.    At the time the request of the organization is sent, the  equivalent of the issued check is included in the debit account  of the Central Bank. When the documents concerning the opening  of documented credit are delivered to the organization, the  equivalent of the amount is taken out of the current account of  the organization and transferred to the credit account of the  Central Bank.    F) The Telfilm Company is one example of debtors to the  organization. This company was established prior to the  revolution to produce films and has received a great deal of  property from the organization. Most of those involved in the  establishment of this company have escaped abroad since the  victory of the revolution, and the above-mentioned company has  practically gone bankrupt. The balances mentioned in 1368 [21  March 1989-20 March 1990] and 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991]  in the debit account of this company are the debts of those  involved in its establishment. In regards to retrieving the  rights of the organization, legal action has been taken.    G) The figure concerning the "release of work" of the  organization all stems from prior to the revolution. A major  part of the debt to the organization from this person was  collected after the revolution in cash, but he suddenly became a  fugitive and left the country. From the early years of the  revolution, a claim has been made in the Islamic Revolution  prosecutor's office of Iran.    It is noteworthy that the location of one of the warehouses  of the organizations that belong to him is under the control of  the organization. With the ruling of the court, the property  will become the organization's property toward the payment of  his debts to the organization, and it appears that thereby the  debt of the person will be collected.    H) The foreign currency and real debts of the honorable  director of the organization are due to the prepayment of extra  pay for assessment and foreign currency revolving funds, and  their rial equivalent concern the purchase of coins to be given  as gifts to the personnel of the organization. Even though the  nature of these payments must not be regarded as his debt, it  has been done in this way for accounting purposes. Most of the  debts referred to in the inquiry and investigation report have  been included in the expenditures account upon the receipt of  the assignment report as well as positive documentation in this  connection, and the remainder of the documents also have been  presented to the Financial Affairs Office and are in the process  of being recorded in the books.    Of course, other colleagues also have similar debts to the  organization. But it seems that the Inquiry and Investigation  Committee, with ill intent, has tried to blow this issue out of  proportion.    I) In regards to the check issued to the Physical Education  organization, it must be announced that this check was issued  upon the order of authorized officials of the organization for  the purchase of land from the Physical Education organization  and placed at the disposal of the Legal office of the  organization to sign the contract. But because the Physical  Education organization refused to accept the contract, the check  was returned to the Financial Affairs office of the  organization, and according to document No. 2858, dated 07/06/71  [29 August 1993], it has been returned from the related accounts.    It can be seen that the date of the investigation by the  Inquiry and Investigation Group is after the above-mentioned  date.    Hence the question in this regard was improper and because  of  lack of familiarity by the Inquiry and Investigation Committee  with financial issues, they were obliged to merely use the  report of the organization, which was prepared earlier, and have  therefore made an error.    J) In regards to the collection of debts from some former  manager and officials of radio and television, legal action has  been taken and the ruling of the court in this regard has also  been issued. But in the court it has been said that the  organization must investigate to see if they have land or  property in Iran in order to issue the ruling based on its  confiscation. In this connection, too, the organization has  employed all its efforts.  <H5>  9. Purchase of Cars From the West of the Country </H5>   When the opportunity to purchase cars from the west of the  country arose and the officials and the related organizations  gave permission to do so, the Voice and Vision organization  also, like many government organizations, made an effort to  purchase heavy and light vehicles needed for itself and  affiliated companies. In this regard, after coordination with  the center of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of  Iran in Sanandaj, the permission for purchase was obtained  through the office of the governor-general of Kurdistan.  Considering the unusual procedures for their purchase, the  auditor of the organization was assigned by the administrative  and financial affairs deputy director to receive the revolving  funds and, along with two purchasing officials and experts, to  be sent there. This was done and after two or three days and  going to the Marivan border the task was coordinated, and after  giving the revolving funds to the purchasing officials, he  returned.    Concerning the purchased vehicles, which include light and  heavy vehicles, no personal use has taken place and the Inquiry  and Investigation Committee, by presenting a false report and  without a meeting with the director of the general accounting of  this organization and quoting him, has announced that two of the  vehicles were for the personal use of the auditor and the  administrative and financial deputy director. The reason for the  revolving funds account not being settled was merely due to the  existing problems in licensing the vehicles.    The reason for the deposit of the funds in the account of  the  purchasing official was because the Voice and Vision  organization did not have a bank account in Marivan. Because of  the danger in carrying out cash from Sanandaj to Marivan, the  organization decided to open an account in the name of the  purchasing official in Marivan. Considering the above  statements, the falsity of the information by the Inquiry and  Investigation Committee in the following areas can be proven.    1) The administrative and financial affairs deputy director  of the organization was never sent on assignment in this regard.    2) The Inquiry and Investigation Committee never met with  the  director of general accounting of the organization and falsified  information from him.    3) None of the cars were employed for personal use. They  were  not placed at the disposal of the auditor and the administrative  and financial affairs deputy director of the organization.  <H3>  10. Payment of Loans to Employees in the Voice and Vision  Organization </H3>   At the present time in the Voice and Vision organization of  the Islamic Republic of Iran loans are granted from two sources.    10.1.) The Savings Fund for Employees, which is provided  with  2 percent of the employees' share and 6 percent of the  organization share and is administered under the supervision of  a board of trustees. Maximum loan paid from this fund is 120,000  tomans.    10.2) The Retirement Fund, which is funded by 8-percent  share  of employees and 16-percent share of the organization and is  administered under the supervision of the board of trustees of  the retirement fund. This fund only grants loans for the  procurement and repair of housing and the marriage of employees.  The maximum loan from it is 500,000 tomans.    The inquiry and investigation reporter has pointed out that  in the Voice and Vision loans are paid from several sources, but  no reference is made to its legal obstacles. Not only has the  organization in no law or regulations been prevented from this  action, but it has paid loans on the basis of the ratification  of the Supervisory Council.    Loans paid in the Voice and Vision are paid in accordance  with the laws and regulations to official and contract employees  and if the borrower is unable to pay the installments of his  loan on time, the installments will be collected from the  guarantor. Apparently, this matter was criticized by the Inquiry  and Investigation Committee as to why no steps are taken to  collect the rights of the related fund from the guarantor, and  the group has offered no solution in this area.  <H5>  11. Withdrawal From Retirement Fund Deposits </H5>   In regards to the payment of loan from Retirement Fund  deposits, the issue was examined. The official of the retirement  fund said that he was not officially contacted and the  information referred to in the report has been placed at the  disposal of the committee by individuals who were not  responsible.    In any case, the payment of loans from the Retirement Fund  to  the organization has been done on the basis of the regulations  of the fund through the board of trustees and their approval,  and there is no legal prohibition.    Also, the organization has taken steps to repay the loan in  question on time.    Other instances stated in the Inquiry and Investigation  Committee report concerning the Retirement Fund lack any basis  or documented evidence.  <H5>  12. Assignments Abroad </H5>   The Inquiry and Investigation Group claims that Voice and  Vision assignments abroad were not related to its duties and  mission, whereas the existing information and figures in the  organization indicate that almost all the assignments abroad by  the organization have been in connection with news coverage of  political events, news coverage of the visits of national  officials, participation in technical and international  conferences, testing and delivery of purchase transmitters and  equipment from abroad, production of programs abroad, and  carrying out training assignments for the personnel, and so on.    Elsewhere, the sending of the head of the general affairs of  programs with a group sent abroad to purchase programs has been  criticized by the Inquiry and Investigation Committee. Usually,  in the purchasing group, a representative of the legal office  and a representative of the financial division for examining the  contents of the contracts and ensuring the conformity to the  laws and regulations must be sent. The [director of] general  affairs for programs on this trip was sent on an assignment as  the financial affairs representative of the organization. Due to  severe financial shortages and cutbacks in expenditures, the  Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran has sometimes  been forced not to send these two representatives, although  legally in sending a group for purchases the legal and financial  representatives of the organization must be present.  <H5>  13. The List of Banking Discrepancies </H5>   The existence of banking discrepancies between the accounts  of every organization and bank statements is inevitable. For  this reason, one of the accounting statements that is prepared  at the end of every month by the financial affairs unit of the  organizations is called the "list of banking discrepancies." In  other words, after comparing the accounts of the organization  and the bank statement, the discrepancies are identified and  steps are taken to correct them.    This tactic is done every month by each of the independent  accounting offices and for each current account, and steps are  taken to eliminate the discrepancies as much as possible.    In regards to the claims concerning failure to give issued  checks to concerned individuals, it must be announced that this  claim is a pure lie, because one of the positive evidences of  this kind of documents is the receiver of the check. If in a  list the signature of the receiver of the fund or check does not  exist, the accounting document of payment is not issued, but the  total amount is put in the credit account of the individual.    The Inquiry and Investigation Committee has not even  presented one example in its report to prove this claim.  <H5>  14. The Account of the General Treasury </H5>   In regards to the balance of the account of the General  Treasury at the end of 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] in the  amount of 21,009,790 rials, it must be said that the balance of  this account on one date can only indicate the balance remainder  of the account on that day, and this balance does not show  failure to deposit the revenues of the organization.  Unfortunately, the reporter has lacked financial expertise and,  resorting to this balance, has announced that the revenues of  the organization have not been deposited in the accounts of the  Treasury, whereas the revenues of the organization have been  deposited in the related accounts of the Treasury, then,  presenting the request for funds from the General Treasury for  some of the needed financial resources of the organization, a  withdrawal has been made from these accounts.    Considering what is stated, the balance figure in the  above-mentioned account by no means shows failure to deposit the  revenues of the organization.  <H3>  15. Carrying Out Postponed Affairs and Payment for  Additional Work </H3>   In various parts of the report of the Inquiry and  Investigation Committee, certain criticism is made of postponed  and unsettled accounts.    As was announced earlier, about five years earlier, despite  the shortage of personnel and problems in not absorbing forces  due to the failure to pay adequate salaries to the expert  financial forces, by making use of the existing personnel, the  work on examining the postponed accounts began. All the records  and related reports in this connection are available in the  financial affairs office of the organization. Hence, it seems  that carrying out this task, that is, investigation of the  postponed accounts, considering the criticism of the Inquiry and  Investigation Committee concerning failure to do so in numerous  cases in the report requires commendation, not questioning.    Undoubtedly, this case, too, has been cited by individuals  who have themselves had job and behavior-related problems in the  Financial Affairs office of the organization, which,  unfortunately, has been reflected in the report of the committee  precisely.    In connection with the payment of overtime, it must be  mentioned that overtime in the Voice and Vision organization is  essentially calculated and paid on the basis of a time card.  Even in cases in 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] to 1368, due  to the shortage of funds there was no possibility of paying  overtime, which the organization employees deserved. (The  records are available.)    Payments of overtime in the organization have been carried  out in accordance with the laws, regulations, and internal  bylaws of the organization.  <H5>  16. Revolving Funds </H5>   The revolving funds of the organization are mainly related  to  the representative offices abroad. Due to the continuation of  their activities, the balance of these offices will never be  zero at the end of the year. Funds that are transferred to the  representative offices of the organization abroad are all  recorded in the revolving fund account of the manager of the  office and the equivalent in foreign currency for the documents  delivered is sent to the representative office by the manager of  the office. Hence, the revolving fund of the managers of the  offices will never reach zero, unless a new person is appointed  in his place. In this case, after examination and auditing the  inventory and giving it over to the new official, the balance is  transferred into the account of the new manager.    As it has been announced in the report of the Inquiry and  Investigation Committee, in some cases, with the written  permission of the auditor of the organization, payment of  revolving funds over 500,000 rials is also permitted. Hence, all  the revolving funds are paid with the permission of the auditor  of the organization or agents of the auditor in Tehran and the  provincial centers, and there is no legal prohibition in this  regard.  <H5>  17. The Fund and Its Evaluation </H5>   The nature of the work of the cashier and numerous accounts  receivable and accounts payable in the course of a day, week, or  month makes the existence of account discrepancies inevitable,  and for this reason the cashiers are [extended] extra pay to  make up for the shortage of cash.    In the Voice and Vision organization, only in a small number  of units (considering the nature of their work) is permission  given to have a fund, and most payments are made with bank  drafts.    The accounts of each of the cashiers at various Junectures  are examined and counted by the evaluation and financial affairs  activities group of the organization, and the shortages of funds  are included in the debit account of the cashier and deducted  from his salary. Hence, the expression of opinion in this  regard, stating that the accounts of the cashiers are never  evaluated and audited, is a pure fabrication. (The periodic  evaluations and audits of cashiers are available in the [office  of] Financial Affairs of the organization.)    In very rare cases, considering the volume of the activities  of the cashier, the accuracy of his actions and reports of the  financial affairs activities evaluation of the organization,  within the possible resources, approved funds may be provided as  aid for the cashier's deficit, upon the approval of the proper  authorities of the organization.  <H5>  18. Other Cases </H5>   Health payments of the organization are handled on the basis  of the health regulations of the organization. In some cases,  because the patient does not have the ability to pay his share,  with a social aid report and the approval of a three-member  committee on this matter and ultimately the approval of the  proper authorities of the organization, his share can be  provided from the aid budget of the organization, instances of  which do not even exceed 1 percent of patients.    Advances for employees in an organization with more than  14,000 permanent and temporary personnel are inevitable, and  such prepayments and their procedures are as follows.    Salary advances. Considering the issue of advances, they are  either deposited all at once after the establishment of the  salary of the new personnel from what is owed him or in  installments (usually within a maximum period of one year) and  deducted from the employee's salary.    Assignment advances. Such advances are deposited all at once  from the debit account of the official after the assignment  report is presented.    Payment of loans to employees who have no employment  (official or contractual) relations is impossible and contrary  to the regulations and internal bylaws of the organization.  Hence, the mere claim that it has happened does not prove it to  be true. Obviously, for every (qualified) individual to whom the  organization grants a loan, in accordance with the regulations,  he must present a person as his guarantor. Naturally, the  responsibilities of the guarantor are clear in terms of the laws  and regulations.    The organization is asked why others to whom the  organization  has debt have not come to collect.    As to why a person to whom money is owed has not come to the  organization to collect it, it is not the problem of the Voice  and Vision organization and its financial affairs to respond.    [11 Nov pp 10, 14]    [Text] Following the publication of two parts of the Voice  and Vision response to the critical report of the Inquiry and  Investigation Group of the Majles, now we publish the third and  final part of this report for our dear readers.  <H5>  Labor Force Report </H5>   In connection with the labor force, the Inquiry and  Investigation Group writes:    "The quantitative and qualitative presence of the  prerevolutionary cadre and lack of basic change in the body of  the Voice and Vision" [sentence as published].    The group continues: "The Voice and Vision is a center with  about 14,000 personnel, most of whom have remained in place from  the past regime. Despite the fact that, like other  organizations, it has been purged, the composition of the major  part of the organization has not essentially changed. Even the  absorption of Hezbollah elements, due to the governing climate,  has not been able to create fundamental change, and they have  either become dependent on the governing climate, have changed,  or have chosen to be silent."    Voice and Vision response: First, the Voice and Vision in  letter No. M/2300/633/5160, dated 13/08/1371 [4 November 1992],  had sent the personnel information (list of individuals who left  the organization from 1358 [21 March 1979-20 March 1980] and a  list of those who have been hired from 1360 [21 March 1981-20  March 1982] to that date) to the Inquiry and Investigation Group.    Second, after the victory of the Islamic revolution:    About 2,328 people, due to ideological affiliations or lack  of the necessary moral and political qualifications for service  in the Voice and Vision, have been dismissed from the  organization and about 1,844 have been honored by retirement or  left the system due to disability or other problems. In other  words, about 4,200 persons have left the organization, and  during the same period the Voice and Vision organization has  hired about 7,500 full-time official and contractual and about  2,000 part-time employees.    In other words, of the total of about 14,500 present  employees, about 9,500 have been newly employed and about 5,000  are the former employees of the organization, and naturally the  new forces are all graduates of the schools, colleges, and  universities of the country after the victory of the revolution  or from the students of religious seminaries. Also, the  remainder of the forces from before the victory of the Islamic  revolution are all sincere, committed, Muslim forces, those  interested in the revolution and Islam, and those loyal to the  sacred regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who have served  and are serving Islam and the revolution.    Third, nearly all the officials of the regime unanimously  believe that those who have been ideologically and politically  affiliated with the previous regime have been purged in the  first few years after the victory of the Islamic revolution from  offices or have left the country and crawled into some corner.    In the 15th year of the victory of the Islamic revolution,  at  a sensitive Junecture when the country is undergoing a period of  construction and reconstruction, raising issues such as the  forces from before or after the revolution or the new and old  will have no results but to create disunity and conflicts in the  offices.    While so far every employee has been purged for whatever  reason for which he should have been purged and those who have  remained or those who have been absorbed after the victory of  the Islamic revolution by the offices are no different, they  have been and are all servants of the people and loyal to the  revolution, Islam, and the sacred regime of the Islamic Republic  of Iran.    The Inquiry and Investigation Group states in its report:  "The organization has 14,000 personnel, most of whom are left  over from the past regime."    Voice and Vision response: As was stated, about two-thirds  of  the employees of the organization are individuals who have  started working with the organization after the victory of the  revolution, and the claim of this group is contrary to the facts.    The Inquiry and Investigation Group in continuation, while  insulting the Hezbollah elements, writes: "The Hezbollah  elements have either become dependent on the climate, have  changed, or have chosen to remain silent!" It then continues:  "Among the managers, proper changes have been made, but  sometimes we witness the inappropriate activities of some of  these managers who have been influenced by the existing climate  in the organization."    Voice and Vision response: Considering what was said, about  two-thirds of the forces in the organization are forces from  after the victory of the Islamic revolution, and according to  the Inquiry and Investigation Group among the managers proper  changes have taken place.    Then, how can this contradiction be accepted, that a  minority  influences the majority in this way and has changed their ideas?    Indeed, why has the Inquiry and Investigation Group tried in  its report to weaken the, as it says itself, committed,  concerned Muslim managers and committed Muslim employees? Can it  not be believed that in this case, too, as in other cases, the  group has deviated from the position of impartiality and ignored  the facts?    But why have they not taken an oath on the Koran before God  to observe trust by relying on their honor?    The Inquiry and Investigation Group continues: "Old  elements,  due to their intellectual opposition to the Islamic regime and  the revolution, protect the interests of those in the same line,  too. In understanding this point, several examples are referred  to and in continuation they have reported a few examples that  are either untrue or, as they have said themselves, whose  occurrence was prevented by the management of the organization,  which, contrary to the claim of the group that says Hezbollah  elements or some of the managers were changed, proves the  sensitivity, decisiveness, and alertness of the committed  managers and employees of the organization.    For example, they have said: "Two of the hosts of the Voice  and Vision, despite their apparent justifiable appearance, have  misused their position to receive resources from the  organizations and after the exposure of a film from which their  immorality is revealed were dismissed and unfortunately rehired  in the Vision."    Voice and Vision response: These individuals have never  misused any organization and have devoted a significant  percentage of their lives on the fronts of the battle of truth  against falsehood. The film that is referred to was  participation in a wedding in which Islamic standards were not  observed. As was explained in the newspapers earlier, they have  never been dismissed from the organization because they had not  committed any crime that would deserve their being fired.    Or it has been said that in the program "Friday Morning," a  host of the program has been invited who has had relations with  SAVAK agents, or they have invited a showman from the tyrant's  time and the director of the organization has prevented his  entry. The first is untrue and the second shows the sensitivity  and alertness of the management.    They have shown sensitivity towards one of the actors in the  serial, "Primrose," which was explained earlier.    They have said: They have purchased a film and because it  was  antireligious have stopped its broadcast. We do not know if the  criticism is due to the preventing of the broadcast and the  alertness of the officials of this medium or something else.    They have said: An interview was broadcast with a Sunni  cleric who, it was later revealed, has had problems. Not knowing  about everyone or the future of others is something obvious, and  when it was investigated by the proper authorities, it became  clear that there had been an error, not ill intentions. They  have said: One of the news anchormen did not read the news of  the death of the Imam and another read it emotionally, but what  they have not said is that the first person was so upset because  of this great loss that no matter how he tried, because of his  great love for the Imam, he could not read it, rather than "not  wanting to read it." And they have said that Mr. Hayati, who  read it, was ridiculed and scolded by his colleagues. This is a  pure lie.    They have said: In the program "Friday Morning," the Prophet  was insulted." They have mentioned an example that has never  been broadcast from the radio. The broadcast from the radio was,  "A person claimed to be God. He was told someone has claimed to  be a Prophet. He said, I did not send him." (A similar story is  mentioned in martyr Motahhari's book.)    And similar to such issues, which are either rare or the  reverse or show the sensitivity of the managers, we must say  that in regard to some of these cases that have actually  occurred, when they have been investigated it has been decided  that there has never been ill intent, but the result of an  error, and that, moreover, the management of the organization  has dealt with the error appropriately at the time. This is an  issue that is mentioned in the Inquiry and Investigation Group's  report explicitly and in some cases not explicitly.    In another part of the report, the group indicates  sensitivity to the serial "Ra'na."    The audience of the Voice and Vision remember well that the  serial "Ra'na" is one of the serials that beautifully shows  certain parts of the Islamic revolution, in particular the  constructive effect of the Islamic revolution and the Hezbollah  on a stratum which paid no attention to the issues of the  revolution or in families in which there were people who were  afraid of the buried regime of the shah.    So, at the end of the serial "Ra'na," the young educated  girls of this family choose the "chador" as their veil and also  some of the women of this family and men who have given up their  previous way of life return to the bosom of Islam and the  revolution. In the opinion of the officials of the Voice and  Vision, this serial was an actual example of what the late Imam  said concerning the mission of the Voice and Vision: "The Voice  and Vision is a nationwide public university."    Which university can, while filling the leisure hours of the  people, show the history of the revolution and create internal  change in its students or audience?    It is not clear to us why the Inquiry and Investigation  Group, despite what the Imam said concerning the responsibility  of the Voice and Vision, repeating frequently that the Voice and  Vision must work for the revolution and Islam, has divided the  programs in its fabricated categorization, "in connection with  Islam and the revolution as indifferent, neutral and deviant,"  when they have given examples and showed their negative  sensitivity mainly to programs that were endorsed by the late  Imam, the grand leader, the high-ranking officials, and the  Muslim and Hezbollah nation or programs that have exposed the  crimes of the criminal Americans, the usurping Zionists or  deceptive and disgraced British.    Here it is necessary to point out that, as the officials of  the Voice and Vision have announced frequently from the mass  media, including the Voice and Vision, we have never believed  and do not believe that no mistakes were made in the programs of  the Voice and Vision or that nothing has occurred contrary to  other people's tastes, because in an organization that annually  produces and broadcasts more than 90,000 hours of radio and  television programs to the farthest areas of the country, there  are not only errors, but it is also impossible for all the  programs to be accepted and not criticized by people with  various tastes.    Various and numerous statistics and polls show that most of  the criticism of the programs of the Voice and Vision is due to  different tastes, because the audience of the Voice and Vision  ranges from two-year-old children to the oldest members of the  society and from the illiterate to the most learned, in short,  all the strata and people in the society, as well as beyond the  borders, audiences who have different intellectual, political,  and social backgrounds.    Hence, differences of opinion and taste concerning the  programs of the Voice and Vision are obvious, natural, and  normal. What is important is that during the 12 years of service  of the present managers of the organization, the general  direction of the programs not only has been in line with Islam,  the revolution, and the Islamic values of the society, but has  had a consistent movement towards improvement and reform. With  the special attention and continuous and sincere supervision of  the late Imam during his blessed and history-making life and now  the grand leader, the pious successor of the late Imam, the  officials of the Voice and Vision have always been able to  correct any error that may have occurred, though rarely, on time  and to deal with it.    Concerning the leaning of the Satellite Building, which  resulted in its destruction and that of much of the satellite  equipment, it must be said: Based on the report of qualified  technical experts, damage to this building was the result of an  earthquake with a vertical strike... With this logic, the  Gilan and Zanjan earthquake is also probably blamed on the  managers of the Voice and Vision in those provinces.    And for this reason they have always been endorsed by the  late Imam and the grand leader of the Islamic revolution, some  of which are pointed out here:    1) The late Imam, on 17/12/1370 [8 March 1992] in an  audience  granted to the general manager and the technical and expansion  employees of the radio and television network of the Voice and  Vision organization, said: "You young people succeeded in  shattering the false beliefs."    2) On 15 Mordad 1361 [7 August 1982], when one year had  passed in the service of the present managers of the Voice and  Vision, in a meeting with the general manager and officials of  various divisions of the Voice and Vision, while emphasizing the  necessity and importance of reforming the Voice and Vision, he  said: "I kept repeating this matter to the individuals who were  in charge of these affairs and are at the top of this issue, but  later it became clear that they were improper people. They kept  making excuses that they are busy with it and are correcting it  and it cannot be done and so on. But now, thank God, we see that  it is being done, and we hope that with the efforts of this  honorable gentleman, `Mr. Rafsanjani,' and the brother of `Mr.  Rafsanjani,' God willing, the problems will be corrected and  these two brothers, God willing, will serve Islam and its  friends. This one in propaganda and the other in everything." In  conclusion, addressing all those present, he said, "I ask God  Almighty for your health and prosperity and thank you for your  hard work and hope you work even harder, work for Islam. We who  are from God must use our time for God..."    In the events of 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] of the  Voice and Vision organization, the Imam, God rest his soul, once  again declared his trust in the management of the Voice and  Vision.    His honor, in his blessed letter dated 4 Tir 1364 [25 June  1985], wrote:    In the name of God, the compassionate and the merciful.    Contrary to expectations, in the Voice and Vision of the  Islamic Republic conflicts occurred that caused concern.  Consequently, I appoint Mr. Mohammad Hashemi as my  representative to take charge of the responsibilities as the  general manager of the Voice and Vision, so that this large  organization will not be without a director; and because the  honorable Supervisory Council has some concerns and some of them  have written to me, and also Mr. Hashemi has some concerns, it  is necessary for the honorable president, the honorable head of  the Supreme Court, the honorable speaker of the Majles, and the  honorable prime minister to examine the issues of both sides  without the slightest connivance, and make the final decision.  It is necessary to mention that it has been heard that some in  my household have done some things contrary to my wishes or  without informing me. Because this matter is untrue, the person  saying such things must repent before God. 4 Tir 1362 [25 June  1983], Ruhollah Khomeyni    Also, at every juncture and opportunity, the late Imam,  while  expressing contentment with the programs of the Voice and Vision  and emphasizing more effort by the managers and officials,  offered destiny-making directives. Finally, on 29 Azar 1366 [20  December 1987], when a number of people were trying to show the  programs of the organization as without content, contrary to  religious law, unsuitable, etc., this wise sage who always  profoundly supervised the programs of this organization said:  "Watching such films and plays has no religious problems and  many of them are instructive and their broadcast is also no  problem and in the same way the music is for the most part no  problem. Sometimes, on occasion, violations are seen, so more  care must be taken."    And here to be offered is an implemental directive: "Those  who put on makeup must be among those who are not legally  allowed to marry the person; a foreigner is prohibited from  doing this."    "Makeup" is an implemental issue, but when the Imam was  asked  how he noticed this problem, he responded: I watched the credits  of the program (the word credits is ours, he said a sentence  that referred to credits), and sometimes there are men or women  actors but there is no mention of the makeup person of the same  sex. Of course, most often it is given. Nevertheless, I made a  remainder that if "a person is potentially legally allowed to  marry the other, it is prohibited."    This point shows that the late Imam carefully paid attention  to the activities of the officials of the Voice and Vision and  when he would see a violation, he would mention and announce it.  Hence, in Azar 1366 [22 November-21 December 1987] he announced:  "The showing of none of the programs is problematic in terms of  religious law and also sports films as well as songs are mostly  no problem. Sometimes violations are seen, though rarely, so  more care must be taken."    This letter by the Imam is a strong endorsement of the  activities of the officials of the Voice and Vision for seven  years and shows the constant and profound supervision of that  late wise sage, the maker of history and founder of the sacred  regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran, during his blessed life.    As has been stated in the report of the Inquiry and  Investigation Group, the grand leader of the Islamic revolution,  too, from 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] to now, "has made  14 reminders to the officials of the Voice and Vision in  connection with the programs of the Voice and Vision."    The reminders of his reverence are also another indication  of  the constant and wise supervision of the grand leader of the  Islamic revolution, the pious successor to the late Imam. The  officials of the Voice and Vision, as they did during the Imam's  life, who made every effort to eliminate the problems that were  pointed out by his honor and in this way were able to receive  the full endorsement of this wise sage for almost all of their  programs.    [Paragraphing as published] now too use their best efforts  to  eliminate the problems that are mentioned in the reminders and  wise directives of the grand leader and have taken steps in  every instance which thank God have been accepted by him. We ask  God Almighty for help to be able to sincerely and fully  implement his profound directives and in our actions gain the  contentment of God Almighty, God willing.  <H5>  Management of the Organization </H5>   Then the Inquiry and Investigation Group in continuing the  report deals with the management of the organization and first  says: "Although the managers and cultural directors of the Voice  and Vision are well-known cultural figures in the country and at  the lower levels too committed and concerned managers are the  majority especially in various groups of Networks 1 and 2, the  question arises as to why the criticism and protest in regards  to the programs of the Voice and Vision are increasing?"    Voice and Vision response: First, the managers of the Voice  and Vision, on all levels and in all units, including the Voice  and Vision, all the deputy directors' offices, headquarter  units, provincial centers, offices abroad, and service and  logistics units, have been and are without exception religious,  committed, concerned, active Muslims, loyal to the sacred regime  of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    It is necessary here to make a delicate point. When the  Inquiry and Investigation Group came to the General Security  office to investigate the managers of the organization and asked  for the files of the managers, the director general of security  placed 150 volumes of files of the managers at their disposal.  They began to leaf through them and examine them. When the  brilliant history, high education, and especially the volunteer  work and active and unassuming presence of 136 senior managers  of the organization at the fronts of the battle of truth against  falsehood during the imposed war was seen, one of the members of  the Inquiry and Investigation Group became extremely despondent  and kicked the files and said: What sort of records are these  that you are showing me? Are you ridiculing us? He then left the  room angrily.    In connection with financial misuse and moral corruption,  the  director of security has said: I cannot make up documents as you  demand. So the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group  became very angry and then the security file placed at their  disposal was thrown in some corner.    The director general of security became very astonished at  this reaction of a member of the group. Why should a deputy of  the Majles be so upset by the active presence of the senior  managers of a sensitive organization of the country on the war  fronts?    Have these managers, who on the one hand have worked day and  night on the most important propaganda front of the country at  the same time used every opportunity to build themselves and  repledge with the combatants of the military front against  falsehood, have hurried towards them, and have even been proud  of doing manual work and any sort of support, caused such  reactions in a deputy of the people, even though they have  hurried to the front as unknown soldiers to pay their debt on  the basis of religious duty and to build themselves in the  spiritual circles of the combatants on the front line and their  reward is with their beloved [God] and nothing else? What is the  meaning of this reaction of a member of the Inquiry and  Investigation Group?    We remember precisely that when the late Imam instructed  going to the front, as the committed managers and employees of  this organization declared their readiness and registered  hastily for the path of their beloved, there was fear of  stoppage and closure of many of the units of this organization.  Hence, we had to ask the Imam for instructions, and his honor  said to the officials of this medium, especially those who serve  in sensitive positions, that they should remain at their jobs  and carry out their duties, for this is also a very great duty.    Continuing the discussion about the present management, the  Inquiry and Investigation Group has regretted the fact in the  introduction of which it has praised the managers and in the  following pages tries to destroy the managers, and for that  matter, with accusations for almost all of which they present no  evidence, except probably what they have heard through "tangible  and intangible ways." Below we refer to some and briefly respond  to them.    1) They write: "Tyrannical artists, in order to prevent the  spread of Islamic culture, have revealed themselves to the  managers and, until some time ago they had convinced everyone  that Islamic cover, that is, the chador, causes technical  problems in front of the camera."    First, this is a pure lie, because since the early days of  the revolution hundreds, even thousands, of programs,  interviews, and reports in which women with chadors have been  present have been produced and broadcast, which have been  witnessed by everyone from the Vision.    Second, Islamic cover is not only the chador. Islam has  restrictions and limits regarding women's covering, which  clearly all the religious jurists by interpreting the Koran have  explained in the scholarly dissertations and other religious  jurisprudent and Islamic sources. For the informed people it is  clear that Islamic covering is not only the "chador"; any form  of cover that provides religious covering for women on the basis  of the standards of the sacred religious law is Islamic covering.    2) They say: "In the foreign unit of the Voice and Vision,  weak management has caused individuals even from the embassies  to operate the foreign unit, some of whom have even been spies."    Here, too, as in many other instances, they have also lied  about the foreign unit and the committed Muslim forces of other  countries who serve the sacred regime of the Islamic Republic in  this unit without any document or evidence. Unfortunately, due  to considerations of the interests of the country and this group  of colleagues, we cannot give any more explanation about them,  and these dear ones are even "oppressed" in our response. God  willing, under more suitable conditions we will be able to  introduce them.    3) They have said that the manager of one of the units has  made a case against four Hezbollah elements last year and  presented it to the Violations Court. The crime of the Hezbollah  elements was protesting the illegitimate relationship between  several employees and one employee.    Voice and Vision response: This issue too, like other cases,  is a pure lie. No such record exists in the Violations Committee  [as published], and we do not know how, if the Inquiry and  Investigation Committee believes in Islamic morality, it can  accuse several people of having "illegitimate relations" with  one person without investigation and proof. Is the publication  of such untrue instances not spreading of debauchery? Is it not  a crime punishable from a judicial perspective? Should not the  honorable officials of the Judicial Branch investigate such  crimes immediately and punish the spreaders of debauchery? God  willing, it will be so.    4) They write: "A person who, because of relations with  deviant individuals, has been dismissed from the institution (it  has not been stated which institution) and then arrested and has  had conflicts with Hezbollah individuals is now the manager of  the Voice and Vision of one of the provinces.    To back this claim, the group has not given the slightest  information from any authority to this organization, and hence  it is a pure lie.    5) They have written: The manager of one of the offices  abroad, apparently propagates deviant ideas and criticizes the  ideas of martyr Motahhari...    We neither know anything about him nor the sources of  information that they have given (the same intangible source  which was mentioned), and again it is a pure lie.    6) Without presenting any evidence, they have claimed that  financial misuse occurs in the serials. If only they could send  us even one document or one example.    7) They have said: In 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991],  the  property of the Voice and Vision was stolen and after  investigation it was found that the related manager had a hand  in it. The issued ruling about the related manager who was  supported by the director of the organization was not carried  out but the secondary elements were dismissed and the related  manager was dismissed respectfully after a long time for moral  corruption.    Voice and Vision response: In this case, we need to explain  more than the previous cases:    A) The manager who is mentioned is among the employees who  has been known for his commitment and being a Muslim from before  the victory of the revolution, and in Bahman 1357 [21 January-19  February 1979] during the arrival of the Imam in the country,  despite the opposition of the radio and television organization  at the time, by using a mobile television unit, directly  broadcast the ceremonies of the arrival and the welcoming of the  Imam of the people. As the Islamic nation knows, the broadcast  of these ceremonies was cut off from the Voice and Vision  center, but he provided the pictures for one of the most  important events of the Islamic world in motion.    B) In the Refah School, the residence of the Imam, he was  given an important assignment to create the revolution  television channel and directly broadcast the meetings of the  Imam with another dear engineer, who in the organization was a  student friend of martyr Raja'i and most favored by him, and  during the first term of his premiership and presidency was one  of the trustees of martyr Raja'i and cooperated with him. He is  now the deputy director of the organization. In the inquiry and  investigation report he has been the target of much exaggerated  unkindness! And every unfair slander for which they have not  found a source is ascribed to him.    C) Among the other activities of this manager, when the  missile attacks on Tehran began and it was decided to keep the  schools closed and for the television to produce and broadcast  school programs, he accepted this grave responsibility and  during the above-mentioned time produced and broadcast  educational programs for schools without leaving the  organization, which was one of the vital centers and a target of  Saddam's supporters for a while.    [D)] During the years of the imposed war, he went to the  front line frequently and organized numerous reports.    E) At the time the late Imam passed away and during the  anniversary of these ceremonies, he made every possible effort  to carry on these ceremonies in a most appropriate manner.    F) In the Hajj ceremonies this year, he broadcast via  international satellite from inside Saudi Arabia the ceremonies  of the exemption of the infidels most skillfully, intelligently,  and cleverly, which is beautifully characteristic of a committed  Muslim.    First, the Government of Saudi Arabia denied the exemption  of  infidels, but when its pictures were broadcast on most of the  world televisions, including the Islamic Republic, they were  forced to confess.    The broadcast of these ceremonies from world television  angered the rulers of Saudi Arabia and caused the joy of  hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world, including the  Muslim people of our country.    As the group has pointed out, in 1369 [21 March 1990-20  March  1991] the organization learned that one of the cameras of the  organization was put on sale in a store on one of the streets in  Tehran.    The director of the organization requested that the public  prosecutor of Tehran help find the perpetrators and return the  property of the organization.    With the help of the Tehran public prosecutor, the elements  were identified and the stolen property was all returned.    Because the above-mentioned manager was also a suspect, he  was introduced to the prosecutor's office and his case was  examined in the prosecutor's office. But the cases of the rest  of the individuals who were official or part-time employees of  the organization were examined by the administrative violations  unit of the organization and, appropriate to their crimes, the  rulings were issued and carried out. But the above-mentioned  manager was acquitted in the court and was obliged to pay 50,000  tomans. At this time, some of the mediating elements who were  affiliated with some political currents or some particular  persons in the organization as well, protested the issued  ruling. The Supreme Court revoked the ruling and the case was  sent to another branch for reexamination. In the second court,  also, the innocence of this manager was proven, and with a  reduction in payment to 10,000 tomans, the case was closed. It  is interesting that the camera of the organization was also  returned earlier by the prosecutor's office.    The officials of the related court observed in the file that  the director of the organization has complained about him and  requested the organization to declare its opinion considering  the present situation of the case. The director of the  organization in a letter announced that the organization has no  complaint due to fully retrieving the rights of the  organization, the case was closed, and the bail documents have  been released.    Other instances of which he is accused in the report are  merely accusations and have not been proven by any authority. He  has not even been dismissed for one moment from the organization  or his responsibility and continues to serve the organization  most sincerely and with continuous effort. Even because of his  skills and sincerity, he has been requested for assistance  during his leisure time by one of the very sensitive  organizations of the country, and this organization, because of  its respect for that organization, has agreed to the  above-mentioned request. At the present time, in addition to  carrying out his previous responsibilities in the organization  he spends his leisure time, unofficial time, and even holidays  working in the other organization.    In the Hajj ceremonies this year, due to the significant  efforts in the intolerable heat of Saudi Arabia and because of  service to the world of Islam in sending the pictures of the  ceremonies of exemption of infidels via international satellite,  he was commended by the representative of the grand leader and  the supervisor of Iranian Hajj pilgrims.    Now, why the Inquiry and Investigation Group has shown such  sensitivity towards him and another engineer in the organization  (educational deputy director, with a brief description of his  services, which was mentioned) and reported untruth is unclear  to us.    After the publication of the report of the Inquiry and  Investigation Group, those who stir up trouble have called from  here and there saying, "You deserve what you get, go ahead and  work as hard as you can for this regime!"    In the continuation of the report, the Inquiry and  Investigation Group discusses the security situation of the  Voice and Vision and raises issues that again, like most of the  other instances, are accusations and even pure lies or  concerning what, for reasons of consideration for the interests  of the country and security, we cannot give any explanation. We  only refer to one point, which indicates the proper and strong  activities of the security unit of the organization, which is,  despite the hostility of the enemies towards this sensitive  center and despite the fact that in every conspiracy against the  regime that has been discovered, the destruction and occupation  of the Voice and Vision as one of the vital centers of the  country has been among the primary targets of the conspirators,  under the auspices of the alertness and active and  self-sacrificing presence of the security forces of the  organization, thank God, so far none of the conspiracies of the  enemies have succeeded in regards to this organization and have  all beem stifled and neutralized in their embryonic stages.    In this connection, we find it necessary to thank and praise  the unknown soldiers of the Imam of the Age.    The Inquiry and Investigation Group in the continuation of  the report examines and compares the laws of the organization  with the statements of the grand leader and says:  "Unfortunately, the instructions and directives of his honor  have not been implemented." And then it refers to the following  few instances.    A) In a decree appointing Mr. Mohammad Hashemi as the  director of the organization, he was asked to rapidly prepare a  bill concerning the administration of the Voice and Vision and  present it to the government and the Majles for ratification. So  far, it has not been done.    Voice and Vision response: The above-mentioned bill was  prepared and presented to the government at the first  opportunity and the government also in its committee on bills  examined and prepared it to be sent to the honorable Majles. At  that time, some of the Majles deputies who had learned about the  content of the bill hurriedly prepared and offered a proposal  with a few signatures to the Majles and told us that in  accordance with the internal bylaws of the Majles, the proposal  that has been registered first is given priority and until six  months after the ratification, no other proposal can be  discussed.    Because the above-mentioned proposal was prepared hastily,  even after correction in the second round of discussions it was  ratified with some problems in the honorable Majles, but the  honorable Council of Guardians found some problems in it and  returned it to the Majles. The Majles refused to accept all the  problems and ultimately the proposal was sent to the Council for  the Discernment of Expediency. In the Council for the  Discernment of Expediency, the proposal was commended and to  some extent the problems were eliminated and it was announced  for implementation, and it is now being implemented in the  organization.    We do not know on the basis of which standards indeed they  have allowed themselves to make unjust and untrue accusations  against individuals. Are there no judicial punishments for these?    2) The Inquiry and Investigation Group has said that from  1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] to 1370 [21 March 1991-20  March 1992], in 14 instances the grand leader has made reminders  to the Voice and Vision concerning the programs, the most  important of which are:    A) Misleading and low quality of programs to be broadcast  abroad.    Voice and Vision response: Careful attention has been paid  to  the directives of his honor and the necessary steps have been  taken in order to avoid the particular instances that were  mentioned in regards to misleading. Also, vast efforts have been  made to increase the quality of the foreign Islamic intellectual  programs. In this connection, it should be mentioned that vast  cooperation with about 160 young, active, and virtuous seminary  students in Qom has begun and the grand leader is aware of this  action.    H) [Numbering as published] In regards to the broadcast of  blasphemous sentences concerning the Sire of the Pious, such as  "Allah, Our Sire, 'Ali," as you know, the poem is by Mowlavi and  the organization for the second broadcast of the song has  changed the praise to "Our Sir, Our Sire, 'Ali," and then issued  permission for its broadcast.    5) [as published] Showing actual persons in the role of the  infallible imams.    Voice and Vision response: In this case, the Inquiry and  Investigation Group has reported falsely, because such an  instance has not occurred on television. But the situation was  that in a play that was broadcast about his holiness, Imam  Mohammad Baqer, the face of the narrator, who was a companion of  the Imam, was designed very beautifully and brilliantly, which  created doubt for some people that the narrator was in the role  of an infallible one and hence they had written to the grand  leader. His honor mentioned the matter to the organization and  naturally, because in this case actual persons had not appeared  in the role of the infallible ones, there was no problem.    F) [as published] Not broadcasting repeated sad films in  special cases, and the decree of his honor is implemented fully.    It can be seen that his honor, too, like his pious  predecessor, that is, the late Imam, continuously makes  reminders about any problem, even if it is "one sentence," to  the Voice and Vision, the total of which, as witnessed by the  Inquiry and Investigation Group from 1368 [21 March 1989-20  March 1990] to 1370 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] were 14  instances, the most important of which were quoted.    It is noteworthy that the Voice and Vision has made its  utmost effort to carry out the reminders and directives of his  honor in a most expedient manner. The fact that during this  period, the grand leader, with his precision and cultural,  religious, political, and social competence--and, as it was  said, he has not even ignored one sentence that was in  violation--shows that of course in personal meetings of the  officials, while giving them directives, he has also expressed  his contentment.    G) [as published] The Inquiry and Investigation Group in the  continuation of this section refers to the violation of the laws  and regulations of the organization by the director of the  organization and says: "According to the head of the Policy  Making Council, most of these ratifications are not announced to  the concerned units by the honorable director of the  organization." We doubt this to be the statement of the  honorable head of the Policy Making Council, because immediately  and regularly the copies of the announcements are sent to him.    Continuing the report, the group says, "In examining the  activities of the organization and their conformity with the  laws, as well, we come across problems that indicate  noncompliance with legal matters, and they are stated in  instances 2, 2 [sentence as published], 21, 23, 27, 30, 33, 45,  46, and 62." Because we do not know about these instances, we  cannot respond. But in considering the rest of the instances in  the report, it is certain that these numbers are only meant to  fill paper and serve as a sort of psychological war. The group  has referred to some instances of not observing some of the  articles of the charter of the Voice and Vision organization,    [Paragraphing in the original] which are contrary to facts,  because first, the general manager, when the Supervisory Council  existed presented the report of activities in accordance with  the regulations to the Supervisory Council. Whether the  Supervisory Council reported it to the Council of the heads of  the three branches or not does not concern the organization. The  number of the deputy director areas of the organization is six,  but the number of units that are under the authority of the  director decrease are combined as need be.    In regards to the Sirjan transmitters, it should be said  that  a detailed report was presented by the officials of the  organization during the visit of the deputies, to which the  deputies expressed their satisfaction in the location of the  transmitter station. However, in the report, the contrary is  stated.    In regards to the leaning of the Satellite Building which  resulted in its destruction and the moving of the satellite  equipment, it must be said:    Based on the report of qualified technical experts, the  damage to this building was due to an earthquake with a vertical  strike and if at any time this or similar earthquakes occur  anywhere, it will have similar financial and human casualties.  Hence, it is not clear why the group blames the officials of the  Voice and Vision even in natural disasters. Of course, under  this pretext, the Inquiry and Investigation Group has made  unjust accusations against the educational deputy director of  the organization, who at that time was the deputy carrying out  the developmental projects of the Voice and Vision organization.  With this logic, no doubt the managers of the Voice and Vision  in Gilan and Zarjan are blamed for the earthquake in those  provinces.    Then the Inquiry and Investigation Group makes false  statements under the heading of the security of the  organization, to which due to the importance of some of the  instances, we shall respond. The Inquiry and Investigation Group  claims that the existence of a strong security that can control  the actions and behavior of the managers and personnel of this  organization is obvious. Among the reports that from various  sources reached the Investigation Committee concerning the  managers, directors, and producers of mainly the Vision, about  40 of them involved people who are serving in sensitive key  positions. The committee prepared a report on their activities  and in meetings that were held initially with the Administrative  Violations Committee of the organization, the above-mentioned  committee stated that they verify the statements that concern  the violations and incompetence of the individuals on the  above-mentioned list.    We know of no case of a sister having first entered the  organization and later, as a result to the pressure and the  climate of the organization, changed to another kind of veil. It  is appropriate, if there is such an instance, that it be  reported it to this organization.    Voice and Vision response: The statements of the Inquiry and  Investigation Group are untrue, because first the Inquiry and  Investigation Group has had an unofficial meeting with two  members of the Violations Committee. Second, initially, they had  mentioned the names of two persons who were dismissed but by the  order of the director of the organization were returned to work.  When the files of these two people were placed at their  disposal, it became known that one case was not returned and the  second case was dismissed by the purging committee and returned  to the organization in 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983]. It  was on the order of one of the elements of interest to the  Inquiry and Investigation Group and hence, fortunately, all the  discussions in that meeting were recorded. The secretary of the  group has the tape and can place it at the disposal of the Voice  and Vision for broadcast. The Inquiry and Investigation Group  has paid no attention and passed it by. In continuation, the  Inquiry and Investigation Group says that in a meeting that they  had with the general director of security of the organization,  he has verified the reports concerning 40 people and later he  has not cooperated. This is also untrue. First, the question of  the Inquiry and Investigation Group in this connection was with  financial misuse and moral corruption. But since there had been  no cases, the director of security had said: I cannot make up  evidence based on your wishes. The members of the Inquiry and  Investigation Committee became very angry, threw the security  file which was at their disposal into some corner and left the  room.    In the continuation of this discussion, the group states  other matters about which, because they are pure lies or due to  the consideration for the interests of the country, we cannot  comment.    Then the group, under the heading of the climate of the  Voice  and Vision, makes statements that are all untrue. Fortunately,  almost all the officials of the regime have seen the work space  environment of the Voice and Vision, and there is no need to  explain the untruth in the report of the Inquiry and  Investigation Group.    In one case the group points out that the picture of a  semi-naked foreign female tennis player was hanging on the wall  of the office hall. Interestingly, the picture was a 25x20 color  picture of a male tennis player, and it was not on the wall of  the office hall but in the corridor of the technical warehouse.  It was not a female tennis player, but a male tennis player. The  Inquiry and Investigation Group says: "Because the secretaries  of the organization from the high-ranking to the lower managers  are all women employees, given the relations that these  secretaries have with each other, they influence the decisions  of the managers of the organization."    Voice and Vision response: First, because the members of the  group apparently have "eyes for women," they have not seen the  male secretaries, or, as it was stated, they saw a male tennis  player as a female tennis player.    Second, if the decisions of the managers of an organization  are to be influenced by the relationship of many of the  secretaries of that organization, would this have happened if  all the secretaries of the organization were men?    Such judgments that on the one hand, "stem from the  male-dominated viewpoint of the members of the group" and on the  other hand are very inexpert and superficial cannot be accepted  by anyone who knows the first thing about the management of a  sensitive organization such as the Voice and Vision.    Why they have looked at the issues so superficially is  unclear to us. Or if it is, we will avoid explaining it further.    The group says: The official veiling in the Voice and Vision  is a scarf and manteau and there are a very small number who  cannot be seen in the organization who use the chador, and  unfortunately most of the sisters who had initially gone to the  organization with chadors have been forced to use a manteau and  scarf as a result of the environment of the organization.    Voice and Vision response: First, those who have come to the  organization when employees leave or arrive have seen a  significant number of women in chadors, which itself is a strong  proof of the falsity of the group's claim.    Second, in a number of jobs in this organization, the use of  a chador is not possible, and hence in the work environment such  sisters use very concealing manteaus and facial veils.    Third, we know of no instance of a sister having entered the  organization with a chador and later changing to another veil  due to the environmental pressure of the organization. It is  appropriate, if this is the case, for it to be reported to the  organization.    Fourth, as has been mentioned earlier, in Islam, what is  obligatory for women is full covering and not the form of the  covering.    The Inquiry and Investigation Group in the continuation of  the same report says: "As a result of various pressures, which  have been imposed on the organization, they allowed a sister to  read the news in full Islamic veil (chador). After the second  session, she was attacked in the corridors of the organization  by a number of female employees. This claim of a group is a pure  lie, both in regards to outside pressure and also the attack by  the employees on the above-mentioned sister.    In regards to the organization, the group has made incorrect  statements to which the Basij resistance headquarters has  responded and apparently published in the newspaper. So no  further explanation is necessary here.    Then the Inquiry and Investigation Group engaged in  reporting  its examination of the college. In the first part of the report,  they have spoken of the shortages and inappropriateness of the  educational environment of the college and the equipment and  accused the officials of the organization over the past 15 years  of having taken no steps to create the college.    Voice and Vision response: At least in the last 10 years,  every year the estimated budget request for the building of the  college has been made by the officials of the Voice and Vision.  This request has either been omitted by the government or the  Majles, and it is apparent that without a budget, it is not  possible to build and equip a college.    Then the Inquiry and Investigation Group continues: "Since  the college is under the direct supervision and policymaking of  the educational deputy director, it is necessary to see who is  the highest decisionmaking authority and who determines the  directives for the training of the most important cultural and  artistic strategies of the country.    Voice and Vision response: First, not only is the  educational  deputy director not a policymaker but no deputy director,  neither in the Voice and Vision nor any other organization, is.  He is the implementor of the policies.    Second, in the higher education units, including the Voice  and Vision College, all the courses are approved and endorsed by  the Supreme Educational Council of the Ministry of Culture and  Higher Education and is not related to any other authority.    Third, in the Voice and Vision College, the head of the  college is the implementor and supervisor of the implementation  of the educational and training policies, not the educational  deputy director. Under this pretext, the Inquiry and  Investigation Group has engaged in making empty accusations  against him. For example, it has said that he was in charge of  construction of the Satellite Building, which could have been  one of the bloodiest accidents.    We have already explained about the satellite unit, that  first he was not in charge of the construction of the building,  but at the time he was executive deputy of the developmental  projects of the organization, and one of the projects of the  organization was the satellite project.    Second, the damage to the Satellite Building was due to the  earthquake, and if there is anyone who is guilty, it was not he.    The group then continues that he was in charge of the  construction of the Zibakenar villas where women and men swam  together and drank alcohol. Again, first, the accusations that  they say have occurred in the educational complex while serving  in Zibakenar are lies, and even if an instance were to have  happened, what does it have to do with the implementor of the  project? And Second, he was not the implementor of the project,  someone else was.    Then they say, this complex is not educational but  recreational, and they have just called it educational.    The number of people who have been trained in this complex  since it was opened, not only from the Voice and Vision  employees but employees of other executive organizations, is  very large. In the past few days a number of organizations which  have had their training courses in this complex have asked us  why the Inquiry and Investigation Group makes such false  statements. They ask: Are they not deputies of the people in the  Majles and have they not taken oaths to be their trustees? We  have had and have no answer to the question of these people.    The group then continues: "His harsh and offensive reaction  towards Hezbollah sisters and brothers of the organization is  known to everyone. His de-Islamization exceeds his domain of  authority and we witness the dismissal of religious persons..."    Unfortunately, there are no reasons or evidence of instances  of accusations and the group has not presented any documents. We  do not know on the basis of which standards have they allowed  themselves to make such unjust and untrue accusations against  the people. Are these not judicial crimes? If they do not prove  it in the court, as they cannot, what is the punishment for such  accusations which they have widely published? Will they be  punished?    In any case, what will they answer to God?    The group then continues that he goes under various pretexts  on trips and is especially interested in Japan.    First, the travel of all the managers, including him, is  done  when it is necessary.    Second, what kind of accusation is this to say that he is  interested in Japan? And how have they discovered such an  interest?    The group then says that in the ski competitions several  years ago in Japan, the physical education officials had asked  the hosts to have the flag of the Islamic Republic be carried by  a man and upon his arrival he insisted that like other countries  a woman must carry it, but the host officials did not accept it  because there was not enough time for training.    Voice and Vision response: First, the flags of the countries  are carried by the athletes of the same country and the flag of  the Islamic Republic was also carried by an athlete member of  the revolutionary institutions.    What was told to the group was probably about carrying the  placard with the name of the countries, which is carried by a  host, and what occurred was precisely the opposite.    Continuing this report, the Inquiry and Investigation Group,  while insulting a number of professors and claiming not to  choose them, states "the educational deputy in a letter asks the  director of the organization to eliminate selection from  entering students which is agreed to by the director of the  organization and protested by the Supreme Council for Selection."    Voice and Vision response: These instances are also untrue,  because in his correspondence he requested selection to respond  within a certain period (three months), whether the applicants  are admitted or not, and it was agreed to by the director of the  organization. And the reason was that the situation of those  admitted must be clarified for registration.    The group in the continuation makes unjust accusations  against one of the most modest professors who wears a chador,  which we are embarrassed to repeat here.    The statements of the group in this case, too, are pure  lies,  and we do not know why this group that in one place defends  women with chadors makes unjust accusations here against one of  the most modest of women in the organization. We do not know how  they want to answer before justice for such contradictions and  accusations.    God willing, God will protect us from the cursed Satan,  Amen,  oh Lord of Two Worlds.    In the conclusion of the report, the Inquiry and  Investigation Group quotes the students of the college  concerning the low amount of student and welfare resources.    Voice and Vision response: We admit that there are  insufficient resources for the students, but the students of the  Voice and Vision College are no worse off in terms of welfare  and educational aid than those in other universities and higher  education centers.    We hope that with the increase in resources we will be able  to provide the students with more resources, God willing.  <H5>  A Few Points </H5>   By expressing its disappointment in the content of the  inquiry and investigation report, which is full of accusations  and slander, the Voice and Vision organization did not have any  choice but to respond, because in this connection it may cause  anxiety for the public and lack of trust and confidence in the  regime and this public university that is the powerful protector  of the revolution and Islam.    Unfortunately, the inquiry and investigation report was  broadcast from the Voice of the Islamic Republic on the  threshold of the national and epic day of 13 Aban [4 November],  the day of the struggle against the oppressors headed by the  United States and was followed by many reactions from the  people, officials, and experts. The above-mentioned reaction was  the main reason for the organization's response.    Today, it has become certain for the self-sacrificing  managers and the concerned employees of the organization that  the inquiry and investigation report was prepared and devised on  the basis of a particular premeditated political agenda and by a  small number of the honorable deputies and does not represent  the opinion and intention of all the honorable deputies of the  Majles. And in spite of our previous wishes we have been obliged  to refer to the past history of some of those who elected the  valuable deputies to be aware of this difference. Hence, the  response of the organization to the accusations was merely and  directly to the claims of that small number of deputies, and  legally, too, it had to be broadcast from the Voice of the  Islamic Republic of Iran.    Also, in this connection, the rights of the concerned and  sincere employees and self-sacrificing and religious managers of  the organization had to be defended, the Basij employees and  managers who in these years of destiny, under the shower of  missiles and in the middle of fields of problems, due to the  enmity of the oppressors and other critical crises, have worked  hard and fought day and night in various units of the  organization to protect the values and foundations of the  Islamic regime and for the people to be able to live with  confidence in the regime and trust in the officials peacefully.    The other reason was that in order to enlighten the public  mind and eliminate the doubts resulting from the untrue content  of the inquiry and investigation report that had caused anger  and anxiety for the people, the publication of the explanations  and responses of the organization and announcing the related  truth and facts seemed necessary, because one of the main  principles of the work of the organization has always been based  on creating a psychological balance and peace of mind in the  society, and it is religiously and legally responsible to  prevent the broadcast of matters that cause conflict in the  society and disrupt public unity and respond appropriately to  untrue statements and domestic and foreign problems and various  ambiguities that disrupt national unity and the psychological  and spiritual peace of the people in order to attain the last  will and testament of the Imam and the emphatic recommendation  of the grand leader in preserving unity in the society. Hence,  the response of the organization to the accusations of the  Inquiry and Investigation Committee was for the purpose of  enlightening the public and preventing rumors and conflicts,  which are the side effects for the people.    The response of the organization was also necessary from a  different dimension. The accusations were so cowardly and  climate creating that they discouraged the self-sacrificing and  committed artists and writers and the religious and competent  forces of the culture and caused instability and lack of job  security for those who have worked hard, truthfully, and  sincerely for years and this seemed very unpleasant and hard. If  they were not supported and defended on time, it would pose  questions to their future service to the revolution and Islamic  art and culture, which would have been irreparable.    One of the most important reasons for the response of the  organization is the heartfelt and religious duty and commitment  that we felt in defending the ideas of the founder of the  Islamic revolution and the grand leader. The late Imam  identified the Voice and Vision as the public university and  Ayatollah Khamene'i the protector of the revolution and Islam.  Silence with regard to the content of the untrue inquiry and  investigation report would be considered treason against the  revolution and its leaders, because the cultural policies and  the basic goals, principles, priorities and the fundamental  policies of the organization have been completed by the grand  leader and always implemented. Concerning the cultural  principles and the culture-creating events and also cultural  pestilence, the Imam said:    "Culture is the source of all fortunes and misfortunes of a  nation. Leaving the misleading Western culture and replacing it  with the instructive Islamic and national culture and cultural  revolution in all areas throughout the country requires such  work and effort that years must be spent to achieve it. `And the  danger of those with stone-age mentality and stupid  pseudo-religious individuals...is not small.' In the Islamic  Republic, except in cases when Islam and the dignity of the  regime is threatened and as determined by a wise expert, no one  can impose his opinion on another.... If we are able to  present a regime based on the true following of the slogan,  "Neither Eastern nor Western" and an Islam devoid of hypocrisy  and deception, then the revolution would be victorious."    "The way to reform a country is through the culture of that  country. Reform must start with the culture. We hope mankind  will reach such growth that will change the machine guns into  pens. As much as the pen and expression have served mankind,  machine guns have not.... The basis is to defend the truth and  replace the machine gun with truth and science. Propaganda,  which is the same as identifying the good and encouraging people  to do them and show evil and the way to escape and prohibit it,  is a very important principle of dear Islam. Show the framework  of pure Mohammadan Islam, which is in drawing sacred and  revolutionary anger, wrath, and hostility against Western  capitalism and the aggressive communism of the East and also the  path to fight hypocrisy and deception to the people, especially  the brave young people. This issue, that the regime is serious  in its goals and if the Islamic values are threatened it will  deal decisively with anyone in any situation, must be propagated  as an unchanging principle for all officials and the people."    The above directives that are the fundamental principles and  cultural policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran acquaint  sincere, God seeking, and concerned individuals with many truths  and warns them of the dangers and the intellectual and cultural  ideas contrary to the pure and happiness-creating Islamic  culture.    The warnings of his honor concerning those with stone-age  mentality and pseudo-religious individuals must always be kept  in mind, and we must take seriously the danger of stone-age  mentality, superficiality, hypocrisy, and deception.    But, unfortunately, clear and perfect traces of stone-age  mentality and superficiality can be seen in the inquiry and  investigation report, which seems, when it is placed alongside  other recent events, to assume a particularly dangerous meaning  and will have improper and inappropriate consequences. This  sense of threat can be strongly seen in the reactions of the  people--the people who are always present on the scene--to the  inquiry and investigation report.  <H5>  A Few Words With the People </H5>   We thank you for your telephone calls and support. Let us  discuss a few points with you.    First, you know well that every once in a while attacks are  launched by those with a stone-age mentality, superficial  thinkers, or those from particular political leanings against  the programs and cultural activities of the Voice and Vision  organization. If we evaluate them optimistically, we realize  that these attacks have been formed due to the lack of awareness  on the part of their operators of the ratified principles,  policies, and goals of the organization and unfamiliarity with  the kind and expansion of the work of this powerful medium and  for this reason will soon lose their color. Hence, you can be  certain, and there is no room for worry, that the programs of  the organization will be as strong as before and will be  designed, produced, and broadcast as the most healthy, most  moral, and most instructive means to fill your hours of leisure,  for strengthening your spiritual and psychological peace of mind  and on the basis of Islamic values and your various needs.    Second, the organization has always tried to avoid  responding  to accusations and to not be a slave to the common traps, chaos  and psychological attacks that intend to engage the managers and  officials and subsequently decrease the production and technical  activities, and still, as in the past, it does not intend to  respond to any minor accusation or lie published by incompetent  people or personal tastes in the press. In the future, too, it  will try not to respond to such cases and follow the directive  of the Koran, which states: And the servants of (God), most  gracious, are those who walk on the earth in humility, and when  the ignorant address them, they say, "Peace...."    Those who witness no falsehood, and if they pass by  futility,  they pass by it with honorable avoidance.    But since the report of the Inquiry and Investigation  Committee has been issued by an official authority and widely  spread, with cowardly accusations against the self-sacrificing  managers and Hezbollah, committed, and active employees, it was  obvious and caused anger, anxiety, and doubt in the society, we  were obliged to respond, although we did not wish to do so.    Third, in exchange for your encouragement and for your peace  of mind, we have some good news for the noble and good people of  Iran, especially the majority, who have no video players: The  efforts of the active colleagues in the Voice and Vision in  planning and operation of the technical system of Network 3 has  reached fruition, and in the near future good and appropriate  programs will be broadcast for your leisure time.  <H5>  A Few Words With the Press </H5>   The independent press underwent the test of freedom and  adherence to the law of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Islamic  morality, and duty well, may God grant them more success. But a  dependent newspaper failed the test and was humiliated. This  group published the inquiry and investigation report, which  contained many accusations, such as drinking alcohol, illicit  relations, theft, spying for foreigners, de-Islamization, etc.,  concerning the serving people in the organization and not only  refused to publish the legitimate defense and the response of  the Voice and Vision organization, but wrote in defense and  praise of the main elements who prepared the inquiry and  investigation report and the fabrications of the accusations.  Whereas Islamic duty and the legal framework of the press and  religious ethics dictated that they publish the response to the  accusations to prevent damage to the dignity of the servants and  to eliminate doubt. Indeed, "why did they not do so" is an  important question. Perhaps the officials of this newspaper did  not consider the above-mentioned accusations of drinking wine,  illicit relations, theft, de-Islamization, etc., to be  violations and regard them as good deeds and hence they did not  consider them accusations and refused to publish them.    Or perhaps they did not consider it in the financial  interest  of their newspaper and violated political ethics, the honor of  journalism, and the law of the press. If only this group of the  dependent newspaper would for once publish for the people their  ideological line, group goals, and work ethic in order for the  people to become more familiar with their implemental goals.  Even in the heathen ideology of Marxism you cannot find such a  justification for publishing a letter of insult against a number  of active, hard-working, committed people not to respond and  defend those who have been unjustly accused.    In any case, we say to the grand families of the martyrs,  self-sacrificers, and missing-in-action, especially the revered  families of the martyrs, self-sacrificers and missing-in-action  of the Voice and Vision organization, while praising their  self-sacrifice, that we have pledged to God to continue your  path on the culture front and not be afraid of any harm.    If your dear ones and children fought on the battle fronts  against oppression and generously gave their blood and life to  help and strengthen the sapling of the Islamic revolution and  preserve the values, we too have made a pledge to fight bravely  in the cultural front and put up resistance. We have been  completely sincere and are ready to sacrifice our life and  reputation to strengthen the fruitful tree of the Islamic  revolution.    Oh God, grant us success in achieving the goals of the  Islamic revolution and the directives of Imam Khomeyni and the  grand leader.    Oh God, grant us success in serving more and step more  steadfastly in the path of Your guidance.    Oh God, increase our revolutionary resistance and patience  in  acting on the lofty instructions and carrying out our religious  duties. Amen.</p>

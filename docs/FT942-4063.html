			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market responds to good gains in gilts - Market Report London's equity market moved up strongly yesterday, shrugging off the news that the Conservative Party had suffered the expected defeats in five by-elections and ahead of an expected thumping in the European elections. The latest rise in the FT-SE 100 index, which closed at the day's best level of 3,055.9, up 27 points on the session left the index up 58.1, or 1.9 per cent, over the week. The equity market's second-ranked index, the FT-SE Mid 250, settled a more modest 9.2 up at 3,608.5, up 51.2 over the week. Much of the impetus for the gain on the week came from much better than expected data on UK manufacturing output released in mid-week. The main driving force behind the equity market was the good showing by the gilt-edged market, which was in positive territory all day, despite the poor showing by the Government in the elections and a lack-lustre performance by sterling against the D-Mark. A further boost for the equity market, later in the day was a strong opening performance by Wall Street in the wake of the US producer price numbers for May. Although closing well below the day's best levels the long gilt closed around  1/4 firmer, having been up over a half-point at mid-session. March trade data, seen as slightly disappointing by economists, had little impact on the market. One of the day's other plus points was the pick up in market activity as the week drew to a close. Yesterday's turnover of 618.2m shares followed the 683.8m traded on Thursday and was given a substantial boost by a sizeable bought deal in Royal Bank of Scotland shares, executed by Smith New Court, the securities house, and a resurgence of trading activity in Lasmo, the subject of a bid from Enterprise Oil. Activity in non-FT-SE stocks accounted for 346.3m shares, or 56 per cent of the day's total. The session began with the equity market uncertain and down around 7 points as marketmakers lowered their opening prices to head off any potential selling from fund managers following the by-election defeats for the Tories. News that Mr Nick Knight, equity market strategist at Nomura, the Japanese-owned stockbroker, had lowered his mid-year forecast for the FT-SE 100 index to 2,500 and his end-year number to 3,000, also played a part in the market's early caution. The mark down proved only momentary, however, as a firm opening by gilts triggered good institutional support as the market regained its confidence. Share prices began to move sharply better towards midday and accelerated strongly thereafter, eventually closing at the day's high. The head of marketmaking at one of the leading UK integrated houses described the days's performance as 'impressive' but emphasised that sentiment in the equity market, still badly bruised by the recent bond market sell off, 'will take some time to rebuild'. The Lasmo defence document, including a higher-than-expected independent net asset valuation, triggered an early upsurge in Lasmo shares and there was intense speculation that a third party may be about to enter the arena. Other oil shares were boosted by US buying. The much-rumoured bid from Commercial Union for Victoire, the insurance arm of French financial services group Suez, appeared in the late afternoon but was too late to have much impact on CU shares.</p>

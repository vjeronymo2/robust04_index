			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Arts: Zeffirelli's 'Six Characters' - Theatre Franco Zeffirelli's production of Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author is on a grand scale, which is how it should be. There is a huge background of squares and rectangles taken from Mondrian, at times strikingly illuminated. The music, while never obtrusive, is frequent and varied. Above all, Zeffirelli has more than fulfilled Pirandello's direction to include a lot of extras in the cast of actors. They add to the excitability when everybody talks at once; they enhance the stillness when almost everyone is quiet. There are some marvellous stage groupings. None of which is to suggest that the production puts style ahead of substance. Six Characters is far too good a play for that to be possible. Rather the infusion of the style makes the play even better. I have always been a Pirandello advocate. This performance should demonstrate beyond doubt that Six Characters is one of the 20th-century masterpieces. Zeffirelli has made one notable change from the original text. Instead of having the actors initially rehearsing one Pirandello's earlier plays, The Rules of the Game, he has substituted his last, The Giants of the Mountain, by which time the master was past his best. The switch probably means more to an Italian than to a British audience. It doesn't seem to me to matter much either way. For the rest, however, this is the essential Pirandello who raises questions about illusion and reality, the difference between real life and what happens on the stage and where the two shade into each other. Where Six Characters excels is in drawing in the audience. The producer of the play in rehearsal, and of the play in embryo, often directs from the front of the stalls. Producer, actors and the family of six characters who come in from the cold to tell their own story frequently stop to consult and argue with each other. Six Characters is an inquiry into the nature, and limits, of theatre. The brilliance of the team playing in Zeffirelli's production by no means prevents star performances. Benedetta Buccellato as the step-daughter is unforgettable. She is not conventionally beautiful, but there is a style and pride to her presence. Although she can suddenly flash a leg, drop a garment, or let fly a torrent of abuse, she is sometimes even more impressive when completely still. Giorgia O'Brien has only about five minutes on stage as the dressmaker and brothel-keeper, but she uses them to perfection, never trying to do too much. Sergio Basile as the producer who is present throughout demonstrates a superb Italian seriousness: a readiness to pick up what is new, learn from it and refine it. Such open-mindedness extends to the entire cast. Some of the best scenes are when the actors are watching the characters and acknowledging that the outsiders have something to teach. The scene where the father (Enrico Maria Salerno) goes to the brothel and begins the formalities with the girl who turns out to be his step-daughter is a dramatic gem. So is the way it is then redone by the actors. Note the change in the accompanying music. One complaint. The Italians seem to regard an interval as an excuse for a siesta. It lasted a good 30 minutes. The production, sponsored by Olivetti UK Ltd, is in Italian, but Pirandello can be almost as good in English. Lyttelton, until Saturday</p>

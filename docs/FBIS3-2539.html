			<p>Language: <F P=105>Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News briefing by Zhou Jue, spokesman for the Second Session </F> of the Eighth National People's Congress, with foreign and  domestic correspondents at the Great Hall of the People on 9  March; moderator identified by indistinct caption -- recorded]    [Text] [Moderator] The news briefing has begun. Let us  ask Comrade Zhou Jue, our spokesman for the National People's  Congress [NPC] session, to make some remarks.    [Zhou] The Second Session of the Eighth NPC will open  tomorrow. Although the current session is a regular meeting, it  is very important. It is being held during an important period  when our country is proceeding on all fronts in reforming its  economic structure with breakthroughs in key areas, and when it  is accelerating the pace of establishing a socialist market  economic system. You are welcome to cover this session. I wish  you success in your coverage. Now, I am willing to answer your  questions that have something to do with the agenda of the  current session.    [RENMIN RIBAO correspondent] I am a correspondent from  RENMIN  RIBAO. I would like to ask the spokesman the following  question: The just-concluded sixth meeting of the NPC Standing  Committee examined and approved the Law of the People's Republic  of China on the Protection of Investments by Taiwan Compatriots.  This has caused great concern on both sides of the Taiwan  Strait. What effect will the implementation of the law have on  the expansion of cross-strait economic exchanges and trade?    [Zhou] The NPC Standing Committee meeting recently approved  the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of  Investments by Taiwan Compatriots. This is because cross-strait  economic contacts have become closer, and Taiwan's investments  in the mainland's economy have increased by a large margin.  Despite this situation, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have  not yet established direct postal links, direct air and shipping  services, and direct trade contacts. Therefore, it is essential  to enact the law on protecting Taiwan compatriots' investments.  The law mainly protects Taiwan compatriots' personal safety,  investments, and investment returns; it also protects  enterprises funded by them in China against being requisitioned,  and if these enterprises are requisitioned for public services,  the method of compensation should be adopted. Moreover, the law  allows enterprises funded by Taiwan compatriots here to organize  business associations to protect their legitimate rights and  interests. The formulation and adoption of this law fully  demonstrates that we attach great importance to Taiwan  compatriots' investment-related rights and interests, and also  give full expression to our sincerity in developing cross-strait  economic contacts and trade. I believe that the enactment of  the law will surely be welcomed by the broad masses of Taiwan  compatriots, and it will play a very important role in promoting  economic development on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The  enactment of this law provides us the most authoritative and  fullest legal guarantee for protecting investments by Taiwan  compatriots on the mainland.    [Unidentified correspondent] Some NPC deputies from the  Hong Kong region are going to put forward a motion during the  NPC session, requiring the NPC to announce the dissolution and  reorganization of the Hong Kong British Government's three-tier  parliament after 1997. Will NPC spokesman support the motion?    [Zhou] Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 1994/1995 elections  have broken down due to an uncooperative and sabotaging attitude  taken by Britain. The responsibility is entirely on the British  side. In accordance with the stipulations of the Sino-British  Joint Declaration, Britain's administration over Hong Kong will  end on 30 June 1997, with China resuming the exercise of its  sovereignty over Hong Kong thereafter. The three-tier political  structure which serves the British administration in Hong Kong  will also inevitably end with the expiry of the term of British  rule. The political framework for the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region will be formed according to the resolution  of China's NPC and the relevant stipulations of the Basic Law.  Here, I would like to reiterate: Hong Kong will soon return to  the embrace of the motherland. No force whatsoever can stop  this. The Chinese Government and people have full confidence  and ability to resume the exercise of China's sovereignty over  Hong Kong on time; to implement the principle of "one country,  two systems"; to carry out the Basic Law; and to maintain Hong  Kong's smooth transition as well as its long-term stability.    [CCTV correspondent] The NPC and its Standing Committee  noticeably sped up the pace of legislation over the past year,  but failure to abide by the laws and lax enforcement of laws  occurred in some areas from time to time. How will the NPC  Standing Committee strengthen examination of and supervision  over law enforcement so as to improve the situation?    [Zhou] Supervising law enforcement and government judicial  organs' work is an important duty entrusted to the NPC and its  standing committee by the Constitution. Over the past year, the  NPC Standing Committee conducted close examination of  legislation of laws, their enforcement, and government work,  bearing in mind the state's priority tasks and the issues of  greatest concern to the people; it successively sent 10  inspection teams to 15 provinces, municipalities, and regions to  assess work in comprehensive management of public security and  in dealing with the production and sales of counterfeit and  substandard commodities. Various special committees also sent  27 inspection teams to assess progress in implementing 15 laws.  The Standing Committee also heard reports by relevant State  Council departments and the Supreme People's Procuratorate [SPP]  on education, banking, foreign trade, the building of a clean  and honest government, and civil aviation. For instance, after  hearing a work report by the department of the Civil Aviation  Administration, the Standing Committee required the department  of the Civil Aviation Administration and its affiliated  organizations to conscientiously strengthen control, to improve  the quality of their work and personnel as well as attitude  toward service, and to improve civil aviation as quickly as  possible. After hearing work reports by the SPP and relevant  State Council departments, the Standing Committee fully affirmed  their work, in particular their work on investigating extensive,  important cases, and gave them maximum support. In the future,  the NPC and its Standing Committee will continue to strengthen  supervision and to exercise the authority of supervision vested  in it by the Constitution in a better way.    [SWEDISH DAILY NEWS correspondent, in English fading into  Mandarin translation] I have heard that the Chinese Government  is considering abolishing the provision on counterrevolutionary  crime in its Criminal Law and replacing it with some definitions  of various crimes. Could you verify such a change? In addition,  do your legislators have plans to discuss this matter?    [Zhou] The counterrevolutionary crime stipulated in China's  Criminal Law refers to crimes endangering state security. In  any country in the world, crimes that endanger state security  have to be punished.    [XINHUA correspondent] How will quickening legislative work  advance China's market economy?    [Zhou] In accordance with China's Constitution, in the past  year, the NPC Standing Committee has made legislative work,  especially economic-related legislative work, a priority.  Excluding the Constitutional amendment bill and the Basic Law  of the Macao Special Administrative Region, adopted at the First  Session of the Eighth NPC, the NPC Standing Committee has  enacted or revised 19 laws, of which 12 concern the  establishment of a socialist market economic system. These laws  include the Corporate Law, Agriculture Law, Individual Income  Tax Law, the Law Against Unfair Competition, the Quality Law,  the Law on Protecting the Rights and Interests of Consumers, and  so on. Last year, the number of laws passed by the NPC Standing  Committee broke all previous records. I can tell you all that  the Standing Committee has initially examined two important  laws, the Budget Law and the Securities Law. During its eighth  term, the NPC Standing Committee will fully implement the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, will quicken  the legislative process, and will endeavor to complete the  better part of the legal framework for the socialist market  economy under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, under the  guidance of the party's basic line and on the basis of the  Constitution. Moreover, it will continue to establish and  improve the legal systems in other areas. During its eighth  term, the NPC Standing Committee plans to pass 152 laws, 53 of  which deal with the socialist market economy. I can tell you  all that from 1949 to 1992, the NPC and its Standing Committees  passed a total of 170 laws. Enacting 152 laws during the eighth  term of the NPC Standing Committee -- this is indeed an  important and glorious task.    [Unidentified correspondent] The NPC has just passed the  "Law on the Protection of Investments by Taiwan Compatriots."  At present, many Taiwan businessmen believe that this law is  insufficient. Therefore, they have been voicing their hope that  the two sides will sign an investment protection agreement.  What is the view of the NPC regarding this issue?    [Zhou] Investments on the mainland by Taiwan compatriots are  a special kind of domestic investment. Therefore, protection of  the investment rights and interests of Taiwanese compatriots can  only be realized through a domestic law. [words indistinct] the  issue of investment protection agreement. Taiwan is an  inalienable part of Chinese territory. The relationship between  the central government and the Taiwan authorities is one between  the central government and a local authority. It is out of the  question that the two sides may sign any agreement.    [Unidentified correspondent] NPC deputies from the Hong Kong  region and those from the Guangdong region have jointly  submitted a motion demanding that a special clean government  work committee be set up under the NPC Standing Committee. They  feel that such a committee under the NPC Standing Committee will  strengthen the Chinese Government's work against corruption.  Moreover, it will enhance the NPC's status. What is the view  of the NPC on this motion?    [Zhou] You have just mentioned that some Hong Kong deputies  have suggested that a clean government work committee be set up  under the NPC Standing Committee. According to the provisions  of relevant laws, any people's deputies are entitled to make  suggestions and submit motions, but examinations and approval  must be done in accordance with legal procedures. As for the  struggle against corruption, we will continue it on a long-term  basis and will strive to achieve still greater results.  Therefore, as the Hong Kong deputies have submitted some good  suggestions or motions, they will certainly be welcomed.    [Unidentified correspondent] This year China will  introduce more measures to reform enterprises. The workers have  become more concerned about their work prospects this year.  Does the NPC have any plan to make laws to protect workers'  rights and interests this year?    [Zhou] Regarding the law on the protection of the working  class's rights and interests, China has enacted the Trade Union  Law. In this law there are explicit provisions on protecting  workers' rights and interests. We have also passed the Labor  Law. This is an important law to protect workers' rights and  interests.    [Moderator] Today's news briefing is now concluded. Thank  you.</p>

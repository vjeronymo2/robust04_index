			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hans-W. Wichert: "Old Liabilities -- New Tasks: </F> Criteria for Reclamation"]    [Text] The problems surrounding polluted sites in the new  federal laender may be seen as the major obstacle to the sale of  the old factories with a view to creating new jobs. However, it  is important to differentiate between the various types and  degrees of pollution and the future uses to which it is intended  to put the sites concerned.    For the purposes of polluted site reclamation -- and this  does not apply solely to the new federal laender -- a  distinction will have to be drawn between the general principle  of prevention and that of salvaging in order to conserve the  soil as a natural entity and the foundation for human, animal,  and plant life. Unless this distinction is clearly drawn, there  will be a danger that prevention standards will be applied to  operations designed to remedy existing soil pollution. This  would result in an enormous outlay and gigantic reclamation  costs.  <H5>  Typical Polluted Site Problems </H5>   It is not only the special cases of former industrial areas,  such as those containing coking works, gasworks, refineries,  etc., that present problems. Polluted sites are often to be  found at factories producing products above suspicion of  contamination, but which merely used (apparently small  quantities of) substances represent a water hazard.    In most of these cases, only part (often under 20 percent)  of  the site is contaminated and needs to be cleaned up. Plant  sections such as former dyeing units, sedimentation tanks,  residue deposits (factory dumps), drum stores, heating boilers,  etc. are the main parts affected. In all these cases it is to  be expected that the soil will have been polluted by slag  containing heavy metals, petroleum products, phenols,  chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHC's), and creosotes (polynuclear  aromatic hydrocarbons). All these pollutants are to be found in  the soil in varying concentrations, and can spread down to great  depths, for instance in troughs, hollows, and gutters and over  wide areas.    It often emerges in practice that the reclamation strategies  drawn up at the beginning have to be changed into use-oriented  versions without reference to the former factory. Multifunction  use of the type frequently called for in the early eighties  cannot be achieved. It is unrealistic to assume that the entire  mass of soil can be cleansed to a degree of purity reflecting  its natural state.    In addition to the nature of the substance concerned, the  path by which it spreads plays a decisive role in determining  the hazard that it constitutes for human beings, animals,  plants, and the environment. Chemical degradation combined with  volubility in water can endanger the groundwater, whereas  volatile substances also take an aerial path. It is only via  knowledge as to how the substances are spread that it can be  established whether they place the various resources at risk.    If a substance in the soil may be regarded as persistent, it  has zero effect on the groundwater and/or human beings provided  it remains below the ground surface but at a sufficient distance  from the groundwater. The situation is quite different if a  substance in the soil is rapidly degradable.    This has major implications for reclamation technology, as  it  may be assumed that processes take place in nature in accordance  with the law of minimum, i.e., with the minimum economic outlay.  <H5>  Developing the Right Criteria </H5>   A major issue, especially in the new federal laender, will  be  the elaboration of criteria that distinguish between the  differing conservation targets for avoiding contamination either  on a preventive basis or as a salvage measure. Without doubt,  reclamation targets frequently call for the lower preventive  level, not least in view of the legal uncertainty facing the  licensing authorities.    Taking a realistic view of the overall situation --  particularly with an eye to stretching limited resources --  every attempt should be made to explore alternative strategies  that make it possible to release parts of the factory sites so  that they can be put to new uses.</p>

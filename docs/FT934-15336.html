			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Digital unveils strategy shift DIGITAL Equipment, the US computer manufacturer, has unveiled about 150 products and services designed to position the company as a significant supplier of client-server systems. Mr Geoffrey Shingles, chairman of Digital's UK operations said the announcements were 'the basis for the new Digital'. The intention is to become the leading client-server company by 1995. Client-server systems involve workstations and personal computers tied together in networks. Digital has been the world leader in minicomputers but was slow to capitalise on the trend towards personal computers and open networks where machines from different manufacturers can be linked together easily. With today's announcement, the company is attempting to recover lost ground and position itself for the future. The products will include special software to enable groups of staff to work co-operatively over a shared computer system and a number of high-powered workstations based on Digital's Alpha chip, said to be the world's fastest. The company has improved its pricing structure and simplified ordering procedures for most of its products and services. It is extending and developing its consultancy services. Digital's move is seen by industry experts as essential for any company hoping to take a large share of tomorrow's data processing markets. There is little or no growth in mainframe or minicomputer based systems. Digital emphasised its global commitment to information technology. It said development of its client-server products had been spread through countries where it operates.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Thai stance disappoints US Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, expressed disappointment yesterday that Thailand had denied a US request to position military equipment on ships in Thai waters but said he was sure other sites could be found. The US wants to keep weapons and vehicles ready in the region to be able to respond quickly to crises in the Middle East or Asia; such equipment could also be used for humanitarian purposes, Mr Christopher told a news conference. He said he would not be surprised if the reason for President Saddam Hussein's recent withdrawal of Iraqi troops from the Kuwaiti border was the rapid arrival of US troops flown in to man equipment already positioned in the Gulf. Mr Christopher yesterday met Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Thai prime minister, and the foreign and defence ministers. The government had previously decided that US arms stocks might endanger rather than promote peace. Thailand has been a close US ally since the Vietnam war, and Mr Christopher said the strong security relationship continued. The US armed forces have conducted 35 joint exercises with the Thai military this year, more than with any other Asian country, and the US has access to Thai ports and airfields.</p>

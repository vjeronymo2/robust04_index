			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / People: Alcatel entices BT's man in Europe The UK ambitions of Alcatel NV, the French telecommunications equipment supplier, reached a new peak yesterday, with the announcement that it has merged two of its UK subsidiaries and appointed a BT executive to run them. John Baker, BT's sales manager for leading business customers in Europe, has been appointed managing director of Alcatel Network Systems UK, an amalgamation of Alcatel's existing UK network systems division and Telettra UK, the UK microwave and line transmission division of the Italian group Telettra Spa acquired by Alcatel in 1991. Coming a week after Alcatel offered Pounds 600m for STC Submarine Systems, the UK-based undersea telecommunications cable arm of Northern Telecom, the Canadian supplier, the move underlines Alcatel's determination to make inroads into the UK market. Unlike virtually all his French counterparts, Baker climbed up through the ranks. He joined the Post Office straight from school as a trainee apprentice in 1964, gaining qualifications through night school, then as a mature student at Essex University. With 1,000 employees and annual sales of more than Pounds 100m, Alcatel has a significant UK presence even before the STC acquisition. 'The world's number one player should be in the world's number one market,' Baker says, neatly complimenting his masters old and new.</p>

In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the BSC determined that gold's role as a financial asset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinguishes it from other precious metals. The proposed matrix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is designed to accommodate the different structures of contracts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as the observed disparities in the volatilities of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated indices or prices of the underlying assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two footnotes are attached to the matrix to address two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular contract structures. The first relates to contracts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with multiple exchanges of principal. Since the level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential future exposure rises generally in proportion to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of remaining exchanges, the conversion factors are to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiplied by the number of remaining payments (that is,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchanges of principal) in the contract. This treatment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to ensure that the full level of potential future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure is adequately covered. The second footnote applies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equity contracts that automatically reset to zero each time a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment is made. The credit risk associated with these contracts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is similar to that of a series of shorter contracts beginning and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ending at each reset date. For this type of equity contract the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining maturity is set equal to the time remaining until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> next payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the capital charges resulting from the application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the new proposed conversion factors may not provide complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage for risks associated with any single contract, the BSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes the factors will provide a reasonable level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prudential coverage for derivative contracts on a portfolio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis. Like the original matrix, the proposed expanded matrix is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to provide a reasonable balance between precision, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complexity and burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> B. Recognition of the Effects of Netting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The simulation studies used to generate the conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors for potential future exposure analyzed the implications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of underlying rate and price movements on the current exposure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts without taking into account reductions in exposure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could result from legally enforceable netting arrangements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the conversion factors are most appropriately applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-netted contracts, and when applied to legally enforceable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> netted contracts, they could in some cases, overstate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential future exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments provided during the consultative process of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revising the Basle Accord to recognize qualifying bilateral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> netting arrangements and further research conducted by the BSC,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have suggested that netting arrangements can reduce not only a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> banking organization's current exposure for the transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the netting arrangement, but also its potential future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure for those transactions. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> While current exposure is intended to cover an organization's credit exposure at one point in time, potential future exposure provides an estimate of possible increases in future replacement cost, in view of the volatility of current exposure over the remaining life of the contract. The greater the tendency of the current exposure to fluctuate over time, the greater the add-on for potential future exposure should be to cover expected fluctuations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As a result, in July 1994 the BSC issued a proposal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporate into the calculation of the add-on for potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future exposure a method for recognizing the risk-reducing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of qualifying netting arrangements. Under the proposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions could recognize these effects only for transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that meet the requirements of netting for current exposure as set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth in the recent amendment to the Accord.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Depending on market conditions and the characteristics of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bank's derivative portfolio, netting arrangements can have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial effects on a bank's potential future exposure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple derivative contracts it has entered into with a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counterparty. Should the counterparty default at some future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date, the bank's exposure would be limited to the net amount the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counterparty owes on the date of default rather than the gross  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current exposure of the included contracts. By entering into a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> netting arrangement, a bank may reduce not only its current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure, but also its future exposure as well. Nevertheless,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while in many circumstances a netting arrangement can reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential future exposure of a counterparty portfolio, this is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not always the case. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> For purposes of this discussion, a portfolio refers to a set of contracts with a single counterparty. A bank's global portfolio refers to all of the contracts in the institution's derivatives portfolio that are subject to qualifying netting arrangements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The most important factors influencing whether a netting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangement will have an effect on potential future exposure are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the volatilities of the current exposure to the counterparty on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both a gross and net basis. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  The volatilities of net current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure and gross current exposure of the portfolio may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessarily be the same. Volatility of gross current exposure is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influenced primarily by the fluctuations of the market values of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positively valued contracts. Volatility of net current exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the other hand, is influenced by the fluctuations of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market values of all contracts within the portfolio. In those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases where net current exposure has a tendency to fluctuate more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over time than gross current exposure, a netting arrangement will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not reduce the potential future exposure. However, in those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations where net current exposure has a tendency to fluctuate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less over time than gross current exposure, a netting arrangement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can reduce the potential future exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Volatility in this discussion is the tendency of the market value of a contract to vary or fluctuate over time. A highly volatile portfolio would have a tendency to fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. One of the most important factors influencing a portfolio's volatility is the correlation of the contracts within the portfolio, that is, the degree to which the contracts in the portfolio respond similarly to changing market conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Net current exposure is likely to be less volatile relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the volatility of gross current exposure when the portfolio of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts as a whole is more diverse than the subset of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positively valued contracts. When a netting arrangement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to a diversified portfolio and the positively valued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts within the portfolio as a group are less diversified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the overall portfolio, then the effect of the netting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangement will be to reduce the potential future exposure for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the portfolio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

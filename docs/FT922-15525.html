			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / People: Unichem Pharmaceutical wholesaler UNICHEM, which recently dropped out of the bidding for wholesale chemists Macarthy, has brought in Grahame Sewell from Arcadian International as its new finance director. Peter Dodd, Unichem chief executive, retires in May, to be replaced by Jeff Harris, the previous finance director and made deputy chief executive. Sewell, a 42-year-old chartered accountant, had spent just 12 months as finance director of Arcadian International, a leisure property group. At the time he joined, Arcadian had been planning a number of acquisitions but decided instead to develop greenfield sites. Sewell, who sees himself as 'very much from an operations background', decided to move on. One priority at Unichem will be to develop the retail side of the business. With one joint venture in Germany, he also sees Unichem pressing ahead with further European expansion. That is a familiar area for Sewell, who had earlier spent two years as finance director of the international division of sports shoe specialist Reebok, and before that worked as one of the first employees outside the US of software house Lotus Development Corporation. ***** A torrent of complaints from building society customers has led to the appointment of a third ombudsman for the industry to work alongside the two already in place, Stephen Udell and Jane Woodhead. The new ombudsman will be Brian Murphy, 51, a partner of Farrer &amp; Co, who specialises in commercial and general litigation, employment law and industrial relations. He qualified as a solicitor in 1966. The latest incumbent will take decisions in his own right. He is likely to have a considerable volume of work; though final figures for 1991-92 will not be available until June, it looks as if complaints have doubled since last year. ***** BAYER, the German chemicals group, has appointed Lennart Aberg as managing director of its Bayer plc, its UK subsidiary. He replaces John Webb who becomes chairman, and will work with him for two months before taking up the new job on July 1. Aberg, currently managing director of Bayer Sverige in Sweden, said yesterday that the problems facing Bayer in the UK were similar to those in Sweden, with low turnover and high costs. However, the scale of the businesses in the UK, which have a turnover of Pounds 414m and employ about 1,700 people, were larger, he added. Aberg said it was too early to say what big changes might be implemented.</p>

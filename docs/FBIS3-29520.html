			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  will make state visits to Japan from March 24-26 and to China  from March 26-30, the presidential office Chongwadae announced  Friday. The visits are aimed at seeking a new post-Cold War  order in Northeast Asia and holding consultations on the North  Korean nuclear problem.    This will be the second summit for Kim and Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa covering political and trade issues.  They met last November in the southern South Korean city of  Kyongju, with next month's summit to follow up on issues covered  then including regional cooperation and prosperity and  multilateral ties such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC). They are certain to address the North Korean nuclear  dispute, exchanging views on the latest developments.    Kim will attend a welcome dinner hosted by Emperor Akihito  and deliver a speech before the Japanese Diet.    The South Korean president heads to Shanghai on March 26 for  a weekend stay, when he will tour sites that once housed the  Korean government-in-exile during Japan's colonial rule of  1910-45. He is to arrive in Beijing the following day for talks  with Premier Li Peng on furthering bilateral relations. Kim  will also make an address at Beijing University during his visit.    Kim's Predecessor No Tae-u traveled to China, but this will  mark the first time that a South Korean leader has been received  on a state visit. Seoul and Beijing normalized relations in  August 1992.    Senior presidential aide for diplomacy and national security  Chong Chong-ok explained that Kim will discuss achieving  friendly and cooperative ties with the two countries that are  close to South Korea both historically and geographically.    "The visits will provide opportunities to settle on a  multilateral security dialogue forum in the region and to  strengthen bilateral political and security cooperation," Chong  said.    First Lady Son Myong-sun will accompany her husband on the  visits.</p>

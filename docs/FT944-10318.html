			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Static water demand forecast Water companies expect virtually no overall growth in water demand over the next 20 years, a summary of forecasts prepared by Ofwat, the industry regulator, shows. The forecasts suggest that a strong increase in demand by households will be offset by several factors. These include a 21 per cent fall in leakage, a 5 per cent fall in demand from industry and a 33 per cent rise in metered households.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oil group buys bid stake The battle for control of Lasmo reached fever pitch when it emerged that Enterprise Oil had bought 9.8 per cent of Lasmo via two purchases. The first was 86.8m shares purchased at 169p and the second was 7.77m shares bought at 161p. The big market purchases drove turnover in Lasmo up to a very heavy 195m shares. Many brokers were outraged at the way Enterprise had picked up the shares. 'There were no bids in the market at 169p; the best bid marketmakers saw was 148p,' said one oil specialist. It was suggested that Philips &amp; Drew Fund Management had sold the block of 86.8m shares to Enterprise's brokers and advisers, James Capel and SG Warburg, at 169p a share. The other big purchase, 7.77m shares , or 1.5 per cent. was bought for 161p apiece. Following the day's events, Lasmo shares were up 2 to 143p, still well below the bid price, but those of Enterprise fell heavily, closing 26 lower at 382p, as the market took the view that Enterprise would only move to buy shares in Lasmo if it felt it were close to winning the bid battle. 'It is still very close, but the feeling is that the balance is starting to swing towards Enterprise,' said one broker. He also pointed out that criticisms of Enterprise's methods of buying the near 10 per cent stake were not dissimilar to those carried out by Lasmo itself when it won control of Ultramar.</p>

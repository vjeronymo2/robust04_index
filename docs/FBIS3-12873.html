			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks in English with </F> superimposed translation into Arabic]    [Text] In an exclusive interview with MBC, Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres called for the resumption of peace talks  between Israel and the PLO, saying that such a move would  benefit both sides.    Responding to a question on the difficulties that the Hebron  massacre has created for the peace talks and the fact that the  massacre brought to the fore once again the issue of  settlements, settlers, and their restraining effect on the peace  process, Peres said:    [Begin recording] [Peres] "I admit that what happened  created  many pressures and problems for us. We have to find the  suitable solutions. In my opinion, the most important  development that should happen now is the implementation of the  agreement, not its revision. I believe that the Palestinians  and Arabs will feel a dramatic change once they are in control  of their lives in Gaza and Jericho. Soon afterward, it will be  possible to begin negotiating other matters. But if we scrap  the agreement and start on a new one, we will remain suspended  in midair for a long time and people will lose patience and  eventually confidence in the possibility of achieving peace."    [Correspondent Mahir Shalabi] There is talk of a possible  meeting between you and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat  tomorrow in Cairo.    [Peres] "No agreement has been made about this meeting so  far."    [Shalabi] If this meeting takes place, one of the issues  that  will be put before you is the deployment of international forces  in the occupied territories.    [Peres] "If the meeting takes place and this subject is  brought up, I will probably have an answer." [end recording]</p>

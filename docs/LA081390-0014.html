			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ;  </P> <P> TALENTS STRETCH GENRE AT LONG BEACH FEST  </P> <P> Tone Loc's got nothing to worry about. At least not from trombonist Wayne  Henderson.  </P> <P> In his show-closing set Saturday at the Long Beach Jazz Festival -- held next  to the Rainbow Lagoon near the Long Beach Convention Center -- Henderson, the  former Crusader and leader here of a slightly over-hyped group of musicians  dubbed "Master Collection," rapped his way through a new tune entitled "Just  Because It's Jazz Don't Mean You Can't Dance." Though the husky-voiced  Henderson's delivery was less than prime, a good part of the crowd, generously  estimated by festival personnel at 9,000, took the lyric to heart, moving into  the aisles and in front of the stage to shimmy and shake.  </P> <P> The tune made an appropriate theme song for the 3-day event that opened Friday  night with keyboardist Bobby Lyle, message-conscious vocalist Gil Scott-Heron  and pop singer Phyllis Hyman, and continued Sunday in a more traditional vein  with a scheduled program that included cornetist Nat Adderley, pianist McCoy  Tyner and Latin-jazz-band leader Poncho Sanchez. But, on Saturday, just because  you heard it at the jazz festival didn't necessarily make it jazz.  </P> <P> Perspective on the label-stretching fest came early-on from singer Dakota  Staton, who delivered a vivacious set of standards and blues backed by the  competent trio of pianist Bross Townsend, bassist Isla Eckinger and drummer  Jack Ranelli. The singer -- who made the pop charts a number of times in the  late '50s -- showed strength and conviction while utilizing a minimum of  stylistic gimmicks in her renditions of such familiar numbers as "Misty," "The  Thrill Is Gone" and "Love for Sale," on which she injected vocal octave jumps  in a way that recalled the late Billy Holiday.  </P> <P> Sandwiched between Staton and Henderson was a mixed-bag of pop, funk and  fusion. Vibist Roy Ayers, who now plays a compact, electronic version of the  instrument, gave an uneven, backbeat-laden performance (with bass supplied by a  keyboard) that contained too much of Ayers' vocal antics and too little of his  mallet work. The Rippingtons, featuring guitarist Russ Freeman, enlivened their  mostly bland compositions with Steve Reid's percussion embellishments and Mark  Portman's synthesizer wash.  </P> <P> A satisfying set from pianist Ramsey Lewis was marred by a loss of sound during  a dramatic guitar solo from quintet member Henry Johnson and by the explosions  of the nightly fireworks launched from the nearby Queen Mary. Lewis' funky  block-chord style remains intact, and the keyboardist worked some ambitious Art  Tatum-style flourishes as well into Stevie Wonder's "Living for the City." And,  yes, the keyboardist did "Wade in the Water."  </P> <P> Despite Henderson's attempt at rap, the Master Collection's short  R&amp;B-infused closing set was solid in a way that recalled its leader's days  in the old Jazz Crusaders. Central to this success was Alphonse Mouzon's crisp,  inventive drumming, Kirk Whalum's blowzy tenor sax work and Henderson's own  burnished trombone tones.  </P> <P> Also appearing Saturday were saxophonist Hank Crawford and the Yellowjackets  (reviewed last Monday.  </P></p>

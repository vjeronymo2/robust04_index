			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad 'Abbas, identified here by his nom </F> de guerre Abu-al-'Abbas, secretary general of the Palestine  Liberation Front, PLF, by Ahmad 'Abd-al-Majid, in Baghdad; date  not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-Majid] You said  consequent action. What is the nature of this action? Will you  resort to another option other than the option of a political  solution?    'Abbas: Struggle is an integral and indivisible  whole. However, any action necessitates a reaction, especially  when you see your people being slaughtered. You must then look  for an appropriate action. We have not relinquished armed  struggle. As an organization, we still believe that armed  struggle is a major tool to attain our people's rights in  Palestine. Developments are escalating, and they are all  related to what has taken place. We have great hope that God  will grant us success and help us wipe away the tears of the  widows and console the children who have lost their fathers and  brothers. [passage omitted]    'Abd-al-Majid: The way you deal with the national  Palestinian rights is to some extent similar to that of Hamas.  Do you have contacts with this movement?    'Abbas: As an organization, we have carried out  armed struggle for more than a quarter of a century in a  continuous manner that has left its imprint in the national,  Arab, and international arenas. We have never been negligent in  this field. Our vision has always been clear and it will remain  so. Hamas and other organizations have similar ideas. In one  way or another, we have contacts with the Palestinian forces  that work within the national framework, regardless of their  political stands. The closer their stands become to ours, the  closer we become to these Palestinian organizations.    We view Hamas with special appreciation, and we have  contacts  with it. I say contacts and not an alliance. These contacts  might be developed. This depends on how close our political  stands become in the future regarding struggle in our homeland.    'Abd-al-Majid: But do not you see that there is a  contradiction between armed struggle and political action within  the PLO framework?    'Abbas: This is an integration, not a  contradiction. We are represented in the PLO and the PLO  Executive Committee. We have developed relations with factions  and forces that are outside the PLO framework. We also have  relations with factions that left the PLO or that have adopted a  certain stand toward the PLO leadership such as the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front  for the Liberation of Palestine. Our concept of integration is  based on our reading of the PLO's current situation. In our  opinion, the PLO still constitutes the moral entity of the  people. In other words, it is the state of the Palestinians.  [passage omitted]    'Abd-al-Majid: Do you have any advice for the PLO  leadership?    'Abbas: Everyday carries new evidence of the blind  and erroneous political course -- its uselessness, the extent of  the harm it has inflicted on our people and cause, and the  losses which could have been averted if the PLO had redressed  its course, especially since there are no signs or indications  regarding substantive Israeli concessions. There were huge  national losses, and the Israeli and American demands are  pushing the PLO toward making still further concessions. In  addition to this, repressive and oppressive measures are still  continuing, and they were crowned by the Hebron massacre. The  only advice I have to the PLO leadership is to leave,  unhesitatingly, this quagmire that it has led our people into,  before the catastrophe becomes complete. [passage omitted]</p>

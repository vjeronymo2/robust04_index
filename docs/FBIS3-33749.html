Upon his arrival, Sha'th stated that 'Arafat and Peres will  meet in Cairo on Sunday [6 February]. He noted that the  Palestinian and Israeli delegations will meet tomorrow to  prepare for the 'Arafat-Peres meeting on Sunday.    Sha'th expressed his belief that the Davos meeting has made  some progress with respect to the difficult problems surrounding  the Gaza-Jericho agreement.    He said that if we reach agreement on Sunday, we will have  overcome the stage of conflicts and advance to the signing of  the agreement.    Sha'th clarified that an international presence at the  crossings has been ruled out, but it is still our right to  demand a temporary international presence in Gaza for a period  of one or two years.</p>

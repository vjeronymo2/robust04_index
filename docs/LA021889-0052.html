			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEVELAND OUTLAWS ASSAULT WEAPONS  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously on Friday to ban the sale or possession of  so-called assault weapons.  </P> <P> It also approved the purchase for police of 500 pistols capable of firing up to  16 rounds without reloading.  </P> <P> The assault weapons ban will apply to several types, including semiautomatic  rifles that hold clips of 20 or more rounds and certain semiautomatic shotguns  and modified handguns, council members said.  </P> <P> The Cleveland ordinance is similar to proposals in California that are being  fought by the National Rifle Assn. and other groups.  </P> <P> There was no expressed NRA opposition to the Cleveland ban, perhaps because the  group was unaware of it, council members suggested.  </P> <P> "We have no obligation to inform the NRA of what we are going to do," council  President George Forbes said. "While they were watching California . . . we  were passing an ordinance S that is going to be very effective."  </P> <P> Under the new law, collectors of the assault weapons may keep them only if the  guns are rendered inoperable.  </P> <P> People found possessing any of the firearms within the city will be fined  $1,000.  </P></p>

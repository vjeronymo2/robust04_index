			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO NEW PRODUCTS;  </P> <P> SUCCESSFUL INVESTMENT MANAGER UPDATES 'BIBLE' OF HIS INDUSTRY  </P> <P> Literally hundreds of "how to" investment books are published each year, many  by dubiously qualified authors. But a new guide by Del Mar-based investment  manager Charles Brandes could have a legitimate claim to investors' attention.  </P> <P> Brandes, whose book entitled "Value Investing Today" was published in July by  Dow Jones-Irwin, knows what he is writing about. Barron's, the financial news  weekly, recently rated Brandes Investment Management as the seventh best global  equity management firm -- based on a 26% increase in value of funds managed in  1988.  </P> <P> Brandes, whose funds under management now total $174 million, up from $130  million on Dec. 31, also placed 17th best in Barron's five-year performance  survey.  </P> <P> The 46-year-old Pittsburgh native decided to write the book as a sort of update  of "Intelligent Investor," one of the two books he describes as "bibles of the  investment industry" that were co-written by Benjamin Graham. A former La Jolla  resident who died in 1976, Graham and David Dodd co-authored Brandes' other  bible, "Security Analysis."  </P> <P> After making Graham's acquaintance in the early 1970s, Brandes adopted his  "value investing philosophy completely." Greatly simplified, that approach is  to never pay more than "two thirds of the intrinsic value of any stock. That  gives you a margin of safety if problems arise."  </P> <P> Brandes said he learned from Graham always to "question conventional Wall  Street thinking. He was always thinking through from a fundamental standpoint  what was going on, what things were really worth, what you should pay for  them," Brandes said.  </P> <P> The most difficult part of "value investing" is the discipline not to overpay  for stocks, according to the Graham formula, and the patience to wait to sell  until the market recognizes the stocks' value, Brandes said.  </P> <P> In 1974, at the tender age of 31, Brandes figured the time was right to quit  the San Diego retail stock brokerage where he was employed because the stock  market was then at a cyclical low and cheap stocks abounded. So, with only  about $300,000 in funds committed, he hung out his shingle in Del Mar, where he  has been ever since.  </P> <P> Finding cheap stocks is always difficult, particularly in the current bull  stock market. Brandes and his staff of four investment managers scan data bases  and corporate financial statements of stocks the world over to make buys. His  firm charges 1% of funds managed as an annual fee and does not accept accounts  of less than $400,000.  </P> <P> His book has sold about 4,000 copies so far, a respectable showing, Brandes  said. He said he wrote the book mainly with the idea of better educating his  500 clients. CHRIS KRAUL  </P></p>

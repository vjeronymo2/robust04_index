			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Cautious times for entrepreneurs - In A Nutshell Owner-managed businesses appear to be optimistic about their future, but would-be entrepreneurs appear to be more cautious. That is the impression given in this month's Touche Ross survey of owner-managed businesses and National Westminster Bank's latest quarterly start-up index. According to Touche Ross, 74 per cent of respondents are anticipating a positive growth in turnover over the next 12 months. This confidence is backed up by improved sales and order levels in the last quarter at more than half the 197 businesses polled. Most promisingly 48 per cent are anticipating increasing staff over the next year, compared with 9 per cent expecting to reduce them and the remainder expecting no change. NatWest's figures, meanwhile, show that the number of small business start-ups in the second quarter of 1993 - around 90,000 - showed a slight dip on the 95,000 estimated for the first quarter. However, the six-month total of 185,000 was the same as that for the second half of 1992. 'New, small-business owners are thinking very carefully about the commitments they are prepared to take on, especially when other people's livelihoods are at risk as well as their own', according to Jane Bradford, who is head of small business services at NatWest. 'On average they spend nearly eight months planning their business venture before they actually start up'.</p>

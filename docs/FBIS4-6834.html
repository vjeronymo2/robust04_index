			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 25 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean and  Chinese trade ministers agreed Monday that Chinese provincial  governments should use more Korean steel, chemicals, foodstuffs  and machinery.    The agreement came as Trade, Industry and Energy Minister  Kim  Chol-su met with visiting Chinese Minister of Internal Trade  Zhang Haoruo for talks on promoting bilateral economic links.    Officials said Kim asked Zhang to open the Chinese market to  official auto imports from South Korea. He also requested  China's active interest in allowing South Korea's corporate  entry into the distribution market since it is linked with  bilateral trade expansion, officials said.    Zhang, in response, said South Korean companies should  invest  mainly in improving and building China's distribution network  including warehouses and marine transport centers.    The two trade ministers decided that Seoul would send a  government-private study team to China around June or July to  look into the distribution market.    They agreed that their governments would fully support the  planned construction of the Korea business center in Beijing and  an oil refinery that South Korea's Yukong hopes to build in  Liangchuan.</p>

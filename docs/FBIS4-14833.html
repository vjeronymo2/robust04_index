			<p>BFN     [Text] The newspaper Narodnoye Slovo, official organ of  Uzbekistan's Supreme Soviet and Cabinet of Ministers, sharply  criticized the idea of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev to  create a Euro-Asian Union. The article headed "Spring.  Restless politician is gambling" says, in particular, that the  words "Euro-Asian Union" are "for simpletons."    "Uzbekistan is still to grow up to Europe's level where the  states can allow such an extravagance -- unification without the  fear to appear under a foreign dictatorship," said the article.    In the opinion of the author, there exists a real threat to  appear under an alien dictatorship in the post-Soviet time. The  article underlined that "the essence of the idea to create the  Euro-Asian Union is the same -- to revive the former Soviet  Union and this cannot be assessed in any other way but as a pure  delirium."    This publication in the official press is the first reaction  of the Republic towards Nazarbayev's initiative. The article  was handed over to the newspaper by the national information  agency.</p>

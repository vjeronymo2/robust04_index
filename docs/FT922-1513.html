			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Liverpool council debt rescheduled A CONSORTIUM of foreign banks which lent Liverpool City Council Pounds 30m in 1984 has agreed to reschedule the remaining debt to give the city breathing space to tackle its troubles. The loan was made to avert a budget crisis in the then Militant-influenced authority. Negotiations were held in secret in January and the consortium, led by Banque Paribas, agreed to the rescheduling in March. Final payment of Pounds 17m was due on April 1. Now Pounds 15m of that principal will be repaid over the next five years. Liverpool still has two other big foreign bank loans to clear from its Militant era - Pounds 30m from Union Bank of Switzerland from 1985 and a similar sum from Yasuda of Tokyo the following year. Those two were deferred purchases, where a two or three-year holiday is followed by seven years of interest charges and repayments, pushing the cost of each to about Pounds 42m. The series of three Pounds 30m loans saved Liverpool from insolvency after the council repeatedly set deficit budgets to try to force the second Thatcher government to give it more money. The tactic was subsequently outlawed by the government. The money Liverpool borrowed went into the city's capital account to help pay for ambitious municipal housebuilding and neighbourhood improvements. The government was then encouraging the private sector and housing associations to form partnerships to do the job instead. Such deals are usually nego The rescheduling has enabled Liverpool to break a seemingly endless annual cycle of difficulties over debt repayment and budget crises bequeathed by its Militant-dominated council, 47 Labour members of which were disqualified from office for five years for financial mismanagement. Mr Harry Rimmer, Labour leader of the council, said at the weekend the council told Paribas it was fully prepared to repay the Pounds 17m but that rescheduling it would avert cuts, help economic regeneration and improve its ability to pay in the future. 'We budgeted conservatively and did not assume there would be a Labour government to bail us out,' he added. 'We were also able to show that despite our troubles last year, Liverpool has never reneged on a commitment.' The government supported Liverpool in the Paribas negotiations, as it did last year when the council took on the town-hall unions to win a seven-month strike and push through more than 3,000 redundancies to reduce overstaffing. The council is now run by a minority group of Labour moderates, who rely on Liberal Democrat support to keep at bay a rump of leftwingers expelled from the Labour party. Mr Tony Jennings, leader of the leftwing group, attended the negotiations over the rescheduling, however, and made a supportive statement. During last year's strikes Nalgo, the white-collar union, called out city treasury staff to try to make the council default on interest charges and debt repayments. Instead, senior managers did the clerical work and signed the cheques.</p>

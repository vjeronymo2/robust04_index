			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Hyundai chief blames government for woes THE founder of South Korea's Hyundai group, who has launched a party to challenge President Roh Tae-woo's government, blamed the government yesterday for the financial woes of the group's subsidiaries, Reuter reports from Seoul. 'Hyundai risks defaulting on bills due to the government's persistent credit control and tax investigation imposed on group subsidiaries,' Mr Chung Ju-yung, 70, was quoted as saying by a spokesman for his National Unification Party. Mr Roh's ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) attacked Mr Chung's statement as a ploy to win public sympathy before next month's general elections. 'Chung is resorting to blackmail. . . in a bid to fulfil his political ambition, making an illicit use of Hyundai group,' Mr Park Bum-jin, a DLP spokesman, said. Mr Chung initially refused to pay Won136.1bn (Pounds 101.8m) in penalty taxes but later changed his mind. Since then, domestic banks have frozen fresh loans to the group, the tax office has launched a second tax investigation and the Securities Supervisory Board has postponed approval on Hyundai units' rights issues for the sixth time, Hyundai officials said. Daewoo, South Korea's fourth largest business group, said yesterday it was suspending its plan for the first joint ventures with North Korea. Disappointed by the outcome of talks between the prime ministers of North and South last week, Seoul said any economic exchanges would be banned until North Korea allowed inspection of nuclear facilities. 'We have also decided to put off the plan to send our executives to North Korea for a feasibility study of the joint venture project,' a Daewoo spokesman said.</p>

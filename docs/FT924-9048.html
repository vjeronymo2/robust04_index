			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Clinton victory cheers white metals - Week in the Markets BILL CLINTON'S victory in Tuesday's US presidential election was given a warm welcome in the New York platinum and silver markets, where traders hoped the incoming administration might be able to stimulate the economy. And that optimism spilled over on to the London bullion market. Base metal traders, however, seemed to take little comfort from the prospect of a new hand on the helm of the US ship of state and all the London Metal Exchange contracts ended down on the week. Though there were no clear fundamental factors to justify platinum's rally, which took the London price to Dollars 366.50 a troy ounce yesterday afternoon, up Dollars 12.35 on the week, technical explanations abounded. The platinum market is traditionally firmer towards the end of the year, dealers told the Reuter news agency, and that seasonal factor might have been delayed by the US election. Chart patterns were looking bullish, they added, and the New York platinum market's rise had broken 'key resistance'. When the price slipped in early trading yesterday the dealers explained that the market was 'consolidating in a technical correction'. The long term downtrend had been broken on Thursday, they added, and if the price moved above Dollars 370 an ounce an important reversal would be signalled. Silver's post-election rally lifted the London spot price to 398.50 cents an ounce at one point. Yesterday the price moved below the key resistance point of 392 cents an ounce that had been breached on Thursday to close at 389.5 cents up 13 cents on the week. Traders, however, were not dismayed. The market was 'completing a small base pattern, underpinned in the 387-389-cent area', they told Reuter, adding that that should support a test of stiff resistance around 395-400 cents and a possible breakthrough up to 420 cents. Gold did not join in with the platinum and silver rallies as the market remained under pressure from forward producer selling. Large sales that appeared to emanate from central banks were also weighing on the market. In London the gold price closed yesterday at Dollars 334.05 an ounce, down Dollars 4.95 on the day and Dollars 5.60 on the week. The pound's continued weakness against the dollar helped the London Metal Exchange's sterling-denominated copper price to reach the highest level for more than two years at one point. But the fundamental gloom eventually overwhelmed the currency factor and the cash price ended the week Pounds 54.50 down at Pounds 1,397.50 a tonne, which translated into a nine-month dollar low of Dollars 2,148 a tonne, down Dollars 120 on the week. Lead, the LME's other sterling contract, was even weaker. As the extreme sluggishness of demand was underlined by a further 8,000-tonne rise in LME warehouse stocks, to 195,575 tonnes, the cash price slipped to Pounds 294.50 a tonne, down Pounds 28 on the week. Possibly more disappointing, however, were the falls in the zinc and nickel markets, where moderately bullish developments appeared to be ignored. The sustained uptrend in LME zinc stocks was reversed yesterday when a 5,225-tonne reduction took the total down to 382,525 tonnes. But the cash prices lost another Dollars 19 on the day to end the week Dollars 70.50 down at Dollars 1,022 a tonne. The bullish news for nickel was Wednesday's announcement by Falconbridge of Canada, the second biggest producer, that it was cutting output at its Sudbury, Ontario, mines by 15 per cent to 38,000 tonnes next year because of the price slump. However, the announcement produced only a modest rise in prices that day and by yesterday's close the cash quotation at the LME was down Dollars 480 on the week at Dollars 5,590 a tonne, the lowest level since early 1988. At the London Futures and Options Exchange cocoa prices reversed last week's falls and moved on to fresh nine-month highs. Sterling's weakness played a part but was responsible for only about Pounds 8 of the Pounds 47 rise that took the March position to Pounds 752 a tonne. Dealers noted that producers had mainly remained aloof, presumably waiting for further price gains before being tempted into the market. At the half-way point of talks in Geneva on reviving the moribund International Cocoa Agreement the gaps between producers and consumers on the price range to be defended and the amount of stocks to be withdrawn from the market had been narrowed somewhat. But they remained dauntingly wide - and the thorny issue of financing the agreement remained to be tackled.  -----------------------------------         LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  -----------------------------------       (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------- Aluminium    -425 to 1,427,950 Copper     +2,675 to   320,475 Lead       +2,000 to   195,575 Nickel       +978 to    57,216 Zinc       -5,225 to   382,525 Tin          -170 to    14,490  -----------------------------------</p>

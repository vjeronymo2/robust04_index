The economic revolution is only beginning in  Vietnam, however. Although it has only relatively recently  opened up its markets, that country, with its 70 million  inhabitants, has already achieved considerable successes.  [passage omitted]    Financial institutions are responding to these prospects.  Their interest in this geographic area was confirmed with the  launch of a capital investment fund called "Vietnam Vest." This  is a first in France. However, the Luxembourg fund does not  seek to attract private investors; it is open only to  institutional investors within the framework of a private  placement. Moreover, it will not involve the constitution of a  portfolio including companies quoted on the stock exchange. The  fund seeks to help French, European, and Asian companies to  penetrate the Vietnamese market by providing capital stock,  either directly of through joint ventures. It targets companies  operating in sectors with strong growth potential, such as the  agro-food, light industry, corporate services, health,  communications, and tourist sectors. The fund's role will not  remain limited to that of capital supplier. The Saigon-based  team managing the fund will also help companies exploring the  market, providing assistance with their search for partners,  their contacts with the Vietnamese authorities, and their actual  establishment.    The fund seeks to collect Fr30 million by June. Initially,  60 percent of its investments will go to joint ventures. In the  second phase, it intends to acquire interests in recently  created Vietnamese private companies, and to participate in the  privatizations planned for the end of this year.</p>

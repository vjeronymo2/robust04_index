			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY BACKS OFF PLAN TO CURB RENT HIKES  </P> <P> A proposed ordinance that would have limited rent increases at the city's three  mobile home parks to 7% over the next year was killed by the City Council on  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The council had tentatively approved the ordinance in an effort to persuade the  owner of the Laguna Terrace Mobilehome Park to limit increases to that amount.  </P> <P> But Tuesday night, council members unanimously agreed that owner Stephen  Esslinger is treating tenants fairly and is willing to work with those who  would be severely strained by larger rent increases.  </P> <P> On June 5, after months of grappling with ways to stabilize rents at mobile  home parks, the council lifted a six-month rent freeze while accepting  agreements with owners of the other two parks, Treasure Island and Thurston.  The Treasure Island agreement allows a 7% increase while freezing rents for  low-income seniors. The Thurston Mobile Home Park accord allows a 6% increase  but has no special provision for seniors.  </P> <P> Esslinger would agree only to keep rents in line with increases of the previous  year. He was satisfied with the council's action Tuesday. "Fair is a subjective  word. And what I thought was fair, the council thought was fair," he said.  LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

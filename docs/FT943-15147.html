			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Matra may buy BAe space arm British Aerospace and Matra Marconi Space are to hold a new round of negotiations in Paris this week over the possible sale of BAe's space systems division to the joint venture company between the French Lagardere technology and media group and the UK's General Electric Company (GEC). Matra officials, attending the latest US space shuttle launch carrying a space laboratory involving Matra technology, described the new talks with BAe as 'important'. Although the two sides appear close to an agreement after nearly two years of negotiations, Mr Armand Carlier, Matra Marconi Space's new chief executive, said it was still difficult to say if a deal would finally be clinched. 'Acquisitions in the space business are difficult because you have to make an assessment of both the past and future prospects of a proposed acquisition. The due diligence process takes long and is complex.' One hurdle which had delayed an agreement appears to have been resolved. This involved the Orion satellite to provide a private communication network for a group of large corporate users led by Chase Manhattan Bank of the US for which BAe is the prime contractor. BAe had difficulty finding a slot on a US rocket to launch the Orion satellite to meet the timetable of the satellite's customers. This now appears to have been resolved with a potential launch later this year or early next year on a Martin Marietta rocket. French officials indicated that Matra Marconi Space could have faced potentially heavy financial liabilities if it had acquired BAe's space systems division before the Orion issue was resolved. French concerns of potentially heavy pension obligations for the 1,000 BAe employees it would absorb also delayed agreement. Matra said that BAe's pension scheme was more onerous than the French company's equivalent. However, Matra appears keen to reach an agreement quickly because it sees the acquisition as a significant step in its efforts with Marconi to create an important European group in the space sector. The combined companies would create a FFr6.5bn (Pounds 780m) group employing more than 4,000. This would strengthen Matra Marconi Space's position in the increasingly competitive commercial space business.</p>

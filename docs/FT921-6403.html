			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Rate hopes recede THE UK MONEY market was quiet yesterday as most players resigned themselves to the belief that a UK base rate cut is unlikely to come before the Budget on March 10. Sterling interbank rates ended marginally firmer as lingering hopes of an imminent cut in base rates faded. Most traders now believe there will be a rate cut around Budget Day, or just after, in the 'window' before a general election is officially announced. The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange opened firmly as rate cut expectations remained intact. But it ended down four basis points on a moderate volume of trading at 89.86. The three months interbank rate was  1/32 higher at 10 9/32 -10 7/32 . Overnight money traded at close to 11 per cent during the day in the face of a substantial liquidity shortage, but finished lower at 10-10 9/16 . The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1bn early in the session. The main factors draining funds from the market were maturing treasury bills and assistance totalling Pounds 704m and Pounds 711m of bills for repurchase by the market. It acted early to relieve much of the shortfall, buying bills totalling Pounds 540m for resale to the market in equal amounts on March 17 and 18 at 10 7/16 per cent. The shortfall was later revised downwards to Pounds 900m, while in further operations the bank bought Pounds 149m of band one bank bills outright at 10 3/8 per cent and another Pounds 20m of bills for resale to the market in equal amounts on March 17 and 18 at 10 7/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the forecast was raised once more to Pounds 1bn, and the Bank purchased a further Pounds 179m band one bills at 10 3/8 per cent, and provided around Pounds 60m of late, unspecified assistance, bringing total liquidity injection for the day to Pounds 948m. Traders saw the three-week maturity of the repurchases as another sign that interest rates are unlikely to be cut, since rates are less likely to be reduced while a repo remains outstanding. German call money rates were slightly firmer after the Bundesbank drained a net DM3.7bn from the money market in its latest round of securities repurchase operations. Traders quoted overnight rates at 9.45/55 per cent, up slightly from 9.40/50 per cent on Tuesday, but unchanged from Monday's levels.</p>

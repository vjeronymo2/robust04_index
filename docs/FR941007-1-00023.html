That Ad also requires modification of the engine fire extinguishing system in the number two and number three engine struts, which, when accomplished, terminates the inspection requirements. The modification was required to be accomplished on all affected airplanes no later than February 20, 1993. That action was prompted by multiple reports of the support clamps in the number two and number three engine struts chafing a hole in the tubes of the engine fire extinguishing system. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent inadequate distribution of the fire extinguishing agent within the nacelle in the event of a fire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received reports of chafing of the tubes and/or cracking of the rubber blocks that are an integral part of the clamps in the inboard strut to wing area in the number two engine strut. (The tube and the rubber blocks were installed as part of the modification required by AD 92&hyph;14&hyph;07.) As a result of the chafing, one of the tubes on one airplane cracked approximately six inches from the forward end. Investigation revealed that the cracked tube had a notch near the cracked area of the tube that had been formed due to contact with a ground stud. This notch may have initiated the crack in the tube. Further investigation revealed that the rubber blocks, which support the tubes, were cracked between the stand-off spacers and the tubes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cause of such chafing and cracking has been attributed to movement between the spacer and the tube. This movement exceeded the flexibility of the rubber and stressed the rubber block, which subsequently pinched and tore the rubber block of the clamp. Such pinching and tearing could cause the clamp to fail and could lead to chafing of the fir extinguishing tube. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chafing of the fire extinguishing tube, if not corrected, could result in cracking of the fire extinguishing tube and consequently produce a hole in the fire extinguishing tube, which could prevent the proper distribution of the fire extinguishing agent within the nacelle in the event of a fire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;26A2226, dated June 30, 1994, which describes procedures for modification of the fire extinguishing system in the number two engine strut. This modification entails removing and replacing the fire extinguishing tube with a new, improved tube (for Group 1 and 2 airplanes); removing and reinstalling the existing fire extinguishing tube (for Group 3 airplanes); and replacing the channel and rubber blocks; and reworking the forward bracket (for Group 1, 2, and 3 airplanes). This modification would revise the geometry of the rubber block and the tube, which would increase the flexibility of the rubber block and would increase the clearance between the tube and the adjacent ground studs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require modification of the fire extinguishing system in the number two engine strut. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Siemens has decided to invest 300 million German  marks in the production of semiconductors in its  Ratisbonne-based plant (Germany), where the Dram 1's and 4 Mbits  and logical circuits in 1 micron technology are being produced.  Jurgen Knorr, head of the German group's semiconductor  division, had recently announced that the company considered  expanding one of its existing sites, on top of the planned  investments in Dresden, in the former GDR. Siemens is planning  to construct a new production unit in Ratisbonne, which will  mainly develop logic circuits, thus creating around 200 jobs.  Production at the new unit could start in mid-1995.</p>

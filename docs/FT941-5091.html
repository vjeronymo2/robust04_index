			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: State to cut BCI shares available to institutions The Italian government last night announced a clawback in shares available to institutions investing in Banca Commerciale Italiana in response to heavy demand from private investors. IRI, the state holding group, will place 192m shares with institutions, compared with the 240m originally earmarked. However, a further 30.7m shares held back for possible market stabilisation purposes is likely to be added to the institutional tranche. IRI is selling its entire 54 per cent stake in the bank, raising L2,900bn (Dollars 1.71bn). Mr Romano Prodi, chairman, sought a wide spread of ownership, but about three-quarters of the 1m-plus private investors who applied for shares will be disappointed. The group said it would only be able to meet applications - on a first-come, first-served basis - from 280,000 private investors, with the allotment of 1,000 shares each. There will be a further 28m bonus shares for investors holding their stake for three years and another 40m shares are set aside for bank employees. BCI shares rose 5 per cent last week on reports that companies linked to Mediobanca were buying stakes. One of these, the insurance group Generali, has said it has 2.6 per cent and intends to obtain the maximum 3 per cent stake carrying voting rights. New rules implemented last week require the names of companies holding more than 2.5 per cent of either BCI or Credito Italiano, the other bank privatised recently, to be declared immediately. However, one analyst said it was likely that a Mediobanca grouping was already close to acquiring upwards of 20 per cent of BCI and thus have a blocking syndicate. The identity of the big stakeholders may not become clear, however, until BCI holds a shareholders' meeting.</p>

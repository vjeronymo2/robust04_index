			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Fiat admits it paid Pounds 19m bribes MR GIOVANNI Agnelli, the chairman of Fiat, yesterday admitted that Italy's largest private group had paid L50bn (Pounds 19m) in bribes to politicians and their intermediaries over the past 10 years. Mr Agnelli also disclosed that Fiat planned to raise up to L3,000bn this year in asset sales to offset rising debt and the prospect of a 1993 operating loss close to L1,000bn. Details of the bribes are in the as yet unpublished accounts, but Mr Agnelli assured shareholders at the five-hour annual meeting: 'The total amount paid out in (illicit) contributions to political parties over a decade by the managers of Fiat group companies have had no significant repercussions on the profits of the group.' He said there was no case of accounts having been falsified because the amounts were minimal in relation to assets, although some accounting adjustments had been made. He insisted that 'at consolidated level, we feel that the amount of these payments in no way affects reliability of our financial statements since the total is no more than 0.024 per cent of consolidated stockholders' equity'. In this respect, Mr Agnelli yesterday showed his full faith in Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, the chief financial officer and one of the two most senior executives to be jailed while being interrogated on charges of alleged corruption. Defending the behaviour of some 20 executives in six companies involved in magistrates' inquiries into corruption, Mr Agnelli said: 'Our managers claim they were obliged to make such payments to prevent their companies from being forced out of the market or to avoid harassment in the course of the public works or supply contracts'. Mr Agnelli was vague about the extent of his suspicions of the level of corruption in Italy, but conceded he had had some reservations about Cogefar-Impresit, the group's construction arm. Mr Caesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive officer, also defended his role in the corruption affair. He said that when the scale of Fiat's involvement became clear, a meeting of the group's co-ordination committee was called and a new ethical code drawn up. Background, Page 28</p>

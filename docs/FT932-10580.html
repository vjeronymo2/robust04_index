			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Local Government Elections: Tories eclipsed by Lib Dems - Higher-than-usual turnout as voters reject recovery claims THE Conservatives had a disastrous day yesterday. They now retain control of only one county - Buckinghamshire. Once 44 of the 47 councils had announced complete results, the Conservatives bore a net loss of 452 seats, with a net gain for Labour of 86, and a big net gain for the Liberal Democrats of 363. In Wales, Plaid Cymru gained 12, mostly from Labour. The Liberal Democrats were boosted by the fact that the last county council elections - in 1989 - came as the party's fortunes reached their nadir following the merger of the Liberals and the Social Democrats. In those contests, the Conservatives gained 77 seats across the country, and Labour 67. Turnout varied across the country, but was healthy by the standards of county council elections, at around 40 per cent, according to the Association of County Councils. Psychologically embarrassing results for the Conservatives came from a line of south coast counties. They lost overall control of Kent, Hampshire, and both East and West Sussex, where the Liberal Democrats became the largest party. They also relinquished control of Surrey, Hertfordshire, Lincolnshire and Warwickshire. Essex, which had entered election mythology as the centre for the Conservatives' victory in last year's general election, inflicted 22 losses on the party. They were still marginally the strongest party with 35, compared with 32 for Labour and 30 for the Liberal Democrats. Mr Bill Dixon Smith, chairman of the Association of County Councils, who represented a seat near Colchester, was a casualty. East Anglia, basking in prosperity in 1989, repeated the pattern for the south-east with the Conservatives losing control of Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. The Liberal Democrats' gains were greatest in their traditional stronghold of the south-west. They gained Cornwall, and Somerset, which had previously been controlled by the Conservatives, with a gain of 21 seats while the Tories lost 18. The Liberal Democrats now have 41 seats to the Conservatives' 13. They wrested control of Dorset from the Conservatives, with a gain of 17, to become the largest single party with 38 seats to the Conservatives' 29. Devon produced a spectacular swing to the Liberal Democrats, whose representation rose from 11 to 41. The Conservatives suffered a fall from 56 to 18, while Labour advanced from 13 to 21. In Cumbria, where the Conservatives had harboured outside hopes of taking overall control, Labour, already the largest party, increased its tally by one despite an embarrassing mistake when two of its existing councillors failed to file nomination papers in time. Labour held on to the councillors it already held, but made few gains, only taking overall control of one new county, Northamptonshire, where it added just five seats, with the Conservatives losing seven, and the Liberal Democrats gaining three. Unusual results included the former Monster Raving Loony Party candidate, who deprived the Conservatives of a seat on Devon county council, while a Green party councillor was elected in Oxfordshire. And one of Labour's winning candidates in Northants was the wife of Lady Thatcher's cousin.</p>

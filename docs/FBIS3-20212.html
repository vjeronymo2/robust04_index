			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas received U.S. Ambassador  Richard Boucher this morning. In a statement after his meeting  with Boucher, which lasted for nearly 60 minutes, Denktas said  that he briefed the ambassador on the latest developments.    [Begin Denktas recording] We briefed the ambassador on the  latest developments. Naturally, the United States regards  itself as being closely concerned with the matter because it has  significant influence in the UN Security Council, that is,  together with Britain. They insisted that a result be achieved  by the end of the month.    However, we must not be held responsible for the delay in  the  process, that is, if a delay is in question. The main reason  for that is the recent move made by the UN officials to put  forward matters that were neither included in the package nor  related to it and to refuse to have them discussed. Those  matters have to do with our security. Therefore, we insist on  discussing them.    A tangible form has not yet been given to the promises that  were made to us at the beginning; that is, the promises that  were made in the reports drawn up by the experts. We have been  informed that we should sign the agreement because a tangible  form will be given to them.    However, a tangible form must be given to the promises that  have been made about our rights for me to say yes to the package  and have it approved by the Republican Assembly. That is  necessary and inevitable. In no way can I inform the Republican  Assembly that we will place Maras [Varosha] under UN  jurisdiction and that the work on the rights that will be given  to us will be maintained and we will gain those rights in the  near future. Negotiations cannot be held like that. The  proposal for the demilitarization of an area to the south of  Maras, an area which is under our control, concerns our  security. That is a new factor that is not related to the  package. That matter has been brought up as a new issue,  regardless of the fact that we have been informed by the highest  official that that area will remain under our control and our  security will not be threatened.    There are several other issues to be discussed. We are ready  to maintain the talks if they also wish to do so. However, if  they wish to find alternatives, then they need time to do so.  We cannot agree to a process of negotiations in which one of  the parties would approach the matter with the concept that the  problem has to be resolved by this or that day, otherwise this  or that side will be penalized. The Cyprus problem did not  begin today. Nor can it be resolved in two or five days or even  five months. It is a legal matter and a question of rights.    The Greek Cypriot side has created the Cyprus problem. The  Greek Cypriots have done everything they can to destroy us and  usurp our rights. They continue to regard the rights they have  usurped from us as being their own rights. No one has bothered  to consider that fact. Several developments have taken place in  the Greek Cypriot side. The Greek Cypriots provoke us every  day. The preparations they make and the approach they maintain  indicate that they want to place all of Cyprus under their  control. No one seems to be bothered by all that. Attention  has been focused only on the package of confidence-building  measures. However, an atmosphere of confidence is required for  the talks on that package. We have been informed on the many  developments and statements in the Greek Cypriots side, which  further strengthen the lack of confidence. That should also be  considered. [end recording]</p>

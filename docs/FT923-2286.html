			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Rome draws up austerity budget to tackle deficit THE Italian government yesterday announced cost-cutting and revenue-raising measures totalling L93,000bn (Pounds 41.2bn) in a 1993 budget package designed to tackle the country's budget deficit. However, the scale of the savings disappointed some economists, who had been calling for measures worth up to L120,000bn to cut the deficit and counter the impact of higher interest rates and inflation. The package envisages L43,000bn in spending cuts and L42,000bn in revenue-raising measures, mainly from new taxes and charges. A further L7,000bn is expected in privatisation proceeds. The government plans to freeze spending next year at 1992 levels. Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, stressed that the credibility of the government and the lira were linked to his budget plans. 'We must restore to Italians our own self-confidence and, for those watching from abroad, confidence in our country and currency,' he said. The bulk of the savings will come from cuts in Italy's generous state pensions system. Under the latest scheme, the pensionable ages will be raised. Further savings will come by freezing a 1.8 per cent pensions rise due in November, and next year's increase in pensions will be linked to the rise in the cost of living, rather than to salary levels which are normally higher. Meanwhile, salaries for the 3m public sector employees due to renegotiate their contracts next year, except for schoolteachers, will be frozen at this year's levels. There will also be a freeze on public sector hiring. In an attempt to win the support of union leaders, the government put forward measures to curb tax evasion and show the burden was being spread fairly. Tax-dodging, rife among the self-employed, will be countered by introducing a form of 'minimum tax' to prevent the self-employed from declaring an income lower than their employees. Free medicines and a variety of other public health benefits will be abolished for those earning over L40m a year, while extra charges are to be imposed on large cars, boats and aircraft. Mr Piero Barucci, treasury minister, said the measures, for the first time, were focused on cutting spending rather than on raising income. Details of the package prompted some recovery in the lira, the value of which had declined against that of the D-Mark yesterday. On the stock market, prices made up part of the ground lost on Wednesday. Series of surrenders for Amato Page 2 Currencies Page 35 World stocks Page 41</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The United States  and the South Korean puppets are reportedly having consultations  to hasten the projected deployment of Patriot missiles in South  Korea.    It is an unpardonable grave military challenge to scheme to  introduce Patriot missiles in South Korea at a time when  DPRK-U.S. contacts have taken place and the third round of  DPRK-U.S. talks are expected for a fundamental solution to the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    It is self-evident that the deployment of Patriot missiles  in  South Korea will key up the tensions on the Korean peninsula and  increase the danger of war.    This scheme vividly shows the reckless attempt of the United  States and the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique to contain the  DPRK militarily has gone beyond the danger line.    The hostile forces of the United States and the South Korean  puppet clique claim that the deployment of Patriot missiles is  to "counter the threat of missile attack from North Korea." But  this is no more than a crafty plea to justify their dangerous  introduction of lethal weapons.    The real purpose of their massive shipment of Patriot  missiles into South Korea under the pretext of "threat of  missile attack" is to impede the progress of the DPRK-U.S.  talks for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula and impose their unreasonable demand for  "nuclear inspection" on the DPRK through pressure and threat.    The projected deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea  is motivated by the persistent anti-socialist, anti-DPRK  campaign of the United States.    Not content with the deployment of more than 1,000 nuclear  weapons in South Korea, the traitor Kim Yong-sam allowed the  introduction of Patriot missiles to kill fellow countrymen. By  doing so, he revealed once again his true color as a heinous  traitor, flunkeyist and "civilian" fascist outdistancing the  preceding military fascist dictators.    If the United States and its followers think they can subdue  the DPRK with pressure and threat, it is a big mistake. That  method may lead the situation to a hopeless phase, far from  resolving the problem.    The United States must look straight at the reality and act  with discretion and drop at once the reckless plan of Patriot  missile deployment in South Korea.</p>

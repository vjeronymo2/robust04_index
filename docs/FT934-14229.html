			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Institution supports Lonhro LONRHO'S big institutional shareholders have given unequivocal support to Mr Dieter Bock's attempts to stamp his authority on the conglomerate with the appointment of non-executive directors. The German financier, who was appointed earlier this year as joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland, remains confident that tomorrow's board meeting will accept his nominated non-executives: Mr Peter Harper, director of Hanson, the conglomerate, and Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher, food processor and distributor. Mr Bock has had support from four big institutional shareholders: Fidelity Management Research, the US investment fund, with 8.9 per cent; Genting, one of Malaysia's biggest companies with 3.9 per cent; PDFM, the Union Bank of Switzerland fund management arm with 2 per cent and Postel, with 1.5 per cent.</p>

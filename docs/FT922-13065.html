			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Chicago business area in chaos after flooding A FLOOD in Chicago's underground tunnel system yesterday plunged the city into chaos. Trading was halted at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's two largest futures markets, and thousands of office workers and hotel guests were evacuated. Flooding began at about 6:30am after the rupture of a passageway in the city's 93-year-old underground tunnel system. Although not officially confirmed, it is believed a construction crew working near the Kinzie Street bridge over the Chicago River accidentally punctured the wall while sinking pilings. Water poured into the underground tunnel system, originally built for coal delivery and rubbish removal but now mainly used for freight and telecommunications cables. A third of the downtown area, known as the Loop, lost electricity in the early morning and further cuts were expected. No injuries were reported. The mass transit system was paralysed downtown and the city hall was flooded. By mid-day, despite pumping, the water level was still rising. Emergency crews struggled to slow the water flow into the tunnels and plug the hole. The Army Corps of Engineers was working to lower the level of the Chicago River, which flows through the centre of the city, by closing a series of locks connecting the river and Lake Michigan. Although the futures exchanges, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the largest US options market, and other businesses hoped to reopen this morning, by late yesterday afternoon it remained unclear how soon the tunnels could be cleared.</p>

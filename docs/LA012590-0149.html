			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAN STEPS UP ITS CRITICISM OF SOVIET ACTIONS IN AZERBAIJAN  </P> <P> Hard-line voices in Tehran on Wednesday notched up their criticism of the  Soviet military crackdown in Azerbaijan, the Muslim-dominated republic on  Iran's northern border.  </P> <P> The morning after an open letter by members of the Iranian Parliament demanded  that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev "deal with the Muslims of the Soviet  Union with compassion," an editorial in the daily Kayhan International  condemned Moscow's handling of the unrest.  </P> <P> "What the (Soviet) empire is facing now is basically due to the nature by which  it was created, namely annexations," the newspaper said. "Large parts of Iran  in the north were separated into the Soviet empire."  </P> <P> By contending that the 7 million Soviet Azerbaijanis were clipped off from  Iranian Azerbaijan and its 9 million Muslims, the editorial raised border  questions that Moscow and Tehran have both sought to suppress.  </P> <P> Already stung by statements of the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Shiite  spiritual leader, and other Tehran leaders on the religious aspects of the  turmoil among Soviet Azerbaijanis, Moscow officials were taking a harder tone  too.  </P> <P> Moscow Radio warned Iranian listeners: "Any unconsidered nationalistic or  religious appeals would be dangerous. . . . Brutal and illusory nationalistic  flights of fancy have dragged the people to the brink of the precipice."  </P> <P> In Moscow, First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander A. Bessmertnykh met  Wednesday with the Iranian ambassador, Naser Heirany Nobari. The Soviet news  agency Tass, reporting the meeting, gave no details on what was discussed. It  said the two took up the border crisis and that Nobari delivered a note from  Iranian authorities.  </P> <P> Iran's ruling political circle has taken a cautious line on the Azerbaijani  developments, supporting the religious rights of the Soviet Muslims but  avoiding outright criticism of the crackdown itself and even expressing  understanding of the need for control.  </P> <P> The Tehran Times, which generally supports the line taken by President Hashemi  Rafsanjani, has said that Iran seeks no change in the present borders.  Rafsanjani himself has so far made no public comment on the situation.  </P></p>

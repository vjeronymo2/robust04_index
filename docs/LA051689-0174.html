			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BAJA 500 TO MOVE, BAR CYCLES, ATVS  </P> <P> t month's Baja 500 off-road race has been moved from Ensenada to San Felipe  because of ranchers' threats to disrupt the annual event through the Mexican  desert.  </P> <P> The site change has prompted Los Angeles-based SCORE, which sponsors the  competition, to restrict entries in the June 3 race to cars and trucks. SCORE  President Sal Fish said motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles will be barred  because the new course looks "rather fast, and I think it would be too risky."  </P> <P> Ranchers living along the part of the usual race route in mountains east of  Ensenada had threatened to block part of the course with heavy equipment,  saying racers have destroyed their roads and fences and killed their cattle.  Fish and Mexican tourism officials agreed to move the race to San Felipe, 140  miles south of the U.S.-Mexico border on the eastern Baja California coast.  </P></p>

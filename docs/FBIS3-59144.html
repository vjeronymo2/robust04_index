According to the court, he sent identical letters to Christian  Democratic Union [CDU] Chairman Helmut Kohl and Christian Social  Union [CSU] Chairman Theo Waigel, informing them that he wants  to run for president. Herzog had said for weeks he would not  make his final decision until the CDU/CSU leadership had  nominated him officially. On Monday evening [24 January], the  CDU and CSU leaderships agreed to ask the 59-year-old Bavarian  to run for president, to be elected by the Federal Assembly in  Berlin on 23 May. Until then, Herzog wants to remain a  constitutional judge and president of the court. [passage  omitted].</p>

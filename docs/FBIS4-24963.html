			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Academy of  Engineering (CAE), the country's highest institution in the  field of engineering technology, was inaugurated today at the  opening of the seventh academicians' conference of the Chinese  Academy of Sciences (CAS).    During the first grand gathering of the two academies,  scientists and engineers will explore China's future development  in science and technology and elect the first batch of foreign  academicians for the CAS, the country's top scientific body, as  well as elect its president and vice-presidents.    All the seven members of the Standing Committee of the  Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central  Committee -- Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu  Rongji, Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao -- met with the academicians  present at the two conferences and posed for a picture with them.    Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,  congratulated them on the inauguration of the CAE and the  holding of the seventh academicians' conference of CAS.    Jiang called the period from now until the middle of the  next  century a great historical period for the invigoration of the  Chinese nation.    He said it is imperative to rely on scientific and  technological advances to achieve the economic and social  development, well-being of the people and prosperity of the  nation, in a country with the world's largest population, weak  foundation and relatively lower stock of natural resources, he  said.    The establishment of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, he  noted, will give scope to the creativity of engineers and help  promote the research, design, construction and operation of the  engineering technology, said Jiang.    In his address to the conference, Premier Li Peng said China  will unswervingly implement the guiding principle of Deng  Xiaoping's thesis: "Science and technology is the first  productive force," adhere to the principle that "economic  construction should rely on science and technology while science  and technology must serve economic construction".    He said the target of China's scientific and technological  restructuring is to build a new structure which goes with the  development of the socialist market economy and the development  value of science and technology, integration of science and  technology with the economy so as to promote scientific and  technological advances.    He expressed the hope that CAS and CAE will work together to  make greater contributions for the modernization of the country.    Lu Jiaxi, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress, and honorary chairman of the  Presidium of CAS, delivered an opening speech at the conference.  Zhou Guangzhao, president of CAS, and Zhu Guangya, executive  chairman of the Presidium of the inauguration conference of CAE,  made their work reports to the conference.    During the conference, the Chinese scientists will elect the  first batch of foreign academicians for CAS, amend and pass "the  Academicians' Constitution of CAS" and issue the Hua Luogeng  Science Award.    "The Constitution of CAE" will be discussed and drafted  during the current conference.    Among those present at today's conference were also Zou  Jiahua, member of the Political Bureau of CPC Central Committee  and vice-premier, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political  Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central  Committee, Song Jian, state councillor and minister in charge of  the State Science and Technology Commission, Luo Gan, state  councillor and secretary-general of the State Council, as well  as Qian Weichang and Qian Zhengying, both vice-chairmen of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference.</p>

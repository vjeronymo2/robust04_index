			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIDDEN HILLS POLL FINDS MOST OPPOSE HOUSING PLAN  </P> <P> More than two-thirds of Hidden Hills residents who responded to an advisory  poll oppose plans to build low-cost housing for senior citizens on the edge of  the exclusive community, city officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> But the town's mayor, who earlier had hoped the poll would vindicate the  council's support for the low-cost housing plan, said a low turnout weakened  the poll's authority.  </P> <P> "We basically failed to get the sense of the community," Mayor Chris K. Van  Peski said. Only 410 of the 1,100 registered voters eligible to participate  took part in the poll.  </P> <P> The poll asked four questions, including whether the council should move ahead  with its plan to build lower-cost housing.  </P> <P> To that key question, 282 residents said no, and 125 said yes.  </P> <P> Two other questions sought opinions on annexation and continued use of a  redevelopment agency, both of which are related to the affordable housing plan.  To annexation, 297 were opposed and 107 in favor. Continuance of the  redevelopment agency was opposed 279 to 127.  </P> <P> The council is scheduled to meet tonight to discuss the non-binding poll.  </P> <P> Under the plan supported by the City Council, a developer would build a 46-unit  project for senior citizens on part of 25 acres the city would annex from Los  Angeles County.  </P> <P> On 20 acres, the developer would build nine luxury homes within the gated  community that would be accessible by its private roads. The remaining five  acres -- outside the gates and roads -- would include the senior housing  project and commercial office space.  </P> <P> The plan would allow the city to settle a lawsuit by Los Angeles County and a  private attorney over its use of a redevelopment agency to fund a flood-control  project. The suit cited state law that requires 20% of redevelopment funds to  be spent on affordable housing.  </P> <P> A leader of the Concerned Citizens Committee, which is opposed to the  lower-cost housing plan, said the poll clearly indicated that most Hidden Hills  residents want the council to reject the plan.  </P> <P> "The message is obvious. . . . I don't think people want this community to  change," said Susan Porcaro, who, along with two other committee members, has  taken out papers to run in the April 10 council election. Incumbents Van Peski,  Colleen Hartman and Warren H. McCament also have taken out papers.  </P> <P> Hartman said she had considered declining to seek reelection but will run again  because of the affordable housing dispute.  </P> <P> "I don't know how to read it," Hartman said of the poll. Opponents were more  likely to respond to the poll, she said.  </P> <P> "We really haven't gotten what we hoped for, which was a decisive yes or a  decisive no," Hartman said. "You just don't have enough people voting."  </P></p>

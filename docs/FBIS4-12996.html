			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on the downing of two foreign  helicopters by U.S. aircraft in northern Iraq, the political  editor of the Iraqi News Agency [INA] wrote today the following:    The downing of these two helicopters has tangibly revealed  the tendentious, premeditated intentions of U.S. and Western  quarters and their agents in the autonomous region.    When the incident took place, the agent quarters in the  autonomous region, as well as U.S. and Western quarters,  initially said that the helicopters were shot down by Iraqi  aircraft. When the truth came out and it was learned that the  U.S. side was the one that downed the two helicopters, those  quarters remained silent and could not avoid the truth. It  seems they were forced to tell the truth because those who were  killed in the incident were of several nationalities so the  truth could not be hidden. Therefore, their black intentions to  involve Iraq in any matter were exposed.    This tendentious approach in leveling accusations against  Iraq betrays premeditated intentions against Iraq. It also  reveals the truth about many previous tendentious accusations  regarding incidents that took place in the northern region in  which Iraq was falsely accused in a tendentious, hasty manner.</p>

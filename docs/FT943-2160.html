			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Gatt targets Taiwan rice Taiwan is under pressure to open its rice market and drop restrictions on Japanese car imports as it enters fresh talks on joining the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade. Taiwan, which hopes to join the world trade body by the end of the year, has sent Mr Sheu Ke-sheng, vice-minister of economic affairs, to a final round of meetings in Geneva with the US, the EU, Switzerland, Singapore and Argentina, before decisive Gatt meetings in October and November. The US is urging Taiwan to open its market to rice imports, a politically sensitive area in Taiwan. Taiwan is lobbying for an approach similar to that agreed with Korea, under which imports will be phased in gradually over 10 years. But it may be forced, like Japan, to accept a six-year adjustment period. Beef-exporting countries such as Australia and New Zealand want Taiwan to end discrepancies in grading of beef imports which they believe grant favourable tariff rates to US beef. And fruit exporters want tariffs lowered from a maximum of 40 per cent to a maximum of 20 per cent on imports of eight kinds of fruit. Japan is keen that Taiwan end its ban on direct imports of cars from Japan. Japanese cars may be sold in Taiwan only if they are made locally through a joint venture or if they are produced in a third country. Taiwan has already agreed in principle to get rid of this after entering Gatt. However the tariffication system to be imposed in its place is also under debate. Taiwan is also being asked to cut tariffs on imported motor parts. Gatt members are pressing Taiwan to dismantle its alcohol and tobacco monopoly by the end of this year and accord foreign suppliers of cigarettes and alcohol national treatment. Taiwan is proposing to send revised legislation to parliament before the end of the year and implement a new system by the end of June 1995. Taiwan has also been asked to remove import quotas on fisheries products, which it has agreed except in the case of squid and mackerel. Services is the least contentious area, with the main Gatt members having in principle accepted Taiwan's proposed concessions.</p>

Seated in the back of a VIP van, Dr. Stolpe, prime minister  pf Brandenburg, says jokingly: "I have just completed a two-year  anniversary." During that time, not a week went by without new  accusations being revealed about his work as the highest lawyer  of the East German Evangelical Church. He supposedly had  "betrayed" people, had received expensive presents, money, and  an honorary distinction from the Stasi.    There is no conclusive evidence. The sources are mostly  former Stasi officers who sold their information to the  tabloids, or to serious newspapers and TV stations for hard  German marks. In February, an investigative parliamentary  committee published its final report on this affair. Stolpe,  who defended his Stasi contacts by pointing out that he had been  acting on behalf of the church, has some prominent allies.  Former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, for example, is speaking of a  witch hunt.    [Vaessen] Mr. Stolpe, you have bene attacked for two years.  How do you put up with it?    [Stolpe] I am constantly under attack. You only can take  this if you have a clear conscience, if you know that the  population is behind you. My faith also gives me strength.  [passage omitted]    [Vaessen] This week Herbert Wehner, the one-time legendary  leader of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany], was  accused of spying and treason. Will the Stasi ghost play a role  in the campaigns of this super election year, in which the  citizens have to go to the polls 19 times?    [Stolpe] Count on it. You could say that the attack on  Wehner is the start of such a campaign. The aim is clear: The  social democrats in western Germany, who are in a good position,  have to be discredited. In the western part of the country,  ghost stories about the Stasi and the KGB undoubtedly make an  impression on voters. In the eastern part of the country, an  opposite effect can be observed.    On the other hand, I am also anticipating revelations about  the Christian Democrats and Liberals who are still bearing  political responsibility at the moment. For example, on the way  in which they collaborated with Eastern Europe. Let it be clear  that credibility in politics will be lost.    [Vaessen] Do you suspect that Chancellor Kohl's CDU  [Christian Democratic Union] is behind the attack on Wehner?    [Stolpe] I suspect a quite evident political interest on the  part of people who fear the SPD might become too strong. They  hope to succeed in damaging the party by slandering the SPD  patriarch.    [Vaessen] The former communists, united in the PDS [Party of  Democratic Socialism], are gaining votes in the former GDR. The  extreme right also believes it can benefit. How dangerous is  the present situation in eastern Germany?    [Stolpe] It is not dangerous, but it is a political problem.  The PDS is swiping our issues before the election campaign, and  is working in a highly populist manner. They promise everyone  work, but they do not say how they will finance this.    The danger is that the former communists could become rabble  rousers, striking a cord in people regarding their deepest  desires, in the same way Chancellor Kohl succeeded in the 1990  parliamentary elections by promising prosperity for all.    [Vaessen] There is much talk of the colonial mentality among  West Germans. In your party, the roles are not distributed very  differently. The West German members of the SPD are determining  what happens, while the East Germans have nothing to say?    [Stolpe] I am against any settlement that automatically  attributes us executive positions merely because we are East  Germans. It is quite different from the situation in 1989 (the  year in which the Wall came down -- ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD editor's  note), when East Germans were carried to the podium. In terms  of membership numbers, we are small; but there are a relatively  large number of SPD voters in the east. That should give us  self-confidence. And we must not be too timid. We must make  our voice heard.    [Vaessen] Do West German politicians have sufficient  knowledge and understanding for East German problems, such as  high unemployment, low incomes, poor housing? It is a fact that  only a few politicians are taking the trouble to acquaint  themselves on the spot with the situation in the east.    [Stolpe] We could say there is a lack of understanding on  both sides. In the east, people are too quick to claim "they do  not understand us." We must beware of tearful narcissism, and  dismal self-pity. We must be frank with our West German  political allies, and tell each other the hard truth. [passage  omitted]</p>

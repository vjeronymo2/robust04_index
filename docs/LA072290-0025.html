			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK AS IT NEARS 40: RUNNING ON EMPTY?  </P> <P> Ten years ago I came to the same conclusion as Hilburn's article -- rock was,  indeed, running on empty. However, I got off my duff and began cruising the  radio dial to see if it had changed coats and moved on, and by God -- I found  it!  </P> <P> Punk/alternative/new wave/college music or  whatever-the-hell-you-want-to-call-it has single-handedly carried the rock  flame through the '80s with all the imagination, guts, humor and passion of the  original.  </P> <P> Oingo Boingo, Midnight Oil, the Cure, Depeche Mode, Morrisey, Billy Idol and  U2, among others, have each created a body of work that rivals any of the  so-called legends of rock, and, remarkably, they've done it, for the most part,  without Top 40-format radio.  </P> <P> No, Robert, rock as a creative, exciting, fun, Mom-and-Dad-still-hate-it entity  is not running on empty -- it just put on a little eye shadow and moved up the  dial to 106.7 (KROQ).  </P> <P> RICHARD J. TAFILAW  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCK MARKET  </P> <P> In response to Ben Wattenberg's admonition to "Be Wily but Buy, for the Market  Is America and Its Future Is Golden" (Op-Ed Page, Oct. 17):  </P> <P> I think he left out some important indicators which might improve one's chances  in our great American stock market.  </P> <P> First of all, don't be in a stock-intensive situation just before any Friday  the 13th, or probably Halloween, for that matter. Market players and their  computers seem to be a bit on the superstitious side (or maybe they know  something that we don't). Also, avoid vulnerability around anniversaries of  previous crashes, "black" days, etc. Anyone with half a brain knows that  lightning always strikes twice (or more).  </P> <P> Next, be aware of the health of people important to the market cycles and  strengths, i.e., President Bush's finger surgery. The implications are  staggering!  </P> <P> Finally, and perhaps most crucial, don't ignore the phase of the moon. In case  no one noticed, this recent black Friday (Oct. 13) was very close to a full  moon. Has anyone considered how many trusted stockbrokers, LBO operators and  junk-bond dealers might be werewolves? Frightening.  </P> <P> Other than that, go for the gold -- except maybe on Arbor Day.  </P> <P> ALLAN RABINOWITZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Concern over undertaking on role by BBC governors DOUBTS WERE being expressed at senior levels in the BBC last night that the corporation's governors intend to follow through an undertaking made on Thursday to clearly redefine their roles and responsibilities. It emerged yesterday that the governors had been angered by criticisms of their role in the appointment of Mr John Birt, first as deputy director-general and then, from January 1 this year, as director-general. Those criticisms, by the BBC's 41-member general advisory council, have apparently encouraged the governors to dig their heels in and resist pressure to undertake a thorough reform of their role. One senior source at the BBC said yesterday: 'The only thing that is likely to change the mood of the governors now is if any of the general advisory council members threaten to resign in protest.' The dominance of Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the board of governors, over the activities of the board of governors will not be affected by Thursday's statement. A source close to the governors said things would go on as before. Four of the governors, including Lord Barnett, vice-chairman, are due to retire at the end of July. However, 'even after they are gone the chairman will still be there, as will the director-general,' said a figure in the BBC yesterday. The general advisory council is not due to meet again for several months. But several of its members, including Mr Robert MacClennan, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, have indicated their firm wish that Mr Hussey should resign. Were pressure from the council to eventually force a much firmer intention of the board of governors to re-define its responsibilities and activities, a political dimension would enter the furore. Depending on how far-reaching reform of the governors' practices were to be, the the BBC charter itself may have to be amended. That amendment could be made only with the agreement of Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, and would have to be approved by parliament. Meanwhile, it was still unclear yesterday whether Mr Birt has agreed to give a financial indemnity to the BBC if problems with the Inland Revenue emerged due to a reassessment of his tax status. Some accountants believe that if Mr Birt was judged to have been an employee of the BBC for tax purposes it would be possible for the Inland Revenue to claw back PAYE tax liabilities and national insurance contributions from the BBC.</p>

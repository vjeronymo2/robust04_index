			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Mercedes-Benz unveils people's car prototype - Carmakers jostle for stake in China project Mercedes-Benz was prepared to invest up to DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in China to build 250,000 models a year of its 'people's car' designed specifically for the local market, a senior representative of the German carmaker said yesterday. Mr Jurgen Hubbert, head of Mercedes-Benz's car division, said that efforts to win Chinese approval for the family car project were part of the 'globalisation' of the company's business. 'The increasing internationalisation of world business has led the company to go one step further than export or foreign assembly,' he said. 'Mercedes-Benz is now looking for overseas production locations where it will not just assemble, but develop and manufacture passenger cars of the highest quality.' Mr Hubbert was speaking after Mercedes-Benz had unveiled its prototype Family Car China (FCC) at a lavish exhibition in Beijing, attended by 22 international carmakers showing their wares in an attempt to be selected as partners in a Chinese people's car project. China's Ministry of Machinery Industry, responsible for the vehicle sector, said it would select successful bidders within a year. It is not clear whether there will be more than one company selected. China announced earlier this year that it aimed by the year 2000 to have built an industry capable of supplying 90 per cent of domestic requirements of about 1.5m cars annually. China manufactured 234,000 cars last year. Among Mercedes-Benz's competitors are Porsche and Volkswagen of Germany, Nissan and Toyota of Japan, Fiat of Italy, Daewoo and Hyundai of South Korea and General Motors and Ford of the US. Porsche, like Mercedes-Benz, has developed a prototype for the Chinese market known as the C88. To overcome scepticism about the involvement of a luxury carmaker in the project, Porsche executives are publicising the fact that it was Ferdinand Porsche who designed and built the first Volkswagen in the mid-1930s. Mr Stefan Geist, Porsche's marketing manager, said that one of the company's aims was to show that 'we not only produce sports cars, we are also able to do other things like providing design and engineering services'. Unlike Mercedes-Benz, whose interest is in a 50-50 joint venture producing cars, Porsche wants to supply basic design and engineering assistance to a Chinese manufacturer in return for a fee or royalty on models produced. Ford, which is showing its Fiesta and other small models in Beijing this week, also invoked the past to strengthen its claims to participate in the people's car project. Referring to the Model T Ford, the world's first mass-produced car, Mr Wayne Booker, executive vice-president for international automotive operations, said: 'Ninety-one years ago Henry Ford had a vision of providing the greatest good for the greatest number of people. From that beginning Ford has adhered to the vision of serving working people.' Volkswagen, the German carmaker which is already the leading car producer in China, said the Seat Cordoba, introduced in China recently as the City Golf, could be the basis for a people's car. Mr Martin Posth, responsible for Asia, said VW would present a complete concept covering development, production, national specialisation, distribution and service.</p>

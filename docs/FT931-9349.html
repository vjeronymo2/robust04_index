			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Ukraine's youthful enthusiasm for private industry DEPRESSING AS this may seem, the experience of the last decade means that western governments are now adept at dealing with the political fall-out from persistently high rates of unemployment. Not so in the former Soviet Union. Political leaders in Russia and the 14 other republics which have succeeded the union have had no choice but to learn to live with rising prices, falling output and declining real wages. But none has been prepared to tolerate the rise unemployment that this collapse implies. The fear, openly expressed by reformers in Kiev and less publicly by their counterparts in Moscow, is that allowing enterprises to close would lead to mass unemployment and provoke a wave of opposition against reform. But the alternative, in the absence of substantial western aid, is to try to keep unemployment rates low by continuing the current practice of printing money to pay wages at the expense of accelerating inflation. Would the employment consequences of cutting subsidies be disastrous? Poland, after three years of pain, has managed to stabilise its inflation rate by allowing the private sector to absorb many of the workers who lost their jobs in state industries. Unemployment rose to 14 per cent last year, not so high by west European standards, while over half of Poland's employed work in the private sector. Yet Poland's private sector, even before reforms began in early 1990, already accounted for over a third of total employment. In the former Soviet Union, by contrast, private employment was negligible, at least in the legal economy. The ability of fledgling private companies to absorb redundant workers might be expected to be comparatively modest. Typically, there are almost no reliable statistical data about current employment in the former Soviet republics; but a recent survey of redundant workers in Ukraine's capital goes some way towards filling this vacuum. By tracking the fortunes of 350 workers who were made redundant last year, Mr Simon Johnson of the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University and Mr Oleg Ustenko of Kiev State Economics University suggest some grounds for optimism. The survey covers workers previously employed by 13 state enterprises in Kiev. In December 1991, the enterprises employed 65,000 workers, a little under 10 per cent of total employment in the city. But employment in these enterprises has fallen by 13 per cent over the past year, with about two thirds of the job losses resulting from involuntary redundancies or retirement. Job cuts were relatively more severe in the seven enterprises which produce only civilian goods. Among the four military enterprises, which make up three quarters of total employment in the sample, two enterprises escaped redundancies almost entirely. Young people appear to have borne the brunt of these redundancies. From each of the 13 enterprises, Johnson and Ustenko have interviewed 40 workers who were fired last year. While the redundancies were equally split between women and men, 49 per cent of the redundant workers were aged under 30 and only 3 per cent were aged over 50. Surprisingly, however, the survey finds that two thirds of the redundant workers have been able to find new employment, with younger male workers faring better in the job hunt. Of the women and older workers who have found jobs, most work in the state sector. Younger workers, by contrast, are much more likely to find employment in the non-state or 'private' sector as the chart shows, usually unlicensed small-scale trading or in off-shoots from the state enterprises. Men have also fared better than women: only 12 per cent of the male sample said they were unemployed compared to 39 per cent of women. Ukraine has a long way to go before it reaches Polish levels of private activity. But it has made a start. *Available from Simon Johnson, Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, NC 27706, USA. Tel.  919-660-7817 Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100. Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force.

Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA. Retail sales volume: data from national government sources except Japan and Italy (value series deflated by OECD using CPI). Refers to total retail sales except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department stores only). Industrial production: data from national government sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US - help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies. Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series, cyclical fluctuations in which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in general economic activity.</p>

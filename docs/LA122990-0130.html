			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> 49ERS PLAY POOR HOSTS TO BROOKLYN  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach discovered Friday night that there's nothing like a rout,  even against a team that has lost 38 consecutive road games, to restore  confidence.  </P> <P> "This is the best I've felt about this team since the second week of practice,"  Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg said after the 49ers broke a three-game losing  streak by defeating Brooklyn College, 85-56, before 1,351 in the Long Beach  Arena.  </P> <P> "It's hard not to lose confidence when you get hammered," Greenberg said,  referring to losses this month to Arizona and Syracuse, "but our kids are  having a good time again."  </P> <P> The 49ers, winning easily for the first time this season, improved to 3-5.  Their previous victories, both unimpressive, were against Chicago State and Cal  State Northridge.  </P> <P> A good first half was all Long Beach needed. The 49ers erased a 12-10 deficit  with 14 consecutive points to lead, 24-12, with 7:26 left in the half, and went  on to a comfortable 43-21 lead at intermission.  </P> <P> Lucious Harris, starting for the first time at point guard, scored six points  during the 14-0 surge.  </P> <P> Brooklyn, which has not won on the road since 1987, went six minutes without  scoring and had only nine points in the last 13 minutes of the half.  </P> <P> "We took them out of their offense," Greenberg said. "The first 18 minutes we  played pretty good defense."  </P> <P> The Kingsmen (4-7) had been giving up an average of 68 points. Not accustomed  to the 49ers' fast-paced style, they made 26 turnovers and could get no closer  than 20 points in the second half.  </P> <P> "I didn't think they were a threat to get back in the game because they play so  methodically," Greenberg said.  </P> <P> Brooklyn Coach Ron Kestenbaum said, "We wanted to play a half-court game, they  made it a full-court game. We were concerned with their quickness and athletic  ability. We gave them too many second shots."  </P> <P> Long Beach had 27 offensive rebounds -- seven by Frankie Edwards.  </P> <P> The 49ers, who had been shooting 39%, shot 44% for the game and 50% in the  first half.  </P> <P> "We were relaxed," Greenberg said. "We moved the ball better and got better  shots."  </P> <P> Harris made eight of 21 shots from the field but finished with a game-high 20  points, four below his average.  </P> <P> Kevin Cutler added 13 points and Troy Joseph had 11. In reserve roles, Ronnie  Winbush made three three-pointers and Chris Tower, a 6-foot-10 transfer from  New Mexico, had seven points and four rebounds in his Long Beach debut.  </P> <P> Brenton Birmingham led Brooklyn with 19 points.  </P></p>

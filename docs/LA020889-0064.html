			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUMP PLAYS TO WIN AT HIS OWN GAME  </P> <P> For the millions of Americans who want to make a fortune overnight, toy maker  Milton Bradley and real estate tycoon Donald J. Trump will soon allow them to  negotiate blockbuster deals in their living rooms.  </P> <P> Trump, the flashy billionaire who recently published the autobiography "Trump:  The Art of the Deal," is now the subject of a new $25 board game, "Trump the  Game," Milton Bradley announced this week.  </P> <P> The game, which will go on sale in the spring, is patterned after Monopoly and  Trump's own career. Trump's well-publicized face, which was recently on the  cover of Time magazine, appears on the game's play money, board, outer box and  Trump cards.  </P> <P> In the game, players compete to buy eight lucrative real estate properties such  as hotels, casinos or convention centers with play money starting in  denominations of $10 million. Trump said he has lost the game a few times  himself.  </P> <P> "The game is based on the high stakes world of wheeling and dealing and 'The  Art of the Deal,' " Milton Bradley President George Ditomassi told reporters.  The toy maker, a unit of Hasbro Inc., also makes the games "Life," "A Question  of Scruples" and "Win, Lose or Draw."  </P> <P> "I really like the game," said Trump, who rolled 14-karat gold dice at a  ceremonial "closing of the deal" in Manhattan's sumptuous Trump Tower. "It's  much more sophisticated than Monopoly, which I've played all my life."  </P> <P> Trump's percentage of the game's profits, which he did not disclose, will go to  charities such as cerebral palsy, AIDS research and help for the homeless, he  said.  </P> <P> "I hope the game makes many millions of dollars," said Trump, who owns the  Plaza Hotel, Trump Tower, Trump Plaza and Grand Hyatt in Manhattan, and Trump  Plaza &amp; Casino in Atlantic City.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salim Yassine] </F>   [Excerpt] Beirut, April 13 (AFP)--The Lebanese government  has eased restrictions on the country's private media in the  face of mounting criticism and a threat by parliament to hold a  debate on freedom of expression.    One week after adopting an amendment to a draft bill  providing for the preventive suspension of publications and  detention of journalists ahead of any court judgment, the  government on Monday back-pedalled.    It decided to scrap the restrictions and reduced by half  fines proposed last week against publications which carried  stories deemed libelous to the head of state and presidents of  friendly countries.    The respected AL-NAHAR daily said in a banner headline on  Tuesday: "The government retracts: The press triumphs" -- words  which summed up the satisfaction in newsrooms across Beirut.    The restrictions against the press triggered an outcry in  newspapers, at the press syndicate and in parliament where  dozens of MPs signed a petition calling on parliament to open a  debate on freedom of expression.    The government also eased a ban imposed two weeks ago on  private radio and television stations. [passage omitted]</p>

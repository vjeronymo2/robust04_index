			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Turnround at Oerlikon-Buhrle OERLIKON-Buhrle, the Swiss armaments and engineering group, returned to profit last year for the first time since 1985. The group, which was put under new management in 1991, recorded a net profit of SFr37m (Dollars 24.7m) in 1992, against a loss of SFr915m a year earlier. Revenues were down 1.5 per cent to SFr3.57bn but group operating profit was SFr232m, against a SFr9m loss a year earlier, due to cost-cutting. Financial charges dropped to SFr204m from SFr249m, mainly reflecting a fall in net debt to SFr1.44bn last year from SFr1.8bn at the end of 1991. The directors said they intended to simplify the capital structure, converting the SFr100 nominal bearer shares and SFr40 nominal registered shares into a single class of SFr20 registered shares. The directors said they expected a further increase in profits this year. ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, said the value of incoming orders dipped 3 per cent in the first quarter to Dollars 7.55bn and group revenues fell 4 per cent to Dollars 6.2bn. But the trend was distorted by exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding these, orders were up 5 per cent and revenues up 3 per cent. 'The recessionary environment and downturn in demand continues in Europe and the slow North American recovery has not yet positively influenced ABB's total order intake,' Mr Percy Barnevik, president, told ABB's general meeting in Vasteras, Sweden.</p>

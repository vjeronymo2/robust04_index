			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Exports boost for West Midlands Export orders for manufac-turers in the West Midlands have continued to rise, but domestic demand is flat, says a survey by the chambers of commerce in the region. The survey of 640 manufacturing and service companies, published today, shows a steady rise in the past year in manufacturers reporting big export order books - from 30 per cent to 37 per cent. But last month the proportion of manufacturers reporting increased home orders was 41 per cent, scarcely changed in any of the quarterly surveys since September 1993. Service companies have been facing slacker markets - 45 per cent of companies have bigger domestic order books, down from 57 per cent six months ago, while 19 per cent reported a higher level of export orders, compared with 40 per cent six months ago. This is a reversal of the trend in the first half, when it appeared that the service sector was leading the traditional manufacturing heartland of the UK out of recession.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BALTIC NEWS SERVICE] </F>   [Text] President of Lithuania Algirdas Brazauskas said that  without Lithuania's consent there cannot be any uncontrolled  military transit to the Kaliningrad region, and that no secret  negotiations were being conducted with Russia about such an  agreement.    According to the president, a draft agreement received from  Russia last week is a new matter and the working group for the  negotiations with CIS countries has to analyze it.    Speaking about the Russian military transit from Latvia and  Estonia to Kaliningrad, President Brazauskas pointed out that it  was necessary to help the Baltic states to have the Russian  troops withdrawn, and for that reason the above transit should  be kept open. This would only assist our common objectives,  said the president.</p>

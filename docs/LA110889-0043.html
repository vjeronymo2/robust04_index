			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> AN OUTPOURING OF CELTIC SOUL BY THE WATERBOYS  </P> <P> The Waterboys' Mike Scott demonstrated Monday night at the Wiltern Theatre that  he is a wary, but immensely worthy rock hero.  </P> <P> In his first local appearance in four years, the Scottish-born  singer-songwriter came armed with enough inspiring songs and uplifting  musicianship to put on a snappy and appealing show that at, say, 90 minutes  would have been a guaranteed knockout.  </P> <P> Instead, he and the other six musicians in his band stretched things out to two  hours, breaking the natural momentum early in the show in ways that seemed at  times stubbornly self-defeating.  </P> <P> Yet, Scott showed in the end that he not only knew what he was doing, but that  he has the conviction, purpose and talent to put him near the forefront of  contemporary rockers. The most significant aspect of the concert was that Scott  now seems comfortable in that role. It wasn't always the case.  </P> <P> Rarely has someone looked stardom in the face so fully as Scott did four years  ago when he stood on the brink of a U2-like adoration in Britain -- only to  step back to see if he liked where he was headed.  </P> <P> It was a surprising move because Scott burst on the scene in England in 1983 so  eager to be accepted as the latest in the rock-as-inspiration tradition of Bob  Dylan and Van Morrison that he seemed to demand to march at the head the  nearest rock parade. The problem was that his vision wasn't focused and his  craft wasn't realized.  </P> <P> Scott wrote so many heavy-handed and overblown "message" songs for the band's  first two albums that Trouser Press, a magazine that specialized in the  alternative rock scene, quite reasonably called much of his music "hideously  pompous" and overproduced.  </P> <P> By the time of his third album, 1985's "This Is the Sea," Scott and the  Waterboys had begun moving toward warmer and more convincing expressions of  spiritually accented idealism and hope.  </P> <P> Despite the advances in his songwriting, there was a somewhat anonymous quality  to the band's music. The songs were still a bit overblown, somewhat adrift in  the fashionable currents of rock at the time, rather than asserting an  individual voice.  </P> <P> Almost intuitively, Scott backed away from the stardom mantle that was about to  be handed him for some soul-searching. He had seen too many other bands reach  mass acceptance only to flounder because they didn't have a solid or purposeful  foundation. The break eventually led him to move from London to Ireland, where  he put together a new band that enabled him to work with the bright, flavorful  Irish folk trimmings that seemed to instill him with a sense of tradition and  earthy truth.  </P> <P> His much admired next album, 1988's "Fisherman's Blues," reflected those  changes. The songs had the ambition of his early albums, but with a far more  personal, perhaps even humble tone that better served his reflections on the  search for social and spiritual fulfillment. Here, at last, was music from a  man's heart -- all dressed in disarming Celtic ribbons and bows.  </P> <P> Monday's show at the Wiltern -- where Scott will appear again tonight before a  concert Thursday at UC San Diego -- was an extension of the breakthrough in  "Fisherman's Blues."  </P> <P> For someone with a somewhat reclusive reputation (no interviews please!), Scott  appeared remarkably comfortable and warm -- if low-key -- on stage, moving  about as if he were simply providing entertainment at a neighborhood block  party as he stood at the microphone in his black leather fisherman's cap, an  old sport jacket and jeans.  </P> <P> The two opening songs -- "Fisherman's Blues" and "Strange Boat" -- outlined the  gentle message of optimism and faith at the core of Scott's compositions.  </P> <P> "We're livin' in a strange time / Workin' for a strange goal / We're turnin'  flesh and body / into soul," he sang in the latter number, virtually defining  his musical destination. The journey itself was sometimes slow -- frustratingly  so as the Celtic coloring (provided by such instruments as the accordion,  mandolin and fiddle) neutralized the emotion of the songs (especially a version  of Bob Dylan's "Girl from the North Country") and the frequent use of  traditional numbers broke the momentum of Waterboys' own punchy songs.  </P> <P> At about the half-way mark, however, Scott seemed satisfied that he had  introduced the roots of his music. He picked up an electric guitar and went  into a series of explosive rockers that had the audience -- which had seemed a  bit drowsy at times -- on its feet, fully engrossed.  </P> <P> By this time, the mixture of folk warmth and rock bite was so unified in his  music that it seemed only natural when Scott brought out the nearly two dozen  members of the Scottish Fiddlers of Los Angeles group for a jam that offered  the warm, communal feel that is such a winning feature of Los Lobos concerts.  </P> <P> Like Bruce Springsteen, Scott realizes that you can't just go out to serve the  audience if you are going to have a lasting and meaningful -- as opposed to  superficial -- relationship with that audience. Scott knows that what he has to  serve are his own artistic impulses.  </P> <P> It's that realization that fuels his new music and performance with a  triumphant and liberating edge. He needs a few more songs of the level of the  "Fisherman's Blues" material before he can be reasonably ranked with the models  he so much admires, but he flashed signs of greatness on Monday.  </P> <P> Opening the bill was Show of Hands, a local folk trio that in its overly  earnest moments seems too much like a hard-edged, contemporary version of Peter  Paul &amp; Mary, but at times(especially in the song "Langston Hughes") seems  to have in a challenging spirit worth exploring.  </P> <P> San Diego Performance. The Waterboys will perform Thursday at UCSD's Price  Center Ballroom.  </P></p>

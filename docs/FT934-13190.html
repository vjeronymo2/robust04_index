			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Restructuring boosts Sears Roebuck in third quarter SEARS, Roebuck, the US retail and insurance group, recorded the second most profitable third quarter in its history, as the restructuring and the divestiture of several businesses boosted its bottom line. This is the third consecutive quarterly earnings improvement, after a record loss in 1992. Sears reported consolidated net income of Dollars 388.4m, or 98 cents per share, up from a consolidated net loss of Dollars 853.8m, or Dollars 2.30, for the third quarter of 1992. Last year's third-quarter loss was primarily due to after-tax charges of Dollars 1.2bn related to insurance claims against Allstate in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. Income from continuing operations was Dollars 453.9m in the quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 992.3m in the same 1992 quarter. Third-quarter results include a Dollars 81m favourable income tax adjustment, which was partly offset by a Dollars 65.5m extraordinary charge related to the company's call of a Dollars 300m, 7 per cent deep-discounted bond. Consolidated revenues in the quarter fell to Dollars 12.7bn, from Dollars 12.8bn a year ago, reflecting the divestiture of Sear's catalogue operation and several merchandising operations. Since spinning off the balance of its ownership in Dean Witter, Discover in June, Sears' continuing operations include its merchandising group, 80 per cent ownership of Allstate Insurance, and its property group, Homart Development. The merchandising group reported third-quarter income of Dollars 215.2m and revenues of Dollars 7.3bn, compared with last year's loss of Dollars 49.4m on sales of Dollars 7.7bn. Allstate's income was Dollars 260.9m, against a loss of Dollars 845.8m, and revenues improved to Dollars 6.3bn, from Dollars 5.07bn in the third quarter last year. Homart Development continued to show a loss, at Dollars 5m in the quarter, compared with last year's loss of Dollars 6.2m. For the first nine months, Sears recorded consolidated net income of Dollars 1.8bn, or Dollars 4.73 per share, against a loss of Dollars 2.1bn, or Dollars 5.84 for the first three quarters of 1992. Sales for the nine-month period were only marginally lower, at Dollars 36.2bn, compared with Dollars 37.3bn a year ago.</p>

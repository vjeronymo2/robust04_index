			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Base metals prices were mostly lower at the end of another active London Metal Exchange session with selling pressure generally winning the day. COPPER prices were lower following the failure of an upside move on Monday and were also pressured by pricing sales in the morning that contributed to a slide below Dollars 2,200 a tonne for three months metal. The three months price closed at Pounds 1,445.50 a tonne, down Pounds 27 on the day. Trade selling pushed three months ZINC down Dollars 38 to Dollars 1,098.50 a tonne at the close and further losses were sustained in afterhours trading. Nickel was also weak following news of a big rise in LME stocks. But the ALUMINIUM market was resilient, despite a very large rise in LME stocks, as heavy trade buying and short-covering rallied the market from support around Dollars 1,210 a tonne for three months metal. The price closed at Dollars 1,219.75 a tonne, down just Dollars 1.75 on the day. At the London Futures and Options Exchange COCOA prices finished with trimmed gains as sterling's late rise against the dollar helped to check an earlier advance. Compiled from Reuters</p>

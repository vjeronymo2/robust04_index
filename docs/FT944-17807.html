			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Hands-on executives: this one's for you Electronic publishing is in turmoil. Yesterday's deal is just one indicator of a wave of change sweeping through the sector promising new growth opportunities. Another is the emergence of Apple and Microsoft as potential competitors to established players such as Compuserve and America On Line. The market is not homogeneous. Companies like Mead, Dialog and Dow-Jones News retrieval of the US and FT Profile and Reuters of the UK are serving essentially the professional market, providing data to experienced information managers. On the other hand, companies like Compuserve, owned by H&amp;R Block, America On Line and Prodigy, a joint venture between IBM and Sears, are chiefly, but not exclusively, aimed at consumers. Information is a commodity to be bought and sold, however, and the data provided through one service may have originated on another. There is a further distinction between companies like Mead and Dialog, which operate on a 'dial-up' basis, and companies like Reuters or Telekurs where information is transmitted and updated continuously. All on-line data suppliers have their eyes on a new target market: the 'executive end-user'. They are racing to make it easier and cheaper for executives to carry out their own searches for information. Some, for example, are building in 'Windows', the graphical interface popularised by Microsoft. Prices are being pegged to a flat monthly fee. In earlier years, on-line services of the kind provided by Mead or Dialog were aimed at information professionals. Executives did not carry out their own searches but requested information from librarians trained to use complex methods of data retrieval. It was expensive; at up to Pounds 120 an hour for some services, too costly to allow the inexperienced to roam aimlessly through the databases. A result was that the market, although potentially vast, grew much more slowly than anticipated and in the past few years has been showing signs of saturation. Profitability has been a problem for some suppliers. Now the technologies which are making multimedia possible are giving on-line database services new life. The secret seems to lie in providing on-line services to appeal to executives at home and in the office.</p>

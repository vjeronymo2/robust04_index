Two days ago, the opposition parties  protested the way in which the government answers deputies'  questions, calling it vague and general.    This took place when opposition deputy Abderrahman Haraichi  raised a question about the case of Shaykh Abdessalem Yacine,  whom the police have kept under house arrest in the city of  Sale, north of the capital Rabat, for three years. Human Rights  Minister Omar Azzimane replied that, as the case was now on the  calendar of the court system, which was studying it, the  prerogatives of the justice system had to be respected. The  opposition deputy responded that no such case existed in the  justice system: that the matter concerned only a complaint that  Abdessalem Yacine's lawyers had submitted to the court for a  review of his house arrest, and that relevant sources had stated  that Shaykh Yacine had submitted a letter on the subject to the  departments concerned.    Significantly, the raising of the case of Shaykh Abdessalem  Yacine, the head of the Association for Justice and Benevolence  whose bureau members were recently tried on the charge of  distributing illegal publications, coincided with escalating  opposition party demands for greater political relaxation,  release of all detainees, and the return of exiles. Mohamed Ben  Said, head of the opposition Organization of [Popular]  Democratic Action, said: "We still demand constitutional and  political reform. We also demand respect for human rights and  cleansing Morocco of all detention camps like Tazmamart [name as  transliterated]." This was a reference to the detention center  that used to bear this name. The Moroccan authorities demolished  it and released dozens of the military prisoners who were living  there.    Mohamed Ben Said said, "We are not against trying those  accused: an accused person must be tried, whatever the charge  against him may be." Here he was quoting the Moroccan opposition  figure Mohamed Basri, who, having lived in exile for more than a  quarter century, has said he is prepared to return to the  country if political relaxation and a return of exiles take  place.    At a Rabat political meeting last Tuesday celebrating the  anniversary of the [1944] independence manifesto, Istiqlal Party  leader Mohamed Boucetta said: "Building a state of truth, law,  and respect for human rights must not remain merely a wish that  pervades civil society. The experience of the recent elections  has shown that the Moroccan people are committed to change and  ready to sacrifice for it."    Mohamed Yazghi, deputy head of the Socialist Union, said:  "On  the threshold of the 21st century, we cannot accept Morocco's  remaining without a truly democratic system. It is unthinkable  for the mixing of power to remain as it is now. It is  unthinkable for the Constitution to be applied as it is now."  This is a renewed affirmation of the opposition parties' refusal  to work with the new government that Mohamed Karim Lamrani has  formed from technocrats. Opposition figures call it  unconstitutional because it did not emerge from the  parliamentary majority. Official sources, on the other hand,  attribute the government's makeup to the opposition parties'  refusal to participate in a proposed government and to the  majority parties' request for a respite to reorganize  themselves; however, the program the new government is pledged  to implement is the same one that King Hassan II proposed to the  opposition parties. Against this background, the opposition  parties are wagering on creating a political and constitutional  vacuum, so that they can resume dialogue with official  authorities on forming a new government. Some sources believe  that the opposition parties' allusion to human rights cases and  the condition of Islamic groups whose attitudes they do not  share is aimed at pressuring the government and embarrassing the  majority parties, which find themselves called on to support a  government in which they are not participating.    Signs of dissatisfaction emerged recently in majority  circles. These claim that the restructuring process is facing  difficulties because of their pledge to support the new  government and because the scope of their freedom is being  further restricted, while the opposition alone aims more  criticisms at the executive apparatus. The former majority  parties are expected to hold meetings to coordinate their  positions on the proposed new budget, which still has not been  able to be approved. Meanwhile, the official authorities have  issued administrative decrees to disburse funds in emergency  sectors.    Interested circles see the call by the opposition  parties--Socialist Union of Popular Forces, Istiqlal, and  Organization of Democratic Popular Action--for the creation of a  constitutional body to oversee elections and for direct election  of all members of Parliament as a new attempt to put political  pressure on Mohamed Karim Lamrani's government. The least of  this was their signaling that they would not accept the  invalidation of a limited number of constituencies. This is the  view that has prevailed until now for overcoming the current  political problem following the issuance of Constitutional  Chamber rulings invalidating the results of no fewer than ten  election districts, including one of the districts in which a  candidate from the opposition Party of Progress and Socialism  won.    Informed circles do not discount the possible issuance of  new  rulings affecting figures who belong to opposition parties,  particularly Istiqlal and the Socialist Union, particularly  because the invalidation ought to include all the results of  indirect balloting. This is a demand which, in the view of  official sources, has no basis in law or the Constitution.    Political circles attribute this escalation to the fact that  the opposition parties, which needed no fewer than 40 seats to  form a parliamentary majority qualifying them to participate in  the government, having made great progress in the results of  last June's direct elections, want to achieve this gain by means  of political pressure. They believe that the problem that  resulted from electing a third of the members of Parliament by  indirect balloting has a political nature and therefore must be  remedied by a political solution. The least of this would be  granting their demand that a large number of outcomes of this  balloting be invalidated, since their participation in any  anticipated government is subject to their winning a  parliamentary majority. On the other hand, official sources  repeat that there is nothing to prevent their participating in  the government, despite their being a minority, on the basis of  seeking a formula of new alliances or taking advantage of the  situation of the current majority, which in any case will not  withdraw its confidence from the government.</p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Russia ready to move out of Lithuania Sir, I refer to your article 'Russia interrupts troop withdrawal' (August 19). Russia is ready to complete withdrawal of its troops from Baltic countries, including Lithuania, as soon as possible provided that, in accordance with CSCE Helsinki documents of 1992, the withdrawal is conducted on the basis of relevant bilateral agreements. We would like to make it absolutely clear that it is not Russia that is responsible for the delay. For example, Lithuania, at the last moment when the agreement was practically ready for signature, changed its position. This led the negotiating process into a dead end. The Russian side is ready to look for mutually acceptable solutions to the problem. Boris N Malakhov, press councillor, Embassy of the Russian Federation, 13 Kensington Palace Gardens, London W8 4QX</p>

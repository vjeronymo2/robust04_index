			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Schauble, chairman of the CDU/CSU </F> Bundestag Group, by Heinz Riebsamen and Cornelia von Wrangel;  place and date not given: "`We Must Continue Consistently  Curbing Expenditure'"]    [Excerpt] [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] The CDU  [Christian Democratic Union]/CSU [Christian Social Union] has  provided the interior minister for the past 11 years. Is the  security situation getting out of control and the government  unable to keep up with these developments?    [Schaeuble] The development of crime is something that the  government can only influence in a very limited way. People's  belief in values has become much weaker. We concentrate on  material values. That is also a consequence of these past  decades that have seen such a growth in prosperity. Perhaps it  is also a consequence of the fact that we have avoided certain  basic questions about the state community. This rigid  concentration on increasing material prosperity promotes a  tendency for people to concentrate on their own gains to the  extent that they only feel that regulations can impose  limitations on their conduct if there is a danger of being  caught.    [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] Does the state not  lose the basis of its existence if it can no longer ensure  security for its citizens?    [Schaeuble] Things go even further than that. The basis of  every liberal form of life is that people adhere to certain  norms with respect to human coexistence, that they feel bound by  respect for the life, property, and basic rights of others. If  that can only be sanctioned and implemented by means of state  norms, bureaucracy, surveillance, and the police, a basic  foundation of freedom is already endangered.    [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] The interior  minister has advised citizens to care more about their own  security. Is that a form of partial capitulation?    [Schaeuble] No, the interior minister simply pointed out  something that is quite obvious. In a liberal democracy, the  state cannot do everything. That does not mean that people  should install as many burglar alarms as they can in their  homes. It means that one should feel a measure of  responsibility for the broader social context, follow what is  going on, and overcome the anonymity that probably also has some  bearing on the massive increase in crime.    [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] How has the world  of politics responded to this development?    [Schaeuble] Citizens always expect solutions from politics.  There is no patent solution for developments where a variety of  factors are involved. That does not mean that politicians do  not have to act. The laender, which are responsible for  security, must make security a high priority. That the police  get bogged down in a mass of paperwork is, of course, an evil  that one can change.

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: UniChem buys six more pharmacies UniChem, the pharmaceutical wholesaler, has acquired six pharmacies, primarily in North Wales. The combined consideration was Pounds 2.05m for goodwill. Annual turnover of the shops totalled Pounds 3.2m. Mr Peter Dodd, chief executive, said the recent rights issue had provided the company with the cash resources to take advantage of lower prices available in the retail pharmacy market. UniChem has acquired 136 shops (including the 92 outlet chain of E Moss) since it started to purchase pharmacies in March 1991.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DEALERS reported a busy session in the derivative market as both stock index futures and traded options saw the expiry of June contracts, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at 2,576, but after a brief surge went into retreat and soon fell to 2,568 as its expiry at 10.10am approached, coinciding with the expiry of the FT-SE 100 index option. Following the expiry of June, the September contract took centre stage and saw buyers which helped it advance from its 2,641 level at 10.30am. Profit-taking however caused a retreat in the new contract towards the close and September finished at 2,627, at a 43-point premium to cash and about 3 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 40 points. Volume in September reached over 10,000 contracts. June closed with turnover of 2,695 contracts. Traded options were also busy. Turnover reached 35,236 with the FT-SE option trading 12,314 lots. Bid speculation in Pilkington made it the busiest stock option and it had recorded a total of 4,218 contracts by the close.</p>

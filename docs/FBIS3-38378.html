			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mario Segni by Giovanni Grassi in Rome; date </F> not given: "I, Mario Segni, Third Alternative Against My Will"]    [Text] On the left? "Those who pine for Cuba." On the  right? "The descendants of fascism and the separatists." Mario  Segni is now abandoning the pursuit of a two-party system,  stating: "The only alternative to the PDS [Democratic Party of  the Left] is the `Pact for Italy.'" With Martinazzoli, La  Malfa, and Amato. "The heirs of the CAF  [Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani] have sided with Bossi and Berlusconi."    "On the left we have those who hark back to the days of the  Berlin wall, and on the right the heirs of fascism." These are  the terms in which Mario Segni expounds the paradox that he is  now facing, and it is no small political paradox: He is the man  who fought hardest, with the institutional referenda, for a  two-party system based on alternation in Italy as well, but he  now finds himself leading a third pole opposing both the right  and the left. "Over the last few months," Segni explains, "We  have come to realize that you cannot achieve a two-party system  in a few weeks; it takes a much longer political process. But  let's get things straight: What he have set up with the `Pact  for Italy' is not a third pole, the geographical center, ready  to line up with the right or the left at its own convenience,  according to Andreotti's old theory of the two ovens." The Pact  for Italy was originally formed to become the  liberal-democratic, reformist pole in opposition to the left.  In the midst of the current chaos, it now represents the only  true national alternative with the potential to beat a left wing  dominated by the PDS.    [Grasso] All things considered, the prospect of a European  two-party system is receding, at least for the time being....    [Segni] Yes, but the blame also lies with the Italian left,  which has no Gonzales or Mitterrand, only Occhetto and D'Alema,  who have no scruples about forming alliances with Bertinotti, in  other words with those on the left who look not to Europe but to  Cuba.    [Grasso] Be that as it may, the left and the right seem to  form an unholy alliance against you....    [Segni] Yes, but what I want to say is that the aroma of  stale politics hangs over both Occhetto's forces and the force  taking shape [if it ever does emerge fully as a force] among  Berlusconi, Bossi, and Fini. They have consciously omitted a  fundamental step: agreeing on a platform for a true political  alliance. Forming a hotchpotch alliance just to gain a few more  seats strikes me as a disgraceful lack of respect for the people  who voted to turn over a new leaf in the referendum. What sense  does it make, for instance, to lump together the League, which  still has federalism as one of its tenets, and the MSI [Italian  Social Movement], which will fight its election campaign in the  south on a platform of national unity? How can these two forces  form a government together? Let us not deceive ourselves....    [Grasso] Berlusconi accuses you of splitting the  liberal-democratic pole, thus helping the left to win.    [Segni] How can Berlusconi describe himself as a liberal  democrat and yet get on with Fini? Liberal democracy is  something very different from claiming to represent the  continuation of the fascist tradition and outlook, albeit in an  updated form. Giscard has never come to arrangements with Le  Pen.    [Grasso] Deputy Segni, you had managed to wrest an agreement  on a platform for government from the League's lower house floor  leader, Maroni. Then Bossi disowned Maroni, and Maroni said  there had never been any mention of alliances with Martinazzoli  and the PPI [Italian Popular Party]. What is the truth?    [Segni] We have always said that our goal was to gather the  best of democratic Catholicism around the Pact, along with those  of a liberal-democratic and reformist persuasion, and the  Popular Party has been in the Pact since the beginning. Maroni  was perfectly well aware of this. What subsequently passed  between Bossi and Maroni I do not know, although I do not find  it difficult to imagine. The once certain thing is that the  League had to disown an agreement that would have made it clear  once and for all that Italian unity is inviolable. By taking  this step, Bossi has once again confirmed his inconsistency on  this issue, demonstrating once and for all that the League is  unreliable.    [Grasso] Has Bossi's "no" disappointed you?    [Segni] I have no regrets. We did everything in broad  daylight and with the intention of creating a joint platform, as  called for by the result of the referendum. It would have been  much more convenient to hold secret meetings with Bossi and  Maroni, but that was a feature of the old way of politics, the  way that lead to "kickback city." Anyway, we did achieve one  result: The electorate in the north now knows who it is that  wants modernity and progress, who wants to combat statism and  inefficiency, who wants privatization, greater regional  autonomy, and safeguards for the weaker members of society and  for the family, without jeopardizing Italian unity and the  national spirit.    [Grasso] Were you not a little naive to think it would be  possible to come to an agreement with Bossi?    [Segni] I don't know. But it's much better to be naive and  in good faith than to be forced to go back on an agreement after  little more than 24 hours.    [Grasso] What idea have you formed of the right-wing pole?    [Segni] It isn't a pole, and it is tainted by a fascist  strain. It is a true right-wing aggregate, unacceptable to a  modern electorate. It is as well for all the moderates in the  north who voted for the League as a protest to reflect that this  is no longer the time for protest votes: The old regime has  been demolished, and now it is time to build. Meanwhile, the  southern electorate must realize that if it votes for the MSI it  will also help the League, which is no longer concealing its  separatist, selfish tendencies.    [Grasso] What do you think of Amato and La Malfa joining the  Pact?    [Segni] I believe that it is fundamental for the Pact to  take in major currents that represent the better manifestations  of the nonconfessional, reformist political traditions. But I  want to make it clear that the Pact will not serve as a life  raft for shipwrecked exponents of the party regime. La Malfa  has set an example by saying that he does not intend to stand  for reelection, and I greatly appreciate this gesture.  Moreover, I am quite sure that we shall stand or fall by the  candidates that we put up: We shall fail the Italians'  expectations unless we present a new, credible, political class.    [Grasso] Does this apply to De Mita too?    [Segni] Look, it is not my place to hand down summary  verdicts. I have already stated publicly that, in my opinion,  De Mita should keep out. However, this does not apply only to  him, but to all those, without exception, who have been the  protagonists of the old party regime, whether at local or at  national level.    [Grasso] Segni, Martinazzoli, Amato, La Malfa. Miglio  accuses you of having reformed the five-party coalition....    [Segni] I would advise Miglio to look to his own house: The  remnants of Craxism are siding with Berlusconi, and the CCD  [Democratic Christian Center] are the direct heirs of the CAF.  And both Berlusconi and the CCD have lined up with the League,  not with us.    [Grasso] If none of the poles gains an absolute majority in  the election, what will you do? Is there not a risk of  ungovernability?    [Segni] If people want us to govern, they must vote for us,  otherwise no one can force us into government. We can go into  opposition, and if we do, we shall do so in earnest, not like  the consociational opposition that we have had to date. It may  well be that parliament is ungovernable after the election, but  I have always maintained that the journey begun with the  referendum is not over yet and that if things are to go in the  right direction we need to amend the constitution to allow the  direct election of the executive.    [Grasso] One last question: The catholic world is  experiencing some anxiety over your government platform, which  is suspected of being over-reliant on free market forces....    [Segni] I should like to make one thing clear: When I talk  about liberal democracy I do not mean that we want to do away  with the welfare state. We want to do away with a state that  promised all things to all men and, in the end, gave no one  anything. The challenge today is to find out where the new poor  are and to give them real protection. Then there is the family,  which is one of the main features of our platform. They have  all promised to safeguard the family in Italy, but no one has  ever done so. Suffice it to say that the state receives three  times as much for family allowances as it actually pays out.</p>

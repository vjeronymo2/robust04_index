			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Travel: Greek delight THERE IS another way to seek out the authentic, unspoiled Greece, and we owe it to the country's national tourist organisation for what are termed Traditional Settlements. The idea is splendid and simple. In different parts of the country, particularly the more remote and less 'commercially-attractive' regions  - such as the Mani deep in the Peloponnese - the organisation has acquired and renovated historic buildings and turned them into 'guest houses.' They are not intended to be as ambitious or sophisticated as the paradors of Spain or the posadas of Portugal, but they have perfectly acceptable modern facilities to go with their simple, white walls, locally-crafted wooden furniture and rich, warm textiles. The buildings are a delight after the anonymous concrete of so many Greek hotels. They are, by definition, sited magnificently. In the Mani, for example, the most dramatic towers in the famous hilltop view of Vathia turn out to be a Traditional Settlement, and you will have a positive suite of higgledy-piggledy rooms quite unlike any motel in which you ever stayed. At the other end of the country, in the forests and orchards of the Pelion, Makrinitsa has three elegant, 18th century mansions perched on the mountain peninsula north of Volos. Back in the Peloponnese, Monemvasia - a sort of Greek Gibraltar - has a renovated former monastery deep within the walls of the traffic-free Venetian fortress. Offshore, the Traditional Settlements extend to Psara (near Chios), to Chios itself, and to a larger group of neo-classical mansions on Santorini. This is as far as you can get from the styles of mass tourism; yet, because the guest houses remain modest, they do not have the limitations of the five-star, high-luxury alternative which is uncongenial to many of us. But a hire car is essential. Further details from the Greek National Tourist Organisation, 4 Conduit Street, London Wl. Tel: 071-734-5997.

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Jobs: Where the real fat cats are to be found - Survey figures show that most public argument about executive pay in Britain misses the point INCREDIBLE though it must seem to anyone who has met the Jobs column, there have been times when it has been unable to get a word in edgeways. The prime instance in recent months came when it was invited to contribute from the floor to a 45-minute televised 'debate' on executive pay. The tone was set by the opening speakers from the platform. The first denounced the monstrous greed of capitalism, making much play with the published salaries of selected heads of big industrial companies. The second responded that the cited sums were necessary to engender enterprise. Those same basic credos, with the same focus on salaries of chiefs of well known outfits, were then hurled back and forth until time ran out. On balance, unashamed proponents of enterprise were far outweighed by equally unashamed opponents of avarice, but they grabbed the floor from one another so swiftly and peremptorily that the Jobs column, despite sticking its hand up sporadically, never uttered a syllable. It still seems a pity to me, at any rate  - not least because, to judge from the typical media reaction to last week's publication of the British Institute of Management's pay survey, the same dialogue of the deluded still rages on. For what I'd hoped to point out on the televised occasion was that the focus of the exchanges was unrealistic, and for two main reasons. First, salaries alone provide an almost ludicrously short measure of executive-pay levels because they take no account of perks. According to the studies of the Noble Lowndes consultancy, which include valuations of benefits such as pension entitlements and company cars as well as bonus payments, salaries make up only about 70 per cent of the average British manager's rewards. Secondly, to suggest that a minority of prominent industrial chieftains are representative of executives in general is not only to do severe injustice to the great bulk of same, but also to overlook the place where Britain's real fat cats largely lurk. That place is the City finance sector, and those doubting it need only look at the table alongside drawn from Day Associates' survey of pay in banks in London's famous square mile. The latest check covers 105 of them, giving data on some 230 jobs high to low. But anyone wanting full information will need to obtain the survey report, price Pounds 200, from Joe Clark of Day at Suite 2.31, 75 Whitechapel Rd, London E1 1DU; tel 071-375 1397, fax 071-375 1723. My figures are limited to 17 posts of senior level, albeit not the highest. In each case, the table starts with salaries  - the lower quartile referring to the person a quarter way up from the foot of a ranking of all in the same type of job, the median refers to the person mid-way in the ranking, and the upper quartile to the one a quarter way down from the top. Next comes the average salary, followed by the percentage of it typically received as a bonus. The last two columns show the proportion of job-holders whose perks include a company car, and its average price. Of course, being confined to banking staff in the City, Day's check cannot show how their rewards compare with those of executives elsewhere. But a rough idea, although no more than that, is given by the following table compiled from the British Institute of Management's figures. It gives average salaries, the percentage of same received as bonus, and the proportion with cars for chief executives, other directors, and five descending ranks of managers: Rank of         Salary   Bonus    Car employee        Pounds     %       % Chief execs     86,817    9.7     97 Other board     55,058    6.9     95 Managers 1      45,169    5.0     97  -do - 2        35,944    4.6     91  -do - 3        30,851    3.2     80  -do - 4        28,147    3.5     73  -do - 5        24,532    2.3     57 So in spite of the dangers that lie in drawing comparisons from different studies, it seems to be abundantly clear that managers in Britain as a whole are underpaid by the standards of their counterparts in City banks. The sole compensation I can offer the majority is that Day's survey shows the square mile's levels are now edging down. Even so, it looks likely to be an eon or two before the reward-gap between the City of London and the rest of Britain is closed. HEADHUNTER Geoffrey King of Cambridge Recruitment Consultants seeks a director of European operations for a British software group fast expanding internationally.

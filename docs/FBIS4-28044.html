			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Since early this year, SCCI [State Commission for  Cooperation and Investment] has licensed a total of 109  projects, including many involving American investors. At a  recent seminar held in Washington, American businessmen  described Vietnam as an interesting market and many large  companies have expressed their wish to operate in Vietnam.    Both Vietnamese and American leaders in their contact,  reiterated to each other they want a full relationship as soon  as possible. The decision to open liaison offices in the  respective capitals of Vietnam and the U.S. has been welcomed by  foreign business circle working in Hanoi. Mr. (?David Drinkerd),  an American businessman of the Digital Company, considered it a  correct and initial step for the normalization of the bilateral  relations. He said the establishment of representation offices  or embassies enables businessmen to have more information and  more convenient conditions to run a business. For his part, Mr.  (?John Lindon), director of an electronic company of Sweden in  Hanoi, held that the new development in Vietnamese-U.S.  relations created more favorable conditions for his company. He  also predicted that there would be more U.S. companies coming to  Vietnam, creating more market for his company's products.    Since the lifting of the embargo, Vietnam and the U.S. have  taken many concrete steps. According to the Vietnamese Foreign  Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, bilateral talks so far have been  fruitful. By March 1994, 31 American companies were licensed to  set up representative offices in Vietnam, 21 in Hanoi and 10 in  Ho Chi Minh City.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARIS OPERA RISES ON BUNKER HILL;  </P> <P> SETTING THE STAGE FOR OPENING OF 'THE PHANTOM'  </P> <P> There are plastic tarps everywhere at the Ahmanson. Covering the carpets,  covering the seats. Huge light boxes are stacked in the lower lobby. Electric  cables crisscross the floors backstage. Dozens of props -- the Phantom's organ,  a bed, the famous chandelier -- are unceremoniously piled together on stage.  Gold-leaf figurines smile down from the rafters. Drills are humming, machinery  is moving up and down, walkie-talkies are abuzz with workmen conferring.  </P> <P> "The Phantom of the Opera" is moving in.  </P> <P> "This production will be as spectacular as the original, (designed in London by  Maria Bjornson) -- if not more so," promised associate designer Dana Kenn, who  oversaw "The Phantom's" Broadway staging, as well as one in Toyko last spring.  In this staging, work began at the Ahmanson the first week of March, with more  than 50 full-time workers in various posts. For Kenn, the responsibility will  continue way into the run, when she will periodically come in from New York to  inspect the show and issue a "report card" on its status.  </P> <P> "This production is larger than the one in New York," the designer said. "The  actual stage space is deeper here, the proscenium is a bit larger. So the show  has also gotten bigger -- and it feels more expansive."  </P> <P> Expensive too. Although Kenn is not giving out exact numbers, she admits the  pre-production has cost "several million dollars." She adds: "But it's also  been put in like a permanent installation -- they're thinking (of being here)  two or three years."  </P> <P> Backstage, there are six painted draperies, 10 full-stage "fancy Victorian"  ones. Bleachers hold 20 life-size mannequins (for a joke, someone's outfitted  them with sunglasses); nearby is a 12-foot-high gray elephant replica that  appears in the "Hannibal" opera number. Large sculptures, constructed from  fireproof resin and Fiberglas, have been flown in from England; smaller ones  were built in New York. Most of the decorative pieces are painted in shimmering  gold leaf -- the better to see from the Ahmanson's second balcony.  </P> <P> Probably the most extensive part of the renovation has been the stage itself. A  new floor was constructed -- and with it, a specially devised basement  structure to accommodate the machinery to conjure up the on-stage magic: 167  traps have been drilled in the stage floor, from which a group of silver  candelabras and 125 candles will rise. The effect takes place during the  Phantom's gondola ride (on a "lake" simulated by dry ice and fog) when he takes  the soprano Christine to his lair.  </P> <P> Kenn (who began working on this staging last July and is currently preparing  the national company tour) noted: "There are 37 men running scenery and lights,  16 dressers for 35 actors, 8 wig people, 5 makeup artists. It's a city back  there. And it's all moving so fast."  </P> <P> Most of the technical controls -- such as those for the sound and lighting --  are via computer devices, while the motorized effects (such as the Phantom's  gondola) are powered by a radio-controlled mechanism. " 'Les Miserables' has  maybe six or seven special effects," Kenn pointed out. "We have 57. So there's  a huge amount of mechanisms." Which, she acknowledged, occasionally break down:  "We had a final dress rehearsal in New York where a lot of things went wrong;  it was like a train wreck. But it was all fixed the next day. And it never  happened again."  </P> <P> Seth Felson isn't vaguely theorizing that "The Phantom of the Opera" will be a  merchandising bonanza in Los Angeles. He's counting on it.  </P> <P> "It takes a special kind of show to support a merchandising program," said the  president of Loring &amp; Matthews, merchandisers for DeWynters Advertising,  the London-based concessionaire for "Les Miz" and "Phantom."  </P> <P> "Visually, musically, philosophically, the show has to be huge. You're selling  a mystique, especially with this one. My spiel is, 'Take the Phantom home with  you.' "  </P> <P> The memory makers come in various forms -- some of which are already available  at the Music Center Gift Shop. Since last November, $9,740 worth of Phantom  merchandise has been sold. The in-house concession stands will feature:  T-shirts ($15), sweat shirts ($22), mugs ($10), matches ($5), buttons ($2),  window cards ($12), songbooks ($15), records ($22), cassettes ($22), compact  discs ($40), "Phantom perfume" ($35), silver-plated key rings ($15), "The  Complete Phantom" (a history of the show, $30), souvenir programs ($5) and  postcards ($1).  </P> <P> But note: These are not just ordinary T-shirts, sweat shirts and mugs. The  garments are emblazoned with a white Phantom logo that glows green in the dark,  thanks to phosphorescent ink. And the white-mask logo mysteriously appears on  the plain black "magic mug" when the container is filled with hot liquid (a  special oxidized ink creates the effect). "We're shipping thousands of  everything," Felson added. "I've already sold $2 million in 50 weeks in New  York; we're anticipating sales of $40,000 a week in L.A. We're in this for the  long haul."  </P></p>

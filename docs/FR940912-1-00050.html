			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are many statutes that authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into specific agreements for the incidental use of Reclamation projects and project lands. These activities may take place on both withdrawn public domain lands and on lands acquired for Reclamation projects either by purchase, exchange, or condemnation. In addition, activities may be authorized for the use of project facilities or may address the sale or disposal of water. Generally those statutes detailed the specific manner in which revenues generated by these incidental uses were to be distributed. The revenues are funds of the United States and, as required by the U. S. Constitution, cannot be expended or credited other than as Congress directs. In those instances where Congress has not provided specific crediting criteria, Reclamation has adopted the manner of revenues crediting specified for other activities from authorized use of Reclamation lands. Examples of the types of uses on Reclamation projects and project lands include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Leasing of minerals_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, (30 U.S.C. 181, et seq.), and the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947 (30 U.S.C. 351,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> et seq.), authorized the Secretary of the Interior to engage in the leasing and extraction of minerals, i.e., oil, gas, oil shale, gilsonite, sodium, phosphate, potassium, sulphur, and asphalt either on lands (specifically the mineral estates) in the public domain, or on lands acquired for a specific project and administered by Reclamation.

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Presidential ambitions fanned on French right: FT correspondents report on fallout from last weekend's European election Squabbling broke out yesterday within France's governing RPR-UDF coalition over the likely candidate for next year's presidential election. A group of 27 deputies threatened to break away from the parliamentary group of their centre-right UDF federation, in an evident move to back Mr Edouard Balladur, the RPR Gaullist premier, for the presidency next year. Last night, the 27 were persuaded by the leadership of their Republican Party to suspend their planned breakaway pending a party conference on June 26. The rekindling of presidential rivalries within the conservative UDF-RPR coalition follows the poor showing by Mr Michel Rocard, leader of the Socialist party, in the European elections. Mr Rocard gained only 14.5 per cent of the vote for his Euro-Socialist list and now looks easy to beat next year. This has encouraged several candidates on the right to enter the field against him. Earlier yesterday, the 27 deputies pledged themselves to support a single candidate representing the RPR and UDF, while Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, overall leader of the UDF federation, has said he wants the UDF to field its own man, perhaps himself. The other factor behind yesterday's move was the Euro-election success of Mr Philippe de Villiers, whose anti-Maastricht campaign split his Republican party. Most of the rebels are similarly Eurosceptic, unable to stomach the notion of backing an old pro-European like Mr Giscard d'Estaing next year. The fact that Mr Balladur is drawing UDF support of this nature may incline him to a more nationalistic stance towards Europe. For his part, Mr Balladur is maintaining a public show of having nothing to do with this internal politicking and of merely getting on with running the country. Next week he lays out plans for reforming social security and the budget and for following up his initiatives in Gatt and and in promoting European stability over the next six months. Meanwhile, two newly elected MEPs traded insults yesterday. Mr Bernard Tapie dismissed as 'ridiculous inventions' claims by Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, an ex-magistrate who won a seat on the de Villiers list, that the Marseilles politician/businessman may be using money in foreign bank accounts to buy back, under others' names, the Olympique-Marseille football club he has been ordered to sell.</p>

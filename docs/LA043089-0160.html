			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN ROME, IT'S SAME OLD STORY: CONGESTION, CRIME, CONFUSION  </P> <P> Bedecked for spring with colorful sprays of azaleas and pickpockets, Mama Roma  observed a new birthday not long ago, troubled by old complaints: Is the  Eternal City governable? Is it livable? Is it safe?  </P> <P> Romans and visitors wondered as both, con molto brio, marked April 21, 753 BC.  On that day, legend says and Rome believes, Romulus and Remus, adopted sons of  a providential wolf, laid the foundation of what would become one of the  world's most beloved cities.  </P> <P> In intervening centuries of splendor and sack, the city's administration, along  with the security of Rome's people, have always been paramount civic  preoccupations. Juvenal satirized imperial Rome's urban mess 19 centuries ago.  Popes, consuls and emperors employed a gamut of guardians, from walls to geese,  in futile attempts at keeping the barbarians at bay.  </P> <P> Today is no different. In many aspects, a city that was once capital of the  world is now Third World. If, as ever, Rome's beauty is unsurpassed, it is also  tarnished.  </P> <P> As it passed its 2,742nd birthday, Rome quite literally, had no city  government. The mayor had quit after being accused of taking kickbacks on  school lunches, and wrangling politicians had been unable to find a successor.  </P> <P> In the piazza before a city hall designed by Michelangelo for greater pomp and  circumstance sits an empty pedestal. One of the city's most powerful symbols,  an equestrian statue of 2nd-Century Emperor Marcus Aurelius, belongs on the  pedestal, but like so much of monumental Rome, it was damaged by air pollution.  After lengthy restoration, the emperor and his horse are still absent from  their place in the piazza. Debate rages over the future of the world's oldest  bronze statue.  </P> <P> "We are the doctors, and we have cured the patient," said Alessandra Melucco,  the chief restorer. "What happens next is a political decision, but we know  that if the statue is again displayed outdoors, it will die."  </P> <P> Visitors are often disappointed, but Romans are by now inured to the endless  monumental restorations that are so much a part of both the city's travail and  its splendor. The continued absence of Marcus Aurelius from public view is  muted this spring by the return of the Arch of Constantine and Trajan's Column  from years of envelopment in restorers' cocoons. Other favorites, including the  Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon, are newly encased in scaffolding.  </P> <P> Of particular concern this year to the tourist hordes that are as much a  fixture of Roman spring as the reopening of outdoor trattorie is a sharp rise  in petty crime. It is no secret that 20th-Century vandals are inside the gates.  Watch your purse and stay off the No. 64 bus to the Vatican.  </P> <P> Crimes of violence are still atypical, but purse snatchers, pickpockets and  burglars are among the busiest of all Romans: They strike at an average of one  every 15 minutes.  </P> <P> Tanja Trabost, a long-time British resident, had a tough March: She was mugged  in Trastevere, her pocketbook was picked on a bus and her apartment was  burgled. An American woman whose tire went flat on the historic Old Appian Way  was delighted when a courtly Italian stopped to help. He jacked up the car,  removed the flat, took her purse and drove off.  </P> <P> Police, reporting a 25% increase in petty crime, blame heroin addicts in  general and, in particular, bands of South Americans, Yugoslavs, North Africans  and Gypsies. About 2,175 petty thieves were arrested in the first quarter of  1989, nearly half of them foreigners.  </P> <P> "People are getting worried, beginning to feel unsafe," said Vittorio Sgroi,  the ranking criminal judge for Rome. Jammed buses like the No. 64 that ferry  Romans and tourists around the choked city center are favorite targets of the  pickpockets.  </P> <P> A British couple were injured in a mugging last month, but even counting such  incidents, Rome remains a unique open-air museum as safe as it is alluring.  Among the American visitors who spent a total of nearly 2 million nights in  Rome last year, 877 suffered the theft of their passports.  </P> <P> "Petty crimes are more by stealth than violence," said U.S. Consul General  Dudley G. Sipprelle. "In my three years here, we haven't had a single American  hospitalized as a result of a mugging or robbery. My 76-year-old mother from  Los Angeles just wandered all over the city for nine days without any trouble.  Of course she didn't ride the buses, and she didn't carry all her documents or  money when there was no need for them."  </P> <P> What is galling about Rome for residents and visitors alike is that it lags  woefully behind other European capitals in infrastructural improvements. These  have not kept pace with a growing population.  </P> <P> Rome, whose population has swelled by persistent migration from the countryside  since World War II, is the only major European capital that is still growing.  Services of all sorts lag: roads, schools, public transport, hospitals,  parking. Tiberius got dispatches quicker from Gaul than today's Romans receive  letters from relatives in the United States. And how many other metropolises of  3 million these days have telephone numbers ranging anywhere from four to eight  digits?  </P> <P> Rome's arteries are so hardened that expert Bernard Winkler has been summoned  from West Germany to mastermind yet one more effort to conquer the city's  2,000-year-old traffic jam. Winkler earnestly promised that vehicular order  "will be my Christmas present to the city this year."  </P> <P> "Rome's current difficulties are the consequence of a sharp decline of the city  in the last 20 or 30 years," Deputy Prime Minister Gianni De Michelis noted  over a cup of inky espresso one recent morning. "Other European cities like  Paris, Frankfurt and Milan have gone one way, closer to Europe. Rome has gone  the other. More and more, it is like a Third World capital.  </P> <P> "In two or three decades of great change in Europe, nothing was done to prepare  Rome for a new way of life as an urban center," De Michelis added.  </P> <P> Proposals to modernize local governments with clearer lines of authority are  pending in Parliament -- and have been for years.  </P> <P> The rites of this Roman spring also were leavened by a juicy scandal at City  Hall, where Mayor Pietro Giubilo resigned after he and 31 others were accused  of corruption by an investigating magistrate.  </P> <P> Other magistrates are probing allegations of corruption in the traffic police,  the city bus company and the municipal licensing and housing departments. The  knaves, if they are uncovered, can only be featherbedding descendants of petty  Roman functionaries who tried the patience of the Caesars.  </P></p>

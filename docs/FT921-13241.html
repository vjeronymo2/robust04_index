			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Algerian Dollars 1.5bn loan in jeopardy: Reluctance of some lenders to refinance foreign debt may endanger funding A Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 830m) loan package to Algeria, intended to refinance the country's foreign debt with nearly 100 commercial banks, has been put into jeopardy by the reluctance of some lenders to back the plan. Failure to complete the deal would call into question the government's policy of refinancing Algeria's entire Dollars 23.5bn in outstanding foreign debt. It could also endanger new loans recently agreed with supranational agencies to support economic development. The difficulties emerged yesterday as cabinet ministers met for talks on the economy with the five-strong collective presidency, established a week ago following the cancellation of multi-party elections. Although western bankers did not link the refinancing problem directly with the political turmoil in the North African state, it will come as a further handicap to the Algiers authorities as they seek to maintain order. Algeria's debt burden, which stands at double its annual export earnings of Dollars 11bn-Dollars 12bn, has made it difficult to contain inflation or unemployment. These adverse economic conditions were seen as fuelling popular support for the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front, which had been on target to win the elections. Credit Lyonnais, which is leading the eight-year loan package, was last night attempting to salvage the deal, designed to refinance principal repayments falling due between now and the end of next year, which would postpone the burden of repayment. Agreement has come from banks representing Dollars 1.4bn of the total, but a small number have declined to participate. Under normal circumstances places could be taken by other institutions. However, some banks have made their commitment conditional on the deal gaining support of all Algeria's commercial creditors. Among the banks so far declining to accept the package is New York-based Bankers Trust. If the deal collapses, Algeria may have no alternative but to seek a restructuring of both commercial bank debt and other foreign debt obligations. Failure could also endanger a Ecu400m (Pounds 287m) loan agreed by the European Community. The facility was agreed on the understanding that commercial bank debts would be refinanced. Only Ecu250m has been disbursed so far. Some other international loans are proceeding as planned. For example, the final three parts of a Dollars 1.33bn trade finance package for development of liquefied natural gas facilities are still expected to be signed next month.

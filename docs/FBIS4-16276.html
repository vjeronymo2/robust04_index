			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow 15 April, TASS -- Twelve ships of the Black  Sea Navy have put to sea for combat training. These are planned  exercises and they are in no way linked with the latest events  in odessa, ITAR-TASS was told by telephone by officials of the  Navy's press centre on Friday.    According to the same source, three other ships of the Black  Sea Navy had put out for planned exercises on Thursday.  Therefore, taking part in the planned training mission in the  open sea are fifteen ships of the Black Sea Navy.    According to information received from the press centre, a  large landing ship left the Sevastopol base on Thursday to  evacuate Black Sea Navy personnel, their families and property  from Odessa. However, on the same day Ukrainian Defence Minister  Vitaly Radetsky addressed a telegram to the commander of the  Black Sea Navy, informing him that calls of Russian warships to  Nikolayev, Ochakov, Ismail and Odessa were undesirable. The  large landing craft was ordered to return to the base.    Reports from Sevastopol indicate that three ships of the  Ukrainian Navy, anchored in the Navy's chief base, have been cut  off from their shore power sources for the fourth day running.  Now they have to consume their own fuel resources to remain  operational. According to the official version of Black Sea Navy  officials, who had cut off the power supply, this was done  because the Ukrainian side had not paid its debts for the  already consumed electricity.    However, chief of the Ukrainian Navy's financial service  Colonel Viktor Kobernik claims that the debt for the electricity  was settled.</p>

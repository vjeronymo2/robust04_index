			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Arts: The Hamburg 'Tannhauser' - Music in Barcelona The Liceu, Barcelona's big and beautiful opera house, has been playing host to the Hamburg State Opera as part of the warming-up process for the Olympics. The invasion was generously planned: four performances of Harry Kupfer's 1990 production of Tannhauser and two concerts with Schoenberg's Gurrelieder, given jointly with the Liceu's chorus and orchestra, even the full Tannhauser company being insufficient for Schoenberg's late-Romantically exorbitant demands. Kupfer, with his questing, sometimes perverse theatrical mastery, sees the Venusberg in Tannhauser as a regime equally oppressive in its diametrically opposite way as the stuffy Wartburg with its traditional song contests. Modern attempts at staging Wagner's underground bacchanal are usually doomed to freakishness if not outright failure. Kupfer's tenable view leaves a producer free to make the Abode of Love more repellent than erotically exciting. In Hans Schavernoch's violently angular, black and white set - revellers milling restlessly around in the darkness - strange rites are enacted. At one moment a female head is raised aloft from an unseen, presumably dismembered, corpse. Venus and Tannhauser lie on a large property bed outlined in neon strips. The Wartburg valley is grey and grim. The pilgrims are transported to Rome in a ghostly Intercity train dimly perceived through mist. They return on foot, with picture hats. After their return the master-idea runs into trouble. At the moment of Tannhauser's supposed redemption the Pope is borne on to the stage and a vast throng is seen behind him. But while Wagner jubilates in E flat major strange lights flicker, segments of grey walls open and close like giant lobster-claws, threatening to engulf the frantic-looking Tannhauser, apparently rebelling even, perhaps most of all, against Grace. Irony could be rammed no further home. In between the not wholly convincing outer acts there comes a brilliantly conceived and executed staging of the Hall of Song - not even the most loyal admirer of this opera normally expects to enjoy this act from beginning to end. Tiers of metal seating are covered in white dust-sheets, whisked away at a touch just before the guest arrive. There follows a highly enjoyable parody of a typical, ghastly North European civic function of the kind where white ties and tails (Reinhard Heinrich's costumes are modern) are worn at eleven o'clock in the morning while trays of glasses containing drinks that no-one wants are solemnly handed round. The women have long black dresses with enough spangles to look festive. The function is carried through with choreographic precision. Even the actual contest did not have the usual dampening effect, so sharply were the competitors portrayed. Part of the success was due to the buoyant playing of the Hamburg orchestra under Gerd Albrecht. For once the march did not go flaccid. The normally thick-soup ensembles sounded almost transparent. Rene Kollo's fraught, probing, Tannhauser remains gripping in the narration and in the subsequent hysterical outburst, but in loud, high phrases the tone is worryingly unsteady. The Venus of Gabriele Schnaut, strong to the point of occasional aggressiveness, was warmly phrased. Linda Plech's Elisabeth was appealing except when, in the prayer, the voice pinched. Harald Stamm made a real person of the Landgrave, Kristin Sigmundsson's Biterolf was uncommonly forceful. Andreas Schmidt's Wolfram - restrained, moving, nobly sung, must surely be one of the finest since Herbert Janssen - a long time ago. Meanwhile the Palau de la Musica Catalana welcomed the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under Charles Dutoit. Since their complete Daphnis and Chloe has been heard in London, I will only say that in Barcelona a famous local choir, the Orfeo Catala, now celebrating its centenary, with a larger contingent than usual for this work, made a powerful contribution. The sonic effect was tremendous. Instead of the Beethoven concerto deemed necessary to tempt a London audience to brave the rigours of Ravel, the Montreallers played the Fourth Symphony of one of this year's centenarians - Honegger. The Fourth was written for Paul Sacher and the Basel Chamber Orchestra. Swiss-born Dutoit gave an admirably clear and sensitive reading of this sober but muscular score in which Honegger, who had dual French-Swiss nationality, gives thanks for the return of peace and for Sacher's support. The Hamburg visit was sponsored by Iberia airlines and the German Federal Government, the Montreal tour by Northern Telecom, the Canadian Government and the Quebec Ministry of Cultural Affairs</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Salih Abu-Hamad] </F>   [Text] Gaza -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chief Palestinian  negotiator at the Taba talks, described yesterday the meetings  in Davos between Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres as being on the level of  responsibility. He said those meetings produced positive results  which three months of talks with Israeli negotiators could not  produce. Sha'th expressed the belief that what was achieved in  Davos was the most that the Palestinians could achieve. He  said: Today we are very close, closer than some might think, to  reaching an agreement ensuring the beginning of implementation  of the declaration of principles.    Sha'th, however, refused to say when he expects a final  agreement to be signed, adding: Our negotiating experience with  the Israelis makes it difficult for us to set any timeframe.    In an exclusive statement to AL-QUDS, Sha'th said: We should  always remember that we are in a transitional stage in which the  Israelis will maintain their presence in two points -- the  settlements and the borders. It was agreed in the Declaration  of Principles to call those points "foreign security and the  settlements' security." We succeeded in confining this presence  to the narrowest possible geographic area with the provision  that there will be a Palestinian presence opposite the Israeli  presence. Sha'th stressed that the Davos accord preserved  Palestinian personal and national dignity.    On whether the prisoners' issue was raised at the  'Arafat-Peres talks, he said: We are talking about an overall  agreement that includes a reasonable timetable for releasing all  Palestinian prisoners, without exception.</p>

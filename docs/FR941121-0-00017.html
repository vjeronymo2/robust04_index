			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Several commenters criticized proposed comment 7(a)(1)&hyph;7, insufficient funds, which states that credit unions are not required to pay dividends on deposits returned for insufficient funds. After consultation with FRB staff, the NCUA Board, for reasons of parity, uniformity and conformity, declines to change the substance of the comment. However, the comment has been reworded, as suggested by a commenter, to clarify its meaning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three commenters requested clarification on the time of day to determine the day's balance. As long as the time of day used does not reflect the low balance for the day (such as after debits are taken and before credits are added), any uniform time of day may be used. The time of day so chosen is not a required disclosure. The guidance was provided in the proposed commentary and is in this final commentary as comment App. A, Part II, &sect;1&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> (a)(2) Determination of Minimum Balance to Earn Dividends <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Two commenters, including a national trade association commenter, noted that proposed comment 7(a)(2)&hyph;4, regarding beneficial method, did not conform to the position taken by the FRB in the final Regulation DD commentary. Since no uniqueness reasons exist, NCUA has revised the proposed commentary to conform to Regulation DD in this final commentary. The national trade association commenter also requested a definition of ``periodic rate'' in lieu of proposed comment 7(a)(2)&hyph;2. However, for reasons of uniformity, conformity, and parity, the NCUA Board declines to so modify this commentary. However, more clarification regarding periodic rates will be provided in a revision to the NCUA Accounting Manual for FCUs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 7(a)(2)&hyph;7 clarifies limitations on minimum balance requirements to earn interest for club accounts_such as ``holiday'' or ``vacation'' club. The rule does not apply to a club account's minimum balance requirements for earning bonuses. This position, taken by the FRB in the final Regulation DD commentary, is also adopted by the NCUA Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Compounding and Crediting Policies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 7(b)&hyph;3 has been revised to clarify that the circumstances under which an institution may deem an account closed, and that accrued, but uncredited interest may be deemed forfeited, are subject to state or other law, if any (such as limitations in the Standard FCU Bylaws). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed comment 7(b)&hyph;4, dealing with the forfeiture of accrued, but uncredited interest for dormant accounts, has been withdrawn for the reasons discussed in 7(a)(1)&hyph;6. This change is also in conformance with the final Regulation DD commentary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 707.8_Advertising <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Misleading or Inaccurate Advertisements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed comment 8(a)&hyph;2 would have required institutions using indoor signs advertising APY's for tiered-rate accounts to state both the lower and higher dollar amount for the tier corresponding to the advertised APY. Many FRB commenters convinced the FRB that stating both dollar amounts is unnecessary. Therefore, for reasons of uniformity and parity, NCUA has adopted the Regulation DD change and the comment provides that a sign is not misleading or inaccurate if it states the lower dollar amount of the tier corresponding to the advertised annual percentage yield. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutions cannot advertise accounts as ``free'' or ``no cost'' (or terms of similar meaning) if maintenance and activity fees can be imposed. Comment 8(a)&hyph;3 address the scope of ``maintenance and activity'' fees and addresses advertisements for ``free'' accounts with optional electronic services. FRB commenters were divided on whether fees for electronic services such as ATM access should preclude institutions from advertising accounts as free. Based on the comments received and further analysis, the FRB believes that ATM services are not different from other optional services such as home banking. Fourteen NCUA commenters, including two national trade associations, agreed with the FRB's reasoning and position. For the reasons stated by the FRB, NCUA follows the FRB and has revised comment 8(a)&hyph;4(vi) accordingly. One commenter requested a cross-reference to comment 4(b)(4)&hyph;1 and 2 regarding fee disclosures, which cross-reference has been added. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FRB received numerous comments on its proposal to consider the term ``fees waived'' as similar to the terms ``free'' or ``no cost.'' Many FRB commenters opposed the proposed comment. They stated that the term ``fees waived'' necessarily implies the existence of charges, and thus is distinguishable from the terms ``free'' or ``no cost.'' These FRB commenters believed consumers would be unnecessarily disadvantaged if advertising fee waivers were restricted as proposed. Others believed most consumers would not distinguish between the terms and that advertising accounts with ``waived fees'' raised the concerns of Congress had in mind when prohibiting the advertisement of accounts as free or no-cost or ``words of similar meaning.'' The FRB believes that ``fees waived'' is a term similar to ``free'' or ``no cost;'' thus, comment 8(a)&hyph;5 has been retained as proposed. For reasons of uniformity and parity, NCUA has followed the FRB's position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Permissible Rates <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

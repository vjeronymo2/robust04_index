			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: LME copper pulls back from 17-month high - Market Report The London Metal Exchange COPPER market proved vulnerable yesterday afternoon, settling about Dollars 30 below an early 17-month high and pulling other metals back with it. The three months delivery price closed at Dollars 2,252 a tonne, up Dollars 51.50 from Wednesday's official close, but close to levels reached later that evening. However, with a further big decline in LME stocks expected to be announced today, the three months delivery price should be able to resume an advance towards its immediate target of Dollars 2,300 a tonne objective, traders suggested. At the London bullion market the SILVER price suddenly leapt 6 cents a troy announce, pulling GOLD into another challenge of its Dollars 383-an-ounce resistance just minutes before the afternoon fixing. The yellow metal closed at Dollars 383.70, up Dollars 1, while silver ended at Dollars 5.62 1/2 , up 7 cents. Dealers said the markets were turning 'less bearish, if not more bullish', and were looking to the Commodity Research Bureau index, now at a 3 1/2  year high, for guidance. Compiled from Reuter</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mladen Stancic] </F>   [Text] Skopje, June 9 (TANJUG) -- Businessmen in The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) are paying an  increasingly high price because of the "southern traffic  pocket", created by the imposition of the U.N. sanctions on  Yugoslavia and Greece's trade blockade of the FYROM. The  transport of goods, raw materials and semi-manufactures via the  roundabout east-west corridor has resulted in a drastic rise of  business costs and, according to FYROM businessmen, will require  an additional 40 million U.S. dollars by the end of the year.  As a result, an increasing number of companies are facing  bankruptcy, while others have been forced to halt production.  The ban on transit through Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) was  introduced in April 1993, when the U.N. sanctions imposed in  late May 1992, were tightened.    The Greek authorities closed their border and imposed a  trade  embargo on the FYROM last January after some E.U. countries  recognized it as an independent state. Athens strongly opposes  the FYROM being recognized under the name of Macedonia,  explaining that this name is closely linked with the Greek  history and that it indicates FYROM's territorial claims. The  anti-Yugoslav blockade has so far cost the FYROM three billion  U.S. dollars.    Two million U.S. dollars have been earmarked for the "south  wing" of the so-called customs corridor, i.e. for the widening  of two bottlenecks at the border crossings Deve Bair (to  Bulgaria) and Chafa San (to Albania). That, however, has only  dimmed the essence of the problem.    Shipping agents in the FYROM are aware that the corridor  through Bulgaria and in particular the one through Albania  cannot be compared to the routes towards Europe via Serbia.    Although the distance between the border crossing Chafa San  and the Albanian port of Durres is only 148 km, trailer trucks  need over nine hours to cover that section because it is in a  very bad condition. Moreover, they are in constant fear from  road bandits or police "controls." The port of Durres, which  gained in popularity after the Thessaloniki port was shut down  to goods from the FYROM last February, is unable to meet all  requirements.    While transport charges in the world amount for 5-12 per  cent  in produce costs, the transport of FYROM goods to Europe via  Albania and Bulgaria hikes up these costs to as much as 50 per  cent.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / US seeks more evidence on Bush death plot claims US INVESTIGATORS are seeking more evidence on whether Iraq was behind a plot to assassinate former President George Bush on a visit to Kuwait last month. Mr George Stephanopoulos, the White House spokesman, said the US took the allegations of Iraqi involvement very seriously. 'If we determine Iraq was involved in state-sponsored terrorism, the US will take appropriate action against Iraq,' he said. It is unclear how the US could take tougher action against Iraq without resorting to military measures. There may, however, be a political danger in being seen to apply a double standard by dealing more harshly with Iraq than with Serbia. Eleven Iraqis and five Kuwaiti residents of Iraqi origin have been charged in Kuwait with conspiracy to kill Mr Bush and with other acts of terrorism. Iraq ridiculed the US and Kuwaiti charges. 'The sheikhs of Kuwait in co-ordination with American intelligence are plotting another deception to fool American public opinion in order to justify a new aggression on Iraq and tighten the economic siege imposed on it,' Mr Hamed Youssef al-Hummadi, Iraq's information minister, said. Reuter reports from Kuwait: Kuwait's parliament has formed a sub-committee to investigate allegations that Defence Ministry officials made money from defence deals which have been concluded since the 1991 Gulf war, a member of the assembly said yesterday. Mr Mubarak al-Dawilah said he had submitted documents supporting the charges to the sub-committee. The incidents of corruption, alleged to have taken place since the emirate's 1991 liberation, include charges that a French company paid kickbacks worth millions of dollars to a defence official to obtain a defence contract, Mr Dawilah said. Sheikh Ali Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah, the defence minister, has denied the charges of corruption and mismanagement.</p>

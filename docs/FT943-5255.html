			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: S Western Electricity buys back 2.5m shares South Western Electricity has become the third of the cash-rich regional electricity companies to buy back some of its shares. The Bristol-based company on Friday purchased 2.5m of its ordinary shares in the market at 820.5p per share, representing 2 per cent of the issued ordinary shares. Mr John Sellers, finance director, said the company had taken advantage of a downturn in its share price on Thursday to enter the market. In common with most other regional companies, South Western has powers to buy back up to 10 per cent of its equity. Mr Sellers said the company wants to assess the market's reaction to Friday's purchase before deciding whether to buy back more shares. Analysts expect other electricity companies will soon join South Western, Seeboard and Eastern in buying back shares. Each either has the cash in hand or low borrowings. Buying back shares boosts earnings per share and enhances the potential to raise dividend payments, even if the current upsurge in the sector's share prices continues. Brokers Hoare Govett estimate that share prices in the sector have risen between 40 and 45 per cent on average in the two months to the end of August.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government is clearly  not willing to make any concessions in the negotiations with the  United States on an aviation agreement. At the moment, the  issue is a "balancing" of the texts, Veit Steinle, spokesman of  the FRG Transporation Ministry, stated in Bonn on Friday [11  February] upon inquiry. If the U.S. side wants improvements in  the agreement, the same must be done for Germany, too. It is  necessary to keep a balance.    Gemany is trying to end the negotiations without "excitement  and panic." This is being done in the closest coordination with  the Federal Government and Lufthansa, Steinle said. The talks  with the U.S. company United Airlines on the contentious issue  of code-sharing, which Lufthansa would like, will be continued  in Washington on Friday. [passage omitted]</p>

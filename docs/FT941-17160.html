			<p>940106 FT  06 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Malaysia purchase for Laing John Laing, the UK construction group, has acquired a 5 per cent stake in YTL Power Generation, which has been contracted to build and operate two privately financed power stations in Malaysia where it is based. International construction companies increasingly are acquiring stakes in ventures involved in private infrastructure projects to increase their share of this work. Laing, which has been appointed project manager for building and civil engineering works of two gas turbine combined cycle power stations at Pasir Gudang and Paka, is paying MDollars 45m (Pounds 12m) for 5 per cent of the ordinary and redeemable preference shares of YTL. The construction contract to Laing is worth just MDollars 17m. Laing said its decision was 'a further step in the group's strategy of increasing involvement in private infrastructure projects worldwide.' The two power stations, costing a combined MDollars 3.5bn, are due to be completed next year. The first dividends are expected to be paid to shareholders in 1997.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhengzhou, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, member of  the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central  Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), today called on  the party members and government officials to uphold the spirit  of Jiao Yulu (the late party secretary of Lankao County).    At a gathering held in Zhengzhou, capital of Henan Province,  to mark the 30th anniversary of Jiao's death (May 14th), Hu was  entrusted by General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee  Jiang Zemin to deliver a speech today. He said that Jiao Yulu  was an excellent member of the CPC recognized by the whole party  and all the people of Chinese nationalities.    Jiao dedicated his life to the improvement of people's lives  and production in Lankao County in the early 1960s and his deeds  were regarded as a fine example in China.    Hu said that over the past three decades, Jiao's spirit and  deeds have inspired tens of millions of party members, officials  and people to advance.    He said that under the new conditions when China is building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, party members and  officials should cling to the principle of serving the people  whole-heartedly, carry forward and uphold the fine tradition of  making close links with the people, and work hard to open up new  development situations.    He stressed that party members should uphold Jiao's  down-to-earth working style, trust and rely on the people, seek  truth from facts, work hard, and be honest in work to enhance  the sense of responsibility in building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, improve capacity and the party's leadership,  fight corruption and promote party construction.    Li Changchun, secretary of the Henan provincial party  committee, and other party officials also made speeches at the  gathering.</p>

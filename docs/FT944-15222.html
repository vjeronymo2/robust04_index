			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Statoil and Saga prepare NKr40bn energy venture Two of Norway's biggest oil and gas companies will today announce details of an asset swap programme which will clear the way for a NKr40bn (Dollars 5.6bn) joint development plan for gas fields in the Norwegian Sea. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, and Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest independent oil company, will swap operational control of oil and gas fields in the North Sea and in fields off mid-Norway. There may be a swap of shareholdings between the companies. The government is also expected to disclose details of a deal in which the state will sell a large shareholding to Saga in either or both the Smoerbukk South and Smoerbukk gas and condensate fields in the Norwegian Sea. The NKr40bn co-ordinated development of these fields has long been stalled by doubts about the fields' economic viability and by differences of opinion over oil companies' investment priorities. The restructuring of the oil and gas assets and their co-ordinated development will allow the companies to share investment objectives. The developments will provide much-needed orders for Norway's oil supply industry whose order books have shrunk due to a fall in investment activity by oil companies and in which restructuring will force the loss of thousands of jobs. The economically depressed mid-Norway region near Kristiansund also stands to benefit greatly from their development. Statoil is understood to have agreed to exchange its operation in the North Sea of its 80m barrel Fenris oil field for Saga's operation of the 100bn cubic metre Midgard gas field. In August, Saga acquired a 50 per cent stake in Fenris from Esso Norge. Financial details were not disclosed. Statoil holds a 20 per cent stake in the field while the state owns a 30 per cent direct financial interest. In the Midgard field, which comprises two licences and is situated in Haltenbanken off mid-Norway, Statoil will assume Saga's operation in exhange for its Fenris operation. Statoil holds a 51 per cent stake in each of the Midgard licences. The state directly holds 31.4 per cent. Saga Petroleum has 9.8 per cent. The Smoerbukk field, where the state is understood to have agreed to sell all or part of its 31.4 per cent shareholding to Saga, is operated by Statoil with a 19.6 per cent shareholding. Smoerbukk contains 95bn cubic metres of gas and 37m cubic metres of condensate. The Smoerbukk South field contains 20bn cubic metres of gas and an estimated 150m barrels of oil. The Midgard field was discovered in 1981 while Smoerbukk was discovered in 1984 and Smoerbukk South in 1985.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAT tumbles Insurance and tobacco conglomerate BAT Industries fell sharply for the second consecutive trading day as analysts digested US price war implications. The stock lost 42 1/2 to 885p on continuing heavy turnover of 8.2m shares as SG Warburg, traditionally bears of the company, reiterated its negative stance. Analysts said the full impact of the Philip Morris announcement on Friday, of swingeing cuts in the price of its Marlboro brand, was diluted in the UK because it arrived late and because the rail strike kept many institutional investors away from work. Also, in the US, many experts were attending an RJR Nabisco annual meeting. Rothmans International 'B' shares fell 21 to 636p in sympathy. Rearguard support helped Wellcome shares regain 13 to 705p against a weak market. Pharmaceuticals experts argued that following Friday's announcement that many early stage HIV positive people would not receive benefits from taking Wellcome's anti-Aids drug, much of the media coverage was overblown. Mr Franc Gregori of Robert Fleming Securities reduced his 1994 profits forecast by Pounds 25m to Pounds 790m, but said Friday's wave of heavy selling reinforced Wellcome's position as 'our favoured stock within a very oversold drug sector'. In an internal note, Mr Robin Gilbert of Panmure Gordon said: 'The data published so far is seriously misleading.' A series of downgrades followed meetings between Unilever and food manufacturing analysts, sending shares in the Anglo-Dutch food group into retreat. Most of the changes in analysts' figures represented currency movements, although concern over the weakness in European sales was also mentioned. Most still retained their fundamentally positive view on the stock, although the negative sentiment knocked the shares 26 to 1163p. Dalgety shares were upset by weekend press comment, although food manufacturing specialists declared that most of the worries over the insurance dispute with Inchcape was thought to be in the price. The shares fell back 14 to 452p. Inchcape lost 5 to 585p. Food retailers remained under a cloud as analysts waited for what are seen as extremely important results from Tesco today. A price-led fightback by the supermarket chain would cast an even larger pall over the sector, according to retailing specialists. A chink of light was provided by Henderson Crosthwaite, which produced a weighty tome on the sector, largely dismissing worries over the likely effect of discounting food groups and asserting that the majors still have room for earnings growth. The house particularly likes Argyll Group, off 4 at 337p, Asda, 1 1/2 shy at 67p, and J. Sainsbury, 9 adrift at 478p. Stores proved a brighter spot, with selected retailers basking in the recovery story and some recent positive results. Among these, Great Universal Stores added 5 at 1618p, Kingfisher 3 at 592p and WH Smith 2 at 418p. Electricity shares were buoyant, largely on yield considerations, although dealers pointed out that turnover was low. Eastern was particularly strong, helped by a buy note and upgrade from SG Warburg. The broker attributes its positive stance to 'stringent cost control' which offers 'scope for enhanced dividend growth and removing any lingering investor concern regarding relative dividend prospects after the 1994-95 regulatory review'. The shares moved ahead 8 to 480p. Among water stocks, Southern was the best performer, climbing 5 to 548p. A press report that cable television was taking business from BT at the rate of 15,000 customers a month came as little surprise to the market and the shares drifted in a lacklustre telecoms sector, closing 6 down at 434p. The leisure sector continued to fret over the demise of Queens Moat Houses. Resort Hotels lost 4 to 36p, while the sector leader Forte shed 5 to 179p. Speculation that the latter will announce a dividend cut with its results next week continues to gather support among leisure specialists. The Grand National was also occupying analysts' minds with suggestions that Saturday's fiasco might require downgrades dismissed. Talk of a loss in revenue of up to Pounds 2m for Ladbroke Group as a result of the race's cancellation were also wide of the mark, market sources said. Ladbroke tumbled 10 at the market's opening, in line with other gambling groups, but later recovered to close just 4 off at 172p. Bass, owner of Coral, rallied to finish a penny off at 550p, while Brent Walker was a halfpenny lower at 12p. Concern about the passenger yield at British Airways also had an impact on BAA, which left the shares 9 lighter at 800p.</p>

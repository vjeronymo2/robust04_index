			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Minister tries to calm fears on councils THE GOVERNMENT'S new policy for local government reorganisation will not lead to district councils taking over the functions of county councils, Mr David Curry, local government minister, said yesterday. Instead, single-tier authorities would be created by merging adjacent district authorities which would be given wider powers. Mr Curry told a conference of the Association of District Councils: 'It is certainly not our intention that existing district councils will become unitary councils. I wish to make sure that the new councils can effectively tackle the problems of dealing with strategic issues.' He said that creating a mass of small unitary authorities would lead to the creation of new joint bodies, and added: 'If you do that, you might as well keep the counties in the first place.' Mr Curry refused to be drawn on an ideal size for the new authorities. Mr Martin Easteal, chief executive of the Local Government Commission, said he expected the new unitary authorities to have populations of between 150,000 and 250,000. Mr Curry made clear to the commission that the government did not expect it to recommend maintaining the status quo of two-tier county and district councils. He said: 'If we were to be invited to do that we might well decide we wished to revisit those recommendations.' Mr Curry's statement followed last week's poll conducted for the commission by MORI in County Durham, which found an overall majority of the voters favouring the status quo. Sir John Banham, chairman of the commission, described the views of the local electorate as 'the jury' for any proposals. He said he was 'most unlikely to discount the clearly expressed view of a representative sample of the people of Durham who have had a chance to look very closely at a range of unitary councils and are clearly unimpressed by them'. However, Mr Curry said: 'If I wanted the entire reorganisation to be determined by MORI, I would have asked them to carry it out in the first place.' He added that local authorities should now take the initiative in producing options for mergers between councils which could then be evaluated by Sir John. If they did so, he said, they could 'lead public opinion'. The alternative, he said, was 'falling back on the status quo'.</p>

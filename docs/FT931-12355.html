			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Observer: Special After months of trawling the City, Norman Lamont - or rather his financial secretary, Stephen Dorrell - has found a new special adviser. Swiss Bank Corp's Rupert Darwall is hardly a household name in the City, unlike his predecessor, Alastair Ross Goobey. But the 31-year-old is the one adviser earmarked for his feel for the markets and what the City is thinking. He is a protege of John Major's former political secretary, Judith Chaplin, and comes from the 'dry' end of the Tory party, being the sort of fellow who feels that the benefits of the Thatcher period are being wasted. Darwall has no problems in accepting a sizeable salary cut, because he regards the sacrifice as an investment in the 'long-term quality of his earnings'. Best known in the City for his work as a transport economist, Darwall is confident that his job security will not be threatened by any change at 11 Downing Street. Even so, it is not all that long since a still better-known transport economist had a part in certain upheavals right next door. Anyone remember Sir Alan Walters?</p>

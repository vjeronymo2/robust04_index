			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPAUL DEFENSE STALLS PEPPERDINE, 85-64  </P> <P> Pepperdine started out like a house on fire Saturday evening, but DePaul  quickly brought out the hoses.  </P> <P> The Waves (3-1) were unable to sustain an early lead and were beaten by DePaul,  85-64, before 3,104 at Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu.  </P> <P> Pepperdine used balanced scoring to build a 16-10 lead in the first six  minutes.  </P> <P> But the Waves, harried by a swarming DePaul defense, began missing shots --  including a couple of dunks -- and throwing the ball away.  </P> <P> The Blue Demons (3-0) capitalized on the mistakes and came back to take a 38-31  lead at halftime.  </P> <P> David Booth scored eight of his 21 points in the first five minutes of the  second half, spurring DePaul to a 60-39 advantage with 12:31 left.  </P> <P> Geoff Lear responded with eight of his team-high 18 points in the next five  minutes, igniting a 15-4 run by Pepperdine, and the Waves narrowed the gap to  64-54 with 6:48 remaining.  </P> <P> But Pepperdine had lost its spark, and DePaul outscored the Waves, 21-10, the  rest of the way.  </P> <P> Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said that his team "got a little greedy" after  leading early. "We couldn't sustain it against a team more experienced than we  are."  </P> <P> Asbury said he didn't think his team was intimidated by DePaul early in the  game, "but over a period of time we were."  </P> <P> Stephen Howard led DePaul with 24 points and nine rebounds.  </P> <P> Lear had a game-high 10 rebounds to go with his 18 points, but the Waves were  out-rebounded, 40-34.  </P> <P> Pepperdine's Doug Christie scored 11 points on four-of-14 shooting, and  teammate Rex Manu added 10 points.  </P> <P> The Waves shot only 38.5% from the field (25 for 65), and DePaul shot 50.9% (28  for 55). On free throws, Pepperdine shot a poor 52.4% (11 for 21), and DePaul  shot 87.1% (27 for 31).  </P></p>

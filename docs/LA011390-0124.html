			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHENEN'S 3-POINT PLAY LIFTS EL CAMINO REAL  </P> <P> There El Camino Real High forward Allen Chenen stood Friday night, toeing the  free-throw line in the Taft gym with two seconds left in a tie game against his  school's archrival.  </P> <P> These neighborhood and Northwest Valley Conference foes had overcome some early  sloppiness to play a taut fourth quarter. And now it was up to Chenen, who had  just converted a clutch, off-balance bank shot to tie the score and then was  fouled by Taft's Cornell Hill on the play.  </P> <P> "My heart was in my feet," Chenen said after the game.  </P> <P> But who needs a heart to sink a game-winning free throw? Not Chenen, whose  offering hit nothing but net to complete the three-point play and give El  Camino Real a 54-53 win.  </P> <P> The finish caused El Camino Real Coach Mike McNulty to leap high into the air,  a rare display of emotion from the usually reserved coach.  </P> <P> Just 30 seconds before Chenen's game-winning play, Taft sophomore Casey  Sheahan, who scored a team-high 16 points, had drilled a three-point shot, his  fourth of the game, to give Taft a 53-51 lead, its first since a 6-4 advantage  early in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Sheahan's shot capped a Toreador comeback in which Taft outscore El Camino  Real, 10-1, in the final four minutes.  </P> <P> Taft (12-5, 2-1 in conference play) hurt itself in the first half, making just  nine of 28 shots and committing numerous turnovers.  </P> <P> El Camino Real (5-7, 2-1), meanwhile, wasn't exactly on top of its game despite  Todd Orlando's game-high 17 points.  </P> <P> The Conquistadores made just 11 of 27 first-half shots but led, 24-20, at  halftime.  </P> <P> The Conquistadores built the lead to nine at 35-26 before Taft mounted its run.  </P> <P> But that run fell just short, courtesy of Chenen, who hit the winning layup  last week in a two-point win over Granada Hills.  </P> <P> So this stuff is old hat to you, now, eh, Allen?  </P> <P> He smiled shyly. "Yeah, it's getting pretty old."  </P></p>

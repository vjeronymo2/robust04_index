			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Bank concern over borrowing: Calls for tax increase boosted by need to hold the line on inflation THE ARGUMENTS for a tax rise in the November Budget strengthened last night after the Bank of England warned that the chances of Britain maintaining its better inflation record could be jeopardised by spiralling government borrowing. The Bank said in its quarterly inflation report that the Treasury's favoured measure of underlying inflation - the year-on-year increase in the retail prices index, excluding mortgage payments - was likely to stay below the government's 4 per cent target ceiling over the next two years. The prospect of underlying inflation dropping to the lower part of the government's 1-4 per cent target range over the next four years was 'within reach' as long as the government maintained tight control of fiscal and monetary policies. The Bank warned, however, that government borrowing, adjusted for inflation and expressed as a proportion of national output, was higher than at any time since the second world war. It warned this 'must be tackled' to keep the confidence of financial markets. The report said the deficit excluding interest payments was 'much larger' as a percentage of national output than in any other member of the Group of Seven industrial nations, which comprises Britain, the US, Germany, Japan, Canada, France and Italy. Unless Britain took action to bring revenues and spending 'closer to balance' the possibility of deficits staying high for some time could damage the credibility of anti-inflationary policies. That could follow from worries in capital markets that the government might finance the deficits by printing money. The Bank left open whether it favoured a tax rise in November for the next financial year, to come on top of the Pounds 6.7bn of extra taxation already due next April. But it said in the report further fiscal action 'may be required'. While relatively upbeat about the UK recovery in the first half of the year, the Bank said domestic and overseas demand was 'uneven' and could be adversely affected by the weakening economies in continental Europe. It gave a clear hint that in spite of signs of a slowing in the pace of recovery in the past two months, a cut in interest rates over the next month or so is unlikely to be considered by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. The Bank's quarterly inflation report was launched early this year as part of a government effort to win greater public confidence in its economic policies. In it, the Bank comments openly about inflation, though stops short of divulging policy advice to the Treasury. The remarks appear to increase the chances that Mr Clarke, on the back of reduced worries about inflation, may ease borrowing conditions closer to the time of the November Budget. Any cuts in base rates, held at 6 per cent since January, might partially compensate for the demand-sapping effect of a rise in taxation in the Budget to curb the Pounds 50bn budget deficit. The Bank said expectations about rising prices had moderated in recent months, partly because of high short-term unemployment and a large number of companies operating below capacity. Also the impact of the fall in sterling on import prices had been offset by a reduction in unit labour costs as Britain embarked on 'gradual recovery'. In June, the underlying measure of inflation stood at 2.8 per cent. The Bank said Britain still had some way to go before establishing the credibility of its anti-inflationary policies. It said the recent relaxation in the exchange rate mechanism might bring about lower rates in the medium term in the rest of Europe.

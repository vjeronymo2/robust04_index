			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in the preamble of the November 18, 1993 proposal (58 FR 60950&hyph;60951), Congress established substitution plans as a compliance option to increase units' compliance flexibility and reduce their overall costs of compliance in Phase I while still achieving the emissions reductions intended by Congress under title IV. A substitution plan allows the owner or operator of a unit listed in Table A of section 404 to reassign the unit's emissions reduction obligations to a designated non-Table A unit under the owner's or operator's control. Upon approval of the reassignment, the non-Table A unit becomes subject to all requirements for Phase I units with regard to sulfur dioxide and is allocated allowances. Emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit may therefore free up allowances, which may be used by the Table A unit (or any other unit) in lieu of making emissions reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 404(b)(5) of the Act expressly states that, with a substitution plan, the intended emissions reductions must still be achieved. That section requires that, in approving a substitution plan, the Administrator ensure that the substitution results in total emissions reductions at least equal to the total reductions that otherwise ``would have been achieved'' by these Table A and non-Table A units ``without such substitution.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b)(5). EPA concludes that the substitution provision is intended to provide an alternative means of achieving Phase I reductions, not a mechanism for avoiding such emission reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provision for reduced utilization plans has a statutory purpose that is also aimed at ensuring realization of emission reductions. As explained in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60951), Congress recognized that the potential for circumvention of emission limitation requirements exists because in Phase I only a minority of all utility units are subject to such requirements. A Phase I unit could simply reduce its utilization by shifting its generation, and the emissions that would otherwise result, to a unit that was not required to use allowances to cover its emissions. Allowances allocated to the Phase I unit would be freed up for use without achievement, at either unit, of the intended emissions reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In section 408(c)(1)(B), Congress adopted a solution to this problem. Owners and operators of any Phase I unit that, for compliance purposes, propose reducing utilization of the unit below 1985-87 utilization (i.e., its baseline) in order to comply with title IV are required to submit a reduced utilization plan. In such a plan, the owners and operators must designate the units that will provide generation to compensate for the reduced utilization of the Phase I unit or must account for the reduced utilization through energy conservation or improved unit efficiency. 42 U.S.C. 7651(c)(1)(B). Each compensating unit in an approved plan becomes subject to Phase I sulfur dioxide emissions limitations and is allocated allowances equal to that unit's baseline times the lesser of the 1985 actual or allowable emissions rate for the unit. The compensating unit will therefore have to use allowances to account for its emissions, including any increased emissions resulting from compensating generation that it provides for the Phase I unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator approves or disapproves each plan (and compensating units proposed therein) after determining whether the plan meets the requirements of title IV, including achievement of the intended emissions reductions under the Acid Rain Program. 42 U.S.C. 7651g(c)(2);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 60951. Thus, like the provisions for substitution plans, the provisions for designating compensating units in reduced utilization plans are intended to allow compliance flexibility but also to protect the emission reduction goals of title IV by requiring that plans not result in more emissions than would occur without the plans. In fact, if the reduced utilization plan provisions were interpreted to allow the creation of excess, new allowances, utilities could simply use such plans to circumvent the limitation on the creation of allowances under substitution plans by bringing the same Phase II units into Phase I as compensating units rather than substitution units. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This conclusion is not contradicted by the legislative history, cited by some commenters, discussing the compliance flexibility and potential cost savings resulting from use of the allowance market.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Senate Rep. No. 101&hyph;228 at 316. Such generic discussion of the ability of units to over- or under- control emissions and to trade allowances does not address the specific issue of the entry of Phase II units into Phase I.

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Management: Training supremos learn a profitable lesson / A look at how Britain's Industrial Society has come back from the brink 'IT WAS a shambles. We were technically insolvent and our backs were up against the wall,' recalls Rhiannon Chapman, director of Britain's Industrial Society. Eighteen months ago, the independent advisory and training organisation committed to developing workplace skills and spreading the gospel of good management, was fighting for survival. A proud, 73-year history was insufficient to guarantee any kind of future. After decades of spirited campaigning to impart best business practice to thousands of private and public sector customers, the society badly needed a dose of its own medicine. By 1990, the organisation had recorded an annual deficit of Pounds 1.4m and another loss was to follow in 1991. Poor financial management meant it was owed about Pounds 1m by customers; unused to being chased they were painfully slow to pay up. 'We were at that point which companies reach when the banks are tempted to pull the rug. We had a very sick balance sheet, with no cash and no reserves. 'It would have been pretty embarrassing to have been brought in to preside over the death of the organisation', Chapman adds. The financial crisis which remained largely hidden behind the Regency facade of the organisation's Carlton House Terrace headquarters in London stemmed from longstanding weaknesses. The society had never entirely seen itself as a hard-nosed business, a tendency reinforced by its commitment to balance its core commercial services - in-house training, company consultancy, conferences and courses - with a range of non-profitable community projects. It spread its training and advisory services too thinly. The programmes offered to the society's 12,000 member organisations were also looking outdated; weak marketing skills compounded the problems which the recession further underlined. Attempts to stop the rot hit staff morale. And just when training was emerging as a political hot potato, the society appeared to have lost its way. Its renewal began with the appointment in July 1991 of Chapman, a former personnel director at the London stock exchange. The choice of a woman was a statement of change in itself, given the exclusively male lineage which had run the society since its formation in 1918. Her reported assertion that the governing council had been 'quite brave' to appoint her was widely shared. For her part, Chapman saw the society as an important national asset which was under threat. The society could at least rely on goodwill among its traditional customers, having won widespread approval and support from government, business and the trade unions. Its reputation as an even-handed source of advice was largely intact. But the priority was for Andrew Cameron, who arrived from RTZ Corporation as finance director, to sort out the books. Old property valuations were updated, paving the way for short-term loans. Financial controls were improved and costs were cut without job losses. An intensive re-examination of the society exposed to detailed scrutiny its staff of 350, its services and its relationships with customers. A possible name change was considered and may yet emerge. 'Product lines' were reappraised - 'Did we need to go on running old courses for the sake of those Neanderthals who didn't want new ones?' - and a new generation of programmes is emerging. The society's organisational structure was also dismantled. An old, departmental structure denied customers full access to the range of services, while staff dedicated to teaching others the art of good communications rarely knew what their colleagues were doing. The new system features six, regionally-based business groups capable of responding better to local requirements. The core group of 16 middle and senior managers were subjected to a bruising period of self-analysis and appraisal which led to them all having to re-apply for newly-defined posts. In September, Bill Beaver, former director of corporate affairs at National Westminster Bank, arrived to head up a revitalised marketing effort. The 'quiet revolution', claims Chapman, means a more self-confident society, armed with a new mission statement and charter of principles intended to set new standards of best practice for organisations and individuals. Though the society may be more commercially adept, it will not give up its role in forging closer links between business, education and the community. It works closely with Training and Enterprise Councils, organises work-related schools conferences and helps to break the homeless-unemployed cycle. Its finances have improved. In the year ending last June, the society showed a surplus and there is cash in the bank. The revitalised organisation is more likely to use its highly-valued independence to speak on issues which it believes are vital to the education and development of Britain's workforce. Chapman says that, despite progress, the organisation is 'not out of the woods' yet. But it can, at least, say that it is practising what it preaches.</p>

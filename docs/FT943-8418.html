			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Brymon's passengers to exceed 400,000 Brymon Airways, the Plymouth-based regional airline rescued by British Airways in August last year, said yesterday it expected passenger numbers to be up by a third this year to over 400,000. Mr Mike Jones, managing director, said: 'In July Brymon flew 37,000 scheduled passengers at an average load factor of 70 per cent, remarkable figures for short-haul domestic operations, and a record'. Brymon flies to 10 destinations, including Paris and Frankfurt. from its hub airport at Bristol. Mr Jones acknowledged the airline had had a reputation for unreliability but said, since January, it had met or exceeded punctuality targets. British Airways, which had held 40 per cent of Brymon since 1985, took over the whole of the lossmaking airline last year and markets its services under a franchise arrangement. The airline said it was now trading well above budget. 'What we are proving is that BA can operate at a local level, providing the cost and operational structure can be kept in line with the type of service provided,' Mr Jones said. 'Brymon as BA is doing a whole lot better than Brymon as Brymon Airways.' He said the airline was seeking slots at Manchester and Dusseldorf airports for services from Bristol. It also planned to improve its operations from Heathrow to Plymouth and Newquay. It intends to examine the possibility of using Heathrow's crosswind runway to give extra capacity, using a special access landing system pioneered in the US.</p>

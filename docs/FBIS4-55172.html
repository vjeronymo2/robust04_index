			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "Lost President"] </F>   [Text] Three weeks after announcing a truce with the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], President Lech Walesa seems to  be lost. Not unlike the period immediately following  parliamentary elections, he does not seem to have any idea as to  how he should coexist with the governing coalition.    The president is not used to a situation in which he must  impose limits on himself, because some spheres up high are  excluded from the set of issues that can be disputed.    Since meeting with the SLD Club, Walesa has been linked to  the governing coalition by a network of interdependent  relations. He keeps the promises made to the coalition (he has  forwarded his draft constitution, his representative will  participate in the work of the committee, SLD is taking over the  deputy ministerial posts in the presidential ministries).  However, he apparently does not feel very comfortable in this  new situation.    This was quite obvious at a meeting with the Non-Party Bloc  in Support of Reforms [BBWR] in Szczecin, and at a meeting of  the Accord Forum in Gdansk, where Walesa did not have much to  say to his supporters. The official truce with SLD, concluded  before television cameras, has invalidated the main thesis that  he wanted to talk about during his tour of the country.    In addition, on some issues Walesa and SLD simply have  "similar goals." For example, the National Council of Radio and  Television [KRRiT] and public television in general. It cannot  be ruled out that Walesa will achieve what he has not been able  to achieve in any other way -- by appealing to the honor (of  three KRRiT members and requesting that they hand in their  resignations), through the method of "extending" the law  (recalling Chairman Marek Markiewicz from his function), by  expressing his dissatisfaction (Wieslaw Walendziak). Unless  there is some change here (one cannot exclude the possibility  that Walesa will not start defending KRRiT and Walendziak from  the "conquest intentions" of SLD), SLD will make changes that  the president will approve.    The president's helplessness is becoming increasingly  noticeable. Recently he has rarely had a chance to make a  decision which to some degree would concern the governing  coalition. He was the one to decide what should be done with  the amendment to the law on the procedures for preparing and  adopting the constitution. However, he really could not veto it  -- because he had made a deal with Kwasniewski that the  constitution issue would be excluded from any conflict areas, as  well as because the bill includes a provision concerning a  legislative initiative that he had been trying to pass.    Soon, after the Sejm makes its decision, he will decide the  issue of the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law.  He will be able to take advantage of this decision as a  propaganda move. If he vetoes it, he will earn the gratefulness  of "Solidarity."    The president has not been very successful recently in  dealing with several issues. He was very active, and his  behavior even had the characteristics of an election campaign.  However, opinion polls suggest that exactly in the period of  this activeness, his popularity was on the wane. Waldemar  Pawlak turned out to be disloyal, by announcing  self-governmental elections in line with the old Electoral Law  and not waiting for the president to query the new one.  Moreover, it turns out that Walesa cannot hope that someone  will build a pro-presidential grouping for him, without his  participation. BBWR is clearly not able to cope with this and  is just waiting for the president to get involved. Existing  groupings are looking for candidates for president; however, for  the time being none of them want to back Walesa.    Walesa cannot really rekindle an open conflict with the  coalition soon because the promises which he has made are an  obstacle here. Nor can he conclude a lasting peace with it  because the president, who considers himself to be the guarantor  of democracy, cannot make peace with a force which, according to  him, threatens it.    However, it can be expected that the president's conflict  with the coalition will last. If Walesa does not have other  possibilities of making the coalition's life difficult, there  will still be the word conflict. Just like there is now.  Walesa speaks about the necessity of reaching a balance, he  announces a "play-off." He has quite considerable possibilities  here, including the one that he is already exploiting:  Presenting the governing parties as a threat to democracy and  himself -- as the defender of this democracy.</p>

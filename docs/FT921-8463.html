			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / (CORRECTED) Companies hit back over river pollution criticisms Correction (published 19th February 1992) appended to this article. BRITAIN'S biggest companies yesterday insisted that they were taking their environmental responsibilities seriously, in spite of a report which said 27 of them exceeded limits for discharging effluent into rivers. The 27, among the largest 50 companies in the FT-A All-Share index, were listed in a report by the Ethical Investment Research Service (Eiris), based on records for the last three years from the National Rivers Authority and the River Purification Boards in Scotland. The incidence varies from exceeding limits once in the last three years to 35 times in the last year. The companies named are not necessarily the worst polluters, but they are the largest companies responsible for pollution. The reaction of most companies was that given their size, the number of incidents was lower than might be expected. Several said the breaches referred to by Eiris occurred up to three years ago, and that measures were being taken to ensure they were not repeated. Guinness, for example, has had problems with nine of its 31 malt whisky distilleries in Scotland. Unlike the rest, these nine were discharging treated effluent directly into rivers. Since 1990 Guinness has implemented a Pounds 2m programme to install treatment plants to bring discharges within agreed levels. Courtaulds is listed as exceeding discharge consents only once in the last three years. In June 1989 a fractured water main at the acetates factory at Spondon in Derbyshire led to acetile acid being discharged from the cooling system into the river Derwent. The company said: 'Acetile acid reacts in water. It takes out the oxygen, and some fish were suffocated, but it did not cause any long-term damage.' Courtaulds said systems had been put into operation to prevent similar incidents. Cadbury Schweppes said the rivers authority had recorded four cases of discharge limits being exceeded at its Bournville, Birmingham plant in 1989. But improvements in monitoring and control had prevented any recurrence of the problem in 1990 or 1991. Grand Metropolitan said some infringements had occurred at two Express Dairies plants, which were sold to Northern Foods in November last year. Controls had been improved to ensure the plants met their discharge standards. One had since won an environmental award. Other problems had occurred at the Auchroisk distillery in Moray, but GrandMet said the distillery, built in 1974, had tighter permitted discharge levels than older plants. The company is spending Pounds 250,000 on a treatment plant to ensure that it meets the more stringent standards by April. BP said the Eiris comments were 'perfectly valid', adding that it was working to reduce water pollution. It is spending Pounds 37m at the Grangemouth refinery on the Forth on a water effluent treatment plant which should be in operation by the end of 1993. Each of BP's three main operating companies, covering oil, exploration and chemicals, has a body supervising environmental control. Many of the companies named by Eiris including GEC, Cadbury Schweppes and Hanson, admitted that they had no central monitoring system or register of pollution problems, but said that subsidiaries had their own environmental units. Correction (published 19th February 1992). IN a report on water pollution published in yesterday's Financial Times it was stated that General Electric Company had no central monitoring system or register of pollution problems. In fact, GEC has a central register of pollution problems and a group adviser on safety and the environment.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THIS SACRIFICE FLY TO WILLIAMSPORT IS WORTH IT FOR O.C. UMPIRE  </P> <P> Ken Kieling traveled nearly 3,000 miles, spent $1,800 and gave up a week of his  vacation time. All so he could spend a week telling 11- and 12-year-olds  whether they're safe or outta there!  </P> <P> Kieling, 42, a resident of Coto de Caza, is in Williamsport this week as one of  10 umpires at the Little League World Series. It is, Kieling said, a thrill  like no other.  </P> <P> "You only get to umpire in the Little League World Series once. This is my one  time," said Kieling, who has been a youth baseball umpire for 23 years.  </P> <P> Friday, Kieling got his one allowed turn as home plate umpire, during the  Shippensburg, Pa.-Mobile, Ala., game. Friday afternoon, he was the first base  umpire during the Taiwan-West Germany game.  </P> <P> "Without a doubt, this is the highlight of my Little League career," said  Kieling, an equipment installer for General Telephone.  </P> <P> Kieling, who grew up in Manhattan Beach, where he played Little League, started  umpiring because he saw a need and he wanted to give back to the program.  </P> <P> "It's just fun," he said. "We're all volunteers, but we love doing it."  </P> <P> Kieling has umpired at two other World Series -- the Big League World Series  (ages 16-18) in 1983 and the Senior League World Series (ages 13-15) in 1987.  But this one, he says, is different.  </P> <P> "You get a lot more attention here, and they (Little League officials) just  treat you real nice," he said. "It's special."  </P> <P> But expensive. Little League baseball does not pay for any of the umpires'  travel or accommodation expenses.  </P> <P> "Actually, all the local leagues in our district (South Orange County) helped  chip in," said Kieling, who has made the trip to Williamsport three times -- in  1987 as a spectator and last June for an umpire meeting.  </P> <P> "Just walking out to do Little League, you've got to put it in perspective,"  Kieling said. "They're just 11- and 12-year-old kids . . .  </P> <P> "But I think it's everybody's dream to play in a Little League World Series, so  this is the next best thing. You get chills, really. The other day, I had  butterflies before the game."  </P> <P> Asked for his analysis of the action so far, Kieling said he was most impressed  with Shippensburg.  </P> <P> "I've never seen a kid throw harder," he said, referring to Bob Shannon,  Shippensburg's ace. In all my years in Little League, I'd have to say that kid  was the best I've ever seen. He was clocked at 75 miles per hour. He brings it  on. He's intimidating, and cocky too."  </P> <P> But Cypress, Kieling said, is impressive too.  </P> <P> "I've umpired Cypress twice in California. I'd say they're comparable to  Northwood (the Irvine team that made it to the final in 1987)," Kieling said.  "Cypress hits real well, but their pitching overall is a hair better than  Northwood's was."  </P> <P> Would he like to pick a winner?  </P> <P> "I'm going to be the typical ump," Kieling said with a smile.  </P> <P> "I'll just say I hope the best team wins."  </P></p>

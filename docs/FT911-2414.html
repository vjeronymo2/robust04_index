			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Voluntary bodies face crisis vote over Pounds 29m THE CONTINUED existence of many London voluntary organisations rests on a meeting of one of the capital's borough councils tonight. After months of wrangling between the political parties, the London Boroughs Grants Committee, which allocates London-wide voluntary-sector support, reached agreement on its 1991-92 budget earlier this month when two Conservative-controlled boroughs - Ealing and Enfield - voted with Labour and Liberal Democrat councils to support a Pounds 29m voluntary-sector funding programme. Ealing has since told the grants organisation that its finance committee lacked the full council's authority to support the budget. The council will tonight decide whether to uphold or reverse the decision. A decision by Ealing to withdraw its agreement to the Pounds 29m budget would aggravate an already severe crisis in the voluntary sector. It would lead to further delays in the distribution of grants to voluntary organisations, and possibly to High Court action. Voluntary organisations throughout Britain are facing financial difficulties because of cuts in local-authority support and loss of other public funding. Many in London are living on borrowed time - and in some cases borrowed money - as they await the allocations. Any further delay would cause many to close. The threat to London's voluntary sector is embarrassing for the government, which wants voluntary organisations to take over welfare and other responsibilities from public authorities. Ministers are believed to be urging their fellow Conservatives at Ealing to endorse the Pounds 29m budget. The London Boroughs Grants Committee was set up after the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986 to distribute public support to voluntary organisations serving more than one borough. Its budget has declined in real terms over the six years of its life because it has to be agreed by two thirds of the boroughs. Differences are largely party-political but also reflect tensions between relatively deprived inner-city boroughs and more prosperous outer ones over how much voluntary activity is necessary. The committee says in its annual review, published yesterday, that demographic changes and government policies such as the contracting-out of public services were going to increase pressures on voluntary organisations.</p>

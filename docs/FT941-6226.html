			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation fears prompt sharp fall in Dow Wall Street US share prices fell across the board in heavy trading yesterday in the wake of a sharp decline in bond prices that was inspired by fears of rising inflation, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 22.79 down at 3,809.23. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index declined 2.70 to 464.44, while the American SE composite slipped 1.38 to 469.96 and the Nasdaq composite fell 3.86 to 788.64. All the main indices ended off their lows for the day. NYSE volume was 304m shares and declines outpaced rises by 1,435 to 697. The day's first big economic news - an upward revision of the fourth-quarter gross domestic product from 5.9 per cent growth to 7.5 per cent growth - had little impact on prices. Although this was ostensibly good news for stocks, analysts warn that these rates of growth will not be sustained in coming quarters. Also, investors are nervous at any sign of excessive economic expansion because it might prompt the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates again. Soon after 10 am, however, prices turned decisively lower. The heavy selling was prompted by a sudden and sharp decline in bond prices. The sell-off in the bond market, which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond up to 6.73 per cent, followed the publication of the National Association of Purchasing Management's February report and, in particular, the announcement that the NAPM's index of prices rose sharply last month to its highest level since October 1990. Like their counterparts in the equities market, bond investors are worried that the Fed will tighten monetary policy again soon. Yesterday's NAPM prices data, said analysts, brought the prospect of another rate rise nearer. This thinking, plus the fact that the stock market rarely likes to see bond yields rising, was behind the declines in share prices. Additionally, traders said several computerised sell programs executed during the morning exaggerated the market's downward trend. Interest rate-sensitive issues were lower. Among banks, Citicorp fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 40 3/8 , Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 31 1/2 , First Chicago Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 48 1/4 and Wells Fargo Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 136 1/2 . Brokerage stocks were also weaker, with Morgan Stanley losing Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 65 3/8 , Merrill Lynch Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 40 1/8 and Salomon Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 49 3/8 . Federal National Mortgage Association, which has benefited greatly from falling interest rates, receded Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 82 1/4 . Digital Equipment bucked the wider trend, forging ahead Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 31 1/4 in volume of 3.6m shares after broking house Salomon Brothers was reported to have upgraded its rating on the stock from 'hold' to 'buy'. On the Nasdaq market, Snapple fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 27 1/8 after Coca-Cola launched a new range of soft drinks under the label 'Fruitopia' that is clearly aimed at competing with Snapple's own hugely successful brands. Canada Toronto finished sharply lower in moderate trading as interest rate fears thrashed the bond market - but traders insist a rally is just around the corner. The TSE 300 index surrendered 33.4 at 4,390.4 and declines led advances by 440 to 316 after volume of 67.3m shares valued at CDollars 756.5m. The mining sector dropped 2.1 per cent, due in part to a fall in Alcan. The stock shed CDollars 1 to CDollars 31 following news that talks about production cutbacks among the world's major aluminium producing countries are progressing more slowly than expected.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CARTER MEETS WITH ARAFAT;  </P> <P> THEIR PARIS SESSION STIRS CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and former President Jimmy Carter met today in an  effort to break the stalemate in the Middle East peace process. The meeting  outraged Israel and many French Jews.  </P> <P> In a surprise development, French President Francois Mitterrand injected  himself into the unprecedented session and met the two before their bilateral  talks for an update "on the prospects for peace in the Middle East," the Elysee  Palace said.  </P> <P> Israel reacted to the meeting with alarm. Government officials said they had  not been informed of the Paris talks either by Carter or by the Bush  Administration.  </P> <P> "Anything that gives credit to Arafat only strengthens his belief that he can  go on with an extremist attitude," said Yosef Amihud, a spokesman for the  Foreign Ministry in Tel Aviv.  </P> <P> Carter and Arafat arrived separately at the Elysee Palace for the talks shortly  after 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Roland Dumas told reporters before the meeting that the  three-way session "could be useful and happy" and that France hopes "to unblock  the Middle East peace process."  </P> <P> Originally the meeting was to involve only Arafat and Carter, but Mitterrand  announced that he was taking part in the unprecedented meeting shortly after  the arrival of the two leaders in the French capital.  </P> <P> Police stepped up security at Orly Airport for Arafat, who landed aboard a  special Iraqi executive jet shortly after 4 p.m. More than 200 gendarmes and  anti-explosives experts ringed the airport's Honor Pavilion, normally reserved  for heads of state, where French officials met Arafat for security reasons.  </P> <P> Carter arrived from Brussels, Belgium, a short time later.  </P> <P> Diplomatic sources said Carter, architect of the 1978 Camp David peace accords  and the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, unofficially is acting as an emissary  of Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who is anxious to crank up talks  between the Palestinians and the Israelis.  </P> <P> A Jewish group, the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France,  protested the Carter-Arafat meeting, saying it "has demanded to be received by  Jimmy Carter to obtain clarifications" about why he agreed to meet Arafat.  </P> <P> "Arafat demonstrates today to France and our fellow citizens that he only  presents a facade of being a messenger of peace and conciliation. In reality he  remains partisan of a murderous conflict," the group claimed in a statement.  </P> <P> Mitterrand last May became the first major Western leader to officially receive  Arafat, and at that time French Jews were also deeply offended.  </P> <P> Last month, Carter made a private tour of Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Israel and  denounced human rights violations in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and West  Bank. Carter criticized Israel last month for its methods of suppressing the  2-year-old Palestinian uprising and called for an international peace  conference.  </P> <P> Carter, who mediated an Israeli-Egyptian treaty excluding Arafat from the peace  process, said during his visit to Jerusalem last month that he saw a major role  for the PLO in the search for peace.  </P> <P> Carter was to have met Arafat in Tunis last month but canceled the trip when  the PLO leader went to Namibia to attend independence celebrations.  </P></p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (3): Cause for local celebration  -Regional airports are chasing small airlines Norwich is celebrating 800 years as a city and capital of the English region of East Anglia. Another cause for local celebration is the sudden success of Norwich airport. With a newly completed Pounds 1m extension to its terminal building, Norwich now handles 230,000 passengers a year and epitomises the rise of the regional airport. 'We survive on feeding other airports through the hub and spoke system says Norwich Airport marketing manager Peter Buckell. Amsterdam's Schiphol is the lifeblood of Norwich. So far this year 63,000 passengers from the wealthy but remote region of East Anglia have flown out of Norwich on one of four daily flights to Schiphol. Consolidated fares, the practice of selling one ticket inclusive of the regional air fare to the larger hub and then on to the ultimate destination, have made Norwich an attractive prospect for Transatlantic passengers. The hop across the North Sea to Schiphol takes less than an hour, and the Dutch hub is renowned for the facilities it affords transit passengers. A new pier has opened recently dedicated to regional services. Mr Buckell is mildly surprised at the effect of this connection 'We have been flying to Amsterdam for 25 years now, and this year has exceeded all expectations.' Norwich Airport is a comfortable option for passengers. With just three gates it offers a contrast to the mayhem of Heathrow or Gatwick, and that lack of congestion is mirrored in the air. Landing slots are available and capacity problems are unheard of. This ease of access for airlines has combined with increasing journey times to major airports to boost regional airports and the carriers that specialise in servicing them. This growth has been a boon to the 56 members of the European Regional Airlines Association (ERAA). A spokesman claims that ERAA airlines find themselves pursued by adventurous airports. 'It is quite common nowadays to see an airport go out, find an airline and propose that the carrier takes up slots on a new route,' the spokesman said. 'The airport itself will have done the market research to justify that route. Airports are now being innovative in offering marketing support to the airline service.' This is a new tack for airport authorities. Traditionally they waited for the carriers to beat a path to their door and plead for landing slots. But across Europe regional airports are chasing the new small airlines to marry their capacity with passenger demand for local, convenient terminals. Liberalisation under an EU Inter-regional Air Services Agreement played a big part in creating this market. Air UK is one of ERAA's larger members with 1,400 employees and a fleet that includes BAe 146 four-engined jets. The advent of jet aircraft such as the 146 and Fokker 100 have expanded the options for regional services. With about 100 seats and an airframe designed for economical operations over short distances these aircraft make the most of new European routes. Phil Chapman, director of planning at Air UK says the 146 was the deciding factor in Air UK's adopting a service from the UK to Florence. Previously passengers for Tuscany flew to Pisa. Mr Chapman says Air UK can now tap into lucrative upmarket holiday traffic by offering a flight direct to a popular destination. This kind of association benefits both parties. The ERAA cites the development of Dortmund airport as a result of close co-operation between the airport authority and the Nuremberg-based carrier Eurowings. Mr Chapman notes that most of the 36m passengers carried by ERAA members in 1993 are ultimately bound for a centre of population. But the ease of access factor will persuade them to land away from their prime destination. Dusseldorf is cited as a successful regional airport, but Dusseldorf Airport Ltd is now promoting Monchengladbach, 15km away, as an attractive destination. The company highlights 'unlimited slots, favourable user charges' as incentives to carriers, while passengers can enjoy air and bus shuttles to Dusseldorf itself. Eastern Europe is latching on to the hubs and spokes theory. Under Soviet domination Hungarian internal aviation relied on a network of 20 grass airstrips to supplement Budapest's main terminals. Now the civil aviation authority is taking control of former Warsaw Pact military airbases. Hungary is acquiring a ready-made regional airports infrastructure that should help attract foreign investment that will see its local carriers moving out of their traditional domain of cargo carrying and crop-spraying into more profitable sectors. The carriers that make up ERAA are currently enjoying an average annual passenger growth rate of 14 per cent. That is double the figure for large carriers flying traditional routes into leading hubs. Regional airports have learnt to work in tandem with these carriers and make life easier for the hard-pressed passenger as well as boosting the bottom line. This is a perilous industry, with apparently successful operators such as Air UK nudging the balance sheet into profit. Regional airports simply cannot afford to ignore the customer.</p>

(714) 540-2500.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DISCOUNT SHOPPING  </P> <P> If the thought of paying full price for holiday gifts brings out the Scrooge in  you, pick up a copy of "Buying Retail Is Stupid!" by Trisha Crumley, Deborah  Newmark and Bonnie Cunningham (Newmark Management Institute), a handy guide to  off-price stores and shopping centers in Southern California. (A reminder: Many  discounters do not accept credit cards, so call ahead.) Local listings include  Freidman's -- the Microwave Specialists in Orange, which offers more than 75  kinds and a full line of accessories; B &amp; B Marine Equipment &amp; Service  in Newport Beach, which carries goodies for the sailor in your life; and  Nordstrom Rack in Santa Ana, where you can pick up shoes, clothing and  accessories from past seasons at the chain's regular stores at 30% to 70% off.  </P> <P> Barstow, situated midway between L.A. and Las Vegas, is hardly around the  block. But the prices and selection at the Factory Merchants Outlet Plaza (2837  Lenwood Road) may make it worth the drive. You can find savings of 20% to 70%  off regular retail prices on items from such name-brand companies as Lenox,  Fieldcrest, Gant, Anne Klein, Ralph Lauren, London Fog, Oshkosh B'Gosh and  more. Shopper extraordinaire Buckita Benson offers trips there through her  Outlet Shopping Tours. The $24 package includes luxury bus transportation to  and from the center, refreshments and a comprehensive store guide. The next  tour scheduled from the Orange County area is Dec. 8. Call (213) 372-9930.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SPECIALTY GIFTS  </P> <P> Those fancy gourmet baskets overflowing with imported goodies and fine wines  make impressive gifts. But they can also make a serious dent in your holiday  budget. With a little legwork and imagination, though, you can put together  your own at significant savings. A good first (and possibly last) stop would be  Trader Joe's, the food and wine chain, which has stores in Laguna Hills,  Fullerton, Santa Ana, Costa Mesa and Huntington Beach. There are variations,  but the stores generally offer items such as dried fruits, gourmet nuts  (macadamias are now available at $5 per 12 oz. bag), cheeses, sausages, and  imported wines and beers (with big savings on these). A $14.99 Stoli Sampler,  for example, has three flavors of the pricey Stolichnaya vodka.  </P> <P> In Old Town Orange (corner of Chapman Avenue and Glassell Street), antiques  from Victorian furniture and artwork to '50s collectibles can be found among  the 35 shops and mini-malls in the area. After shopping, you can relax at one  of the area restaurants or sit next to a sparkling fountain. Most stores are  open daily from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. (714) 633-7766.  </P> <P> Uncle Pat is pining for an early American armoire and Aunt Sue dotes on antique  doilies. Chances are you'll find both at Old Barn Antiques in San Juan  Capistrano (31792 Camino Capistrano). Housed in five historic buildings, 65  merchants offer a variety of antiques and collectibles ranging from delicate  linens to 1960s memorabilia. All stores are open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. (714)  493-9144.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'TIS BETTER TO GIVE  </P> <P> A number of charitable groups give you a chance to spread that holiday cheer to  those less fortunate. Here are a couple of ideas . . .  </P> <P> Give a goat (or rabbit or heifer or chicken) to a needy family through the  Alternative Christmas Giving Market from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. every Sunday until  Christmas at the United Methodist Church of Garden Grove (12741 Main St.). Make  a donation of any size toward the purchase of livestock, seeds, medicine of  other necessities for the underprivileged, and you will receive a card  describing the gift to give to someone on your list. The funds are channeled  through local and international charitable organizations, among them the Church  World Service/United Methodist Committee on Relief and Real Help of Garden  Grove. (714) 991-5558.  </P> <P> The Orange County office of the Salvation Army hopes to aid 20,000 deserving  folk during the holidays. Their bell-ringers will be out in force at all major  shopping centers from Monday, Nov. 26, through Christmas Eve. At the Laguna  Hills Mall, the group will have an Angel Tree listing the names and ages of  needy children. Shoppers may take a name, purchase and wrap a gift for that  child and return it to the tree for the group to distribute on Christmas Eve.  Donations of cash, food and wrapped gifts and also helping hands to aid in  sorting and distributing the goodies are welcome at the Salvation Army  Christmas Headquarters (101 S. East St., Anaheim). (714) 558-9354.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MALLS  </P> <P> OK, we put it off as long as we could.

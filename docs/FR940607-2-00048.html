These supplementary rules are intended to protect public land facilities and provide for public safety for the Row River Trail, a rails-to-trails conversion project near the city of Cottage Grove, Oregon. The BLM is accepting the donation of the former railroad as a non-motorized trail from Willamette Industries, Inc., as partial settlement of a debt owed to the United States. Upon acceptance of the trail and associated properties by the United States, the donated land will be available for public use. These rules are designed to reduce the potential for damage to the trail by unauthorized motor vehicle traffic and to enhance the safety of trail visitors and neighboring residents. A ``Notice of proposed establishment of supplementary rules'' was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19204) and provided for a thirty day comment period that ended May 23, 1994. Four letters were received, containing two substantive comments. One comment objected to the prohibition against the possession of firearms on the trail. The writer felt that a prohibition against discharge of firearms would be sufficient and that visitors should be allowed to carry firearms for self-defense. It was decided to retain the restriction against weapons, including firearms, to reduce the potential for misunderstanding of rules by trail users and to help protect people both on and off the trail from accidental injury. Another comment objected to the prohibition against motorized vehicles on the grounds that this would exclude disabled visitors from using all-terrain vehicles or motorized wheelchairs on the trail. The rule does allow use of motorized vehicles authorized by BLM, which could include disabled visitor's motorized wheelchairs or specialty all-terrain vehicles on a case-by-case basis. Each situation would need to be evaluated with regard to the potential for such use to damage the trail or the surrounding environment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should be sent to Terry Hueth, South Valley Area Manager, Eugene District Office, P.O.

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Midland Independent asks MMC to block bid by rival Midland Independent Newspapers, publishers of the Birmingham Post and Mail, has told the government it should continue to block the proposed Pounds 92m acquisition of T Bailey Forman, publisher of the Nottingham Evening Post, by the Daily Mail and General Trust, publishers of the Daily Mail. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission unanimously opposed DMGT's proposed acquisition of T Bailey Forman. It said the deal would give DMGT too high a concentration of newspapers in the East Midlands area. In written evidence to Mr Tim Eggar, trade secretary, MIN argues that the only way to address concerns about the deal is for DMGT to sell daily titles in the region. DMGT has described this as 'wholly unacceptable'. The Birmingham group contends that it is impossible to devise a form of words that will ensure that the concentration of power involved in the acquisition would not operate against the public interest. MIN also says that the amount offered, nearly 29 times the earnings of the Nottingham titles, suggests that 'DMGT will have to follow policies to remove smaller and weaker competitors, to allow it to capitalise on a monopoly position and so maximise its return from local advertisers'. DMGT has been given a December 5 deadline to convince Mr Eggar that the deal should go ahead. Mr Peter Williams, finance director of DMGT has made it clear the company will demonstrate the diversity of editorial views exhibited by its regional titles. Both MIN and Emap, the newspaper and magazine group, are understood to have bid between Pounds 70m and Pounds 75m for T Bailey Forman last time. Both will bid again if the titles come back on to the market, but probably with lower bids.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The precontroversy discovery period for rate adjustment proceedings is similar to that for distributions. After receiving a petition for rate adjustment, the Librarian will issue a request for public comment or conduct public hearings to determine whether the petitioner's interest is significant, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and require interested parties to file a notice of intention to participate. After reviewing comments or the hearing record as to the petitioner's significant interest and receiving notices of intention to participate, and after the period described in &sect;251.63(a), the Librarian will issue a precontroversy discovery scheduling order identical to that for distribution proceedings. The Librarian will require exchange of direct cases, conduct the one round of motions and objections, issue appropriate rulings, and announce the date on which initiation of arbitration proceedings will begin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The determination of ``significant'' interest is not required for the noncommercial educational broadcasting and satellite carrier rate adjustments since they begin automatically as provided in sections 118 and 119 of the Copyright Act. The Librarian shall, therefore, schedule precontroversy discovery in advance of the pre-set starting dates for those proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We believe that these precontroversy discovery and scheduling regulations should provide a workable solution to the time pressures of distribution and rate adjustment proceedings, and should sharpen the focus of the proceedings by eliminating much of the preliminary work that would be faced by the CARPs without such procedures. We agree with the Copyright Owners that 17 U.S.C. 801(c), coupled with Chairman Hughes' floor statement regarding precontroversy discovery, provides ample statutory authority for the Librarian and the Copyright Office to conduct precontroversy discovery and issue rulings. It may be that, with some issues, the Librarian will designate the issue raised during the 45-day precontroversy discovery period to the appropriate CARP for disposition, but it is our belief that the Librarian will be able to dispose of most precontroversy discovery issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Status of Certain DART Proceedings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Copyright Office concluded in the Interim Regulations that two categories of digital audio proceedings set forth in chapter 10 of the Copyright Act were not CARP proceedings and therefore not subject to these rules: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i) the proceeding raising the maximum rate for digital audio tape royalties which, under 17 U.S.C. 1004(a)(3), is to be handled solely by the Librarian;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) the arbitration proceeding under 17 U.S.C. 1010 to determine if a digital audio recording or interface device is subject to royalty payments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 59 FR 23967 (1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RIAA/AARC agrees with the Office that proceedings under section 1004(a)(3) to raise the royalty maximum should be ``handled solely by the Librarian.'' RIAA/AARC, comments at 2. RIAA/AARC is concerned, however, with the costs involved in adjusting the royalty maximum and urges the Copyright Office to apply to DART its policy for CARP rate adjustments; that is, requiring that the burden of costs be shared equally by both copyright owners and users participating in an adjustment proceeding.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 3 (59 FR 23977).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RIAA/AARC does not agree that arbitration proceedings under section 1010 should be treated separately and states that ``the CARP system should be applied in these proceedings.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RIAA/AARC, however, offers no support for its position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EIA supports the Copyright Office position for both section 1004(a)(3) royalty maximum adjustment and section 1010 arbitration. EIA notes that section 801 of the Copyright Act contains no reference to royalty maximum adjustments or section 1010 arbitration, and that the Copyright Office correctly observed that the former Copyright Royalty Tribunal's duty to ``carry out its other responsibilities under chapter 10'' was expressly repealed from section 801 in the CRT Reform Act. EIA, comments at 2. Absent jurisdictional authorization, EIA argues that section 1010 is outside the scope of the CARPs. Furthermore, EIA notes that CARP procedures are inconsistent with section 1010 arbitration; a petition initiates CARP rate adjustments whereas agreement of the parties is necessary to initiate section 1010 arbitration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 3 (citing section 1010(a) and (b)). Section 1010 arbitration is also governed ``by such procedures as [the Arbitration Panel] may adopt,'' as opposed to CARP procedures adopted by the Librarian of Congress.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (citing section 1010(d)). Finally, argues EIA, section 1010 arbitration relates solely to whether given devices are subject to chapter 10 requirements and are therefore unrelated to the purpose or expertise of the CARPs to make royalty rate adjustments and distributions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> 3&hyph;4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to its comments regarding section 1010 arbitration, EIA believes that the issue of costs regarding both section 1010 and section 1004(a)(3) proceedings is not properly before the Copyright Office since neither is a CARP proceeding.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Copyright Office reaffirms the conclusion announced in the Interim Regulations that proceedings under sections 1004(a)(3) and 1010 are not within the jurisdiction of the CARPs. 59 FR 23967 (1994). Proceedings to adjust the royalty maximum under section 1004(a)(3) shall therefore be handled solely by the Librarian, and proceedings under section 1010 shall not be subject to the rules and regulations governing the CARPs. It may be that an arbitration panel convened under section 1010 chooses to use some or all of the rules applicable to CARP proceedings; that choice, however, is up to the arbitration panel.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  17 U.S.C. 1010(d) (the arbitration panel is governed by ``such procedures as it may adopt'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the division of costs among the parties participating in a section 1004(a)(3) or section 1010 proceeding, we agree with the EIA that the issue is not ripe for decision since neither of these proceedings is within the scope of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The issue of the costs involved in the entire CARP process was understandably a serious concern of a number of commentators. These concerns included the payment and fees charged by arbitrators, deductions from royalty pools, and billing cycles for arbitrators. The commentators offered some unique solutions to these problems, some of which we are adopting in these Final Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 251.54, 251.65 and 251.74 are the principal regulations governing the costs of CARP proceedings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 251.54 directs the CARP panels in the case of rate adjustment proceedings to establish each participating party's share of the costs of the proceeding. In the case of distribution proceedings, each participating party's cost is in direct proportion to its share of the distribution. Sections 251.65 and 251.74 allow the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office to recover their respective costs for rate adjustment and distribution proceedings. For rate adjustments, the Librarian and Office may deduct their reasonable costs from the relevant royalty pool. If no such pool exists, then the participating parties' costs shall be assessed directly to them. In distribution proceedings, reasonable costs may be deducted directly from the relevant royalty pool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 251.38 governs the accounting and costs that arbitrators are allowed to charge (meals, lodging, etc.). This section, however, relates to the ethical standards of arbitrators and is discussed in the context of subpart D of these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

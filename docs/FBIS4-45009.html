			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview With al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, Leader of Sudan's </F> al-Ummah Party, by Muhammad Sa'id Muhammad al-Hasan, in  Khartoum; date not given]    [Excerpts] Khartoum--[Passage omitted]  <H5>  What About the Interrogation? </H5>   [Al-Hasan] When the guests departed, we asked when and why  Sadiq al-Mahdi was summoned [by the security agency]?    [Al-Mahdi] Three weeks after the holiday sermon in the third  week of last Shawwal (March), an officer came to me and said  that they wanted me at the Security Agency premises in Khartoum  at 1100 on Tuesday, 29 March.    I went there and stayed with them from 1100 until 0700 the  next morning. Four different security teams interrogated me. The  conversation focused on articles written, statements made,  interviews published, and the holiday sermon.    They had no specific purpose, no charge and no particular  thing to which to refer. I concluded that they wanted to express  their resentment. I was released the next morning, and I went  home. But I was summoned again, unexpectedly.    (Al-Mahdi added:) The second time, I was summoned to the  Security Agency premises on a Thursday morning in the same month  and at the same time, and I stayed there until 1900. I was  interrogated by two teams. Finally, two teams of security  officers said to me: We think that you have committed violations  in your activities and we consider these violations detrimental  to security. Because there are security violations, we are  interrogating you.    I told them that I concluded from the nature of the  questions  that "your purpose is to exhaust and offend me. But if there are  violations; if you plan to take steps and deal with us as a  security figure, whereas we are in fact a political figure to  you; and as long as there is no basis for legitimacy in the  country, we will continue to demand this basis, namely the  restoration of legitimacy. As long as you fail to respond and as  long as legitimacy is imposed unilaterally, there will continue  to be a conflict between us and you. The answer is to seek an  acceptable solution for legitimacy so the conflict will be  governed by this legitimacy. In the absence of legitimacy, the  basis of legitimacy will continue to be envisioned subjectively  and from a partisan perspective. We will continue to demand  legitimacy, regardless of what steps will be taken. We must be  dealt with as a political figure, not a security figure."  <H5>  Strange Incidents </H5>   [Al-Hasan] What about the recent political conditions?    [Al-Mahdi] The most outstanding manifestation in the recent  period is the emergence of some sort of solidarity among all  Islamic forces in Sudan, which have defined their position  toward the regime. This reflects a new and clear phenomenon. The  second point is the emergence of an almost united position among  the southern political forces on the demand for  self-determination. This, too, is a new phenomenon.    It is my opinion that there is a recurrence of interestingly  strange incidents in Sudan, such as fires in banks, including  the Khartoum Bank and the Bank of Sudan. There has also been an  armed attack on a mosque in Omdurman and there have been armed  robberies in the capital in broad daylight.    These phenomena or strange incidents recur every two or  three  weeks, and with increasing severity. They are truly strange  phenomena, and they all fall within the context of violation of  the laws and of public order.  <H5>  Splits Within the Regime </H5>   (Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi added:) There are evident splits within  the regime, and they are documented and discussed. It hasn't  been customary, not even within the bounds of democracy, for  conflicts and mutual accusations to reach this degree. For  example, Ibrahim Idam, a former Revolution Command Council  member and the minister of communication, condemns the  privatization of telecommunications and makes the charge that  this would be a betrayal of trust and a waste of public money.    Professor Ma'mun Hamidah, a former president of Khartoum  University, condemns the higher education phenomenon explicitly;  calls the new universities "slogans;" and accuses the regime of  abandoning the resolutions adopted by the higher education  conference and of deviating fundamentally from the educational  policies.    'Abd-al-Rahim Hamdi, a former finance minister, has issued a  statement denouncing the new fiscal policies and saying that  they are in conflict with the three-year program. He has also  said that he resigned because of deviation from the three-year  program policies.  <H5>  AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI </H5>   Then there is AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI, a paper that has come to  crown this domestic situation with an endeavor to provide a  critical podium. It is true that some people believe that this  idea has been concocted by the regime and that it is a maneuver  on the regime's part. I personally don't believe so. Mahjub  'Urwah is from the Front (meaning the National Islamic Front).  But he has a different opinion. 'Urwah believes that the Front  has burned its bridges with the political forces and that these  bridges must be rebuilt. The proof of this is that he invited me  two years ago to talk to me about an issue that could be  discussed by Sudan's intellectual political forces under the  title of a "vision of the future under the canopy of the new  world order."    Shaykh Rached Ghannouchi, [Tunisia's] al-Nahdah Movement  chairman, then visited me in my house, accompanied by a young  al-Nahdah member called Omar Hamed. We embarked on a dialogue  about the tendencies of the current regime in Sudan. It was my  opinion that this regime is a foe of Islam. Shaykh Ghannouchi's  opinion was that, regardless of its faults, the regime is  correctable. At that meeting, Hamed mentioned that there was in  the Islamic Front a tendency stressing that the Front had to  overcome its isolation by establishing bridges with the other  political forces. He cited Mahjub 'Urwah as an example.    In my opinion, all this shows that Mahjub 'Urwah has been  trying to establish some sort of dialogue with the opposing  opinion. It has been evident to me that he has been trying to  establish an independent newspaper, believing that this would  serve the interest of the Sudanese regime and that it would  improve this regime's image in the eyes of the world. It has  been 'Urwah's opinion that this should be done by establishing a  degree of freedom of the press. Therefore, the policies  expressed by AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI have been totally logical.    (Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi added:) This is why I don't see that the  paper is biased. It believes that others have erred and it wants  to help, or help them. It is sufficient to say that in two  months, AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI has, want it or not, been able to do  the following:    1. Document the corruption existing at present, and from  inside sources.    2. Form a public opinion that wants an opposing opinion.    3. It has, in contrast, exposed the failure of the official  media in a way that has annoyed this media greatly. It is my  opinion that the steps taken against 'Urwah actually reflect the  regime's resentment of these facts.    Al-Mahdi went on to add in his interview with AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT: It has become impossible to lie about the extremely  evident phenomenon of economic failure. Prices of food supplies  have gone out of control, and so has the dollar price. The  negative impact of the taxes and of the harsh means employed to  collect them has surfaced. People have turned in their licenses  so they will not be pursued by taxes.    This phenomenon of turning in licenses reflects economic  deterioration. But on the other hand, it has made people who are  actively engaged in illicit economic activity proceed to embark  on all kinds of illegal commercial enterprises. Smuggling has  increased. The regime has focused on violations connected with  its security. But it has been surprised to find itself  unprepared for the violations that come from these parties.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC urged to set up food subsidy anti-fraud unit THE EUROPEAN Community should set up a new anti-fraud unit to keep tabs on EC subsidies to international food exporters, according to a report from the Court of Auditors, which has uncovered widespread fraud at two large European companies. The court has been monitoring the dairy product companies - which are not named in its report - over the last two years as part of a wider inquiry into the system of export 'refunds'. The two companies accounted for 10 per cent of all EC refunds on milk product exports during the period. Such refunds are paid to traders to bridge the gap between high guaranteed European prices and the generally lower world market prices. An in-depth audit of the two companies revealed that they had made false claims worth millions of Ecus. Among other methods, they reclassified dairy exports so that they were eligible for higher refunds. They also claimed refunds on exports which turned out to be unfit for human consumption and one of the companies added about Ecu40,000 Pounds 28,000) to its claim by weighing the plastic wrapping as well as the cheese. In response to the report, the European Commission claimed that a number of measures had been adopted to tighten up on such fraud since the court inquiry began. But Mr Jo Carey, the court's British representative, said yesterday: 'We don't think any individual national body could do the sort of work that we have been doing on an experimental basis'. The Court now wants to use similar methods to look at export refunds paid to beef and cereals companies. Together with milk products, the three sectors accounted for more than 70 per cent of Ecu7.72bn of export refunds paid in 1990.</p>

The  senior officials, speaking shortly after President Bill Clinton  and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa expressed regrets  about the collapse of the talks, said Washington may act against  Tokyo by July.    Meanwhile, Japan's Vice Trade Minister for International  Affairs Sozaburo Okamatsu said at a news briefing that if the  U.S. takes unilateral punitive steps, Japan will bring the case  to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). "We're  reviewing all our options and will proceed promptly," a senior  U.S. official said.    U.S. officials emphasized that the U.S. will act before the  Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries convenes its annual  summit meeting in Naples in early July.    The officials, briefing reporters on the Hosokawa-Clinton  summit, declined to disclose the specific actions under  consideration but said they range from unilateral to  multilateral moves.    While refusing to comment on whether U.S. trade sanctions  are  included in the U.S. options, a senior U.S. administration  official said the threat of trade sanctions has been effective  in opening foreign markets. He cited examples such as the  threat to impose trade sanctions that U.S. officials said  resulted in the opening of the Japanese construction market to  foreign firms.    The U.S. officials also said Washington will "reassess the  viability" of the whole framework trade accord if Japan does not  accept the types of "objective criteria" the U.S. has proposed  to measure the progress of imports in Japan.    Clinton told reporters after the summit meeting with  Hosokawa  that indicators the United States has proposed for measuring  that the Japanese market is receptive to foreign goods include  the level of imports, the state of domestic demand in Japan,  exchange rate movements and efforts of U.S. firms to compete in  the Japanese market.    Japan has rejected the U.S. call for adoption of "objective  criteria" as unacceptable, saying they amount to setting import  targets and managed trade.    U.S. administration officials said Washington will not  reopen  the framework negotiations unless Tokyo changes its position.  The U.S. is not prepared to continue the negotiations "under  the present circumstances," one senior U.S. official said.</p>

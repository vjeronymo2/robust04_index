			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEAVER, OUT OF BASEBALL SINCE '86, RETURNS AS COMMENTATOR FOR NBC  </P> <P> Tom Seaver is back in the rotation. It won't be on the mound, though. It'll be  in the TV booth.  </P> <P> NBC, the lame duck network of baseball's Game of the Week, announced Monday  that Seaver will be its top color commentator this year, joining play-by-play  man Vin Scully. Seaver replaces Joe Garagiola, who quit after last season.  </P> <P> "I used to practice on the days I didn't pitch," Seaver said of his  broadcasting. "Some days I wished that I did do it on the days I was pitching,  too."  </P> <P> Seaver has been out of baseball since the end of the 1986 season. He became a  free agent and no one wanted him. Then, in the summer of 1987 he tried a  comeback with the New York Mets but decided he didn't have enough left in his  right arm.  </P> <P> NBC's final season begins on March 25 with a Dodger exhibition game against the  Boston Red Sox. Seaver opens the regular season in Atlanta, where the Braves  play host to the Dodgers on April 8.  </P> <P> After this season, the Game of the Week is no more. CBS, which takes over  baseball in 1990, will show only 12 games during the season.  </P></p>

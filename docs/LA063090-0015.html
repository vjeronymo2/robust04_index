			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSTAGNO DOESN'T SEE WHAT HITS HIM IN 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 DEFEAT TO IVANISEVIC  </P> <P> Why did Derrick Rostagno lose his third-round match at Wimbledon?  </P> <P> "You can't hit what you can't see," Rostagno said.  </P> <P> Rostagno, who eliminated John McEnroe in the first round, was overrun by Goran  Ivanisevic, 18, of Yugoslavia, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4.  </P> <P> Ivanisevic served 17 aces.  </P> <P> "I've never played someone who's played that well," Rostagno said.  </P> <P> Rostagno, 24, of Brentwood, was unable to break Ivanisevic's serve, but thought  he played well.  </P> <P> "I gave it all I had, so I can't get angry," said Rostagno, who has a sore  throat.  </P> <P> He said he isn't unnerved by losing, and plans to see the play, "Phantom of the  Opera" before he leaves town.  </P> <P> "Things can go wrong, things can go right," Rostagno said. "How serious can you  take everything? This is a game. It's a great game, to be sure, but you can't  forget what it is." THOMAS BONK  </P></p>

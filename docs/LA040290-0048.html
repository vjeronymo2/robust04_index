			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SURVIVE BREAKS AQUEDUCT MARK  </P> <P> R. Dee Hubbard's Southland-based Survive ran a mile in stakes record time,  carrying Jose Santos to a three-length victory Sunday in the $114,400 Bed o'  Roses Handicap at Aqueduct.  </P> <P> Carrying 117 pounds in the race for fillies and mares 3 years old and older,  Survive ended Amy Be Good's five-race winning streak. Amy Be Good was second in  the six-horse field, 4 1/2 lengths ahead of Warfie.  </P> <P> Survive's time of 1:34 1/5 bettered by four-fifths of a second the record set  by Too Bald in 1968.  </P> <P> The victory was the first in four starts this year for favored Survive, who  earned $68,640 and returned $5.20, $3.60 and $2.40. Amy Be Good paid $3.40 and  $2.60 and Warfie was $4.20.  </P> <P> Train Robbery, ridden by Pat Day, went past Mercedes Miss in the deep stretch  to score a neck victory over Silvered in a three-horse photo in the $75,000  Honeybee Stakes at Oaklawn Park.  </P> <P> The pre-race favorite, unbeaten Classy Irene, was scratched early in the day  because of a bruise above the hoof on his right hind leg. That scratch enabled  the connections of Train Robbery to hire Day, the leading rider at Oaklawn.  Classy Irene had won six consecutive races.  </P> <P> Owned by the Overbrook Farm and trained by Wayne Lukas, Train Robbery paid  $4.80 and $4.80. Silvered returned $8.20. There was no show wagering in the  four-horse field.  </P> <P> Train Robbery, fresh from a victory in the Remington Oaks, was the second  choice in the wagering. Timber Ribbon, the favorite, wound up fourth.  </P> <P> Train Robbery completed the 1 1/16 mile race in 1:45 3/5. The Honeybee is a  major prep for the $250,000 Fantasy Stakes at Oaklawn on April 20.  </P> <P> Train Robbery won despite carrying top weight of 122 pounds, 10 pounds more  than each of her three opponents.  </P> <P> Train Robbery earned $45,000 to push her career earnings past $120,000. She has  four firsts and two seconds in nine starts.  </P> <P> Tower Above 'Em rallied in the stretch to beat 11 older horses in the $100,000  Week of Fame Gold Cup at the Fair Grounds.  </P> <P> It was the third time in his last four races that Tower Above 'Em used a late  stretch drive to win. He was seventh at the turn for home and beat Allijeba by  1 3/4 lengths. The 6-year-old Irish Tower gelding returned $23.40, $9.40 and  $5.60.  </P> <P> Libor came from far back to upset Dawn Quixote, the odds-on favorite, in the  $50,000 Golden Beach Handicap for 3-year-olds on the grass at Gulfstream Park.  </P> <P> Libor won the 1 1/16-mile race by half a length as Dawn Quixote edged Duke's  Cup by a nose for second. Libor paid $18, $4.60 and $2.40.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Four Iraqi citizens who over a month ago  infiltrated from Jordan to Israel and asked for political  asylum, were sent off by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers  into Lebanese territory this afternoon. UNIFIL [UN Interim  Force in Lebanon] Spokesman Timor Goksel told our correspondent  in the north Yo'av Aviv that the IDF soldiers brought the four  Iraqis, whose hands were tied, up to the border, untied them,  and the four marched northward to a UNIFIL post. They have been  held in prison since they crossed the border into Israel, and  have now been handed over to Lebanon.</p>

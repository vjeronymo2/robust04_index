			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Arena sale helps Molson improve after earlier slip Molson, the diversified Canadian brewer, lifted quarterly profits by a third but the advance was due to a one-time gain from the sale of a Toronto ice-hockey arena. Earnings before the gain slipped by 12 per cent due to fierce competition in the Canadian discounted beer market; higher expenses at Diversey, Molson's international cleaning-services unit; and a flat performance by the retail hardware outlets. Net earnings rose to CDollars 49.2m (USDollars 35.6m), or 84 cents a share, in the three months to end-June - Molson's first quarter of fiscal 1994-95 - from CDollars 36.8m, or 62 cents, a year earlier. The special tax-free gain amounted to CDollars 16.9m, or 29 cents a share. Sales fell by 2.3 per cent to CDollars 754.5m. Molson Breweries, a joint venture between Molson, Foster's Brewing of Australia and US-based Miller brewing, in-creased its share of the Canadian market fractionally to 48.5 per cent. Total second-quarter beer sales in Canada improved by 0.6 per cent to 5.5m hectolitres. Sales volume in the US jumped by 90.6 per cent to 0.7m hectolitres. This sharp increase was due to the launch of Molson Ice a year ago and a one-time inventory adjustment. Although Diversey's sales rose by 12.4 per cent, operating profit dipped by almost 16 per cent. The decline was due mainly to efforts to reverse recent difficulties in its US subsidiary, which suffered a CDollars 3.5m loss. Mr Marshall Cohen, chief executive, said Diversey's profit growth will continue to lag sales. 'We expect, in future quarters of fiscal 1995, to continue to nourish sales and to be patient with profits,' he said. Molson recently folded its Canadian warehouse hardware chain into a joint venture with Home Depot, the large US do-it-yourself retailer. Home Depot Canada, 25 per cent-owned by Molson, posted strong growth in the latest quarter, with sales of CDollars 163.5m.</p>

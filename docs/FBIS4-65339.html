			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Claes Appeals For Peace Force in </F> Neighboring Countries"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In an interview given to BRTN  [Dutch-language Belgian Radio and Television], Foreign Minister  Willy Claes called for creating an African force to protect the  hundreds of thousands of refugees in the areas bordering Burundi  and Tanzania. He observes that the United Nations has not  succeeded in resolving the conflict, and that Belgium and France  are not regarded as neutral. According to Claes, the United  States is in the best position to bring about a cease-fire.  "Hence my idea of asking the United States to play a more  active role. I am going to talk with George Moose, U.S. deputy  secretary for African Affairs, and set the priority of achieving  a truce," Claes said.    "The United Nations must not be depicted as an institution  that can work miracles," Claes added. He also said Belgium may  have been naive where Rwanda was concerned. "However, I prefer  to be counted among the naive than among the murderers who keep  on selling increasingly modern weapons," Claes concluded.    The main countries supplying arms to Rwanda are Uganda,  South  Africa, Egypt, and France.</p>

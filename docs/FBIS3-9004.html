			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with new Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner by </F> Ivan Samel at Bratislava Castle following the swearing-in of the  new government on 16 March --recorded]    [Excerpts] [Samel] Minister, what changes do you plan to  take in your ministry?    [Pittner] First of all, we are going to create conditions,  be  they personnel or organizational, to ensure calm in the streets,  to ensure calm in society as far as crime is concerned, as well  as in relation to certain manifestations of hatred that can be  expected at times of political change. My view therefore is  that our task, rather than reorganizing the ministry, will be to  take measures so that the citizens have the chance to prepare  themselves in a free and democratic atmosphere for early  elections and vote in accordance with their conscience.    [Samel] Does it mean that you are not planning any changes  in  the system, for example, in relations among the police, the  Interior Ministry, and other relevant bodies?    [Pittner] It is quite possible that some changes will have  to  be made in the Police Presidium, since, in my view -- which,  however, is not very well-informed at the moment; I will need to  have the situation analyzed -- it has become bloated and has  perhaps become, I am exaggerating now, a second ministry.  [passage omitted] My aim will be to slim down the Police  Presidium and ensure that it is effective and performs tasks  necessary for the benefit of the citizen.    [Samel] What steps do you intend to take in connection with  the investigation of the events of 14 March, when four  journalists were assaulted in Primate Square?    [Pittner] It is a very serious matter. Alas, it was very  irresponsible of the previous government to turn down the  president's request that it remain in office until the new  government was appointed; this meant that the police lost their  top leadership, which must have influenced the way they acted.  On the other hand, it does not exonerate those policemen who  did not fulfill their duties. If it is proven that the  accusations were true, or that they refused to help others  because of political reasons or inclinations to different  political views, the most strict legal measures will be taken in  accordance with the law on the police corps.

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Brazil tries to wipe out deficit Brazil yesterday unveiled its toughest planned budget cuts in recent memory as finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso pledged once again to tackle the country's annual inflation rate of close to 2,000 per cent. Mr Cardoso outlined spending cuts and revenue measures to wipe out a projected Dollars 22.2bn deficit and balance next year's budget. The main savings will come from the government's personnel budget, which Mr Cardoso hoped to cut by Dollars 3.74bn, and from the transfer to local government of spending on health and basic education. This will save the federal government up to Dollars 8.4bn. 'There has probably never been a government attempt like this in this country to erase a budget deficit,' Mr Cardoso said. Brazil's budget deficit has in the past been covered by the government's inflationary practice of issuing short-term securities. Mr Cardoso said this would no longer happen. The budget, which will be formally presented to President Itamar Franco and Congress next week, is expected to be the first of several measures to be announced over the coming months designed to try to stabilise the country's economy. There is speculation Mr Cardoso will next week announce a new price index. This would be seen as the first step towards linking wage and price increases to the exchange rate which it is hoped would bring inflation down next year. The budget won cautious backing from the government's coalition partners. But analysts pointed out that some of the spending cuts would be unpopular and difficult to implement, especially with presidential and congressional elections next year. For example, one of Mr Cardoso's proposals would give the central government greater influence over money which otherwise goes straight to states and municipalities which may block the proposal, which needs a constitutional amendment to become law. Mr Cardoso will also rely on congressional approval for a planned increase of 5 per centage points in all income taxes to give a new top rate of 35 per cent. The budget is partly designed to please the International Monetary Fund which is holding off approving a restructuring of Brazil's commercial foreign debt until the country can demonstrate it is tackling its economic problems. A balanced budget is thought to be one of several key requirements the IMF wants before it will approve the restructuring deal. Even though the IMF has yet to approve the deal, Mr Cardoso is due to start signing the restructuring agreement with Brazil's private bank creditors on Monday in Toronto. He is expected to announce the next steps in his economic programme when he returns to Brazil next week. Other measures to be announced included a 3 per cent tax on overseas fund raising, such as bond issues. This was designed to stop speculative foreign investment flows. Also, a recent surge in foreign investment had inflationary effects because Brazil's central bank is still obliged to buy all foreign currency coming into the country, and issue local currency as payment.</p>

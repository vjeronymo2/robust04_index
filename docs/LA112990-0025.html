			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: SAWTELLE RUSTIC: ISHI OR ISN'T HE?  </P> <P> For a while in the early '80s, I and most of my friends did a great deal of our  serious eating at the tiny Japanese-French restaurant called Ishi's Grill,  which was in that odd tangle of streets popularly known as the Bermuda  Triangle, a couple miles west of Downtown. At first, Ishi's was that hungry  man's dream, a lunch counter that served haute French cuisine at close to  coffeeshop prices. The artist community adopted the restaurant. Later Ishi's  became more of a regular restaurant, if an odd one -- it looked like the kind  of place the Jetsons might visit on a romantic evening out -- and it remained  the eccentrics' favorite Japanese-French place in town.  </P> <P> Ishi's was the restaurant where a lot of people learned how to use sesame oil  in a vinaigrette, how to arrange a salad to look like a Zen garden, and just  how good slightly undercooked chicken could taste sparked with a bit of ginger.  I remember the shock of spooning up a bit of what I thought was split-pea soup  and tasting the clean, strong bite of fresh peas, overlaid with the briny scent  of mussels. I suppose Ishi's was my standard spot for a second date: someplace  romantic.  </P> <P> When Ishi's closed four or five years ago, a lot of us tried hard to discover  where its gifted chef, Masayuki Ishikawa, had moved his pots and pans. There  were rumors of a big restaurant in the Valley, undone by brutal city building  inspectors before it had a chance to open, and I think Ishikawa was supposed to  develop the trans-Pacific menu at Noa Noa before that Beverly Hills restaurant  hired Orange County hotel chefs instead. While he was away, styles in L.A.  cooking changed, and where small mounds of food on great big plates had been  hip, rustic cooking became the norm, and places that had previously served a  lot of scallops in buerre blanc started serving a lot of scallops in tomato  sauce instead.  </P> <P> Which bring us to Sawtelle Kitchen, Ishikawa's new restaurant.  </P> <P> A smallish place up the street from the strip malls and office buildings of the  Sawtelle-Olympic corridor, Sawtelle Kitchen is tastefully rustic right down to  the patinaed walls and the weathered hutches that hold the bowls for cafe au  lait. The tables are covered with sheets of copper and little fiaschi hold  homemade chile-flavored olive oil. The restaurant is identified from the street  only by a tiny sign painted on the window in discreet Art Nouveau lettering.  Recorded torch songs play softly. Customers are allowed to bring their own wine  -- like Ishi's, the restaurant has no alcohol license -- and on a typical  Wednesday night many of California's better Chardonnay vineyards are  represented, along with trendy red varieties from the Rhone. There is no more  charming restaurant in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But where Ishikawa's cuisine worked beautifully at Ishi's -- Japanese cooking  and nouvelle cuisine have, after all, lightness, rigor, and the importance of  presentation in common -- his take on rustic cooking is a bit weird. The world  may not be ready for Japanese-Provencal-Italian cuisine.  </P> <P> The salads are pretty much the old Ishi toss of greens, though the dressings  are spiked now with exotic rustic things like lavender and balsamic vinegar.  He's solved the pizza problem by using flour tortillas instead of crust, two of  them glued together with a layer of melted cheese, and topped with delicious  things such as proscuitto and mushrooms, duck sausage, or a modified puttanesca  made with anchovies, capers and sliced hard-boiled eggs. They're pretty good in  spite of themselves, much better than they were when the restaurant opened last  spring; crisp and light and easy to eat.  </P> <P> Many entrees are a different matter. Where at most new-rustic places you might  expect something called bistecca to at least resemble the terrific grilled  T-bones that go by that name in Florence and Siena, Ishikawa's version is a  tough, thin rib-eye steak served a la pizzaiola, in an acrid, over-reduced  tomato sauce dotted here and there with lumps of melted fontina cheese. A  beautiful, crisp-skinned roast chicken was drowned in a salty brown sauce that  obscured the flavor of the meat. A special of veal stew -- topped with a  rock-hard crown of puff-pastry -- was overcooked and unpleasantly gamy,  redeemed only by a few soft rounds of sweetly spiced veal sausage.  </P> <P> Sawtelle Kitchen seems to do best where it is closest to refined French  cooking. Broiled Norwegian salmon, while nondescript, is served on a bed of al  dente pasta sauced with a textbook-perfect buerre blanc; sauteed sea bass,  served with sort of a Tuscan-style ratatouille, is sweet and nicely  undercooked. Soups have been wonderful, especially an intense carrot puree  flavored with fresh clams.  </P> <P> And though you should at all costs avoid the clammy sweet-potato tart, Ishi's  most famous dessert, coffee Jell-O topped with rich cappuccino ice cream, is as  good as ever. I'm not sure how it is on a second date, though . . . maybe a  third date: something exotic.  </P> <P>  Sawtelle Kitchen, 2024 Sawtelle Blvd., West Los Angeles, (213) 445-9288.

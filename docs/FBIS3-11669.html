Upon arrival at Tijuana General Hospital, where Luis Donaldo  Colosio died of two gunshot wounds, Attorney General Diego  Valadez said he has been specifically instructed by President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari to direct the investigation. The  president of the Republic appointed (Santiago Unate Laborde),  one of Luis Donaldo Colosio's close collaborators, to be special  prosecutor in charge of investigating the attack.    Diego Valadez reported that officials from the Attorney  General's Office [PGR] will participate in the investigations in  order to clarify the events that took place at 1708 Tijuana  time, which is 1908 Mexico City time [0108 GMT].    The PGR official confirmed that two people have been  arrested. He pointed out that his office will release  information to the public as the investigation proceeds.    At approximately 2230 Tijuana time, which is 0030 Mexico  City  time [0630 GMT], the PGR issued a communique in Tijuana, in  which it confirmed that the person who shot and killed Luis  Donaldo Colosio has confessed that he fired four times on Luis  Donaldo Colosio. Only two shots, fired from a .38 special  revolver, hit Luis Donaldo Colosio, one in the abdomen and the  other behind the right ear.    Prior to entering the area where Colosio Murrieta's remains  were being held, the attorney general of the republic insisted  that justice and the law will prevail in Mexico and that firm  action will be taken to clear up absolutely everything.</p>

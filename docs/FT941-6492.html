			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Reuters, CME and Matif close to deal on Globex Reuters, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the French futures exchange, Matif, are on the verge of an agreement that could prolong the life of Globex, the computerised international futures dealing system. The agreement, as negotiated in New York last week, would effectively deal the Chicago Board of Trade out of the system. Reuters has been seeking revisions to the existing Globex governance agreement for more than a year, and has become frustrated at the CBoT's failure to support Globex's expansion. The CBoT and the CME have joint responsibility for running Globex, which represents a Dollars 100m investment by Reuters. The CBoT could give notice it is quitting the system as early as March 22. In the CBoT's absence, the CME, allied with the Matif, is trying to construct an open-ened governance model that would attract other exchanges, like London's Liffe, to Globex.</p>

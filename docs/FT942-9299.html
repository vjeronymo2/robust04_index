			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / DTI may extend copyright to TV programme formats The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday said it was considering whether copyright protection should be extended to programme formats. A programme format is seen as comprising the 'common unifying features' of a game show or situation comedy. In 1989 the Privy Council decided that the unifying features of the talent show Opportunity Knocks, which had been copied by the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation, did not constitute a work protected by copyright law. Ministers are now considering whether further protection is needed especially as the government has been trying to find ways to encourage Britain's broadcasters to export more programmes. The DTI has issued a consultation paper and is seeking comment by June 24. 'For example, concern has been expressed that protecting formats could result in simple programming ideas being monopolised with consequent restrictions on programming freedom,' the department said. At present broadcasters often either pay for or acknowledge another's format, but only on an informal basis. CBS, the US network, was angered last year when the BBC launched its 999 series featuring stories of survival in dangerous circumstances. CBS believed it had much in common with its programme Rescue 911.</p>

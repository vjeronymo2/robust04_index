			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: HK exchange alters secondary listing rule THE Stock Exchange of Hong Kong has approved changes to its secondary listing regulations, enabling the Jardine Matheson group to proceed with proposals to take up a primary listing in London while retaining a secondary listing in Hong Kong. Under the new secondary listing rules, Hong Kong companies will be permitted to be regulated by a recognised stock exchange, while retaining listing status in Hong Kong. So far, only London has been recognised. Mr Nigel Rich, Jardine Matheson managing director, welcomed the changes. The proposals will be put before Jardine shareholders at the company's annual general meeting next month and could be implemented three months later. Dairy Farm, Hongkong Land, Jardine Strategic and Mandarin Oriental, members of the group, will follow suit. The move is conditional on the signing of a written agreement between the London and Hong Kong exchanges governing their respective roles. However, the regulations are broadly similar and an understanding has been reached. The new rules require companies to have 'an adequate nexus' with the primary market; this is broadly defined by having more than 10 per cent of its worldwide share turnover in the proposed primary market during the year prior to application for secondary listing. Following the rule change in Hong Kong, companies will be able to withdraw their secondary listings after a 90-day notice period, assuming 20 per cent of worldwide trading volume took place in the primary market during the previous year. If less, the notice period is extended to 180 days.</p>

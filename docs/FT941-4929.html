			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Management: Twelve steps to a successful speech - Talking about the audience you are talking to is the key to public speaking Who are these people?' If you are preparing to make a speech, and the audience is already shaking your confidence, start with that question. It is the key to public-speaking success. Whether they are strangers or co-workers, they have one thing in common: they expect you to dazzle them for the next 15 or 20 minutes. And the best way is to focus on their favourite subject - themselves. Talk about the people you are talking to. Begin by defining who these people are and what they want. To help, here are 12 questions: Are these people friends, co-workers, customers or strangers? Define their characteristics and self-interests - the work they do, their education level, the everyday language they use, and especially the problems and opportunities that concern them. Why are they here? What do they expect to get out of your speech? What do they want of you? They expect to benefit somehow. Write these expectations down. Why were you invited to make this speech? There must be something special about your background that is of interest to the audience. What exactly have you got to offer? You must understand your qualifications so you can deliver the speech they expect to hear. Audiences are easily disappointed when a speaker steps out of character and ignores the reason he was chosen. What problems do these people have? One of the best ways to win approval from your audience is to recognise their problems and help solve them. Your knowledge of their problems is probably the reason you were invited to speak. They expect fresh insights, a different point of view, and ideas that may help them. They do not want platitudes and generalities. One or two specific ideas that stir their minds will send them away feeling their time has been well spent. What opportunities do they have and how can you help realise them? This and problem-solving are the two best strategies to catch and hold the attention of any audience. Your function is to help them see their opportunities, open their eyes, stimulate their imagination, point the direction, and encourage them to act. They came to this meeting expecting you to freshen and expand their thinking. What is the normal, everyday language of this audience? Once you have settled on the big theme idea, the ultimate virtue is to express it with absolute clarity. If your audience is from a certain industry, what terminology does it understand best? The audience dictates your choice of words. The best way to convey an idea is to use the language the audience knows best, cast in the simplest words you can find. Do these people like humour? Everybody does. But humour is a risky device. What strikes one listener as clever may strike another as inane. The theme of your meeting may be serious, and humour would be out of place. Few speakers are good comic story-tellers, and nothing can be worse than telling an old, inappropriate or pointless story. A light touch here and there, if it does not interrupt the logic of your speech, is welcome, but humour is no substitute for a big, useful idea clearly expressed. How long should the speech be? When you were invited, you were probably given a general time limit. The best rule is to take only as much time as needed to make your presentation with absolute clarity. The only thing worse than being too long and boring is being too short and only partially understood. Should you use visual aids? If they make your central point easier to comprehend, yes. Keep them simple and uncomplicated because the audience has only a moment or two to digest them. Explain every word, line, graph, number, picture; otherwise, if you pass on without doing so, the audience feels it has missed something. What should your manner of speaking be? Speak loudly. Make sure your voice carries distinctly to the farthest listener, so nobody has to strain to hear you. The whole character of your speech - your enthusiasm, conviction, emphasis, sincerity - can be lost if you speak with a tentative, soft voice that makes listening a chore. Nobody ignores a loud voice, and there is no conviction in a voice that mumbles. How should you use your eyes? Make eye contact. Look directly into the eyes of individuals, shifting from one part of the audience to another, from front to back, left to right. This has the compelling effect of keeping listeners' eyes on the speaker, feeling that he is addressing them personally. It also makes you, the speaker, feel you have made personal contact with individuals who are hanging on every word. Should you make an outline? Yes, and consult it as you speak. It forces you to organise your speech in a logical, coherent way, and keeps you from running off the track. These questions are just a start; add others to fit your occasion. Taking a few minutes to understand who these people are, and what they want, is the first step in making a good speech.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The possibility of resuming the Athens-Skopje  dialogue remains open but it does not mean the prerequisites for  such a likelihood exist. This is the verbal message from Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou that European Union [EU]  Commissioner Hans Van den Broek will be conveying to [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, President Kiro] Gligorov.  After his meeting with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias  today, van den Broek will be visiting Skopje again.    In a statement, Papoulias noted that the government says yes  to the dialogue as long as the conditions it has set out are  fulfilled. Papoulias added: Gligorov and Skopje should abandon  their intransigence and Greece will wait until then.    Van den Broek said the disagreements between the two sides  should be raised for discussion at the negotiating table  urgently, stressed that his own efforts are of a temporary  nature, and referred to the good offices of Cyrus Vance at the  United Nations.    Papoulias made it clear that if and when the dialogue  resumes  at the United Nations, the name issue would be excluded from the  package of issues to be discussed. The foreign minister further  noted that the process of handling the name issue will be very  time consuming.    The EU commissioner will have a telephone conversation with  Papoulias tomorrow to brief him on the commissioner's meeting  with Gligorov today.    Asked about the likelihood of a meeting on the foreign  minister level between Athens and Skopje, Papoulias said that  the current facts indicate that this is premature. Asked  whether Greece would give its consent to Skopje's accession to  the CSCE, Papoulias noted that as far as the Greek side is  concerned, nothing has changed, since Skopje's intransigence  continues.</p>

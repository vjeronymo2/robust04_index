			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Credito Italiano targets rival bank Credito Romagnolo, the Bologna-based bank, is today expected to reject a L2,000bn (Pounds 800m) offer for 48.2 per cent of its shares by the recently privatised Credito Italiano. The takeover would create Italy's largest privately owned bank with deposits exceeding L65,000bn. Credito Italiano is now the fifth largest and Credito Romagnolo the 15th. Romagnolo's board will take a formal position today on Credito Italiano's proposal. Romagnolo management, which is controlled by shareholders dominated by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti chairman, has refused to comment formally. Mr Lucio Rondelli, Credito Italiano's chairman, was quoted as saying: 'I don't regard the offer as hostile. Indeed we think we can maximise the synergies with a bank that is complementary to ours.' But a banker familiar with Romagnolo's position said: 'Credito says the offer is friendly, but when the Soviet tanks went into Prague they also said they were friendly.' The offer is for 105.5m shares, valuing them at L19,000 against L13,674 on Wednesday. Credito Romagnolo shares have risen sharply in recent weeks, rising more than 20 per cent since mid-September. Credito Italiano admits to have been one of the buyers and already has 2.5 per cent of Romagnolo shares. Romagnolo's statutes forbid any shareholder from owning more than 10 per cent, in order to preserve a wide ownership base and retain a strong regional identity rooted in the rich farmlands of Emilia Romagna and the area's thousands of dynamic small businesses. Its largest shareholder is France's BNP with 6.8 per cent. The De Benedetti group has just under 5 per cent. Between 1984-88 there was a fierce struggle for control of the bank when a De Benedetti co-ordinated alliance fought off takeover attempts by the Fiat group and the Agnelli family. There are also some 28,000 small shareholders. Since privatisation earlier this year Credito Italiano has come under the effective control of Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank headed by Mr Enrico Cuccia. Lex, Page 20</p>

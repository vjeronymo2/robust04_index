			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Cajoling the Japanese DO NOT fret about our rising current account surplus, Japan's Ministry of Finance has told the world: its recent surge merely reflects 'special' factors which will ultimately go away. But Japan has got its logic upside down: the world economy needs Japan's current account surplus to resume its rising trend; but not in 1992. It is the 'special' slowdown of Japanese domestic demand, thereby cutting import demand, that is most worrying the rest of the growth-starved world. The world will need Japan's current account surplus once economic growth finally picks up. The contraction of the world's savings pool over the past decade, alongside a continually rising demand for investment capital, has forced up world real interest rates. Only Japan has bucked the trend. Its willingness to save more than it invests domestically, thereby exporting the surplus, has prevented real rates from rising further. The corollary of such a capital outflow is a current account surplus. This surplus has provided a convenient totem for protectionists in general and troubled US and European multinationals in particular. But the rest of the world should give three cheers for Japan's prudence. Future income Japan's motives are not purely altruistic. It will have a rapidly ageing population over the next 30 years. So both individuals and the government are investing abroad to provide a future income stream. The government has accumulated a social security fund which now exceeds 50 per cent of Japanese gross domestic product. The Japanese government has gross debts of more than 60 per cent of GDP, but almost all of them are held by the social security fund. Overall, the government should be a net creditor by 1994. Yet last year's rising trade surplus reflects the current slowdown in Japanese domestic demand rather than any structural rise in its savings propensities. National savings have risen while imports have slumped, falling by 14.4 per cent in the year to last November. This Japanese growth recession is one Japanese export that the rest of the world certainly does not need. Moreover, the continuing financial squeeze and lack of confidence among Japan's banks represents a further important source of deflationary pressures worldwide. Austere budget The Japanese government could offset this domestic slowdown by a more active fiscal policy. But the 1992 budget is typically, if needlessly, austere; there is ample room for an expansionary supplementary budget package; and there are many areas in which the government could usefully increase public investment. Yet the main threat to growth is the persistently tight stance of Japanese monetary policy. The Bank of Japan's reluctance to ease policy at more than a cautious pace is understandable. Its governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, has done an exceptional job of repairing the damage done by the loose monetary policy pursued by his predecessor under heavy US pressure. Japan's asset market bubble has been deflated with, so far, the minimum of disruption to the real economy. Yet a renewed bout of asset price inflation is no longer the main threat to Japan's financial stability, as Mr Mieno must well understand. Confidence is low, banks do not want to lend, retail sales are sluggish, overtime working is down, and bankruptcies are rising, especially among heavily-indebted small and medium sized companies. That share prices are still falling, even after the collapse of the last two years, reflects this growing sense of gloom. Little wonder then that monetary growth remains very sluggish. Against this depressing background, the last thing either Japan, or the world, needs is persistently high Japanese interest rates aimed at boosting the value of the yen in a mis-conceived attempt to cut the trade surplus. What Japan does need is an easier monetary policy, as Mr Mieno will be (respectfully) informed at this weekend's meeting of officials from the world's seven largest industrialised countries. He should listen with 'special' attention.</p>

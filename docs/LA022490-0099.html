			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVE DISTEL: TO TURN PRO OR NOT? ANSWER WAS EASY FOR CORONADO'S GAVALDON  </P> <P> Great thinkers and lawmakers, perhaps an incongruous alliance, spend  considerable time contemplating the consequences of athletes turning  professional after their junior years of college competition.  </P> <P> You've heard the fuss surrounding, for example, the deliberations of one Junior  Seau, an aptly named young man from Oceanside who has been employed as a  football player at USC and seeks to improve himself by moving to the more  lucrative NFL.  </P> <P> Seau ultimately resolved that it was time to be paid by check rather than by  room and board, but not before his ponderings had been examined so thoroughly  you would think he had been asked to determine the outcome of the  SDG&amp;E-SoCal Edison merger.  </P> <P> The wisdom that must prevail, of course, is that a person cannot be prohibited  from making a living in a chosen field, regardless of whether or not athletic  eligibility has been exhausted.  </P> <P> This is particularly interesting this week, because another junior from this  neighborhood turned professional without accompanying brouhaha and controversy.  </P> <P> "It wasn't such a big decision," said The Athlete. "I did it because it was  time."  </P> <P> But Angelica "The Athlete" Gavaldon has little in common with the collegiate  behemoths who crave to play for pay in the NFL.  </P> <P> For one thing, Gavaldon did not choose to turn pro after her junior year, but  rather during. What's more, Gavaldon is doing all this while a junior in high  school.  </P> <P> Indeed, Gavaldon, all of 16 and a year removed from winning her second CIF  championship for Our Lady of Peace, made her professional debut this week in  the $150,000 Virginia Slims of Oklahoma. She advanced to the today's semifinals  by defeating Brenda Schultz of the Netherlands, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, Friday.  </P> <P> Anyone who followed her exploits at the Australian Open would not have been  surprised by her decision. She reached the quarterfinals in that tournament,  which is a Grand Slam event and not a parochial exercise lost somewhere in the  outback.  </P> <P> That tournament was, in fact, the turning point in making the decision now  rather than waiting.  </P> <P> "Definitely," she said by telephone from her hotel room. "On the way home on  the airplane, my mom and I were discussing it. We decided I would turn pro  after I was in the top 100."  </P> <P> Why, after all, remain an amateur? To win another CIF championship? To earn a  college scholarship?  </P> <P> When Gavaldon arrived home in Coronado, she learned she was ranked 97th in the  world.  </P> <P> The time had come.  </P> <P> The time had come to get paid for playing well. By her recollection, she would  have pocketed $24,000 for her showing in the Australian Open. As an amateur,  she was limited to expense money.  </P> <P> Considering that she played as an amateur in 10 tournaments in 1989, how much  money might she already have won?  </P> <P> "Around . . . ," she said, hesitating and then laughing. "I don't really know,  and I'll have a fit if I think about it."  </P> <P> Of course, a 16-year-old cannot worry too much about lost time. The future  belongs to her, years and years of it.  </P> <P> Gavaldon's biggest problem, perhaps, is finding time to study. She is taking  literature, American history, art and biology via correspondence courses.  </P> <P> "It's very hard," she said. "It's like going to school, except I don't have  anyone to explain things to me."  </P> <P> She probably could use an economics course, as well, because she is going to  make a lot of money playing this game she started learning eight years ago when  the family lived in Tijuana.  </P> <P> "My mom played for fun, and my dad played, too," she said. "They put me into  tennis lessons, and I started playing some tournaments and winning. Everything  started getting really serious after I started winning."  </P> <P> When the family moved to Coronado, Gavaldon kept right on winning.  </P> <P> But Angelica, has it become too serious?  </P> <P> "It's my career," she said. "It has to be serious. But it's still really fun,  and I'm enjoying it."  </P> <P> But what of those high school days? Football games? Dances? Yearbook pictures?  </P> <P> "You miss out on a lot," she said, "but I think I'm better off doing this. And  I want to be somebody in life."  </P> <P> And so Angelica Gavaldon's prof tennis career is on its way. It's business now,  a serious business, but one in which she can seriously have some fun and also  make some serious money.  </P> <P> That, in short, is the difference between this week and last week.  </P> <P> "I don't really think much about it," Gavaldon said. "Playing tennis is just  about the same as a professional or as an amateur. It wasn't any big decision."  </P> <P> No big decision at all. Not when the time is right.  </P></p>

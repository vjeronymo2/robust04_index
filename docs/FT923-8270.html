			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Wal-Mart Stores announces 21.5 per cent second-quarter profits WAL-MART Stores, the largest US retailer in terms of sales, yesterday unveiled a 21.5 per cent increase in second-quarter profits after tax, to Dollars 420.4m. The advance came on the back of a 26 per cent sales rise, to Dollars 13bn, writes Nikki Tait. The second-quarter results take Wal-Mart's profits for the first six months, to end-July, to Dollars 807.4m, up from Dollars 652.8m a year earlier. Sales increased from Dollars 19.6bn to Dollars 24.7bn. Earnings per share were up from 30 cents to 37 cents in the second quarter, and from 57 cents to 70 cents in the first half. The group's shares rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 57 1/2 on the news. Part of the advance comes from Wal-Mart's highly aggressive expansion programme. In the second quarter alone, the discount retailer opened 20 new Wal-Mart stores and 18 Sam's Clubs - wholesale clubs which sell at rock-bottom prices to a membership customer base. By the end of July, the company was operating 1,755 Wal-Mart stores and 233 Sam's Clubs. It covers 44 states, having recently added Idaho.</p>

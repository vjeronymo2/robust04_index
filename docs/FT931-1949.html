			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bank of Edinburgh calls off merger discussions THE BANK of Edinburgh, which was established in 1990 to take over small and medium-sized building societies, yesterday disclosed that its first attempt to do so by acquiring the Heart of England Building Society had failed. The bank and the society announced that they had agreed not to proceed further with merger discussions. One of the bank's shareholders said talks had foundered on difficulties in gaining regulatory approval from the Bank of England. Mr Russell Frith, Bank of Edinburgh finance director, said the bank still believed that it could acquire other societies. 'There is nothing we have found that is wrong with the basic principle of what we wanted to achieve,' he said. The Heart of England, which is the 25th biggest society with assets of Pounds 1.01bn, said it intended to continue to trade independently although it did not rule out entering merger discussions with large building societies. Mr Mike Travis, chief executive of the Heart of England, said the society, which is due to report full-year results in April, would declare a profit. 'It is business as usual, although we are disappointed that this proposition did not go ahead,' he said. The bank's largest shareholder is Scottish Amicable, which has a 39.2 per cent stake. Mr Graham Knox, deputy managing director of Scottish Amicable, said the negotiations had failed because of strict regulatory requirements. Mr Knox said that the bank had not been able to satisfy a series of requirements for it to retain a banking licence after taking over Heart of England. He said it had learned a number of lessons that would be useful for the future. Mr Knox said that reports that Scottish Amicable wanted to take a majority stake in the bank were incorrect.</p>

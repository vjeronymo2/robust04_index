			<p>BFN     [Text] Medellin -- The product-origin regulations in the  textile and petrochemical sectors are the two points that need  to be negotiated so that Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela can  sign the G-3 [Group of Three] commercial integration agreement  before Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's administration  concludes.    This was reported by Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel  Santos during the inauguration of the "Businessmen and Economic  Opening" seminar, organized by the Colombian Foreign Trade  Institute (Incomex). According to the minister, the  negotiation's technical commission will hold a new meeting  before the end of the week to try to reach a decision on the  points pending on the 400-page agreement.    However, several businessmen, mainly in the textile sector,  fear that political interests are taking precedence over  commercial interests in the signing of the G-3 agreement. "We  are worried that conditions unfavorable to the Colombian  industrial sector might be accepted just so they can sign the  agreement prior to leaving. Mexico is demanding 100-percent  compliance with the product-origin regulations, and this is  impossible," a textile industry businessmen stated.    With the signing of the G-3 and Caricom [Caribbean Common  Market] agreements, which, according to Minister Santos, will  also be negotiated next week, the government will have kept the  entire integration program, which it proposed when the Foreign  Trade Ministry was created.    The signing of approximately 22 bilateral and multilateral  agreements have given the country access to a market of 200  million Latin Americans, not just a market of 34 million  Colombians. In addition to those agreements, the government also  obtained tariff preferences from the United States and a 10-year  agreement extension with the European Union. According to  Minister Santos, "having 60 percent of the international markets  tariff free, Colombia will have favored access to them, but will  have to learn to sell and conquer those markets."  <H5>  False Infrastructure </H5>   To conquer the markets to which Colombia has guaranteed  access through its commercial integration agreements, the  country has to resolve its infrastructure and education  problems. According to Santos, the country has a large  infrastructure shortage and is under the Latin American average  of 3.6 km of highway per citizen. "This means that, on average,  our exports are 5-percent more expensive and that we are  5-percent less competitive due to our shortcomings in terms of  highways, without counting deficiencies in our airports and  other communication systems," Santos added.    During his speech to inaugurate the Incomex seminar, Santos  noted the scarcity of human resources. He highlighted the  Monitor survey results that indicate that 85 percent of  Colombian businessmen have expressed their dissatisfaction with  the quality of human resources.    "The universities are increasingly below international  averages; only 50 percent of our youth get to high school, and  there is a 10-percent illiteracy rate," the minister asserted.  According to the foreign trade minister, the competitive  advantages were previously in natural resources and cheap labor.  However, today, the most important advantages are in  infrastructure and human resources.    Finally, Minister Santos referred to the need to attract  foreign investment to the country since it will bring new  technology, products, and jobs.</p>

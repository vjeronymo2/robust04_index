			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 21 Jun (PL) -- Today, Christine Stewart,  Canada's minister of state for Latin America and Africa, stated  her country's opposition to the policy of isolation of Cuba.  Stewart discussed the development of bilateral ties with the  local government.    At a time the island is trying to resolve its problems amid  serious difficulties, "it needs friends and support so the  changes can be implemented in a positive and peaceful manner,"  the official said in a news conference before returning to her  country.    Stewart explained that Canada has that bilateral  responsibility, adding it will internationally begin a process  of discussions with other countries in the hemisphere to break  every trace of isolation. She recognized, however, "it will be a  slow process that will not change rapidly."    Stewart said that despite the different views on the issue,  her country must maintain an open dialogue in this regard with  the United States, which has maintained a tight blockade against  Cuba since 1962.    "The reality is that Canada is not the only country that has  relations with Cuba," the official indicated, upon recalling  that states from Europe and other parts of the world maintain  ties with the island, which "offers opportunities for the  countries of the world."    Regarding the position of Western hemisphere governments  that  Cuba must return to the OAS, Stewart said Canada will not impose  conditions on that possibility "because we try to be respectful."    Under this purview, Stewart commented on the decision of  Caribbean governments to include Cuba in the Caribbean States  Association, which will be formed soon. Canada will support and  promote this idea, the official stressed.    This reflects the fact that there is a growing understanding  that Cuba's situation in the hemisphere must be revised, she  commented. Stewart even said that Washington is gaining  awareness of this and is reconsidering some points of its  blockade policy, such as trips.    In this regard, the official considered, "we must promote  opening toward Cuba in the United States." Stewart referred to  the position of a growing number of Cubans in the United States  that this country must soften its rather ideological stand  towards Cuba. According to Stewart, other nations in the  hemisphere have adopted this position, and this could have an  impact on U.S. policy.    In light of criticism from the U.S. over Ottawa's decision  to  strengthen its ties with Havana, Stewart underscored that  "despite the differences with the United States, with whom we  held discussions at the OAS annual assembly, the reality is that  I am here in Cuba and we will continue to increase our ties with  the island."    Stewart's visit is the most important by a Canadian official  to Cuba since 1976, when then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau  traveled to Havana.    During a busy work schedule, Stewart met with President  Fidel  Castro, Vice President Carlos Lage, Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina, National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, and the  ministers of finance and prices and foreign investments and  cooperation, Jose Luis Rodriguez and Ernesto Melendez,  respectively.    On Monday evening, Stewart inaugurated, together with Lage,  an international conference on business opportunities on the  island, sponsored by the British magazine, THE ECONOMIST. This  conference is being attended by over 120 business executives  from Canada, the United States, Great Britain, Europe, and Latin  America.    At the conference on Monday evening, Stewart praised the  efforts of the Cuban State to try to preserve social programs  such as education and health, amid an acute economic crisis.  She expressed Canada's willingness to assist the island in  whatever way it could. Stewart took the opportunity to announce  the resumption of official economic aid from Ottawa to Havana,  suspended in 1978, and she stressed her government's willingness  to promote Canadian investment in Cuba.</p>

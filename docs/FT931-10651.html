			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Unions likely to fight pits plan BRITISH Coal's demands for sweeping changes in working practices to save many of the 31 pits threatened with closure look set to antagonise mining unions. The corporation wants flexible working time, involving longer shifts and weekend working. It favours extending the shift system used at the Asfordby pit in Leicestershire. That involves a six-day working week incorporating three seven and a half hour shifts, with crews working 45 hours a week for three weeks followed by one week off. This would end overtime working. At present shifts longer than seven and a quarter hours underground and eight hours on the surface are voluntary. The legal restraint was repealed last year, but has not yet become effective. British Coal also wants a revision of the 1954 Mines and Quarries Act to enable more effective response to technological innovation in mines without lowering safety standards. The corporation hopes to end the joint consultation system in the pits and wants to be able to impose compulsory redundancies. It is also calling for multi-skill training to allow electrical and mechanical engineers and miners to become more versatile. The National Union of Mineworkers is opposed to changes in work organisation. Its delegate conference on Thursday rejected unanimously the corporation's aims.</p>

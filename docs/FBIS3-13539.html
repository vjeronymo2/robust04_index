			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- AL-HAYAH has learned that  the Algerian presidency has received a secret report pointing to  "the involvement of official quarters" in the attack on the  Siryanah [as transliterated] ammunition factory (40 km west of  Tazoult) in Batna wilaya and in the big escape operation from  Tazoult prison in the same wilaya. [passage omitted]    The prison's administration has emphasized to AL-HAYAH that  the number of "freed" prisoners totals 901, in addition to eight  guards, and that 1,400 prisoners are still in the prison. The  cell doors were opened for them, but they refused to leave.  [passage omitted]    Those observing the escape operation level the accusation of  "involvement" at high quarters in power, on the basis of the  following:    1. Mohamed Karash, director of Tazoult prison had over the  previous eight months sent eight reports to the justice  minister, informing him of the intention to attack, the plan,  and the timing. He says he "had not received any response until  the day of the attack."    2. In an official meeting grouping Interior Minister Selim  Saadi; General Abdelhamid Jawadi, commander of the 5th military  zone and who is leading the combing operations in the area, in  addition to other figures, Abdelsaghir Hamrouche, wali of Batna,  raised the issue before participants, so Gen. Jawadi said: "Let  them escape," meaning the Tazoult prisoners.    3. Intervention forces near the area arrived in Tazoult  eight hours after informing them of the incident.    4. The reports sent to the presidency contain indications  that security authorities in neighboring wilayas had knowledge  of the attack.    Well-informed sources say that "in view of this accurate and  reliable information, decisionmakers are astonished at the  negative attitude of those concerned, who failed to take  suitable measures to foil the attack plan."    Some circles in Tazoult attribute the question of "avoiding"  foiling the operation to the following:    1. The site of the operation is President Liamine Zeroual's  city, whose residents are currently subjected to storming and  combing operations by Gen. Jawadi's forces. It is a "clear"  message. Some people say that what had happened is a "coup  attempt," and this rumor has been circulated throughout the  country.    2. The attack was carried out while lists of prisoners to be  released were being prepared, the lifting of the curfew  considered, stages of the dialogue with the Islamic Salavtion  Front planned, and the pensioning of 25 high-ranking officers  talked about. Those opposed to the dialogue with the Islamists  believe that this operation aborts the dialogue and national  reconciliation idea, which President Zeroual and most Algerians  hope would produce a comprehensive change.    The major attack on Tazoult prison coincided with another  attack which is not less important than the first, namely on the  ammunition factory situated some 40 km west of Tazoult  (birthplace of Gen. Khaled Nezzar). The attack continued for  five hours until the intervention of the Air Force, which  settled in the clashes in favor of the factory's guards.    Political sources believe that the escalation between the  two  sides is aimed at thwarting Liamine Zeroual's plan, which -- as  far as he is concerned -- is a question of life or death. The  sources did not rule out that the next days may bring other  surprises and important changes at the top of the military  establishment and the government.</p>

According to the Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, a  stalemate persisted on the Kashmir issue during his talks which  concluded in Islamabad on Monday.    India does not look at the Indo-Pakistan relations through  "one prism" of Kashmir issue, though Pakistan considers Kashmir  as the "core issue." India is committed to continuing peace  process without any preconditions for resolution of all  bilateral disputes between India and Pakistan, since  geographically the two countries will have to live together as  neighbours.    This was the approach which India adopted at the seventh  round of India-Pakistan Foreign Secretary--level talks that  concluded on Monday in Islamabad, according to Mr. Dixit, who  led the Indian delegation to the talks, at a 45-minute press  conference here on Tuesday.    Conceding that there were basic differences on the Kashmir  issue, Mr. Dixit stated that there were issues like Siachen,  stabilisation of situation along the Line of Control, measures  of confidence building problems of nuclear and conventional arms  proliferation, maritime boundary, issues of economic  cooperation, all these issues were to be tackled for mutual  benefit. India offered to prepare a position paper covering all  these issues which would be considered at the next round of the  Foreign Secretary-level meet.    India suggested that the eighth round of the Foreign  Secretary-level meet to take place within a period of four  months. But Pakistan preferred to keep it "open-dated" and dates  to be dependent on "visible Indian response on ground."    The position paper would also be presented to Pakistan also  on the basis of "realities on ground," Mr. Dixit said. Thus this  also has become "open-dated."    The position paper would deal with demarcation of boundary  in  Sir Creek area, deployment in Siachen area.    Mr. Dixit said that India did not and would not give up  "peaceful process" for resolution of all outstanding problems  between the two countries and would continue to pursue that  process.</p>

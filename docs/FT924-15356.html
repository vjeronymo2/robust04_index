			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Spain tells leaders to focus on EC unity at summit SPAIN has called on European Community leaders meeting at next week's Birmingham summit to focus on restoring EC political unity rather than become bogged down in debate over the exchange rate mechanism. In an interview with the Financial Times, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez warned: 'Birmingham will have to give a clear signal that the 12 members, beyond what our individual problems might be, have common interests and are prepared to say so - I was going to say in a friendly way, but even that is not necessary.' Madrid is concerned that political and technical divisions between Germany and Britain, which has the EC presidency until the end of the year, might spill over into the summit. It is also worried that currency speculators might view anything less than a firm renewal of EC political commitment to the economic and political objectives of the Maastricht treaty as a further opportunity to attack the ERM's weaker currencies. The Spanish leader did not believe Britain's presidency of the EC during the currency turmoil had been deficient. 'There has been a lack of co-ordination. . . perhaps a lack of leadership,' he said, 'but we leaders are, all of us, responsible for it. We have made the mistake of renationalising our political attitudes when it is clearer than ever that interdependence has increased.' Spain may raise its official interest rate from 13 per cent this week to match demand for higher yields on the public debt it needs to issue to raise about Dollars 17bn (Pounds 9.5bn) in new deficit financing by the end of the year.

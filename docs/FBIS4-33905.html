			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotations marks recorded] </F>   [Text] Candido Palmero, first secretary of the Communist  Party of Cuba in Havana Province, has sent a message of  congratulations to the members of the Western Army on tomorrow's  observance of the 33d anniversary of its creation.    [Palmero] "They have been a school for training cadres and  communists. We, just as our people do, greatly admire and  appreciate them for their revolutionary attitude and exemplary  commitment to the work of the Revolution in these difficult  times."    Palmero also highlighted the significant support of the  troops in the province's agriculture.    [Palmero] "Approximately 2,000 members -- generals,  officers,  soldiers -- conducted the potato harvest, together with the  Youth Labor Army [EJT]. Over 73 percent of the harvest was  collected with enormous efficiency. Right now, the EJT is 50  percent of the entire labor force in the province. They  successfully complete their tasks with fewer men and more  efficiency and productivity."    Palmero pointed out the influence of the Western Army in the  combat training of the people in the province.    [Palmero] "During these 33 years, this command has done  wonders for the defense of the Revolution. One of the most  historic and difficult struggles has been that many of us, a  great number of the population -- militants, workers, and  farmers -- fulfilled internationalist missions while in the  service of the Western Army. Many comrades of this command gave  their lives in other lands."</p>

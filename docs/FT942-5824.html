			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Net earnings at Anglo American rise 23% Anglo American, South Africa's largest corporation, yesterday reported a 23 per cent increase in net earnings for the year ending in March to R2.98bn (Dollars 543m), up from R2.42bn a year ago. Net income after tax rose 19 per cent to R2.24bn from R1.83bn, while attributable earnings rose to R1.68bn from R1.40bn, a gain of 20 per cent. A final dividend of 300 cents was declared, bringing the total for the year to 395 cents, up from 345 cents last year and above market expectations of around 370 cents. The company's net asset value after the dividend recorded a substantial 55 per cent jump to R54.98bn, reflecting the continued buoyancy of the Johannesburg stock exchange. The results have been modified in accordance with the international moves towards greater accounting comparability and provide for stricter treatment of extraordinary items, but the effect on earnings figures has not been material, resulting in a 3 per cent increase in 1994's net earnings and a 2 per cent decline in 1993's restated figures. Of the group's divisions, mining finance remained the most profitable, accounting for R754m of total net earnings, up from R617m last year, while gold rose to R400m from R277m on the back of the higher gold price. Industry and commerce recorded a 17.7 per cent increase to R529m from R381m, while diamonds rose to R642m from R463m, but platinum and other mining declined slightly to R127m from R155m. Coal's contribution also dipped to R134m from R240m, although this was largely a reflection of the disappearance of last year's R114m tax rebate from the figures. Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said he was confident the earnings improvement would carry through to the current year as a result of the continued improvement in both the South African economy and the international trading environment. He also expressed confidence in the country's new government, praising both its 'welcome commitment to reconciliation' and President Nelson Mandela's 'commitment to prudent economic policies'. However, he refused to be drawn on a time frame for the corporation's planned unbundling of its interests in rival mining house Johannesburg Consolidated Investments and the anticipated sale of some of that company's largest divisions to black shareholders.

The weekly quotes the admiral as  saying that he "continues vigorously to deplore" the cumulative  delay in replacing the two French aircraft carriers, because  this is liable to "insiduously weaken" the capabilities of the  Naval Air Service.    As we know, budget restraints have forced the successive  governments to delay (initially by 30 months and more recently  by an additional six months) the commissioning of the nuclear  aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle--now under construction in  the Brest navy yard--whose total cost is estimated at 17 billion  francs [Fr], of which Fr10 billion has already been  appropriated. The carrier is currently scheduled to be  commissioned no earlier than late 1999, with an initial  detachment of Rafale fighter aircraft on board.    "The Clemenceau was commissioned in 1961 and the Foch in  1963," Admiral Coatanea explained to COLS BLEUS. "The Alize (a  carrier-based maritime reconnaissance and antisubmarine fighter  aircraft) joined the flotilla in 1958. The Crusader (a  carrier-based aircraft designed for air defense) dates back to  1964. Their replacement is therefore urgently necessary, and I  continue vigorously to deplore the successive delays in this  program. These postponements insidiously weaken our capability  for naval air action, the value of which has been demonstrated  by the events of recent years. Moreover, these delays saddle  those responsible for ensuring the availability of such  action--and for carrying it out--with a burden whose increasing  physical and psychological impact is comprehended by very few."    "We appear to be on the right track, however," the admiral  went on to say. "The Charles de Gaulle will be launched next  spring. It is scheduled to go into active service by the end of  the century, equipped with its first Rafale fighter aircraft and  also a reconnaissance aircraft for which provision has been made  in the budget."    Admiral Coatanea made mention of the proposal--submitted to  the government by the Navy--to purchase four Hawkeye  carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft from the U.S. Grumman  company. This radar-guided aircraft is capable of  "illuminating": that is to say, capable of detecting aerial  intrusions (by aircraft or missiles) that might pose a threat to  aircraft carriers at sea. The cost of the project is estimated  at Fr5.8 billion, and the 1994 defense budget has already set  aside Fr1.735 billion.    The Navy chief of staff "strongly" expressed the hope that  "a  second aircraft carrier will go into service several years  later." Together with the Charles de Gaulle, he said, a second  carrier would "constitute a homogeneous and powerful force that  would always be available to support any action taken to  prevent, contain, or otherwise respond to a crisis or conflict."</p>

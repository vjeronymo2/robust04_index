			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Rome police suspect Mafia of blast POLICE in Rome yesterday continued investigations into a car bomb that exploded on Friday night in a wealthy residential area of the capital, injuring 23 people, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The police said members of the Mafia were the most likely instigators. Italy will be marking this week the anniversary of the Mafia killing of Mr Giovane Falcone, the anti-Mafia magistrate, and the authorities have warned that the group is preparing to act against the state. One theory is that the bomb was aimed at Mr Mauricio Constanzio, one of the country's most popular chat show hosts who has been an outspoken opponent of Mafia tactics. His car passed by seconds before the bomb exploded and only a wall saved him from serious injury. However, the explosion did not bear the familiar signs of Mafia action and would be an unusual departure from the organisation's practice of concentrating terrorist action in its home base of Sicily. Firemen were yesterday still clearing up debris in the street in the Parioli district of Rome where the explosion occurred. Some 80 apartment owners have been forced to leave their homes temporarily following the blast, which gouged a small hole in the road and devasted the facades of buildings for nearly 100m. Police said the explosion was unlikely to be the work of any foreign organisation or a local subversive group.</p>

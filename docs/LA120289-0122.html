			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S MOVE BASED ON INTERNATIONAL LAW;  </P> <P> POLICY: THE U.S. AID FOR AQUINO GETS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN CONGRESS.  </P> <P> President Bush's order directing U.S. warplanes to help suppress the insurgency  in the Philippines was legal under a provision of international law permitting  governments under attack to seek outside help, U.S. officials and  non-government experts agreed Friday.  </P> <P> The President's decision to authorize use of armed force in defense of  Philippine President Corazon Aquino's government drew immediate applause from  Democrats in Congress, including some who have expressed doubts about  involvement of U.S. military power in Third World conflicts.  </P> <P> Pentagon officials, departing from their usual reticence about military rules  of engagement, said the F-4 jets were armed and authorized to secure airspace  over Manila "with force if required." These officials emphasized that Aquino  was given all the help she requested, but nothing more.  </P> <P> "If President Aquino thought she had everything under control, she probably  wouldn't have asked for our help," a senior defense official said.  </P> <P> "We were coming to the assistance of a democratically elected government that  requested our assistance," said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.  "That is totally in conformity with international law."  </P> <P> Barry Carter, a Georgetown University professor of international law, said it  always is legitimate for a nation to respond to a plea for help from a  recognized government.  </P> <P> "An invitation (from a government facing attack) is a genuine basis under the  United Nations Charter and international law for the use of force," Carter  said.  </P> <P> That theory has been cited frequently in recent years. For instance, Washington  invoked it in responding to an appeal from the governor-general of Grenada to  restore order on that Caribbean island after a hard-line Communist coup in  1983, and France cited it in helping the government of Chad expel Libyan  occupiers from the North African nation.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union also said it was acting in response to a government invitation  when it invaded Afghanistan in 1979. But shortly after Moscow's troops arrived,  they deposed the government and installed a puppet leader.  </P> <P> The U.N. Security Council ultimately determined that the Soviet presence in  Afghanistan was illegal. But Soviet forces remained there for a decade, clearly  demonstrating that international law can be flouted with impunity, especially  by a superpower.  </P> <P> International law -- derived mostly from treaties, compacts and longtime  precedent -- generally has no means of enforcement. Nevertheless, nations  usually try to at least appear to abide by its provisions because they are  reluctant to be branded as outlaws.  </P> <P> At least at the outset, Bush's use of air power in the Philippines seems to  have generated less opposition than any military deployment in decades. Aquino,  credited with ousting the authoritarian government of the late Philippine  leader Ferdinand E. Marcos, is immensely popular in the United States.  Moreover, the U.S. government, which maintains its largest overseas military  bases in the Philippines, has a clear interest in preserving stability in  Manila.  </P> <P> "It is hard to think of a case where the use of force from our point of view  and that of the rest of the world would be less controversial," said Richard K.  Betts, a senior fellow of the Brookings Institution in Washington. "If you are  ever going to do that anywhere, this looks like as good a case as you can  find."  </P> <P> The initial reaction from Capitol Hill seemed to prove Betts' point. Senate  Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) called Bush's action "prudent and  appropriate." Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.) said the President "took the kind  of measured action required."  </P> <P> Bush's prompt backing of the Philippine government was in sharp contrast to his  failure to take decisive action when rebel officers recently tried to overthrow  the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega in Panama. But Administration  officials insisted that the two situations were far different.  </P> <P> "This is a legitimate and popular government (in the Philippines), as opposed  to the situation we saw in Panama, where an unknown and suspect officer was  trying to overthrow the government," said an Administration analyst. "Here,  we're saving democracy. This is mom-and-apple-pie stuff."  </P> <P> The Administration also was on much firmer international legal ground in the  Philippines. Even though Noriega's regime is widely regarded as illegitimate,  it remains the only effective government of Panama. Therefore, there was no  government that could request U.S. intervention.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, some specialists suggested that Bush might have moved more  quickly this time because of criticism that his actions were halfhearted in  Panama.  </P> <P> "You've got a good lesson learned and applied there," said Dov Zakheim, a  former Reagan Admistration official. "There needed to be clarity in a highly  fluid situation where there were American interests and lives at stake."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base are America's largest military  facilities outside the continental United States and are vital for the  protection of U.S. strategic interests in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Large  stockpiles of fuel and ammunition are maintained at Clark, from which the  United States can stage airlift operations -- as it did in the early days of  the Vietnam War -- and train combat pilots based there. Subic Bay is the main  rest and repair stop for the U.S. fleet operation from the mid-Pacific to the  Persian Gulf. While they are an increasing sore spot to nationalist-minded  Filipinos, the two bases, situated north of Manila, contribute substantially to  the Philippine economy, providing employment for 68,000 Filipinos.  </P></p>

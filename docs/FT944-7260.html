			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / The sweetening of one man: Jurek Martin and Nancy Dunne analyse the political manoeuvres behind Clinton's deal to ratify the Uruguay Round Robert Strauss, the US trade representative in the late 1970s, once described his approach to negotiating trade agreements and getting them approved by Congress as 'half a teaspoon of sugar here, half a teaspoon there and pretty soon they are sweet'. The business has become more expensive - if not necessarily more subtle - since his heyday. Last November's successful battle to ratify the North American Free Trade Agreement linking the US, Canada and Mexico saw pork thrown around the congressional barrel as if all pigs were about to be slaughtered. This month's - over Gatt - came down to the sweetening of one man. When Senator Robert Dole, the most powerful Republican in the US Senate, pronounced himself satisfied with the deal he had struck over congressional ratification of the Uruguay Round trade accords, more than President Bill Clinton breathed a sigh of relief. The eyes of the trading world had been focused on whether the US Congress would ratify the creation of a global trading regime due to come into being next January under the auspices of the new World Trade Organisation. Waiting on the US, only about a quarter of the more than 120 members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have completed the approval process. The endorsement of the European Union has also been delayed by a legal wrangle, now resolved. International uncertainty has left even the choice of a head of the WTO up in the air. Now, even US opponents of the new order concede that Mr Dole's endorsement has turned the tide. Next Thursday the outgoing Senate ought to put its seal on the Uruguay Round. The House of Representatives should have done its bit two days earlier since the bipartisan leadership - Congressmen Newt Gingrich for the Republicans and Richard Gephardt for the Democrats - is committed to approval. Political chickens are being counted with care but the assumption is that the deal has been hatched. Mr Dole is no mean dealmaker himself, fond of squeezing the pips until they squeak. It must be assumed he knew exactly what he was doing in September when he announced that he was far from sure that consideration of Gatt should not be delayed until the new Congress convened in January. There were, he said, serious budgetary issues and weighty questions of US sovereignty. This simple pronouncement made him the centre of the post-mid-term election political universe, even temporarily eclipsing Mr Gingrich. Nafta, not a perfect precedent but the best available, passed the Senate last year by 61 votes (including his) to 39. This is only one more than the 60 votes the Uruguay Round needs to pass a critical procedural hurdle - the waiving of budget rules - prior to a floor vote. While Mr Dole sat on the fence and even with a number of Democratic converts from the anti-Nafta ranks, the White House was conceding on Wednesday morning that it was a handful short of the magic 60. It was not merely the administration, directed by one of its own better dealmakers, trade representative Mickey Kantor, that concentrated all its energies on Mr Dole. The anti-Gatt forces based their campaign in his home state headquarters in Wichita, Kansas, the 'ground zero' of their campaign. Ross Perot, the 1992 presidential candidate, was in the city on Tuesday night addressing a rally urging rejection. The Dole office was receiving 2,000 calls a day against ratification before the phones were taken off the hook. Many of these were instigated by Mr Perot's organisation and by rightwing radio commentators. For public consumption, the lobbying of the senator from Kansas was always more about pure politics than the merits of free trade, though all the usual arguments were given full public airing. The administration naturally claimed that Gatt amounted to 'the biggest tax cut in history', that free trade created more high-paying American jobs, and that US leadership overseas would be gravely damaged if the treaty went down the tubes. The opposition, encompassing left and right and with the Nafta experience fresh in the memory, warned that the Gatt-implementing legislation included 'give-aways' for special interests in the fine print of the revenue measures of the enabling legislation. One of the better stunts was pulled by Mr Ralph Nader, the consumer activist, who offered to give Dollars 10,000 to charity if any member of Congress read the whole Uruguay Round agreement and then answered 10 questions of his own design. Only Senator Hank Brown, the Colorado Republican and a Gatt supporter, has taken him up - he sits the test before next week's vote. But the essence of the deal that was finally confected - some favours for the agricultural interests so dear to any representative of the farm belt but, most important, the creation of a five-judge panel to ascertain if the WTO unfairly rules against US interests - was designed to give the senator the sort of political protection he craved. For there can be no doubt after the mid-term elections that the old Republican support for free trade, so much a part of Mr Dole's own political career, is weaker now than it has been since the 1920s. Suspicion is rampant of any global body threatening US sovereignty, especially one with the menacing title of World Trade Organisation. It is generally recognised that Mr Dole has both a managerial and a political problem with the resurgent right which, without this week's deal, could have been exacerbated by the Gatt. Not only would he be vulnerable to conservative charges of sacrificing US sovereignty to an unaccountable world panel, he would also, in the legislative process, have found himself voting for higher taxes. Under laws peculiar to the US, the loss of revenues from the lower tariffs of the round must be offset by higher taxes and user fees. Putting down his marker on the right, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a likely rival of Mr Dole's for the party presidential nomination in 1996, came out early and said he could not vote for the budget waiver and its higher taxes, whatever he thought of the Gatt (after the Dole deal, he left the impression he would back the treaty). Mr Dole has more than Mr Gramm to worry about in looking ahead to 1996. It is going to be hard enough simultaneously to run the Senate and a national political campaign. Early finance and good organisation are imperative, especially now that California and New York have moved their primaries up to March, front-loading and shortening the effective voting season. And big business - Mr Dole's potential underwriters - is pro-Gatt, while Mr Gramm, for one, already has plenty of money and political chits in his campaign bank. Sometimes in the negotiations it seemed Mr Dole overreached himself. His attempt to link the Gatt to cutting taxes on capital gains - long on the Republican wish-list - got short shrift not only from the administration but also from business interests. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, put it bluntly: 'The consequences of killing the Gatt because of last-minute political manoeuvring over a capital gains tax cut are too great.' Even if the game is now over, the perception persists that the administration should never have been forced into the corner of dealing with Mr Dole. According to Julius Katz, a trade official under President George Bush, the lessons of footdragging over Nafta should have been learnt. The additional taxes needed to offset the lost tariff income should have been in the budget for the 1995 fiscal year. It was known as soon as the Uruguay Round was concluded last December that such provisions would have to be made. Then, in the search for extra revenues, the administration lighted upon licence fees on the operators of the new broad spectrum radio wavebands. This gave jurisdiction to the commerce committee chaired by Senator Ernest Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat and protectionist. In October he invoked congressional privileges forcing a 45-day delay in the Gatt vote. Even assuming all goes to plan next week, the unintended consequences could be many. Other countries may want their own watchdog panel of judges. The entire dispute settlement process of the WTO, one of the main US objectives in the launch of the Uruguay Round, could thus be put at risk. But to Bob Dole, playing for high stakes today, that is tomorrow's problem.</p>

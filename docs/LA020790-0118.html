			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE TO TAKE A TAX BITE FROM SCHOOL FUND-RAISERS  </P> <P> Hundreds of school organizations that peddle everything from football buttons  to hot dogs as a way to earn money for school activities are facing for the  first time the same burden as most business people -- sharing the take with the  tax man.  </P> <P> The new tax bite comes as a result of a recent State Board of Equalization  ruling that a high school wrestling team in Monterey has to pay a sales tax on  thousands of dollars it made selling fried calamari.  </P> <P> The 3-2 decision sets a precedent that places new responsibilities on school  organizations to either collect a sales tax on certain items they sell or  obtain a tax exemption from the Board of Equalization.  </P> <P> Discovered and later billed by tax authorities conducting a routine check at a  local fair, the Monterey High School wrestling team balked at paying up. The  team claimed that, as a nonprofit high school organization, it was entitled to  a tax exemption and did not owe $1,000 in sales taxes.  </P> <P> But, acting on the advice of its lawyers, the board majority ruled last month  that either on purpose or by accident the Legislature had repealed automatic  tax exemptions for school organizations in the mid-1980s. At that time, staff  attorney Ron Dick said, lawmakers replaced a law giving school organizations  blanket exemptions with a new measure that specifically named those  organizations that would not be required to pay the tax.  </P> <P> He reasoned that any groups -- such as school athletic teams -- that were not  named in the law would not be entitled to an automatic exemption.  </P> <P> On the list of exempted organizations were the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Cub  Scouts, YMCA, YWCA, Future Farmers of America, Future Homemakers of America,  4-H Clubs, Special Olympics, Little League, Bobby Sox, Campfire Inc., Future  Business Leaders of America, Distributive Education Clubs of America,  Vocational Industrial Clubs of America, Collegiate Young Farmers, America Youth  Soccer Organization, California Youth Soccer Assn. and Pop Warner Football.  </P> <P> Any other youth organization, Dick said, would have to apply to the board for  exemption before they sold taxable goods. The board would then have to decide  on a case by case basis whether the exemption was justified.  </P> <P> Two board members -- Controller Gray Davis and Chairman Conway Collis --  disagreed with the staff lawyer's interpretation, insisting that the  Legislature never intended to make schoolchildren wend their way through the  state's complicated tax laws. They argued, without success, that by passing the  new law, legislators meant only to expand earlier exemptions and not to replace  them. Davis and Collis cast the two dissenting votes when the Board of  Equalization voted to turn down the appeal by the Monterey wrestling team.  </P> <P> "Raising money for athletics is as American as apple pie and here we're  requiring them to go through bureaucratic hoops," Davis said.  </P> <P> "I just can't believe the Legislature intended this result. Next they'll be  taxing little 6-year-olds selling lemonade outside their home."  </P> <P> Dr. Robert Peterson, superintendent of schools in Orange County, predicted that  imposing taxes on school organizations would become a politically volatile  issue that would force lawmakers to pass legislation to stop it. He also  denounced the ruling by the Board of Equalization as a waste of taxpayer  dollars.  </P> <P> "Probably the amount of money that's involved here is not equal to (the cost of  paying) the number of new employees you'd have to have to enforce it, so it's a  lose-lose situation," Peterson said. "It would just give us a bigger  bureaucracy."  </P> <P> Davis said the ruling now will force school organizations to familiarize  themselves with tax laws that are complicated enough to give a Philadelphia  lawyer a headache.  </P> <P> In order for a school organization to know whether, for example, its food sale  items are taxable, it will have to delve into narrowly drawn laws governing its  temperature. In this case, hot prepared food is taxable; cold food generally is  not. So if the organization sells a hot fried ham sandwich on toast it is  subject to tax, but a cold tuna on toast is not.  </P> <P> Because candy manufacturers have been influential with the Legislature, candy  proceeds are usually not taxable. Neither are baked goods. But when candy,  baked goods or other food items are sold within a place where admission is  charged -- such as a dance, a football game or a fair -- it is subject to the  tax. Restaurants operate under a different set of tax rules.  </P> <P> As a practical matter, Collis said, most organizations will have no way of  knowing either when something is taxable or how to obtain an exemption. Davis  said it is apparent that school groups don't know about the law because state  records show none of them have ever applied for an exemption.  </P> <P> And while the exemptions are expected to be granted almost automatically to  school groups, both Collis and Davis said it will take weeks, if not months,  for the requests to work their way through the bureaucracy to the board.  </P> <P> "To make groups go through the bureaucratic rigamarole of applying for an  exemption is just making it that more difficult for them to operate. These  programs are for school kids; they are not a business. These resources should  go into teaching kids and not be bogged down in the tax bureaucracy," said  Collis.  </P> <P> Bill Grant, the Monterey High School wrestling coach who was the first to get  hit with the special tax, said the Board of Equalization's decision is  particularly burdensome for high school sports programs which increasingly have  had to resort to fund raising to make up for cuts in athletic budgets. When he  took the coaching job at Monterey High 12 years ago, Grant said, his budget was  $12,000. Last year it was under $5,000.  </P> <P> What was once an occasional activity has become a way of life for coaches, he  said. And what were once modest ventures such as car washes and bake sales have  become more elaborate as the financial needs of team sports become more  critical. Monterey wrestling team members and their parents spend nine days  each summer selling calamari at the Monterey County Fair and net nearly  $10,000.  </P> <P> "Almost every coach in the United States has to do this," Grant said. "You're a  fund-raiser and a coach. It's sort of a necessary evil. I have so many friends  who have dropped out of coaching because of the frustration of fund raising."  </P> <P> And now with the tax burden added, he said, the job is even harder.  </P></p>

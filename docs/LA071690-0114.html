			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSINESS SALES JUMP 0.9% IN GOOD SIGN FOR ECONOMY  </P> <P> Business sales shot up 0.9% in May, the biggest jump in three months, while  inventories rose modestly, the government said today in a report indicating  continued economic growth.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $538.3  billion, up 0.9%.  </P> <P> It was the strongest increase since February, when sales rose 1.4%, and  followed a 1.0% decline in April.  </P> <P> Inventories held on shelves and back lots in May totaled a seasonally adjusted  $799.4 billion, up 0.4% following a 0.3% increase in April.  </P> <P> The combination of strong sales and a moderate increase in inventories produced  a 1.48 ratio of inventories to sales, down slightly from 1.49 in April. The  ratio means that it would take 1.48 months to exhaust the backlog of goods at  the May sales pace.  </P> <P> Today's report, which was in line with economists' expectations, provided fresh  evidence that the economy is not in danger of toppling immediately into a  recession.  </P> <P> If inventories were to rise excessively in relation to sales, it could cause  production cutbacks and job layoffs at factories as businesses attempted to  sell off their goods backlog.  </P> <P> Inventories have remained under control so far this year despite lackluster  economic growth.  </P> <P> Manufacturers showed the biggest sales gain in May, 2.0%, while sales fell 0.6%  at retail stores. Wholesalers reported a 0.6% increase.  </P> <P> In an advance estimate, the Commerce Department said last week that retail  sales rose 0.5% in June, the first increase in five months.  </P> <P> The increase in inventories, meanwhile, was greatest at wholesale  establishments, up 1.2%. Retail backlogs rose a moderate 0.4% while inventories  at factories were unchanged.  </P></p>

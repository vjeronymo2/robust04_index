			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECT ANIMALS FROM THE OCCULT  </P> <P> After reading about "born-again" Christian Randy Emon and his occult ideas, I  am quite mystified how he is able to retain such a responsible job as a police  sergeant in Baldwin Park.  </P> <P> According to the article, Emon believes his children have been possessed by  demons. How many more children standing in the sergeant's path will be accused  of these same "crimes"?  </P> <P> Mention was made that two youths had mutilated around seven cats. The district  attorney seems to have believed their act was "all a joke," to quote Glen  Myers, Covina crime prevention officer.  </P> <P> Killing cats is not a joke. Neither should be mutilation of other animals in  the name of Santeria or any other perverse religion that allows such horrible  practices. Let's put the blame where it belongs -- not on some medieval notion  of satanic possession, but on religions that continue to practice animal  cruelty.  </P> <P> Sgt. Emon should be studying psychology instead of occultism, and he should be  referring people who commit bizarre religious rituals to the nearest mental  health clinic. In the United States we have freedom of religion, but cruelty to  animals should and must have priority over religious incantations of a former  uncivilized age.  </P> <P> GERALD P.

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Row over health care is settled MINISTERS have settled a row that was threatening to delay the switch to local authorities of responsibility for the government's care in the community policies for the elderly and mentally handicapped, Philip Stephens writes. In what is seen as a defeat for the Treasury, health secretary Mrs Virginia Bottomley is also close to winning her battle to ensure that money transferred to local authorities from the social security budget to fund the new system will be 'ring-fenced'. The plans - which will begin next April to transfer to councils responsibility for those requiring care at home or in residential accommodation - have been the subject of intense Whitehall infighting. The aim is to 'cap' a surge in open-ended income support payments to pay for residential accommodation but the size of the initial transfer from the social security to local authority budgets has been the subject of dispute. The Treasury and the Department of the Environment have also opposed Mrs Bottomley's view that the transfer can only succeed if local authorities are prevented by ring-fencing from switching resources for community care to other budgets. The health secretary is now said to be confident that she has secured enough money - several hundred million pounds - to ensure that the phasing in of the new system can begin next year. The government appears set to reject the recommendations of an independent review body that more than 2,000 top public servants should receive a large one-off pay rise to bring their salaries level with those in the private sector. Senior ministers said that they expect tomorrow's meeting of the cabinet to scale back significantly the increases for senior civil servants, armed forces officers and judges suggested by the Top People's Pay Review Board. Mr John Major is also likely to insist that those pay awards of over 10 per cent which are accepted by the government should be phased in.</p>

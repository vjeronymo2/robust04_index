			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Bosnians slow to hand arms to UN The number of artillery pieces being placed under United Nations supervision by Bosnian Serb and Bosnian government troops is 'negligible', a senior UN officer said yesterday. General Jean Cot of France admitted that there were very few weapons being handed over despite attempts by UN forces to speed up their collection in order to pre-empt Nato air strikes on positions near the city. UN officials believe air strikes could lead to an escalation of the fighting and undermine the humanitarian relief effort, and could amount to a Nato declaration of war against Serbia. General Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of the United Nations Protection Force (Unprofor), has spoken to senior Nato officials about the need for much greater back-up on the ground to collect and supervise heavy weapons. Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister, warned that if Sarajevo were not demilitarised, 'an air strike is unavoidable and this could cause a further escalation of the war'. He was speaking at a news conference in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, the former Yugoslav republic. Nato has said it will strike at any positions, held by either side, if heavy weapons located in the exclusion zone are not handed in by midnight GMT on Sunday. Military experts yesterday said the UN was at a disadvantage in trying to demilitarise Sarajevo since it did not know exactly how many weapons were held by either side. 'There are certain kinds of weapons which we can identify from the air. But there is no inventory. We do not know where all the weapons are,' said Mr Edward Foster, military strategist at Britain's Royal United Services Institute. There is also concern that Bosnia's Serb forces are placing weapons in their own depots to be supervised by unarmed UN personnel. Weapons handed in by the Bosnian government are being supervised by Ukrainian UN peacekeepers. UN officials are also concerned that the Bosnian government forces might try to destabilise the ceasefire by provoking the Serbs, possibly leading to Nato air strikes.</p>

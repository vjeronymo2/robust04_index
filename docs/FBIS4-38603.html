			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Radiostantsiya Ekho Moskvy in  Russian at 1815 GMT on 30 May carries a 45-minute live studio  interview with Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the Russian State  Duma Defense Committee, and U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, head of the  Armed Forces Committee of the U.S. Senate, by an unidentified  correspondent. Nunn speaks in English with passage-by-passage  translation into Russian.    The guests discuss topics related to Russo-American  relations  and answer a few questions phoned in by listeners. Nunn  introduces himself and speaks briefly about his military career.    The correspondent reports that, as of today, Russian,  British, and U.S. missiles are no longer aimed at each other.  Nunn says partnership and trust are growing and adds that  today's meeting was a step in the right direction. He says that  relations are developing in many areas. Yushenkov then  reiterates Nunn's words regarding the end of missile targeting.    Nunn says that he, Yushenkov, Lukin, and others discussed  the  issue of joint maneuvers. He says they are intended to be a  small- arms, peacekeeping enterprise and that there is no  requirement that the maneuvers be held at the Totskoye proving  ground. He asks why the maneuvers could not be held in the  United States. Nunn then says that the Defense Department must  decide these things, but he hopes other senators will support  them on the question of joint maneuvers. Yushenkov says the  maneuvers will also help the two sides to train together should  a real conflict emerge. Nunn agrees.    The guests then discuss the arms embargo against Bosnia.    Yushenkov reads a quote from Jean Kirkpatrick that the only  successful U.S. military operation since World War II was in the  Gulf War. He says that other so-called peacekeeping operations  have resulted in great losses and says that intervention should  only be accompanied by military action.    Nunn says he does not agree that there have been no  successful peacekeeping operations. He cites Cambodia and the  Sinai as good examples.    Yushenkov says he is an opponent of using force as a means  toward peace. He says there are many examples of this  throughout Russia, and it is impossible to determine who is the  aggressor and who is the victim in various hot spots. Nunn  agrees and says that the United States must be very careful  where it puts peacekeeping forces.    The moderator asks the guests if they believe Russia and the  United States should compete in arms sales. Nunn says the  United States has not chosen to be a competitor; it has happened  naturally, due to economic reasons. Yushenkov says Russia has  reduced its arms sales drastically compared with the United  States.    A listener asks whether Russia and the United States are not  tired of opposing each other. Nunn says yes, that even friends  have differences, but they should be discussed together. He  says the aftermath of the Cold War--in the form of thousands of  nuclear and chemical weapons in both countries--must be  remembered. He adds that biological weapons also need to be  eliminated.    Yushenkov says he is not only tired of making war but he  abhors it. He says that Nunn is coauthor of an amendment on aid  to CIS countries for the destruction of nuclear weapons.    Another listener asks whether there might be a third force  or  group of countries that would want to aim its missiles at both  the United States and Russia. Nunn says he put this question to  the military in the 1980's to find out the potential of both  countries to repel an attack by a third country.    Yushenkov says both countries' efforts should be aimed at  improving the effectiveness of the United Nations, the CSCE, and  the Partnership for Peace program.    The moderator asks both guests what they would like to be  remembered about them.    Nunn says he would like to think he made the world a bit  safer and more peaceful. Yushenkov says he would like the Duma  to pass a law on alternative military service and an effective  law on control of the military.</p>

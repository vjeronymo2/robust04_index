			<p>BFN     [Text] The international force of observers is beginning  its duties in Hebron today. The 160-strong force, including  support staff and experts, comes from Norway, Denmark, and Italy  and was agreed on by Israel and the PLO following the Hebron  massacre in February. Mark Weiss reports from Hebron:    [Begin Weiss recording] I am speaking from the Hebron  Municipality building. The international observer force has  arrived in the town and has just been welcomed by Mayor  al-Natshah at the Municipality building. He expressed [word  indistinct] that the people will feel safer because of the  arrival of the temporary international presence. He expects all  the population to cooperate despite reports of threats from  Islamic fundamentalists. The mayor told me that tomorrow a  meeting will be held between the international observers and the  Islamic fundamentalists in the town. The mayor said he believed  their arrival will reduce the level of violence in the city.  The observers arrived in a fleet of white Fiat Uno cars flying  a white flag. They are all dressed in smart white uniforms.  For most of them it is the first time they have arrived in the  town and they are actually due to begin their work tomorrow.  [end recording]</p>

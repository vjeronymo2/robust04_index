			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Rail union threatens to step up signal staff strike action Britain's railway network faces further weeks of widespread disruption after the RMT transport union's executive decided last night to escalate the signalling staff dispute if a settlement of their grievances is not achieved by July 24. This would involve moving from the current one day a week stoppages to two days of action a week. In the meantime, tomorrow's one-day strike will go ahead as planned and this will be followed by further 24-hour stoppages on the Wednesdays of July 13 and 20. The RMT's general secretary, Mr Jimmy Knapp, said after a five-hour meeting of the executive that it was 'about time we resumed serious negotiations to end this dispute on a basis which my members will recognise as fair and reasonable'. He added that over the weekend signalling staff had made it clear to the union that they thought the current three-stage productivity offer from Railtrack was a 'very poor deal'. The union said that the signalling staff who had contacted the RMT had been 'overwhelmingly hostile to Railtrack's offer'. 'The responses we have been getting today make it clear that members are still solidly behind the union and I am confident this will be demonstrated on Wednesday,' said Mr Knapp. However, he suggested that the union had left Railtrack with time to reconsider its position. A company spokesman said last night that Railtrack was 'disappointed that the RMT had stuck to an unrealistic demand and refused to consider the offer that will substantially benefit signalling staff'. Railtrack added that its phones had been 'red hot' all day with signalling staff who wanted to hear about the offer. The company believes there is no more than a 'hair's breadth' between the union demand and the Pounds 28 to Pounds 34 a week the signalmen would receive in their pay packets between now and October when their final productivity deal would come into force. Railtrack believes that the RMT executive is becoming more interested in a political confrontation than reaching a deal. Mr Knapp said the company must address the demand for a pay rise for signalling staff for past productivity achievements and to restore their earnings position on the railways relative to other workers.</p>

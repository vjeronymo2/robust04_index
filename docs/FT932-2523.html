			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Management: Thriving on independence - IMI has shaken off the restrictive culture of its former parent ICI As an old ICI hand, Gary Allen has been watching the carving up of his former employer with a certain fraternal interest. IMI, the engineering group of which he is managing director, used to be an ICI division. In 1978 it was floated as an independent company. It was thus the prototype for this month's more ambitious demerger of Zeneca, ICI's bioscience business. Allen joined ICI's metals division - the future IMI - as an accountancy trainee in 1965. Two months after the flotation he joined the IMI board. He is therefore something of an authority on what it means to cut loose from the ICI culture. His verdict is unequivocal: 'It was the making of us.' As he describes it, life under ICI sounds uncommonly restrictive. For example, he says, take joint ventures. In the mid-1970s, he was running a boiler-making subsidiary of IMI. 'I had a joint venture I wanted to do with another ICI subsidiary in Ireland. It was a feasible project and would have made money for both of us. Then there was a head office diktat: we don't do joint ventures this small. And that was that. After 1977, a lot of IMI's growth was getting into joint ventures with European family-owned companies  -taking stakes, building blocks without total ownership, then buying the family out later.' Or take wages. 'Under ICI, when it came to pay scales, there was always some read-through from the centre. There was the ICI pension scheme, which everyone had to belong to. There were joint consultative schemes. And in 1977, IMI had 30,000 employees, a lot of them ladies employed in assembly work. When ICI negotiated a pay increase for one of their big capital-intensive plants, labour costs were relatively low in the equation. They were very high when it came to us making zip fasteners and ammunition.' Or take capital investment. At the time, ICI was spending a great deal on petrochemical plants around the world. IMI, it decreed, must live within its own cash flow. IMI's head at the time of flotation, Eric Swainson, now deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank, says: 'IMI was very largely a UK metal basher. Our ambition was to diversify in terms of products and outside the UK. That was not really possible at any speed within our own cash flow. We needed access to the markets. ICI made it clear to us that if we wanted to live in their protected world, we couldn't change our nature. If we wanted to grow and diversify, we could only do it outside.' Or take research and development. 'It was regarded as essential to have a very large central research establishment,' Allen says. 'That was very ICI. But we felt that in many of our product areas we ought to be in process development rather than in basic research. After demerger, we decentralised our R&amp;D totally.' Or even, at the extreme, take industrial relations. 'There was an ICI message I had as a factory manager,' Allen says. 'We don't have strikes. Once we were independent, we shut down zip fasteners in Birmingham. I think that would have hit a block in ICI, because it involved getting rid of 3,500 ladies. In fact, there was no strike, but ICI wouldn't have taken the risk.' In fairness, he concedes, he might have got the message wrong. 'But that's where culture comes into play. As a manager at that time, you got the very strong feeling that ICI didn't want any trouble. Once we were independent, we knew we had to grasp these nettles. And why weren't they grasped before?' At this point, one begins to ask if it was all really so one-sided. Surely ICI provided some central services which IMI found hard to replace? Not at all, say Allen and Swainson, if anything, the reverse. 'To be honest,' Allen says, 'we found there were a lot of professional advisers who regarded us as a new and very desirable client.' In purchasing, Allen says, there were positive advantages. 'One of my jobs after the split was to re-negotiate all the big supply contracts like gas and oil, which had previously been handled by a massive ICI organisation at Millbank headquarters called Central Purchasing Department. We actually got better terms from some of those suppliers, who were very concerned that we'd go elsewhere.' To be fair to ICI, some of these rigidities have since been abolished. The Central Purchasing Department, for instance, was disbanded long ago. But until the Zeneca demerger there was still central purchasing of cars and some engineering equipment, while groups of businesses within ICI clubbed together to buy raw materials. Central wage bargaining remained: indeed, for the next few months both Zeneca and the new smaller ICI will still be working off the wage settlement struck before they went their separate ways. The rosy picture of demerger needs qualifying in one important respect. For IMI's senior staff, Swainson says, it represented pure opportunity. But, he concedes, 'security was a thing that bothered people down the line. There was fear that this might be the start of a break-up or screwing down of conditions'. Allen agrees: 'For management, it was exciting. For a lot of people below the level of management, the great umbrella of ICI had been taken away. And even some managers realised - hang on, we could be taken over. The same must apply to Zeneca and ICI now. They're both more vulnerable, simply in terms of scale.' As a proxy for the Zeneca demerger, IMI is far from perfect. It was far smaller than Zeneca and more self-contained. It also had a stock exchange quotation for more than a decade before its final separation. But its experience bears out one central contention of the ICI board in devising the latest split: that different parts of the business should be free to manage themselves however suits them best. For what it is worth, there may also be a message in the share price. Over the 11 years in which IMI was publicly quoted but still part of ICI, its shares underperformed ICI's by around a third. Since then they have outperformed ICI by more than 60 per cent. On that basis, Zeneca's Pounds 1.3bn rights issue - which closes on Monday - should be a snip.</p>

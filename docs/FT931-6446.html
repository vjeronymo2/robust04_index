			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Serb push in area around US air-drop SERB forces were yesterday close to seizing Cerska, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia which United Nations officials said was the target for the first US air-drop. Reports from Cerska said there was no evidence that any of the 21 tonnes of food and medicine dropped by US air force C-130 aircraft were recovered either by the 6,000 Moslems trapped in the area or by any of the other parties to the conclict. However, Mr Les Aspin US defence secretary, said the operation had been successful, with many parcels landing in clear areas near Cerska. He added it was believed the other parcels had landed in or near the drop zone. Mr Aspin said the information was provided by national technical means, which usually refers to aircraft or satellite photographs. In Germany US troops prepared for a second air-drop but refused to say when it would take place. An amateur radio operator, Cerska's only link with the outside world, said an object which could have been an aid pallet had been spotted behind Serbian lines. He suggested that the US aircraft might have mistaken Moslem villages set alight during recent fighting for bonfires in the enclave. Serb fighters at the weekend seized several villages in the Moslem area. Artillery shells yesterday fell in the Drina valley as Serb forces fought for control of more territory around Cerska. Western diplomats said the outgunned Bosnia government forces in Cerska were unlikely to hold out much longer. The Belgrade office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees last night sent two officials to the Zvornik area, just 10 miles away from Cerska, to investigate reports of a likely outflow of Moslem refugees. Local Bosnian commanders said that there were 1,500 wounded in Cerska and that Serb fighters had set 10 villages on fire. Bosnian Croat forces said yesterday they were enforcing a blockade of supply convoys for their estranged Moslem allies despite Bosnian government reports that it had been lifted, Reuter reports from Zvornik. The Bosnian Croat militia force said it was halting about half of the Moslem forces' traffic between the Croatian border and central Bosnia.</p>

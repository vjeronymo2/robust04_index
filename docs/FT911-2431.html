			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Miners expected to yield to Yeltsin MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian leader, is expected to persuade coalminers in the Kuzbas today to end their strike, which is already showing signs of faltering. Beginning a visit last night to the most militant coalfield, he told the miners that the agreement he and other republican leaders had signed with President Mikhail Gorbachev last week had conceded many of their political demands. He claimed that his call in March for Mr Gorbachev to resign had succeeded in pulling the latter away from his alliance with hardliners. 'The President just had to be cooled off,' the independent news agency Interfax quoted him as telling strike leaders. He said that the 'special regime' in mines and other strategic industries which the agreement had proposed was designed to create favourable conditions for increasing productivity. He stressed, however, that a decision to end the strike was in the miners' hands. Mr Yeltsin, with Mr Yuri Skokov, the Russian deputy prime minister, gave the miners' leaders details of how the pits could be transferred from Soviet to Russian jurisdiction. Back in Moscow, his supporters took to the streets to collect the 100,000 signatures necessary for his presidency. A demonstration supporting him in central Moscow last night attracted about 30,000 people, a small number compared with other such rallies in recent months. This reflected both the bad weather, and, more importantly, the deflation of the radical movement after Mr Yeltsin's signing of the statement with Mr Gorbachev and eight other republican leaders committing him to end strikes and support the government's anti-crisis plan. The congress of the Social Democratic Party, which begins today in Leningrad, is expected to follow the Democratic Russia movement's initiative at the weekend in endorsing Mr Yeltsin's candidacy. However, deputies to the Russian parliament said yesterday they were seeking ways to restrain him from acting impulsively in the future. Two other names are now being mooted among deputies as possible contenders for the Russian presidency on June 12. These are Mr Vadim Bakatin, the former interior minister and now a member of Mr Gorbachev's presidential council, who achieved a reputation as a liberal; and Mr Anatoly Sobchak, Leningrad's popular and high-profile mayor. Neither, however, has been approached formally and it is thought unlikely at the moment that either could be persuaded to attempt to stop Mr Yeltsin's bandwagon.</p>

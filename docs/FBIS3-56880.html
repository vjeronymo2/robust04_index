"I have already obtained the government's backing to my idea  of slightly correcting the functions of the Economics Ministry,"  the minister said.    In Shokhin's opinion, the Economics Ministry should be  turned  into a federal body, which would analyse all the economic,  social, and political aspects of the reforms, should issue  recommendations to other agencies, to the government, and even  to the president, should advise them on the actions that should  be taken at the given juncture.    "The ministry should discharge less functions linked with  the  duties of the former 'State Planning Committee', that is with  the distribution of resources," Shokhin stressed. However, he  noted that for the time being it would be necessary to combine  both functions and to draw up proposals for the government's  crediting commission.    As to relations with the International Monetary Fund, the  minister said: "We would like to get from it not standard  recommendations on financial stabilisation, but a programme  drawn up on the basis of concrete scenarios and versions, taking  into account the actual state of the Russian economy".</p>

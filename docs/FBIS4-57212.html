			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Text] Two days after he took office and was installed as  provisional president of the Republic by the Army and the  unofficial Office of the Senate, Justice Emile Jonassaint has  not yet published the names of his government. According to  Dominique Levanti of AFP, who quoted well-informed sources, Mr.  Jonassaint's steps toward formation of a government are  allegedly hindered by strong U.S. pressure on those who could be  appointed ministers in order to dissuade them, a report denied  by the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince through its spokesman,  Stanley Schrager.    [Schrager] "No, not at all. The U.S. Government is putting  no  pressure on this new -- this so-called government. But I would  say instead that the reason the so-called president cannot find  ministers who would like to participate in his government is  that no self-respecting Haitians would be part of such a  government. That is the problem. It is not pressure from  elsewhere that is preventing this so-called government from  functioning."    On the part of the supporters of the implementation of  Article 149 of the Constitution, this delay in the formation of  the government is explained by the fact that attorney Jonassaint  finds himself in an awkward position because he has to choose  from an overabundance of names. This is, for instance, the  opinion of Hubert De Ronceray, who is a possible prime minister.    [De Ronceray] "Once again, I cannot answer with precise  explanations, but I suppose that President Jonassaint must be  facing a pretty wide range of proposals. He must -- perhaps with  clear-mindedness -- be checking all those proposals so as to end  up in a correct choice which meets all the criteria that are  essential on this occasion."    It should be noted that several names are circulating for  the  post of prime minister. Rumor has it that the latter is  allegedly a woman, a lawyer who is well-known in Port-au-Prince  for her statements in favor of the coup d'etat. But there is a  major problem for this government: the matter of due  ratification by the two chambers of the parliament. It is  allegedly almost impossible to reach a quorum, given that the  socialists and the National Front for Change and Democracy  members have dissociated themselves from the partisans of  Article 149 and did not participate in the session held on the  installation of Justice Jonassaint -- unless, of course, the  procedures established by the Constitution are ignored, as was  the case on 11 May.</p>

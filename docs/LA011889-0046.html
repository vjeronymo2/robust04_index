			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USIU IS HEAVILY FAVORED AGAINST UCSD, BUT SERIES HISTORY IS 50-50  </P> <P> U.S. International University's game against UC San Diego might not appear as  if it will be much of a contest. The NCAA Division I Gulls play host to the  Division III Tritons tonight at 7:30 p.m. in Golden Hall.  </P> <P> But since USIU turned Division I in 1979, the teams have split six games. They  each won once during the 1986-87 season (the Gulls won the last meeting,  106-94). UCSD won both games in 1985-86, and USIU swept a 2-game series in  1984-85.  </P> <P> The Gulls will be heavy favorites tonight -- Coach Gary Zarecky has the finest  team in the 4 years he has been at USIU, and UCSD is rebuilding and 5-9 against  mostly Division III opponents.  </P> <P> The Tritons are led by 6-foot-8-inch center Gordon McNeill (12.5 points per  game). USIU counters with a balanced attack that includes four players  averaging in double figures.  </P> <P> Gary Williams leads the team with 17.1 points, and Paul Wilson adds 16.5. Point  guard Steve Smith is averaging 10.9 points, and forward Demetrius Laffitte is  averaging 16 points and 10.4 rebounds.  </P> <P> Laffitte needs 15 rebounds to move into fourth place on USIU's all-time list.  He has 207 rebounds with 8 games remaining and has a chance to break the school  record of 308 set by Don Robinson during the 1981-82 season.  </P> <P> The Gulls hope to tune up with UCSD and then await their rematch with Loyola  Marymount in Los Angeles Jan. 31. The teams combined for an NCAA record 306  points as Loyola won, 162-144, on Jan. 7.  </P></p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Fleming Claverhouse net assets ahead Net asset value at the Fleming Claverhouse Investment Trust was 193p at June 30, up 14 per cent on the figure of 168.6p at end-June 1992. Net revenue amounted to Pounds 1.12m, down from Pounds 1.25m in the comparable period. Earnings worked through at 2.55p (3.13p) per share. Comparative figures were adjusted to reflect the change of accounting policy to recognise income from investments on an ex-dividend basis and the scrip issue in March. Dividends of 2.5p have already been announced and the directors expect to recommend a maintained total of 5.35p.</p>

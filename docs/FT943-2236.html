			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Feelgood factor Why don't consumers feel happier about the economic recovery? Mr John Major says they should, and so do most of the economic statistics; but Gallup shows them clinging resolutely to gloom. A clue to this conundrum came yesterday from a leading feelgood factory, Grand Metropolitan's IDV drinks business. Instead of uncorking expansion, IDV's announcement reads like recession's hangover: plant rationalisation, office closures, regional restructuring. Another clue is the way companies find it hard to raise prices, despite economic recovery. Fiercer global competition lets consumers shop around. Companies grown fat on regional dominance find themselves seventh in a global market where only the big three thrive. To compete, ever-lower costs are essential. This remorseless logic has undermined the drinks industry's dash for margin, the trend of the late 1980s. For a while, drinkers were happy to pay more for sipping less; but as Guinness has found, that only works while the glow of economic euphoria lasts. This is the real message in IDV's bottle. Big companies, in English-speaking countries at least, are in a Maoist state of permanent revolution. GrandMet preceded the IDV restructuring with a similar effort in its US food business. Few large companies are not wielding the axe somewhere in their divisions. So, even though employment is rising, people who already have jobs feel threatened by uncertainty. That is a deeply unsettling sentiment. Much of economic history reflects the desire to defeat, avoid or pass on to someone else the inevitable uncertainty of human existence. The craving is a visceral one; its consequences range from trivial to profound, from the folding umbrella to the Common Agricultural Policy. It is frustrating when this sentiment hampers manifest improvements in human welfare, such as wider free trade. But politicians and business people ignore it at their peril. The lesson, for politicians, is that people really feel good only when they possess greater economic certainty - something to be earned the hard way, by long-term policies which promote stability. Business people have little choice but to live with uncertainty; but they might minimise its impact on stakeholders by speedy decisions, frankly communicated. After all, the truth works in good times as well as bad: a bit less feelgood factor wouldn't have done any harm in the late 1980s.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Historic Crossroads for Norway"] </F>   [Text] The government has every reason to be satisfied  with the job it has done in the negotiations for membership of  the European Union [EU]. This applies in particular to  Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen who in the early hours of  yesterday brought home a fisheries agreement that in every  important respect protects our vital interests. But the real  job is only now beginning for him too because it is his task to  convince the fishing population that it can feel secure that our  responsible management of fish resources in the north will  continue even after the period of transitional arrangements runs  out.    There can be no objections to the agreement. Now that the  final piece is in place we have -- as Prime Minister Gro Harlem  Brundtland has pointed out -- achieved an agreement that  guarantees Norway an equal place in the shaping of Europe's  future. We should therefore seize "this historic opportunity to  take part in the political cooperation on our continent,  alongside our Nordic neighbors."    The prime minister is right when she says that by doing so  we  will be able to achieve greater influence over political  cooperation on employment, the environment, and social security.  And -- no less important -- it is within this community that we  will best be able to defend out foreign and security policy  interests. There can be no doubt that we have a contribution to  make to the shaping of tomorrow's Europe.    But the government should not think that the completion of  the negotiations means that it has done its bit. It is now that  the real work will start, for the prime minister, for the  fisheries minister, and -- for that matter -- for all the others  who are convinced that our future must be based on full  participation in committed European cooperation. For we will  not become members of the EU unless the majority of the  Norwegian people is persuaded -- and persuaded among other  things that membership will "increase our right of  self-determination in relation to the forces that we today have  too little control over."    At the start of the battle for the soul of the Norwegian  people -- for this is what the battle will basically be about --  the prime minister should not entertain hopes that the debate  will be very different from the debate 22 years ago.  Predictions that we are moving toward catastrophe are already  lining themselves up. The more measured evaluations of EU  membership in which many people are putting their faith are not  as yet dominating the debate.    On the one side there are the fundamentalist opponents of EU  membership who claim without reservation that the choice is  between continuing as an independent state or being swallowed up  by a new and monolithic state that is coming into being.  Hopefully the majority will not take this distorted picture of  the committed cooperation among independent states as the gospel  truth. After all, to the very end of the at times extremely  difficult and dramatic negotiations we now have behind us, we  have seen crystal clear examples that show that member states  know how to defend their special interests. This is true of the  negotiations on fisheries issues in particular.    Further confirmation of this is provided by the fact that  the  EU also has to sort out its own internal conflicts and its  voting rules before the Community will be in a position to admit  the four applicants nations that have now completed their  negotiations for membership. Despite the prospect of  forthcoming membership, it still remains to be seen whether the  majority of the Norwegian people will allow themselves to be  persuaded that the EU is something very different from what its  opponents claim it is. This battle can only be won through an  active and accurate information campaign about what we are  actually facing, and about the unique opportunities that are now  emerging.    After all, the view the opponents of EU membership like to  take of things is inaccurate -- that the choice is between  stepping into an unknown future and continuing as if nothing had  happened. The fact is that we applied for membership in part as  a consequence of the fact that our neutral and nonaligned  neighbors applied for membership as a result of a recognition  that it was a completely new Europe that was taking shape after  the demolition of the Berlin wall. We have already had painful  experience of the international trends that have washed over  Norway with full force. In our dealings with the problematic  real world it will be of crucial importance that we are there to  plead our cause when important decisions are to be made.    The most dramatic choice we could make in this new situation  would be to opt to remain outside. It is not difficult to  undertand that people might have wanted a different situation in  Europe. However, the fact is, as Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore  Godal pointed out in Brussels the other night, that all the  other countries of Europe are now taking their bearings in  relation to the EU. Regardless of how many people may emerge as  opponents of the EU, Norway cannot create its own alternative  world. We must relate to the Europe of which we are part when,  after a thorough debate, we go to vote in a referendum.    As far as the timing of the referendum is concerned, we  should take the time we need. An additional consideration is  that what Sweden and Finland do will probably play a decisive  role for the majority of the Norwegian people. The worst thing  that could happen would be that the border between the new  Europe and Norway were to be drawn between Norway and Sweden. A  common date for the referendums in the Nordic countries would  conflict with our national interests.</p>

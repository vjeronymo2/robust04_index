			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Maastricht budget targets prove elusive: Painful surgery is needed as big deficits endanger the EC plan for economic and monetary union THE Maastricht budget deficit targets agreed by the EC in 1991 to pave the way to economic and monetary union (Emu) are proving uncomfortably elusive. With recession and high real interest rates pushing the targets increasingly out of reach, most EC countries look likely to register budget deficits this year of more than 4 per cent of GDP, while their overall public debt ratios will worsen. Budget deficits are booming partly as an automatic effect of recession, which reduces tax revenues and increases social security pay-outs. Countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Italy are still trying to cut the structural component of their deficits by making economies in areas like health care and social security. But three of the four largest EC economies - Germany, France and the UK - appear recently to have switched away from fiscal austerity in a bid to combat recession through increasing expenditure. The Maastricht treaty lays down a number of hurdles to allow countries to qualify for Emu towards the end of the century. Overall government debt should not exceed 60 per cent of GDP, while annual budget deficits should not be more than 3 per cent of GDP. The treaty also sets targets permitting Emu membership only for countries registering good performances on inflation and long-term interest rates. The treaty could allow Emu membership for countries which did not precisely achieve the fiscal targets. But Germany has indicated that only those members which precisely fulfil the targets would be allowed to join. Ironically, Germany itself is being blamed for a good deal of the overshoot. Increasing German budget deficits caused by reunification have been the main reason behind high Bundesbank interest rates - and these have spread recession throughout the EC. 'We are all living in bad times,' says Mr Jean-Paul Betbeze, chief economist at Credit Lyonnais in Paris. 'They have shocks in Germany. And because they are trying to solve this selfishly, we are all bogged down.' Credit Lyonnais is forecasting a French budget deficit of FFr220bn (Pounds 26.73bn) this year - nearly 3 per cent of GDP - based on an assumption of 1.2 per cent growth in the French economy. However, other economists are still more gloomy. The UK merchant bank SG Warburg, forecasting nil growth for the whole of the EC this year, believes the French deficit will be much higher at FFr325bn - 4.5 per cent of GDP. Mr George Magnus, international economist at Warburg, says countries will need 'painful fiscal surgery' as well as a return to much higher growth rates to stay on track for the targets by 1996. Long-term interest rates - which remain high in Europe despite cuts in short-term rates - are a key impediment to necessary budget restructuring, Mr Magnus says. Mr Robin Hubbard, chief economist at Paribas Capital Markets in London, is forecasting a French budget deficit of FFr270bn this year. Governments' inability to stick to a credible Maastricht convergence path 'shows that the Maastricht targets were a bit of a nonsense,' he says. 'The Maastricht targets were laid down at German insistence. But the country that looks like missing all of them at the moment is Germany.' Mr Hans-Peter Frohlich, senior economist at the Cologne-based Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft (IdW), the free market research body, says, 'Germany's chances (of meeting the fiscal targets) are worse than six months ago.' The IdW calculates Germany's overall budget deficit is currently about 5.5 per cent of GDP, including some spending which is not at present in the consolidated government accounts. Economists generally agree that the German government's package of spending cuts and revenue increases unveiled last week make little change to the sources of Germany's structural budget deficits. Indicating lack of longer term success in budget consolidation, the Bonn government is forecasting that the federal budget deficit will more than double by 1995 and 1996 compared with previous optimistic forecasts in June 1992. Experts at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris admit that their relatively sanguine forecasts published last month for 1993 budget deficits have now been overtaken by events. The forecasts were based on assumptions of German 1993 growth of 1.2 per cent, whereas the Bonn Economics Ministry has now officially stated it expects zero growth for unified Germany this year. As a rough rule, the OECD believes that, for every 1 percentage point fall in economic growth, budget deficits throughout the EC rise by 0.4 to 0.5 percentage points. This indicates that, by the end of the year, there will be still more red ink for governments to mop up. The Maastricht fiscal targets are designed to be met in 1996 or, failing that, 1998 as a condition for moving to a single currency. Returning to the Maastricht convergence path later this decade is not impossible. But it will require painful fiscal policy changes, combined with a return to much higher EC growth rates than are likely for 1993 and 1994. UK tax increases, Page 8</p>

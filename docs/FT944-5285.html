			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Swiss back curb on drug dealers Swiss citizens yesterday voted massively in support of a law making it easier to detain immigrant drug dealers who pose as asylum seekers. Religious and left-wing groups opposed the law's tough sanctions as infringements of human rights. They also feared it would foment anti-immigrant sentiment. But Swiss have been disturbed recently by the sight of misery at Zurich's open drug scene, rising violent crime and a threat from Lebanese dealers last August to start a bombing campaign in the city. Nearly three-quarters of those who voted supported the law. There were majorities in every canton, big ones everywhere except in Geneva. The law is aimed at stopping foreign drug dealers from taking advantage of the asylum law. Typically, these dealers throw their passports away after entering the country. Then they apply for political asylum and proceed to deal. If they are caught, the police can detain them only for 30 days. If their applications for asylum are still under consideration, they cannot easily be deported. When they finally do leave, relatives or friends replace them. The new law allows for detention of any foreigner found without identification for three months, and for a further nine months if he appeals against a deportation order. If the person is believed to constitute a threat to law and order, he can be ordered to keep away from specified areas. The new law is one of several measures which has been taken in the past three months following a radical reversal of Zurich's liberal policy towards its large drug addict community.</p>

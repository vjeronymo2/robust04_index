			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Still on an even keel: The City's reaction to the new chancellor The mud and vitriol flying around Westminster this week have failed to upset the City of London. Whatever the criticisms of John Major and his government by Norman Lamont, sterling has stayed steady and the stock market has edged up. For all the confusion over the policies of the new chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, who at times this week has seemed on the brink of a dangerous policy of dashing for growth, long-dated gilt-edged yields have been edging lower, perhaps implying growing confidence on the part of investors. Alternatively, UK government bonds may simply have been moving in line with a firmer trend across Europe, and ignoring local upsets. 'People aren't sure whether this week's events matter. The UK government has long been perceived as being quite weak,' says Michael Saunders of Salomon Bros. A minor flurry of speculation over interest rates has subsided. 'Lamont's remarks will make it more difficult for Clarke to cut interest rates,' says Roger Bootle, chief economist of Midland Bank. He argues that a rate change would now have to be solidly justified by economic evidence - for instance, slow monetary growth and a faltering recovery - rather than by political convenience (which Lamont implied had motivated the last cut on January 26). David Shaw, who heads investment strategy at one of the biggest life assurance groups, Legal &amp; General, says the key decisions may not be made until the autumn. 'We are worried that the emphasis will be on public spending cuts rather than tax increases,' he says. In the meantime, however, 'nothing much will change for several months'. The City expects a quiet period while Clarke masters his brief. So although he is about to make a big speech at the Lord Mayor's Guildhall dinner on Tuesday, an event at which the chancellor normally discusses the technicalities of funding policy and monetary strategy, tension is low. 'I don't think it is realistic to expect anything very new,' says Kevin Adams, UK bond strategist at the leading government bond house, Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Despite all the initial speculation that Clarke might overthrow the discredited Treasury advisers and strike out afresh, beginning with cuts in short-term interest rates, the markets have quickly come to a more conservative judgment. Since Clarke was appointed on May 27, short-term sterling interest rates have tracked sideways and, although the sterling exchange rate index initially eased a little, this week it has been rallying. Demand for sterling bonds has also picked up. 'Gilts have ignored everything this week,' comments Robert Thomas, head of research at NatWest Capital Markets. 'The government is pretty well hemmed in. It's less likely now that we will have an interest rate cut.' Investors elsewhere in Europe are now being attracted into sterling bonds by high interest rate differentials. Not only are they buying gilts, but some hefty corporate bond issues, including Pounds 250m from British Gas and Pounds 150m from Marks and Spencer, have been mopped up within the past few days. 'The Germans are becoming quite enthusiastic about gilts,' notes Stephen Lewis of London Bond Broking. The markets, he says, have been comforted by the warnings of Eddie George, who becomes governor of the Bank of England next month, that interest rates should not be cut at present. Mr Lewis comments that the City was not sorry to see Lamont go. Clarke, as he juggles growth rates against interest rates and fiscal deficits, is for now in a position to be 'all things to all men'.</p>

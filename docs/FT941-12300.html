			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Groups examine Ferranti businesses About eight companies from the UK, France and the US have emerged as serious candidates to take over the bulk of Ferranti International's defence electronics operations. Ferranti's administrative receivers have drawn up a short-list of companies which have expressed interest in acquiring 70 per cent or more of the collapsed group which has been in receivership since early December when the General Electric Company withdrew a 1p-a-share rescue bid. The list, compiled by Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot, the administrative receivers from Arthur Andersen, is understood to include GEC, British Aerospace, Thorn EMI and Thomson-CSF of France. The list of potential corporate purchasers is also believed to include one other French defence concern and two US companies. A team of seven Ferranti managers, led by Mr Phil Burton, Ferranti's director of marketing, is also preparing a bid for most of the Ferranti operations. Last week the management team began seeking equity finance to back either a full management and employee buy-out, or the management/employee element of a consortium bid in conjunction with a corporate partner from the UK or overseas. The Ministry of Defence would not stand in the way of either a corporate or a consortium bid and has indicated that it would not raise competition objections. However, in the event of a French bid it is likely that the MoD would seek a joint-venture solution with a British partner. Thomson-CSF already has first refusal rights on the 50 per cent it does not already own in the profitable Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems UK joint venture, which is not affected by the receivership. It is believed to be close to a deal to sell the additional shareholding on to GEC. Such a move would satisfy the MoD which wants to see a 50 per cent British share maintained in the joint venture company since it regards sonar technology as crucial to national security.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / McDonald's fights 'poisoning' claim The McDonald's fast food chain yesterday asked the High Court in London to halt a campaign by environmentalists accusing it of poisoning customers, exploiting Third World countries and employing cheap labour. A leaflet distributed four years ago contained a 'wholesale attack on almost every aspect of McDonald's business', said Mr Richard Rampton QC. It was 'completely false in every material respect', he told Mr Justice Bell at the start of a libel action expected to run for up to four months. Yet London-based environmental campaigners Mr Dave Morris and Ms Helen Steel had published, as recently as the day before, material repeating the allegations. McDonald's, said Mr Rampton, was seeking to protect its reputation for 'uniform excellence' in the quality of its products, the well-being of its customers, the welfare of employees and respect for communities and the environment. Mr Rampton was explaining why the world's biggest food service organisation, with 14,000 restaurants in 70 countries, was pressing ahead with its action. Mr Morris, 39, and Ms Steel, 28, who say their allegations are justified, are unwaged and conducting their own defence because they cannot afford lawyers. Legal aid is not available in libel actions. They are members of the London Greenpeace group, which has no connection with Greenpeace International. McDonald's has no prospect of recovering more than nominal damages or its legal costs, which could run to more than Pounds 1m. Mr Rampton made clear that the main purpose of the action was to secure an injunction banning them from repeating their allegations. Mr Rampton said the allegations in the 'malicious' leaflet - entitled 'What's Wrong with McDonald's? Everything They Don't Want You to Know' - had begun to appear with alarming frequency in the 'respectable media', both nationally and locally. The case is being heard without a jury because the courts have ruled that the issues require careful and prolonged examination of complex scientific evidence culminating in a reasoned judgment. Mr Rampton said the dispute was not about freedom of speech because the freedom laws did not extend to the dissemination of falsehoods about other people. 'There may well be people who don't like McDonald's food, either because it is made from meat or because they don't like the taste, and they may wish to give expression to their views, sometimes in strong terms,' he said. 'McDonald's may not like it, but would not try to stop honest criticism. What they will always seek to prevent is the dissemination of false factual information about the company, its business and its products.' The hearing continues today when the defendants will outline their case.</p>

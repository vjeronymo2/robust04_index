			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Damir Gaynutdinov under the rubric "The </F> Authorities and the Press": "Dare Not To Have an Opinion--Vice  Governor Igor Lebedinets Demanded of our UTRO ROSSII  Correspondent"]    [Text] From now on, esteemed reader, there will be no  reports from teleconferences of the extraordinary commission for  kray heat supply, which used to be published on Wednesdays and  Saturdays under the rubric "Winter Problems." Not because with  the advent of spring these problems have disappeared overnight.  It is simply that Igor Petrovich, our chief troubleshooter  everywhere, forbade me to attend these events from now on. Not  for the first time, though.    Back in December he was very unhappy over the item "Where  Did  the Firewood Come From?" in which the author made no secret of  reports from Khorol officials that because of coal shortages in  rayon villages, people were chopping down the woods. This was a  misstep, as the "Cheka" [extraordinary commission] chairman  explained to me the next time we met. Instead of mobilizing  people to struggle against adversity, the way it used to be  during the times of agitation and propaganda and party committee  press departments, it turns out that I, in Lebedinets' opinion,  had demoralized the workers. It somehow does not occur to Igor  Petrovich that only the truth can mobilize people, including the  kray leadership, toward liquidation of the fuel crisis. The  Khorol leadership has rung enough alarms by then.    The most entertaining part at the time was Igor Petrovich's  accusation that both I personally and UTRO ROSSII are doing  everything possible to make things worse... for President  Yeltsin. I have to confess that sometimes I disagree with the  actions of Boris Nikolayevich--who during his visit to  Vladivostok gave his blessing to the publication of our  newspaper--which should be a normal thing in a law-based state  and a democratic society. But Igor Petrovich himself developed  an affinity for Yeltsin only when he ascended to this  administrative job. As I recall, he had none of that affinity  during his time in the communist faction of the kray soviet,  which he headed.    Whatever--the result was that he banned me from attending  the  conferences then, but later relented after M. Savchenko,  chairman of the kray administration committee for housing and  municipal services, said publicly (this is how you discover  people's mettle even in our democratic times) that I do write  objectively.    On 5 March, however, Mikhail Lvovich sensibly remained  silent, having decided that to keep trying to educate and teach  Igor Petrovich is like trying to cure a dead man. Here is what  happened.    Not a single teleconference passes without a reminder of the  money owed to the energy sector. All the rayons and cities are  in this debt up to their ears. All of them Igor Petrovich treats  with benevolence and understanding, however, but as soon as it  comes to Vladivostok he literally goes into a fit of rage. This  time what prompted his outburst was that I do not get upset and  treat Vladivostok like every other place. My especially  dangerous fault was that I did not write that one of the causes  of our common shivering this winter was the fact that V.  Cherepkov allocated money to start the BOLSHOY VLADIVOSTOK  newspaper.    "Why do you not write about that?" the vice governor said,  looking as if he were spoiling for a fistfight.    I explained to him that then I would have to write that  millions of taxpayer rubles are allocated by the kray  administration to KRASNOYE ZNAMYA and NOVOSTI, as well as by  local authorities to all rayon and city newspapers. Is this a  solution to the heating and power problem?    "A demagogue," was the label slapped on me this time. Kray  party committee ideologist Antokhin once called me a rebel;  another party secretary, Kharchev, suggested that I decide for  myself whether I was for the Soviet power or not. It turned out  that the way he saw it, I was against it. And now another kray  zealot of propaganda customs, without doubting for a moment...    There are many people in the kray who have known both Igor  Petrovich and myself for many years. Since he got his education  as a part-time student, I will remind our mutual  acquaintances--as food for thought--of the meaning of one word.    DEMAGOGUERY (demogogia in Greek, from demos--people and  ago--lead)--deception through intentional distortion of facts,  false promises, and flattery; hypocritical pandering to the  taste of the less educated part of the masses in order to  achieve political goals.    I really cannot accept such a characteristic of myself. As  to  I. Lebedinets, who calls journalists "slimeballs"--I do not  know...    Watching Igor Petrovich in his capacity as de facto first  vice governor, I cannot help recalling his namesake and  predecessor Igor Chernyanskiy. He was rakishly rough, but while  holding this job he did not stoop to pettiness and  vindictiveness.    "I want to understand, looking from the position of an  elephant (meaning his job of great responsibility--D.G.) why I  am being barked at, even if I am not aware of it," he said once.    I think it is time for Igor Petrovich to grow to fill this  job rather than staying in the old position he is accustomed to.    Actually, he is not as insignificant as some may think or  imagine. If I am asked some time in the future who Ye.  Nazdratenko was, I will say he was Maritime Kray governor during  Lebedinets' time.</p>

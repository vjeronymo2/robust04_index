			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sarajevo, 6 Apr (TANJUG) -- British General  Michael Rose, commander of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  forces in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, has postponed his visit  to Gorazde because of bad weather and the snow which has been  falling for 10 hours now in the area of Romanija and eastern  Bosnia.    The decision to postpone the visit was made after today's  brief meeting between Rose and Ratko Mladic, commander in chief  of the army of the Srpska republic, in Pale.    At the same time, it was agreed that the team of military  experts in Gorazde be strengthened by a further nine officers of  the international forces.    After his meeting with Mladic, Gen. Rose went to the Muslim  part of Sarajevo. [passage omitted]</p>

Yesterday's hunt was focused on Ravensthorpe in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, where a house was under continuous surveillance although neighbours said the occupant was in Portugal. One clue is that the winner is the 1,500th richest person in the UK, according to BusinessAge Magazine - which likes to think of itself as Britain's answer to Forbes magazine, the self-styled capitalist tool. Unnaturally, the erratic mag failed for once to name the lucky winner.</p>

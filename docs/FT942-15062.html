			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Bank was warned of crisis at Schneider Deutsche Bank, the biggest creditor to the bankrupt Jurgen Schneider property group, was told about the impending crisis at the privately-owned company four days before the group's difficulties were made public last week. Mr Hellmut Hartmann, chief press spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said yesterday that Mr Jurgen Schneider, the property developer who built up the group that bears his name, wrote to a member of the bank's board saying that on medical advice he had had to travel to an unknown destination and give up day-to-day responsibility for managing the business. The letter highlights the closeness of Germany's biggest bank to the failed property developer. Deutsche is thought to be owed DM1.2bn (Pounds 480m) by Schneider out of a total of at least DM5bn owed to more than 40 bank creditors. Tradesmen and small businessmen are owed another DM250m. The group's remaining cash resources were estimated at just DM5m when Jurgen Schneider AG, the holding company at the heart of the group, filed for bankruptcy last Friday. In the long letter, Mr Schneider asked Mr Ulrich Weiss of Deutsche Bank to provide further cash for the company in his absence and if necessary to wind up the property group's affairs in an orderly way. The letter arrived at Deutsche's headquarters in Frankfurt by special messenger on April 7. Speculation continues about Mr Schneider's whereabouts, with suggestions that he has fled to either Iran or Florida. After receiving the letter, the bank quickly started talks with Jurgen Schneider AG officials. After those discussions, the bank rejected the request for further finance on April 10. The difficulties of the group were made public late last Monday. Three days later Deutsche Bank sued Mr Schneider, in his absence, alleging fraud. Deutsche has insisted that it was not the company's 'house bank'.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / People: Robb steps back from Aberdeen Trust George Robb, one of the founders of the small and aggressive fund management company Aberdeen Trust, is stepping down as executive chairman, but remaining on the board as a non-executive director. The group, which has suffered, particularly earlier in the year, from the weak dollar, has seen its share price drop from 60p in March 1991 when it joined the stock exchange, to a low of 24p this year. Currently with around Pounds 1.6bn of funds under management, the company's transaction-driven expansionist strategy has not been without its detractors. 'George Robb has felt for some time that what interests him most is building companies,' says chief executive Martin Gilbert, 'whereas now we have entered a consolidation phase. We need to pay attention to becoming more client-orientated.' Whereas the company has been strong in Far Eastern emerging markets and UK smaller companies, it has lagged in other areas, notably continental Europe. Another catalyst for the change in emphasis has been the purchase of Century life assurance group in September, which added around Pounds 450m in new funds to manage as well as affording access to a direct sales force. 'It is going to be an enormous amount of work integrating Century,' Gilbert believes. Robb, 50, and Gilbert, 37, founded the business in 1983 as a management buyout from a firm of Aberdeen solicitors, Brander &amp; Cruickshank, where Robb was a partner in the investment management department and Gilbert was his assistant. Robb took over as executive chairman at the time of the stock market listing. 'Since becoming chairman, I found there was a decreasing amount to occupy me. It was a miscalculation on my part,' Robb, who was previously chief executive, now admits. 'It was a good time to make a break.' He is looking for other opportunities, not necessarily within fund management. Among a number of other outside directorships he is on the board of Aberdeen Petroleum, a USM company which he helped establish in 1981. Meanwhile, Angus Pelham Burn, 61, takes over as non-executive chairman. A well-known figure in the Scottish financial community, Pelham Burn has been a director of Aberdeen Trust since 1985. He is also a non-executive director of the Bank of Scotland and a member of Grampian regional council. ***** Alastair Ross Goobey, James Capel's chief investment strategist and author of one of the livelier weekly investment newsletters, has decided to practise what he preaches. Next month he takes over as chief executive of PosTel Investment Management, Britain's second biggest pension fund manager. Goobey, 47, is only the third chief executive to look after the Pounds 20bn of pension fund money of British Telecom and the Post Office. He takes over from former Bank of England man Alan Threadgold, who in turn took over from Ralph Quartano. Although Ross Goobey has made his name recently as James Capel's investment guru and a special political adviser to the chancellor of the exchequer, he has earned his spurs as fund manager. Before becoming a stockbroker, he had been a director of Geoffrey Morley &amp; Partners, independent pension fund managers, and before that had managed the Courtaulds pension fund. Although part of his job at PosTel, which has 160 staff, will be administrative, Ross Goobey will also be director of securities investment.</p>

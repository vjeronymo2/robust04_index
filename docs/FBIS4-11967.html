			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by media affairs correspondent 'Irit Rosenblum] </F>   [Text] A poll conducted by the New Channel 2 Television  Network shows that 50.3 percent of the public are generally  satisfied with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin while 49.7 percent  are dissatisfied. The number of interviewees completely  dissatisfied with the prime minister is almost double those who  think Rabin's performance is very good -- 26.2 percent compared  with 14.3 percent.    The questions which asked were: 1. Are you satisfied or  dissatisfied with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin? What grade  would you give Rabin as prime minister? (very good, quite good,  not so good, bad).    2. What grade would you give the prime minister for his  handling of each of the following issues: advancing peace and  the negotiations with the Arabs; foreign and defense policy;  the economy; social welfare. (very good, quite good, not so  good, bad).    The prime minister received a "very good" grade from 14.3  percent of the interviewees, "quite good" from 32.7 percent,  "not so good" from 20.3 percent, "bad" from 26.2 percent. Some  6.5 percent did not have any opinion.    A total of all those with good opinions about Rabin's  performance reached 50.3 percent while a total of those with  negative opinions was 49.7 percent. On the issue of advancing  peace and negotiations with the Arabs, 46.6 percent expressed  satisfaction and 53.4 percent had a negative stand. On foreign  and defense policy, 52.6 percent supported his actions and 47.4  percent rejected them. On economic issues: 49.7 percent had  positive thoughts while 50.3 percent expressed negative views.  On social welfare issues: 47.6 percent gave the prime minister  positive grades while 52.4 percent gave him negative grades.  These data show that overall satisfaction with the prime  minister is higher than when his performance is divided up into  specific areas.    The poll also studied the interviewees according to changing  variants. Among the women, 48.1 percent had positive views on  Rabin and 51.9 percent had negative views. Among the men, 52.7  percent had positive opinions and 47.3 percent had negative  views. Among young people, Rabin supporters numbered 42.9  percent and those who rejected him 57.1 percent; among middle  aged people, 51.8 percent supported him and 88.2 percent opposed  him; Rabin had most support among the elderly, 56.3 percent,  compared with 43.7 percent who oppose him. That means that  women and young people are more critical of Rabin than middle  aged and elderly men.    Support for Rabin was also divided up according to  geographic  areas. Most of the support came from the north (Haifa,  kibbutzim, Arab areas) where the rate of support was 60.4  percent and the opposition is 39.6 percent. In the center of  the country, 52.8 percent supported Rabin, compared to 47.2  percent who did not; and in the south it was the opposite, 47.2  percent supported him compared to 52.8 percent who did not.  Jerusalem is opposed to Rabin, according to the survey: 64.3  percent are dissatisfied compared to 35.7 percent who are  satisfied (the poll apparently did not include East Jerusalem  residents).    The poll encompassed a representative sample of 1,006  people,  men and women from the age of 18. It was held in the second  half of May 1994 through telephone interviews from the Teleseqer  Institute in Ramat Gan. The margin of statistical error can  reach 3 percent.</p>

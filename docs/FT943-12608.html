			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: United in mediocrity - Giles MacDonogh visits Ulster - Eating Out Northern Ireland is worth it. It has some spectacularly beautiful stretches of countryside and in some parts, at least, it has all the charm and warm-heartedness more usually associated with the Republic. Even after a vicious terrorist campaign aimed at the historic centres of Ulster's county towns, much of it is unspoiled. 'The Troubles' are still very localised. With a name like mine, I am naturally disposed to like Ireland; and Ulster is very much Ireland. On the other hand I am not blind to the drawbacks. One of these is food. When it comes to food, the dream of unity has already been accomplished: you may eat badly from Ballydehob in County Cork, to Ballycastle in County Antrim. Things are, however, getting better on both sides of the frontier. Ulster has two famous restaurants. In the holiday town of Portrush there is Ramore and in Belfast there is Roscoff. I have not eaten at Ramore for more than five years, so I shall forbear from comment. Roscoff, Ulster's only Michelin-starred restaurant, I have visited more recently. Its location came as something of a surprise: it is right in the middle of Belfast where it is popular with British journalists on Ulster postings. It is keenly priced and busy; with its vaguely nautical decoration it looks a bit like a sea-side brasserie. The food is described as Franco-Californian, but it is rather more of the latter than the former. Rather Californian was the 'seared beef with celery, Parmesan and truffle oil' which I enjoyed; less so were the 'sauteed sweetbreads, with fresh pasta, bacon and roast garlic', which I did not. It was a fussy dish and the sweetbreads were overcooked and over-salted. A chestnut and amaretti souffle proved a little dull, but Paul Rankin, the chef, was away that day, and I am prepared to believe that the cooking would have been more precise had he been around. In the province they will tell you that Rankin has done much to encourage small producers of quality raw materials. One supplier he has patronised is McCartney's in Moira, County Down. George and Gordon McCartney are prize-winning sausage makers with a list of 31 specialities running from lamb with mint to pork with banana. I am happy to say I have not had the banana sausage, but I have eaten a delicious pork and leek sausage as well as an excellent beef and Guinness. The McCartneys refuse to countenance sales from anywhere other than their shop; which is fine if you live in Belfast, which is only half an hour away by car. Here in London it seems a pity. The McCartneys use pork from a couple of local farms and superb Ulster lamb. At the Portaferry Hotel in Portaferry I had wonderfully flavoured lamb from the Mourne Mountains, while on the Antrim coast the lambs graze on salt meadows as fine as any in Normandy. Sadly no initiative is made to market this meat and in most Ulster restaurants there is an unfortunate tendency to smother the meat in old-fashioned fruit sauces. A similar lack of initiative has blighted Ulster cheese. In the Londonderry Arms, in Carnlough, I was told that the local farmers' wives had abandoned cheese and butter-making in the interests of 'liberation'. I don't know if this is true, but if it is, liberation would seem to be a high price to pay. Ulster used to have three farmhouse cheeses, but these are, as I was told, 'all more or less defunct'. There is a serviceable cheddar from Coleraine and a horrid Limeswold lookalike called Bally Blue. Bally Blue indeed. Beer from Ulster's one independent brewer, Hilden, proved impossible to find, even in the Crown Liquor Saloon. The Crown is one of the best preserved Victorian pubs in Britain: a remarkable achievement for a building opposite the Europa Hotel in Belfast. Belfast gin was almost as hard to find. Again this is a pity. It is a nice lemony drop, and rather better than a lot of the better-known brands. On the other hand, there was no shortage of Bushmills' whiskey, County Antrim's most famous product. Ulstermen are proud of their breakfast 'fry', but this too is something to approach with caution. Neither the sample produced at the Culloden Hotel in Holywood, nor the Galgorm Manor, near Ballymena, proved authentic: the sausages were in synthetic casings (unlike McCartneys'), there was no black pudding and the sausages had been grilled] The grilling was justified on grounds of health - something which seems absurd. There is no such thing as a healthy fry. On my return to London I dropped in on Richard Corrigan's new restaurant in Fulham Road. Here is an Irishman cooking superb meals by sagely adapting the earthy flavours of his mother country: wonderful ravioli of suckling pig; delicious faggots culled from every imaginable part of the pig's head; crubbeens (pigs' trotters) and sensational black pudding. Where are the Corrigans of Ulster? Or is it true that no man is a prophet in his own land?

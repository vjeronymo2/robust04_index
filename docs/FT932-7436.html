			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Rises 'higher' in small companies THE SMALLEST and largest companies gave their managers and directors the highest pay rises last year, research published today by the Institute of Management shows. Managers and directors of companies with a turnover of less than Pounds 25m had an average 6.6 per cent increase in the 12 months to January. Other institute studies have shown that those working in companies with a turnover of Pounds 25m to Pounds 125m had average rise of 5.5 per cent last year. Those in companies with a turnover of Pounds 125m-Pounds 600m received 5.1 per cent. In the largest companies - above Pounds 600m - the trend reverses, with managers getting increases averaging 7.2 per cent and directors 8.6 per cent. According to the latest study, in businesses with a turnover of less than Pounds 25m the average manager now earns Pounds 27,504 and the average director Pounds 50,803. The survey, covering nearly 2,500 people in 127 companies, was carried out by Remuneration Economics, the pay research group. Women directors fared significantly worse last year than their male counterparts. Women's earnings increased by just 2.9 per cent, compared with 7 per cent for men. The gap between male and female managers' increases was smaller - women had 6.4 per cent and men 6.5 per cent. Large regional differences were highlighted by the survey. In central London smaller businesses average pay for managers is Pounds 34,383 and for directors Pounds 60,121. Managers in the south-west and Wales receive Pounds 22,270, and directors Pounds 43,435. Mr Roger Young, the institute's director, said smaller companies were catching up on pay after holding back for the past five years. 'The more companies have delayered, the more responsibility has been taken by those managers who have been left,' said Mr Young. Companies have had to give above-average increases to remaining managers to 'build up morale', he added. The survey found the best-paid executives in smaller businesses worked in computing, telecommunications and marketing. The worst-paid were in production, distribution, personnel, and research and development. April pay deals confirm the downward trend in settlement levels, according to the research group Incomes Data Services. Three quarters of the increases monitored in April were worth 1.5 per cent to 3.9 per cent. Pay had been frozen in one case in 10. The Smaller Business Review.

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Better margins downstream help lift net at Texaco Texaco, the US oil group, recorded a jump in profit margins in its downstream refining and marketing operations in the final three months of last year, in part offsetting the effects of a sharp drop in world oil prices. Amoco, meanwhile, failed to receive a boost to downstream earnings, though a steady improvement in its chemicals business helped to make up for some of the fall in upstream profits. At Texaco, upstream exploration and production earnings fell by more than half during the period, to Dollars 150m from Dollars 352m a year before, as the price of oil plummetted on world markets. However, downstream operations, which benefit from cheaper oil, reported a rise in operating earnings, from Dollars 139m to Dollars 220m. The result, after special charges and tax adjustments, was net income for the period of Dollars 339m, or Dollars 1.21 a share, compared with Dollars 313m, or Dollars 1.11. After-tax earnings for the year as whole were Dollars 1.1bn, up from Dollars 712m, after a number of one-off items. Before special factors, net income rose by only Dollars 6m, to Dollars 1.13bn. The results reflect 'strong operational performance in the face of crude oil prices which weakened significantly in the third and fourth quarters, and which remain depressed,' said Mr Alfred DeCrade, chairman and chief executive. Amoco reported a fall in upstream earnings in the fourth quarter to Dollars 215m, from Dollars 429m the year before. This was before taking into account a Dollars 120m gain in the latest period from the sale of part of Crestar Energy. Refining, marketing and transportation earnings reached Dollars 259m - buoyed by a Dollars 50m gain from reductions in inventory - from Dollars 202m at the end of 1992. Chemicals, on the other hand, saw a further improvement on the back of higher sales and the benefits from earlier cost-cutting. Net income rose to Dollars 83m from Dollars 18m. For the quarter as a whole, after one-off items, net income rose to Dollars 584m, or Dollars 1.17, from Dollars 548m, or Dollars 1.10, a year earlier. The 1993 net income rose to Dollars 1.8bn, against Dollars 850m, before accounting changes, last time.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS REJECT PLAN FOR MORE MEDFLY TRAPPING SITES;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE: STATE PROPOSAL MIGHT HAVE RESULTED IN MORE MALATHION SPRAYING,  THEY FEAR.  </P> <P> Afraid to do anything that could trigger new rounds of aerial malathion  spraying, county supervisors ignored the advice of scientists Tuesday and  rejected a state plan to double the number of Medfly trapping locations in  parts of the county.  </P> <P> State officials had argued that they could more quickly detect Mediterranean  fruit fly infestations by rotating existing traps more often and splitting up  pairs of traps to double the number of locations with at least one.  </P> <P> But Supervisors Roger R. Stanton and Harriett M. Wieder, whose North County  districts were most heavily hit by malathion spraying last winter and spring,  complained that the proposal would have made a test case of Orange County and  might have subjected residents here to more rounds of spraying.  </P> <P> "I don't see a logic to increasing the probability . . . of finding a new fly  out there," said Stanton, who led the move to reject the proposal. "I really  have found no cogent reason at all to support this program."  </P> <P> In response, state Medfly experts accused the supervisors of playing politics  with the problem and said the action could actually worsen the chances of  heading off a major infestation.  </P> <P> "It sounds to me like a bury-your-head-in-the-sand approach," said James Carey,  an associate professor of entomology at UC Davis and a member of the state's  Medfly advisory panel. "The whole point of trapping is to find the fly  population so that you can surgically remove them. . . . You can use a rifle  instead of a shotgun."  </P> <P> Because the proposal would have amended an existing county contract, four  supervisors would have had to favor it. But only three did, with Stanton and  Wieder opposed. As a result of the board action, the number of trapping  locations in Orange County will be reduced as planned at the end of this month.  There are currently about 6,000 traps in Orange County, about 4,500 of which  are overseen by the state, Agricultural Commissioner James D. Harnett said.  </P> <P> The vast majority of those will be taken out by the state within the next few  weeks, he added, now that the Medfly infestation that hit the county earlier  this year appears to have passed.  </P> <P> Harnett would not criticize the board for its vote but said he brought the  proposal to the supervisors because "we thought from a professional standpoint  that it might be a good idea to do this."  </P> <P> "Obviously, what was presented was not comfortable to them at this time. It  seemed to me that there were other things afoot than just the logic of the  issue."  </P> <P> Gera Curry, information officer for the California Department of Food and  Agriculture, was more outspoken. "I'm stunned," said Curry, who accused Wieder  and Stanton of putting politics ahead of science in the Medfly battle.  </P> <P> "We think that it's unfortunate that some members of the board politicized this  issue," Curry said. "I can't argue with the premise that if you don't look, you  don't find, but early detection is what can prevent a wider spray area. It's an  early warning system."  </P> <P> Some of those concerns were raised during the board meeting, as Supervisor  Thomas F. Riley voiced his support for the trapping proposal.  </P> <P> "Preparedness is a better way to be than to be surprised," Riley said.  </P> <P> Wieder questioned Harnett closely about the proposal, asking the commissioner  whether other counties were participating in the program and questioning  whether Orange County is already living up to its contract with the state on  placing traps.  </P> <P> Harnett acknowledged that the county is abiding by that contract and said the  state's proposal would mark the first time that a county split its traps or  rotated them more often. Orange County was picked, Harnett said, because it is  an urban county squarely within the hazard zone for Medfly infestation.  </P> <P> If the pilot program succeeded in capturing more Medflies, Harnett said, the  new method of trapping would be extended to other areas as well.  </P> <P> At the conclusion of their exchange, however, Wieder said she was not satisfied  that the county should agree to the proposal. "Your answers haven't convinced  me," she told Harnett. "Why are we being such heroes?"  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Less than a week into his  term as Japan's new prime minister, Tsutomu Hata left Tokyo on  Monday [2 May] for an official visit to Italy, France, Germany  and Belgium.    Hata aims to establish personal rapport with European  leaders  ahead of the July summit in Naples, Italy, of the Group of Seven  (G- 7) major industrialized nations, Foreign Ministry officials  said.    The visit should also serve to strengthen political ties  between Japan and the European Union, they said.    The trip was originally scheduled for January by then Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, but was postponed until May due to  tight domestic political schedules. [passage omitted on  previously filed material]    It is extremely rare for a Japanese premier to leave the  country so early into his term -- a mere five days in Hata's  case.    Hata, who was elected prime minister by the Diet on April  25,  inaugurated a minority cabinet Thursday following the withdrawal  of a key coalition ally, the Social Democratic Party.</p>

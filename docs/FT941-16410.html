			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Bonn still hopeful as GDP falls 1.9% The west German economy contracted by 1.9 per cent in 1993, the sharpest drop in gross domestic product since the second world war, according to the federal statistics office. GDP for the whole country fell by 1.3 per cent last year, down from a growth rate of 2.1 per cent in 1992. The recession in western Germany had an impact on the eastern part of the country, which accounts for 7 per cent of the economy. Eastern Germany's GDP rose by 6.3 per cent in 1993, after growing by 7.7 per cent the previous year. Officials at the statistics office said the 1993 drop in GDP was 'dramatic' but it came from 'a very high point' following two years of boom after reunification in 1990. The figures support estimates by the government, which revised its forecast downwards in December and predicted a 2 per cent GDP fall for western Germany. In October, the economics minister still expected a more modest drop of 1.5 per cent. The economics ministry in Bonn yesterday refused to comment as detailed figures, including fourth-quarter GDP, will only be published officially today. But government officials said the fourth quarter would continue to mark the improvement recorded in the previous two quarters. West Germany's GDP grew by 0.5 per cent in each of the second and third quarters after a 3.4 per cent drop in the first three months of the year. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, recently said Germany could look forward to growth in 1994 of between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent. But pessimism prevails among independent advisers, (the so-called five wise men) who see zero growth for 1994 due to lagging domestic demand and delayed investments. Ifo and DIW, two leading economic institutes, last week called on the Bundesbank to further lower short-term interest rates to ensure sustainable growth. Both institutes are warning that the modest improvement in the economy could be short-lived unless better investment conditions are offered to enterprises.</p>

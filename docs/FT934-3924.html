			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: Asset innovation - Legal briefs Britain's first public securitisation of a commercial mortgage book, valued at Pounds 167m, has just been completed by City solicitors Cameron Markby Hewitt for UCB Bank. The mortgage assets - secure loans from UCB on residential care homes and nursing homes - will be purchased from the bank by a newly-formed company, Healthcare Operators Group 1. Healthcare Operators will finance the acquisition by raising funds against the security of the assets, with any risk on the assets transferred to the issuer. Cameron Markby says the financing structure overcomes legal, tax and regulatory problems which have prevented securitisation of commercial (as opposed to residential) mortgage assets in the past.</p>

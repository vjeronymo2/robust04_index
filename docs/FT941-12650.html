			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): Asia Pacific may not be able to defy gravity What goes up must come down. An increasing number of investors are becoming aware of the fact that Asian markets, many of which hit record highs last year, may not be able to defy the forces of gravity, writes Emiko Terazono, in Tokyo. The case for investing in emerging markets in Asia has been demonstrated by the rapid economic growth of the south-east Asian region and China, and increasing liquidity due to low interest rates and capital inflows from overseas investors. But, as markets such as Manila rose 151 per cent and Hong Kong 118 per cent last year, cautiousness over the increased speculation in the markets has started to prevail. The boost during the last quarter of 1993 was provided by foreign fund managers, especially from the US and Japan. Baring Securities estimates that last year, a total of Dollars 38bn flowed into emerging markets in the Pacific Rim and Latin America - double the figure for 1992. It predicts that Dollars 45bn will flow to such markets this year, but sees US investors switching towards Latin America. The bottoming out of interest rates in the US points to similar circumstances in many south-east Asian countries, where rates move in tandem with the US. Investors may want to bet on further growth potential in the region, but they will need to keep in mind the fact that the risk of a correction looms. Many analysts are downbeat on Malaysia, which, in terms of valuation, has become the most expensive market in Asia, excluding Japan. However, political developments may help to support stock prices, as the government is likely to try and maintain an active stock market if it chooses to hold an early election. Investors in the Hong Kong market will need to weigh the risks of an overheating Chinese economy and an expected wave of capital inflows from the west and Japan. Meanwhile, the attractiveness of Manila will depend upon whether the electricity porducers can solve the power crisis, and whether the economy can post a firm recovery. Thailand, which rose 90 per cent last year, may be threatened with a rise in inflationary pressures in the near term. While the economy remains strong, with firm business confidence and consumption, the central bank has warned that it will impose a tougher monetary policy this year in order to control overheated inflation. This could potentially hurt liquidity flows. An increasing number of investors are starting to focus on laggard markets in the region, namely Japan and South Korea. Expectations of economic recovery in Japan, which underperformed, relative to Asia, last year, have started to attract an inflow of overseas funds. A weakening yen will also help corporate profits, along with fiscal stimulus and a substantial cut in income tax. South Korea has increased its competitiveness as a result of last year's spurt in the yen, and share prices are expected to be supported by continued economic growth. The Taiwan market, which gained 74 per cent last year, currently stands at about a third of its peak in 1990, and is also favoured due to expectations of lower interest rates. So where ought investors to be looking to place funds in Asia? 'On a risk reward basis, it's Japan,' says Mr Geoffrey Barker, at Baring Securities, in Tokyo. He believes that the risks of investing in Japan are limited, relative to other Asian markets. Although the rewards may not be substantial, with the upside of the Nikkei index which is currently hovering around the 18,000 level, at 20,000, prospects for a crash are slim . Another reason for moving out of south-east Asian stocks may be the active purchases of those markets by Japanese investment trusts seen during the last quarter. . . 'Buying by Japanese individuals may point to the top of the market,' says Mr Peter Tasker, at Kleinwort Benson, in Tokyo, referring to a similar phenomenon just before the Tokyo market crashed in early 1990.

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report PALLADIUM hit its fourth 38-month high fixing since June 10 at Dollars 128.50 a troy ounce yesterday afternoon on the London bullion market. The rise was based on tight supply, steady physical off-take and strong charts, dealers and analysts said. They are now looking to Dollars 130 in the short term with Dollars 140 pencilled in as a medium term target. Prices have increased by around 35 per cent from around Dollars 95 in early December, analysts said. 'Physical demand has been generally good for several months, especially from Japan and the US but palladium is now finding a bit of speculative interest coming in,' one dealer said. Meanwhile dealers deemed Russian sales to the market as 'orderly.' Other precious metals remained in relatively tight ranges. But on New York's Comex GOLD futures were higher in late trading after local traders succeeded in triggering buy stop orders above Dollars 372 a troy ounce for the August contract. On the LME TIN continued to recover from its recent slide to 20-year lows, although market sentiment remained shaky, as all the signs were that producers would boost exports. Three-month metal closed at Dollars 5,142.50 a tonne, up Dollars 30. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Plan to seize BR pension fund assets abandoned THE GOVERNMENT yesterday abandoned its plan to seize part of British Rail's pension fund assets after privatisation in the face of opposition from trustees, employees and Conservative party backbenchers. Instead, the roughly Pounds 8.5bn in pension fund assets will be used to create a joint industry scheme for current employees as long as they remain in the rail industry. A portion of those assets will be set aside in a separate pool to pay benefits to present and deferred pensioners. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said yesterday: 'There can be no question of a U-turn as this is a decision being taken for the first time.' He said the move was not a blueprint for the future of the pension schemes of other soon-to-be-privatised industries. 'This plan is particular to the railway industry.' Trustees of the Rail Pension Scheme had been urging the government to back down on its 'Option Two', outlined in the white paper on rail privatisation. The government had proposed seizing a portion of the pension scheme's assets in exchange for a promise to pay index-linked pensions indefinitely. 'This is largely what the trustees were looking for, but there are still some safeguards we are seeking,' said one trustee. In particular, the trustees want assurances that ministerial powers over the pension scheme may not be used to weaken the benefit structure in the future nor to shift the cost-sharing in a way that forces members to increase their proportion of contributions. Answering questions at a news conference, Mr MacGregor said the new owners of the privatised BR companies would be represented on the Joint Industry Scheme board of trustees but would not have the power either to wind up the scheme or weaken its benefits without the consent of parliament. It is envisaged that the JIS will have a trustee company consisting of employees and representatives of BR's new owners. There will then be a series of local boards who decide matters relating to conditions of individual schemes. BR freight, Page 6</p>

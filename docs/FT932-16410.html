			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Arts: Mireille - a worthy survivor from a Provencal idyll / Paris Opera queues stretching across the Place Boieldieu in front of the Opera-Comique in Paris for a Sunday matinee. The attraction? Not a baroque revival by one of the authentic-instrument groups approved by the musical 'tout Paris', but Gounod's Mireille - a survivor from the old popular repertory now gingerly being taken down from the shelf and found good. The process is not confined to Paris: this Mireille started in Avignon and will also be shown in Lausanne, Nantes and Tours. The queuers were rewarded by an uncommonly enjoyable performance of some ravishing music reflecting Gounod's sudden, overwhelming love affair with the sights and sounds of Provence. The first act and much of the second form a perfect pastoral idyll. The transition from idyll to rural tragedy is not altogether happily made but there remains plenty to enjoy: nothing turns ponderous, nothing goes on too long. Robert Fortune's production, clearly designed with touring in view, in sets by Dominique Pichou and costumes by Rosalie Varda is traditional, honest, colourful, suggesting the sun and shadow of Arles and the country round about with a minimum of detail (the costumes, I fancy, are accurate). The Provencal songs and dances are presented simply without quaintness or condescension. Choral and choreographic movement (the latter by Laurent Noris) are smoothly interwoven. The third act scenes in the Val d'Enfer and on the banks of the Rhone avoid the wishy-washiness lurking in Gounod's deliberately subdued treatment of the supernatural. Only the last act lost its way, with a corner of the Crau desert surely too invitingly sunny to give Mireille her fatal sunstroke (not even a glimpse of the mirage she sees) and a final scene in the chapel of the Saintes Maries suddenly switching style to black drapes and banks of electric candles. There was a partly double cast. I heard Michele Command as Mireille and Luca Lombardo as the basket-weaver Vincent, whom she loves in spite of furious opposition from her father, a rich farmer. The soprano pleaded throat trouble but showed little sign of it. Both are most likable performers, she warm, easy, supple, phrasing sensitively, the tenor elegant, ardent and youthful. Both, the tenor especially, have excellent diction (Michel Carre's adaptation of Mistral's Provencal epic is no fun to read but it sings well). Ourrias the drover, who wounds Vincent out of jealousy, was sung with biting intensity by the Belgian baritone Marcel Vanaud. The character does not normally stand out so clearly from the other deep voices. The short but telling role of the kindly witch Taven was taken at this performance by the veteran Rita Gorr. This rightly popular favourite has plenty of power left: at moments I thought she might shake the ruins of Arles to their foundations. The small parts were well cared for, the mysterious ferryman (Christian Poulizac) making the utmost of his moment of glory. Cyril Diederich, conducting the Opera-Comique chorus, the Hauts de Seine children's choir and the Colonne Orchestra, fill the theatre with joyous, mellow sound. Gounod scores like Schubert, much of whose melodic gift, in this opera especially, he inherited. If a new government in France means a shake-up in the operatic world it would be another opportunity (there have been others but they have slipped by) to give a more positive role to the Opera-Comique. This famous institution is under-used. The building - old-fashioned, inconvenient and ill-equipped - could do with some of the funds shovelled into bigger things more likely to produce 'gloire'. From the spectator's point of view, is there a better house for hearing medium-sized opera? Many years back, Rolf Liebermann, then director of both the Opera and the smaller house spoke in an interview of the Opera-Comique's great prestige and illustrious past, stressing that of all lyric theatres in France it had staged the greatest number of first performances. That past adds up to a rich repertory much of which may not appeal to social or cultural snobs, but is an essential part of French musical culture. Seeing the queues for Mireille, one cannot hardly doubt public support, given a chance. Sponsored by Alliance Operas.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 21 TASS -- The Russian Government  adopted on Saturday main guidelines of social policy in 1994  aimed at stabilisation and gradual improvement of living  standards in Russia.    The document signed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  obliges all federal executive bodies to draw up their programmes  of targeted social assistance and wage increases on these  guidelines.    They call in particular for measures to stop further  decreases of wages and salaries, balance economic interests and  material possibilities of three major categories of the  population -- employees, entrepreneurs and disabled people,  reform the social sphere and increase the role of the state in  employment and retraining of citizens.    The document also envisages establishing efficient private  ownership of housing and preservation of housing subsidies for  lower income families.</p>

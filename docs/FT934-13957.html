			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Goldman Sachs, Mitsui in derivatives venture GOLDMAN Sachs and Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance have established a joint venture for trading derivative instruments. Goldman Sachs Mitsui Marine Derivative Products, rated triple-A by Standard &amp; Poor's, opened for business yesterday. The move follows a trend set by Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers, which established separately-capitalised derivatives units with top credit ratings to combat the competitive disadvantage of their relatively weak credit ratings. The lucrative Dollars 4,000bn market in over-the-counter swaps and options is extremely credit-sensitive, as many clients are limited to dealing with counterparties rated double-A and above. 'We were certainly missing out on some business, although the vast majority of clients' were happy to deal with Goldman, said Mr Jacob Goldfield, a Goldman partner and president of the joint venture. He added that 'the world may be moving so that we need this to stay competitive'. Goldman's approach breaks the pattern set by its US rivals, by using a partner to ensure a stronger credit rating, rather than relying on its own capital. The new company is 50 per cent owned by each partner, with initial capitalisation of Dollars 75m provided equally. The joint venture is backed by both companies, but it is the support of triple-A rated Mitsui Marine which ensured the top rating by S&amp;P. Goldman has made limited use of two existing special purpose vehicles for derivatives in existence. 'The other vehicles could have been used for this purpose, but we chose to wait for this one,' said Mr Goldfield.</p>

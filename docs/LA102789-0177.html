			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH VETOES A SECOND BILL ALLOWING ABORTION FUNDS;  </P> <P> D.C. WOMEN WILL GET NO U.S. MONEY  </P> <P> President Bush today vetoed a $4-billion bill for the District of Columbia that  would have allowed local funds to be used to pay for abortions.  </P> <P> It was Bush's second veto of abortion-related legislation in the last week.  </P> <P> "I informed Congress earlier that I would veto this bill if it contained funds  to pay for abortion," Bush said in a statement handed to reporters as Air Force  One landed in Costa Rica.  </P> <P> "This year, regrettably, the Congress has expanded the circumstances under  which federal funds could be used to pay for abortion," Bush said. "I am  therefore compelled to disapprove (the District of Columbia appropriation)."  </P> <P> On Saturday, Bush vetoed the $156.7-billion spending bill for the departments  of Health and Human Services, Labor and Education because that bill allowed the  use of federal money to pay for abortions of poor victims of rape and incest.  </P> <P> Bush has supported abortions in such cases but opposes any change in the  current law that bars federal funds for abortions except in cases where the  life of the mother is endangered by the pregnancy.  </P> <P> House supporters of the HHS bill failed in their effort Wednesday to override  the veto. They won a majority of votes but not the two-thirds majority needed  to pass the bill over the President's objections.  </P> <P> Abortion-rights supporters are not expected to be able to override the veto of  the district bill, and both appropriations bills will have to be reworked by  House and Senate Appropriations committees.  </P> <P> Bush's action was immediately denounced by supporters of legal abortion.  </P> <P> Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action  League, said Bush has an "extremist ideology" and showed "callous disregard for  the health and well-being of poor and vulnerable women in crisis pregnancies."  </P> <P> "Today's veto is one more attempt by an out-of-touch Administration to allow  politicians to interfere in intensely private decisions about abortion," she  said, predicting the Administration's stance would hurt Republican candidates  in upcoming elections.  </P> <P> Sandra Faucher, director of the National Right to Life political action  committee, said the group was pleased with Bush's action but she dismissed  critics of the President who she said should not act as if they were surprised  by the veto.  </P> <P> Sen. Brock Adams (D-Wash.) said that in vetoing the abortion funds, Bush also  vetoed an anti-drug bill for the district because the catchall measure  contained $32 million for the beleaguered city's war on drugs and drug-related  violence.  </P> <P> "We have set back the war on drugs in the United States," Adams said, because  of Bush's "personal belief on abortion."  </P> <P> Sen. Joseph R. Biden (D-Del.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said: "We  came up with a strategy and we came up with the money. All we wanted the  President to do was to come up with his signature. So (now) the so-called drug  war in Washington, D.C., is not only no better off than it was before, I think  it is worse off than it was before."  </P></p>

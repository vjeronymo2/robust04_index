			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Richards withdraws from printed carpets Shares in Richards fell 5p to 49p on Friday after the Aberdeen-based textiles company announced its withdrawal from the manufacture of printed carpet where, it said, it had no long-term competitive advantage. The carpet manufacturing operations in Northern Ireland would now be closed with the loss of about 175 jobs. A 'significant write-off' would inevitably result from the decision. All non-print carpet manufacture would be concentrated at Cumnock, Ayrshire, and the remaining carpet business should improve performance substantially in 1995, directors said. The core spinning operation continued to show improved results. For the half year to March 31, pre-tax losses deepened from Pounds 326,000 to Pounds 1.62m after provisions totalling Pounds 1.61m for the period. Before this there was a swing from operating losses of Pounds 248,000 to profits of Pounds 220,000 from continuing activities.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Rival Yemenis pour forces into battle for military base Heavy artillery thundered through the key military base of al-Anad on the road to Aden yesterday in the biggest battle between Yemen's rival armies since civil war erupted two weeks ago, Reuter reports. Rocket and tank fire added to the deafening noise of battle inside the sprawling 10km by 5km army and air force base where troops of south and north fought desperately to drive out their foe. The base, 60km from Aden, governs the northern approaches to the city, bastion of the southern leaders. Its capture would give the northern forces a springboard from which to attack the port city. Reporters based in Sanaa and Aden went inside its perimeter to try to verify rival claims about who controls the base. They saw only a small part of the huge encampment, but heard heavy gunfire and saw evidence of some savage fighting inside and outside al-Anad. One Reuter correspondent who entered the base from Aden in the south yesterday said southern troops loyal to Vice-President Ali Salem al-Baidh appeared to control most of the terrain. At about the same time other reporters from Sanaa, the capital and stronghold of northern President Ali Abdullah Saleh, saw northern troops backed by heavy armour were well inside the base and said they were tightening their grip despite stiff resistance. Southern aircraft flew at high altitude overhead but did not appear to drop any bombs and a northern army officer said they were apparently directing southern artillery fire. Northern commanders said the bloody pitched battle to enter the base started on Monday. One officer said: 'The troops of the mutineers (southern leaders) put up bloody initial resistance.' Another estimated the southern troops in the base at 10,000 but would give no figure for his northern forces.</p>

In a statement issued at the end of a two-day NATO summit,  the 16 nations reaffirmed support for political and economic  reforms pursued by President Boris Yeltsin, despite the  emergence of a strong challenge from extreme nationalists in the  new parliament.    The December 12 Russian elections and adoption of a new  constitution conferring executive powers on the president marked  "a major step forward in the establishment of framework for the  development of durable democratic institutions.    "We further welcome the Russian government's firm commitment  to democratic and market reform and to a reformist foreign  policy. These are important for security and stability in  Europe. We believe that an indepednent, democratic, stable and  nuclear-weapons free Ukraine would likewise contribute to  security and stability.    "We will continue to encourage and support the reform  processes in both countries and to develop cooperation with  them, as with other countries in Central and East Europe," NATO  said.    But the communique went on: "The situation in southern  Caucasus continues to be of special concern," referring mainly  to Armenia's bitter territorial struggle with Azerbaijan over  Armenian-dominated Nagorno-Karabakh.    "We condemn the use of force for territorial gains. Respect  for the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of  Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia is essential to the  establishment of peace, stability and cooperation in the region."    "We call upon all states to join international efforts under  the aegis of the United Nations and the CSCE (Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe) aimed at solving existing  problems."</p>

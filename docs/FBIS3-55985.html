			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tartu, Estonia, Jan 12, BNS - The Estonian State  Court today ruled to declare null and void the government  regulations and amendments to the police law which legalized the  usage of special means of surveillance by the country's security  police.    The State Court in the ruling says such means of police  surveillance and their usage as stipulated by the government  regulations may restrict the citizens' constitutional rights and  freedoms.    The police law amendments allowed for special means, such as  phone-tapping and reading of citizens' letters, to be used by  the Defense Police in some cases. The amendments law, however,  also stipulated that such means could be used only following a  respective permission from the head of the State Court or a  State Court member to whom the court's head has referred the  powers to issue such permission.    The amendments, originally meant to remain in effect until  the adoption of a separate law, left it largely with security  police officials and one State Court member to determine what  means of investigation and police surveillance were to be  regarded as special measures and in which cases these were to be  used.    The Estonian parliament passed the police law amendments on  April 21, 1993.    The chancellor of law, Eerik-Juhan Truuvali, first referred  to constitutional stipulations and requested that the  parliament annulled the amendments. Truuvali sought a State  Court ruling on the issue after the parliament made no move  toward bringing the law into accordance with the constitution.    Both rulings adopted by the State Court today are effective  immediately on adoption, final, and cannot be referred to any  other court of appeal.    The Defense Police on several occasions recently has  obtained  from the State Court the right to use extraordinary means of  surveillance. For instance, Defense Police tapped the phones of  some members of the so-called Pullapaa volunteer infantry  company during last summer's crisis, when the unit had announced  its independence from the defense forces Main Staff.    The prosecution service law, a legislation designed to  finally regulate the usage of special means of police  surveillance, has by now passed the first reading in the  parliament. According to the draft, permission to use  phone-tapping in investigation has to be sought from  administrative courts.</p>

According  to a statement from the Ministry of Territorial Administration  and Security, the peaceful people of Samba Dramane hamlet  yesterday between 0630 and 0700 GMT were waken up by gunshots by  17 Peul aggressors coming from Senegalese territory. This  attack, the statement said, left four victims including two  inhabitants from the Segui village -- one hawker and one  inhabitant from Samba Dramani hamlet. The Samba Dramane  self-defense brigade pursued the assailants who left obvious  footprints in their retreat. These footprints led to Jagi hamlet  situated on Senegalese territory where all the inhabitants are  of the Peul tribe. The Senegalese security forces went to the  area and arrested members of the Samba Dramane self-defense  brigade.    The regional and local administrative authorities are now on  the spot and are actively preparing the meeting which our  minister of territorial administration and security and his  Senegalese counterpart will hold on Wednesday 9 March. These  two officials met on 13 January at Bakool. According to latest  reports, following the meeting of the governors of the two  border regions in Kidira and upon instructions by the Senegalese  authorities, these Malian citizens will be handed over to the  Kayes governor this evening.</p>

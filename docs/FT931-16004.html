			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Costly siege of the franc fort: The defence of the French currency is putting a severe strain on the economy Is the prestige worth the pain? That is the question which President Francois Mitterrand and most of France's political and business establishment must ask themselves as they soldier on in defence of the franc's present parity with the D-mark. Mr Mitterrand believes there is far more than prestige at stake in keeping the franc level-pegging with the D-mark. For him, there is the overwhelming political importance of preserving the dream of monetary union. And there is no one in France who disagrees that the present link between the franc and the D-mark is all that pins the European Monetary System together at the moment. But it is the economic rationale of the franc fort policy that is seriously weakening in the face of growing redundancies and record real interest rates, shoving up the misery index for many French companies and citzens. Underneath the political crust of support for the franc fort, the economy is rumbling with discontent. Peugeot's announcement this week that it was laying off 2,600 jobs - 4 per cent of its workforce - made clear that there will be no respite this year in the trend that saw a record 600,000 job losses last year. This took the total number of unemployed to 3m, or 10.4 per cent of the workforce. The lay-offs have come in every branch of industry and have not spared the service sector. Every time there is a run on the franc, higher market interest rates present banks with the choice of seeing clients go under or themselves losing money. Banks and insurance companies are having to practise various forms of financial engineering - assets swaps, selling and leasing back buildings - to limit the impact of the slide in the value of their property holdings. The unrelenting pace of redundancies may be as much the result of domestic fiscal and social policies as of the battle on the foreign exchanges to maintain the value of the French currency. But an increasing number of those doing the firing seem to put the blame on the franc fort policy and the high levels of interest rates it requires. In a survey by the business paper, Les Echos, this week, 71 per cent of a sample of 402 company bosses said they hoped that, if the centre-right parties carried the March parliamentary elections, the new government would abandon monetary rigour for interest rate cuts. For the opposition, this is a highly unwelcome view from its natural business constituency. The single element of support for Minister Pierre Beregovoy's socialist government from the top leaders of the Gaullist RPR and Giscardian UDF parties is for its exchange rate policy. Indeed, they are actively conspiring with the government's efforts to talk up the franc. Socialist and opposition leaders have joined in disparaging the minority advocates of 'soft money' in each other's camp. Such disparagement became slightly more difficult when Mr Alain Madelin, a former UDF minister and pro-European, last month urged a floating of the franc from the European Monetary System. Equally, both government and opposition leaders now talk in non-partisan terms about the need to give the Banque de France statutory independence from the government of the day, a move considered vital to bolster the franc and necessary to comply with the Maastricht treaty on eventual monetary union. Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, has said that to try to rush through a new central bank statute before the March election would show 'a lack of confidence' in the opposition, which he, like every other reader of French opinion polls, expects to form the next government. For his part, Mr Edouard Balladur, tipped as prime minister in that new government, yesterday admitted his 'error' in not pushing autonomy for the Banque de France, when he was finance minister in the 1986-88 conservative government. The same consensus does not exist on public finances, which according to an independent estimate yesterday by the Centre for Economic Studies are likely to be FFr220m (Pounds 25.8m) in the red this year and FFr250m next year. Mr Beregovoy more or less conceded these estimates, when he admitted this week that the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation had been more accurate in estimating growth this year at around 1.5-1.6 per cent than his own government's estimate of 2.6 per cent. But a charge of fiscal extravagance is hard for the oppostion to level at Mr Beregovoy, who throughout the dour nine months of his premiership has only come up with penny packets of reflation - some low-interest loans for small business in October, some tax relief for the sick property sector in December, and this week's announcement of speedier VAT refunds to help companies' cash flow. Equally, Mr Balladur said yesterday that he looked first to tax reform and German-led interest rate cuts to spur economic revival, which only over time would boost tax receipts to reduce the budget deficit. Despite the fact that the economy is likely to grow by more than 1 per cent this year, there is increasing frustration that the past ten years of austerity have failed to yield the expected benefits. France has now achieved lower inflation than Germany, but its interests rates remain higher. Its trade surplus - FFr23bn in the first nine months of last year - is now threatened by the depreciation of many of its neighbours' currencies. Blackest of all is the unemployment picture. Much of the jobless increase can be blamed on the high level of real interest rates, which but for the need to keep the franc in lock-step with the D-Mark should have fallen over the past two years as inflation, investment and economic activity have sunk together. The banks have tried to diminish the pain to their lenders at some cost to themselves, claims Mr Robert de Bruin, director of the Association of French Banks. Keeping their base rates below 10 per cent, when measures to defend the franc in September and early October last year drove money market rates to a peak of 20 per cent, cost the banks FFr400m, he says. Since then, however, banks have raised their base rates to 10 per cent or above. 'It is good commercial sense not to hurt our clients', says Mr de Bruin. 'We can hold the line on rates, but only for short periods.' A host of structural factors are also to blame for the mismatch of supply and demand in France's labour market. But one fact has now shot to political prominence. This is the new freedom with which French firms lay off their workers. Their motive is the high social payroll charges, which, as Mr Balladur was complaining yesterday, mean that total wage costs in France amount to 19 per cent of GDP, compared to 11 per cent in Germany. The last conservative government repealed in 1986 the law that made redundancies subject to the public authorities' approval. But only in the past 18 months have companies really exploited their freedom to shed labour. The wave of recent lay-offs, some of them perhaps long overdue from before 1986, has hit far more sectors than in any previous economic downturn. Some of them are perhaps long-overdue. Air France, for example, is making forced redundancies for the first time. The Patronat employers' federation naturally rejects charges that its members are trigger happy in firing people, and it and the unions are embroiled in a separate dispute over unemployment insurance, accusing the state (with some justice) of shirking its responsibilities. Indeed, issuing a report this week on French competitiviness, Mr Jean Gandois, the head of Pechiney, the metals group, complained that companies are further handicapped by the unfair share of unemployment insurance costs they have to shoulder. It is hardly surprising, in present circumstances, that the Beregovoy government should hanker after the old 1986 law. Nor was it surprising that last month it passed a law requiring companies to first present a plan to try to give workers alternative jobs before making them redundant. In the absence of such plans, redundancies can be declared legally invalid. Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, said employers should think twice before laying people off. Mr Balladur even floated the idea of levying social charges on a company's turnover, not its payroll, thereby denying it cost savings from lay-offs. The opposition is clearly growing anxious about the state of the economy for which it is likely to inherit responsibility. Precisely because the unemployment crisis is intractable, there is always the temptation to reach for a simplistic solution, such as abandoning the franc's present parity with the D-mark. The deeper France enters into its election campaign, and the longer the Bundesbank maintains its rates at the present level, the greater that temptation grows.</p>

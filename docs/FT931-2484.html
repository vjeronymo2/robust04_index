			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Arts: Marc Laforet - Recital This pianist, Paris-born but 'of Russian descent', was Silver Medallist at the 1985 Chopin Competition in Warsaw, when he was 18. The programme for his Wigmore Hall debut on Wednesday was all Chopin, no doubt like a great many of his recital-programmes since Warsaw. On the Wigmore evidence, Laforet is plainly a good Chopinian at heart - but his execution slides too easily now into fulsome routine. A personal moratorium on Chopin for a couple of years might pay inspiriting dividends for him. He may not have done himself justice in the Wigmore. His keyboard attack was scaled to a much larger auditorium: though he never pounded, one soon felt starved for some real pianissimo, which never came. Every tune was plonkingly set out - with affection, certainly, but with a forthright insistence that became tiresome; and often it submerged the ever-fresh delights of Chopin's figuration. So did a heavy hand in the bass, compounded with Laforet's penchant for the sustaining pedal (before long one felt starved for some clean, dry sounds too). In several of the 24 Preludes op. 28, the dense lower resonances swallowed up anything ingenious that he might have been doing in the treble range. Yet his left hand could scamper through the semiquavers of the Prelude in G without pedal-feints, to bright, springy effect; we wanted much more of that. In the event the marvellous variety of the Preludes was severely shrunken. He did strike a vein of live drama for the very last prelude, but it came too late. If Laforet's actual playing sounded too much of an orotund muchness, there was no mistaking his sympathetic grasp of Chopin's dramatic structures. He knows very well where their nodes are located; he never failed to signal crucial contrasts and turning-points. All that we missed was spontaneity, fantasy, a sense of moment-to-moment re-creation. The B minor Sonata marked a low point, with every small section faithfully spelled out but no incisive larger trajectory, nor - in the Scherzo or the Finale - anything more than beta-plus brilliance. Before that, he had fixed properly pungent characters for four of the Mazurkas (at Warsaw he won the special Mazurka Prize), though they came rather near to sounding like French valses. The most intriguing exhibit in Laforet's programme was his first, the A-flat Impromptu, in which he allowed himself a shamelessly wayward rubato of the most period-winsome kind, but knowing. That sounded like the real thing.</p>

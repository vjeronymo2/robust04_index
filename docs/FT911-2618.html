			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / G7 agrees need to lower rates: Germany defends economic policies against pressure from US A MEDIUM-TERM strategy to lower real interest rates and promote world growth was agreed yesterday by finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven main industrial countries. There was no indication in a communique issued after the meeting in Washington that Germany had bowed to US pressure for an early cut in its own interest rates. Instead, the statement papered over the cracks between the US and Germany, allowing all sides to claim that a day of tough talks had ended with G7 backing for their respective policies. The statement emphasised 'the importance of monetary and fiscal policies which provide the basis for lower real interest rates and a sustained global economic recovery with price stability'. Referring to the ministers, it added: 'They believed that such a medium-term strategy was the best way of reducing potential risks and uncertainties in the current outlook.' Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, said the emphasis now was more on the interdependence of the global economy. This marked a change away from past communiques which focused on high inflation and slow growth. He told journalists he believed there was now 'relative price stability in the US', and he expected that 'over time' there would be lower interest rates in Germany and Japan. Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president, said Germany was not opposed to lower interest rates, but they had to be earned. The German economy was expanding strongly and had to react to that. This was now better understood by the US. 'Policy co-ordination does not mean that countries have to do the same thing at the same time,' he said. A British official said the statement was in line with UK policy of promoting growth through price stability. He emphasised that the communique stressed the importance of fiscal policy in achieving this end. Immediately before the G7 met, President George Bush told the finance ministers and central bank governors from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada that the US wanted lower rates to foster global growth. The president's unusual intervention demonstrated that US concern about the risk of worldwide recession exists at the highest political level. The G7 meeting also discussed the gathering economic crisis in the Soviet Union, problems of Third World debt and underlined importance of bringing the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks to a successful conclusion. Apart from underlining the need for sustained economic reform in the Soviet Union, the communique gave no indication of what the west would do. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said it was clear there would be great concern among the G7 if the Soviet Union got into greater difficulties. Its problems had to be seen in connection with the efforts of eastern and central Europe to reform their economies and political systems. He said the G7 would foster dialogue and help for the Soviet Union, showing the USSR how to boost exports and productivity. Before the meeting with President Bush, the German and US delegations met bilaterally to air their differences over the US demand for lower German interest rates. Speaking afterwards, both Mr Waigel and Mr Pohl made clear that the German delegation had delivered a robust defence of German economic and monetary policies, including the present level of the country's interest rates.

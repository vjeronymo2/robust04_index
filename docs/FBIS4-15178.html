			<p>BFN     [Text] As you know, a decree signed by the president of the  Russian Federation, in which Boris Yeltsin agrees with a  proposal from the Russian Defense Ministry to create military  bases on the territory of CIS member states and in the Republic  of Latvia, became known yesterday. The aim of the proposal is  to ensure security of the Russian Federation and the  above-mentioned countries, as well as to carry out tests for new  kinds of armaments and military equipment.    Commenting on this reasoning, Latvian Foreign Minister  Georgs  Andrejevs stressed that at least on the part of Latvia nobody  has asked for such a security guarantee and that the Russian  Federation has no right to willfully take responsibility for  Latvia's security.    The decree instructs the Russian Foreign Ministry, together  with the Defense Ministry, to hold talks on this issue with the  Republic of Latvia and to enshrine reached agreements in  corresponding documents.    According to Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, this decree  contradicts the treaties initialed at the talks between the  government delegations of the two countries and casts doubt on  the Russian delegation's true intentions in the process of  preparing the treaties. According to the state president's  office, the Russian side's move is causing anxiety about a  meeting scheduled to take place between the presidents of the  two countries.    In a telephone conversation with [Latvian Prime Minister]  Valdis Birkavs, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt gave a  cautious assessment of the Russian president's decree and voiced  the assumption that Russia may rescind the document, as has  already been the case many times with Russian statements.    A session of the security council took place at the  Maikapara  House this morning. At this moment, the Russian Embassy in  Latvia is holding a news conference.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Consortium buys 60% of Argentine insurer A consortium of Leucadia National Corp of the US and Argentina's Werthein family is to pay Dollars 85m cash for 60 per cent of state-owned insurance company and savings bank, Caja Nacional de Ahorro y Seguro (CNAS). Its sale represents one of Argentina's last big privatisations. CNAS dominates the local insurance industry, with a 12.5 per cent share of the market, and its savings bank has assets of Dollars 350m. The Werthein family controls privately-held Banco Mercantil Argentino, a middle-ranking commercial bank, and will own 30 per cent of the Caja. Leucadia will hold another 30 per cent. They will take control of CNAS in mid-March. The government plans to float a further 30 per cent of the company on local and international stock exchanges, but no date has yet been fixed. The remaining 10 per cent will be held by the employee share ownership scheme. In the past three years, Argentina has sold nearly all its state companies, raising Dollars 9bn in cash and retiring Dollars 10bn in debt.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Live report by Jose Ignacio Aguirre from the Defense </F> Ministry building]    [Text] After meeting for more than two hours, Defense  Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma and Carabineros Director General  Rodolfo Stange finally reached an agreement on the thorny issue  involving Gen. Stange. After the meeting, the government issued  a communique, which was read by the defense minister himself.  Let us listen:    [Begin Perez Yoma recording] The national defense minister,  who is now addressing public opinion, has entrusted the  Carabineros director general -- who had acquiesced with this  request -- with the task of drafting a study within 30 days to  streamline the institution he heads. The Defense Ministry deems  that this task is of the highest national interest. Hence, the  director general will have to discharge this duty by giving it  precedence over all other regular duties. To this effect, he  will delegate all the power that the Carabineros Organizational  Law allows him to the Carabineros deputy director general.  Thank you. [end recording]    This is the communique released by the defense minister, who  confirmed the reports that were leaked this morning at the  ministry indicating there would be surprises in the way Gen.  Stange would resume office. As has been heard, he will devote  himself to the streamlining of the Carabineros police. The  duties of director general as such will be discharged by the  deputy commander, who is the current acting director general,  General [Fernando] Cordero. This is all the information we have  at the Defense Ministry. Thank you.</p>

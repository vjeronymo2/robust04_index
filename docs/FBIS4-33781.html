			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras from the </F> "Doing Radio" program]    [Text] As we have been reporting on this braodcast of the  "Doing Radio" program, yesterday, demonstrations were held in  Washington to protest the U.S. blockade against Cuba.  Approximately 100 business, intellectual, as well as many other  organizations participated in this demonstration. In essence,  Congressman Charles Rangel as well as other political figures,  intellectuals, and businessmen believe that maintaining the  blockade is an ill-fated remnant of the Cold War which punishes  the Cuban people and hampers legitimate interests of U.S. firms,  who are interested in trading with Cuba.    Among other reasons, they argue the fact that the United  States maintains good trade relations with two socialist nations  with which it fought in the past: China and Vietnam. The truth  is that if someone expects to find a reason -- even from the  most radical perspective of extreme conservatism -- to justify  the existence of the blockade, it would be difficult for that  individual to find an intelligent reason that does not  contradict the agreements on trade, such as the latest one  within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade, or principles of the UN Charter, which sustain  international rights.    Each day, two arguments gain force in the heart of U.S.  society, one being of an ethical nature and the other of  legitimate interests. The first points out that it is unfair,  with or without political reasons, to punish an entire people,  who only want peace and respect for their decisions regarding  domestic policy. The other argument is linked to legitimate  interests of U.S. businessmen who see in Washington's  unwillingness to authorize them to trade in and with Cuba a  serious hindrance to their legitimate business interests.    I have just learned, to give an example, that the Texaco  Corporation is interested in participating in exploration and  drilling for oil in Cuba, under the same conditions as the  European, Canadian, and Latin American firms. Other sectors,  such as the food, pharmaceutical, tourist, and airline, as well  as many other industries -- a long list which would be  embarrassing to read -- do not want to be excluded from the  opportunity of doing business in Cuba due to a prohibition by  Washington, a prohibition basically supported by political  stubbornness.</p>

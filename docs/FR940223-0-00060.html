			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing and Educational Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because PMCPs have not been regulated in the past, the FHWA and state personnel will be providing educational and technical assistance for these carriers prior to the effective date. The FHWA is seeking comments on the type and scope of educational and technical assistance that should be provided to assist PMCPs in complying with the FMCSRs. Comments must be received on or before October 1, 1994. The FHWA will make the materials available to National and State organizations which represent PMCPs or anyone who requests assistance directly from the FHWA. The FHWA also has Division offices in every State that can answer questions and provide technical assistance to these carriers upon request. The addresses for the FHWA Division Offices are listed in appendix D to 49 CFR part 7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PMCPs (business and nonbusiness) will have until January 1, 1995, to meet these requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because this rulemaking has been the subject of substantial congressional and public interest, the FHWA has determined that this final rule is a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 and a significant regulation under the DOT regulatory policies and procedures. In the Motor Carrier Act of 1984, Congress expanded the definitions of ``interstate commerce'' and ``commercial motor vehicle'' which expanded the Department of Transportation's regulatory jurisdiction to include private motor carriers of passengers. Both Congress and the bus industry have shown a keen interest in the progress of this rulemaking. The safety benefits and opportunities for benefits from this rule will offset any cost. A regulatory evaluation has been prepared and is available for review in the public docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. Many small entities will be economically impacted by this rulemaking and some may decide to cease transportation of passengers rather than comply with the safety rules and regulations. However, the overall impact on small entities will be minimal. The FHWA is exempting the majority of small entities_those defined as nonbusiness_from the paperwork and recording requirements of this rule. The vast majority of PMCPs are small entities, especially the non-business carriers. Some of the smallest entities may find it preferable to discontinue their operations in interstate commerce, and to charter buses for their interstate trips. Private carriers which pay their drivers are even more likely to consider chartering as an option because of their increased costs for driver salaries or other compensation. Chartering does not reduce the cost of complying with this rule, but does place an effective ceiling on how much this rule might cost small entities. Thus, under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. This regulation amends certain parts of the FMCSRs pertaining to the scope and applicability of the FMCSRs to interstate transportation by PMCPs as authorized by the Motor Carrier Act of 1984. The FMCSRs establish minimum safety regulations which may be supplemented by the States, provided the State safety laws and regulations are compatible with the Federal requirements. (See 57 FR 40946, September 8, 1992, which includes the Tolerance Guidelines for Adopting Compatible State Rules and Regulations.) The statutory basis for Federal regulation of interstate commerce has been outlined above. Accordingly, it is certified that the policies contained in this document have been assessed in light of the principles, criteria, and requirements of the Federalism Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental Review)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Numbers 20.217, Motor Carrier Safety, and 20.218, Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program.

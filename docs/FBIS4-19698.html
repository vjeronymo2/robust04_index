			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] ANAP [Motherland Party] leader Mesut Yilmaz said the  the public is being given the impression that the meetings with  the IMF are successful. He added that agreement with the IMF is  like sharing the state's economic sovereignty with an  international corporation.    At his party's assembly meeting, Yilmaz said that the  information communicated to the public regarding Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller's visit to the United States is unsatisfactory.  Indicating that the public is being given the impression that  the visit was very successful, Yilmaz added that the contents of  this success are not clarified. Asserting that the real aim of  this visit was to procure foreign financial support for the  stability measures, Yilmaz claimed that there can be no mention  of a basic feasibility package and added that there is an  attempt to camouflage the package with an IMF cloak.    Yilmaz indicated that Turkey faces a heavy price because the  coalition government did not take the necessary measures in  time. Indicating that Turkey had $7 billion worth of foreign  currency in the Central Bank in November 1993, Yilmaz said that  today there are no foreign currencies Turkey can make use of in  the Central Bank.    [Begin Yilmaz recording] The election wasted $7 billion in  six months. Now, the total credit the prime minister with her  large delegation and with her numerous meetings obtained is $640  million. $640 million is the amount allocated to Turkey and we  cannot obtain this amount at one time. We can only withdraw the  money as long as we implement the measures and the IMF approves  of them step by step. [end recording]    Yilmaz stressed that the United Nations and NATO are  incapacitated regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina. Yilmaz stated that  UN secretary general should immediately resign in case Gorazde,  which is under the protection of the United Nations, is captured  by the Serbs.    Recalling the announcement that compulsory savings will be  refunded, Yilmaz said that it is not right that a small amount  will be paid to those that have contributed continually for six  years. Explaining that the tax bill is not just, Yilmaz said  that 6 million people are outside the tax bracket and 3 million  people are overtaxed. Yilmaz noted that the results of all the  measures is 200 trillion Turkish lira [TL] and added that the  state lost much more than TL200 trillion with the devaluation  and the rise in the rate of interest.    Expressing their worries that all the sacrifices will be in  vain, Yilmaz said that without controlling the rate of interest  and foreign currency, public debt will not be reduced.</p>

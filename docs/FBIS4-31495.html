			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 9 (CTK) -- Slovakia will this year  receive 40 million ECU [European Currency Unit] (about 1.5  billion Slovak crowns) within the PHARE [Economic Reconstruction  Aid for Poland and Hungary] programme for the 1994-96 period.  The programme was signed here by Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan  and European Union Commissioner Rene Steichen today.    "The European Union has become the most significant foreign  aid contributor to Slovakia," Kukan said. In 1990-93, Slovakia  received within PHARE nearly 130 million ECU in support of  economic reforms.    Steichen said that this aid had brought results in most  sectors but that he was not satisfied in all cases. He added  that the use of EU aid was regularly checked. The sum of 40  million ECU is to be distributed among agriculture, the private  sector, additional training, science and technology, energy,  environment, transport, public administration reform and  implementing the EU association agreement.</p>

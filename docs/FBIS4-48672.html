			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Greybe] </F>   [Text] Cape Town -- President Nelson Mandela had not  opposed demands by the Inkatha Freedom Party and KwaZulu  government before the elections that King Goodwill Zwelithini be  given royal control of KwaZulu tribal land, a top adviser to the  king said yesterday. Inkatha central committee member and newly  appointed KwaZulu/Natal education minister Vincent Zulu said the  issue was discussed at length at the April 8 summit at Skukuza,  attended by then president F.W. de Klerk, Inkatha leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Zwelithini and Mandela and their  negotiators.    "Mandela said our demand was valid and he undertook to  discuss it with his national executive," Zulu said. "He said he  would do everything possible to satisfy the king's demand."    Mandela and Buthelezi were scheduled to meet in Cape Town  last night to discuss the growing row.    De Klerk authorised the transfer of 1.2 million hectares of  land to a trust controlled by Zwelithini on April 25.    ANC acting presidential spokesman Carl Niehaus said  yesterday  Mandela had "nothing more" to add until he had met Buthelezi.    Mandela said on Friday he became aware of the land deal only  on Friday after media reports. He said the ANC had not been  involved in talks on the deal.    De Klerk, speaking in London on Friday, said it was  "nonsense" to suggest there had been a secret deal.    Zulu said the KwaZulu government, by legislating for the  royal control of tribal land, had "just wanted to make sure"  about the future. If government at central or provincial level  wanted to develop tribal land in KwaZulu in future, for whatever  purpose, it would have to negotiate with the king, he said.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Midland advances to Pounds 443m - Strategy of maintaining existing branch network to be reviewed Midland Bank will re-examine its strategy of maintaining its branch network and keeping senior managers in branches if it fails to attract sufficient new income to compensate for the cost, the bank said yesterday. Sir William Purves, chairman of Midland and its parent company HSBC Holdings, said that it wanted to use its 1,740 branches to increase its market share in the UK, but 'it remains to be seen if we have got it right'. Sir William said that he had been shocked at the level of dissatisfaction with UK clearing banks compared with Hong Kong, where most letters from customers praised banks. He said that some complaints were 'very justified'. Sir William said he believed the 2.5 per cent pay rise imposed on Midland's 45,000 staff was fair despite ballots on a series of one-day strikes organised by Bifu, the banking union which represents 13,900 Midland staff. The strategy of putting managers back into local branches and keeping a strong network was set by Sir Brian Pearse, the bank's previous chief executive. Sir Brian retired earlier this year, and was succeeded by Mr Keith Whitson. Midland disclosed a Pounds 58m rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 443m for the half year to June 30, but there was an 11 per cent drop in operating income to Pounds 1.5bn (Pounds 1.68bn). Net interest income rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 897m (Pounds 840m), but non-interest income fell by 29 per cent to Pounds 599m (Pounds 840m). 'The biggest worry in clearing banking must be that revenue is simply not growing as fast as overheads,' said Sir William. Operating expenses were flat at Pounds 1.04bn, but the ratio of costs to income rose to 69.6 per cent (61.9 per cent). This is above the HSBC group target of 60 per cent. Mr Whitson said Midland had made gains in its credit card business, and had increased its share of the UK mortgage market. He said the pressure on margins had been limited except in lending to big companies, but he expected that pressure to grow. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell to Pounds 54m (Pounds 321m), including a net release of Pounds 45m related to less developed country lending. Mr Whitson said he expected the provisions figure to rise somewhat when lending growth resumed. Midland made a Pounds 65m profit from reducing its equity shareholding in 3i, the venture capital company formerly owned by banks, from 17 per cent to 8 per cent. The profit will be realised in the second half's financial accounts. Assets weighted by risk rose to Pounds 48.2bn (Pounds 42.9bn) and the tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets stayed at 6.5 per cent. Midland paid a Pounds 106m dividend (Pounds 50m) to HSBC out of unchanged attributable profit of Pounds 282m. Earnings per share amounted to 34.6p (35.4p). See Lex</p>

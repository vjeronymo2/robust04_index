			<p>BFN     [Text] The Government has thrown open the basic telecom  services for the private sector shedding its long-held monopoly.    It would also have `suitable arrangements' (preferably a  regulatory authority) to implement the policy allowing the  private sector into the basic services. The much-awaited  national telecom policy was announced in both Houses of  Parliament today.    The Government, however, did not intend to change the  present  part departmental, part corporation structure of the telecom  sector. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and Mahanagar  Telecommunications Ltd (MTNL) would be allowed to remain in the  present form along with the private sector entities in providing  the basic telephone service, in voice, data and other  connections.    The announcement heralding a new era in the telecom sector  was made by the Minister of State for Communications, Mr. Sukh  Ram, after the Union Cabinet cleared the policy at its meeting  earlier in the day. The minister later addressed a press  conference giving details of the policy.    `With a view to supplementing the effort of the DoT in  providing telecommunications services to the people, companies  registered in India will be allowed to participate in the area  of basic telephone services also', the new policy said. Various  international telecom companies had already put in proposals  worth $3 billion offering to run telephone services in various  parts of the country. The new policy clears the hurdles in  their joining the Indian network.    Mr. Sukh Ram announced at the press conference that the  Government would fix the telecom tariff and a decision on the  regulatory body to ensure competition and interface problems  would be taken at a later date. He felt that India had one of  the lowest telephone tariffs and he wanted that status to be  maintained. Mr Sukh Ram noted that the 0.8 per cent telephone  density was much below the world average of 10 per cent.    The new policy also announced revised targets for the  telecom  sector for the Eighth Plan and noted that additional resources  required to achieve the revised targets would be well over Rs.  23,000 crores. `Private investment and association of the  private sector would be needed in a big way to bridge the  resource gap,' the policy said. It went on to add that private  initiative would be used to complement the departmental efforts  to raise additional resources both through increased internal  generation and adopting innovative means like leasing, deferred  payments, build-operate-transfer (BOT), build-lease-transfer  (BLT), build-transfer-operate (BTO) etc.    About the private participation, the policy noted that  `these  companies will be required to maintain a balance in their  coverage between urban and rural areas. Their conditions of  operation will include agreed tariff and revenue sharing  agreements. Other terms applicable to such companies will be  similar to those indicated for value added services'.    `In order to implement the above policy, suitable  arrangements will have to be made to (a) protect and promote the  interests of the consumers and (b) ensure fair competition,' the  policy said indicating the formation of a regulatory authority.    Introduction to the policy document said the telecom  services  of world class quality are necessary for the success of the new  economic policy.    To achieve the new policy objectives the Government also  announced the revised targets for the Eighth Plan. According to  the new targets, telephone should be made available on demand by  1997. All villages should be covered by 1997. In the urban  areas a PCO [public call office] should be provided for every  500 persons by 1997. All value-added services available  internationally should be introduced in India to raise the  telecom services to international standards, preferably by 1996.    Even with the comparatively modest targets of the Eighth  Plan, as originally fixed, there is a resource gap of Rs. 7,500  crores. The additional resources required to achieve the  revised targets would be over Rs. 23,000 crores. `Clearly, this  is beyond the capacity of Government funding and internal  generation of resources,' the policy said.    About the value added services, the policy pointed out that  apart from continuing with the tendering system, the track  record of the company, compatibility of the company, usefulness  of the technology being offered for future development,  protection of national security interests, ability to give the  best quality of service to the consumer at the most competitive  cost and attractiveness of the commercial terms to the DoT would  also be criteria for selection to award licence.    The policy also encourages introduction of new technologies.  `Pilot projects will be encouraged directly by the Government in  order to access new technologies, new systems in basic as well  as value added services'. The policy emphasises the need for  administration of the telecom sector in such a way that the  inflow of technology is made easy and India does not lag behind  in getting full advantage of the emerging new technologies.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS REJECT SALES TAX INCREASE  </P> <P> A divided Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors rejected a proposal Tuesday  asking voters to support a half-cent increase in the county sales tax that  would have raised money for mental health and emergency health care, the  homeless and AIDS-related programs.  </P> <P> Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who successfully pushed for a similar half-cent sales  tax for mass transit nearly 10 years ago, failed to win board support for his  latest proposal to raise $400 million annually for such county programs.  </P> <P> Only board Chairman Ed Edelman joined Hahn in backing the measure, which would  have been placed before county voters on the June, 1990, ballot. But the  board's conservative majority -- Supervisors Mike Antonovich, Deane Dana and  Pete Schabarum -- opposed the idea, claiming in part that the public is already  overtaxed.  </P> <P> But the supervisors agreed to explore other possible funding sources.  </P></p>

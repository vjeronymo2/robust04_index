			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Goodies in a mixed bag: Trends in UK retailing As the UK government waded through the latest batch of retail statistics this week, it had reason to feel some summer-time cheer. With economists watching carefully to see how the UK recovery will weather April's tax rises, the verdict from the high streets seems to be 'steady as she goes'. So far there is little sign that consumers have responded to the tax increases by slashing spending. Retail sales volumes rose by a healthy 0.9 per cent between March and May, compared to the previous three months, and were 3.9 per cent higher in May than the same month last year. But neither do consumers show any hint of embarking on a 1980s-style consumer binge. There was no growth in sales volumes between April and May and prices remain subdued. Though the signs are encouraging for Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, who committed himself to recovery free of boom and bust this week, excessive celebration could be premature. One reason is that consumers have yet to feel the full tax pinch. Though the increases in national insurance contributions and the cut in mortgage tax relief were felt in household budgets in April, the introduction of value added tax on fuel will not hit quarterly fuel bills until this summer. A warning note against any premature celebration was sounded by this week's Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey. This showed that only 44 per cent of retailers believed business was better than a year ago. The proportion of retailers who were pessimistic about trading conditions increased between April and May. This increased wariness about business prospects together with flat monthly sales indicated by the Central Statistical Office might hint at a tax-induced slow down. But most analysts warn against too much gloom. A recent Gallup survey showed that consumer confidence, although subdued, rose in May. Meanwhile the CSO's monthly figures need to be treated with caution, since Easter holiday spending straddled March and April this year, leaving its statisticians uncertain about how to adjust for the seasonal swing. Another reason for treating these numbers with caution is that monthly figures remain volatile, and include a kaleidoscope of variations according to regions, sectors and types of stores. A better conclusion to draw from the divergences in data may be that the tax rises are hitting consumer groups differently, while the retail sector is going through structural changes. One striking trend in the CBI survey, evident through much of the recession, is that large store chains have performed better than smaller groups and independent stores. While 54 per cent of multiple outlets said sales increased in May compared with the previous year, only 28 per cent of single outlets agreed. This may be because large chains can offer better value for money than small stores. As the recession made consumers more price-conscious, big stores were able to harness their buying power and the distribution systems they developed in the 1980s. That might explain some of the discrepancies between the CBI and CSO data, says Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at Midland Global Markets, who says the CBI survey gives greater weight to smaller - and now gloomier - businesses. Different retail sectors are also experiencing mixed fortunes. Food retailing, for example, is competitive, partly due to structural factors. Superstore operators such as Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll, owner of Safeway, have been forced to respond to the rapid growth of cut-price competitors such as Kwik Save, by cutting prices and gross profit margins. The 'big three' groups all recently reported small increases so far this year in like-for-like sales volumes, which exclude newly-opened stores. However, supermarkets' prices were in many cases lower than last year, resulting in an overall fall in the value of like-for-like sales. The superstore groups predict continuing slow growth and pressure on prices, holding margins down. The Do-It-Yourself sector, which like food retailing increased floorspace and pushed up margins in the late 1980s, continues to struggle, owing partly to the uncertainty in the housing market. Clothing, however, is performing better. Marks and Spencer, Next and Storehouse all recently announced healthy increases in sales, and in the CBI survey 56 per cent of clothing retailers and 85 per cent of footwear and leather retailers said sales were up in May. Not just sectors, but different regions are seeing different levels of performance. Mr John Bowes, corporate marketing director for CWS, the largest co-operative retailer, which has both small shops and superstores across the UK, said Scotland and Northern Ireland were trading well, and south-east England was recovering. The north-east remained competitive, while trading was difficult in areas of high unemployment such as the Midlands. There is also evidence to suggest that people on lower incomes suffered to a greater extent from the April tax increases. Shoprite, the Scottish discount food retailer, which targets the less well-off C2DE customers, recently announced profit figures well below expectations. Kwik Save, the UK's largest discount food retailer, with a similar customer profile to Shoprite, was one of the few other retailers to agree that the tax increases had hit its customers hard. Nearly all retailers and economists agree that the 1990s recession, unlike that of the 1980s, has left consumers value-conscious, and likely to remain so when the good times return. 'There is more money for discretionary spending, but it needs the right things, good products at good prices, to bring it out,' said Mr Kevin Hawkins, corporate affairs director at WH Smith. These pressures could explain why retailers remain gloomy in CBI surveys despite good volumes, says Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salamon Brothers. Indeed Mr James May, director-general of the British Retail Consortium, which represents more than 90 per cent of retailers, argues that weak margins may yet force shops to push up prices. But there is little sign of upward price pressure at the moment. And while canny consumers may not make for happy shop-owners, they are good news for a government trying to keep recovery on course without overheating.</p>

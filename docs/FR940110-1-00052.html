			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cancellation fees identified in paragraph (vi) above, where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is purchase, construction or rehabilitation of housing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the borrower is required to pay the fee, are a cost of financing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such purchase, construction or rehabilitation and therefore are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized uses of funds under the AHP. Because the advance would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be converted to a direct subsidy, such cancellation fees would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payable only if the application also meets the requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification of applications contained in &sect;960.11 of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. (These requirements are discussed in greater detail in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification section below.) However, AHP subsidized advances or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct subsidies may not be used to pay for cancellation fees in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations where the cancellation of the advance is not part of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restructuring that results in the purchase, construction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation of housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The conditions identified in paragraph (vii) above on the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of funds under the AHP for refinancing are intended to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the funds are not used by the borrower to take out its equity in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the project and to ensure that the funds are used for authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes under the AHP. The Board specifically requests comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on whether the $2,500 minimum per unit is a reasonable minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount to be required to be spent on rehabilitation in conjunction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a refinancing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Questions have arisen as to whether funds under the AHP should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used to pay for pre-development costs that may or may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing. Pre-development costs are costs incurred prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closing of a purchase, construction or rehabilitation loan for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of determining the feasibility of a proposed project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of pre-development costs include architectural and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engineering fees, legal fees, the costs of surveys and appraisals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local building permit and planning fees, and earnest money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits. Since AHP applications are required to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold feasibility requirement provided in proposed &sect;960.9(d)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to be scored, authorizing the use of funds for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-development costs raises the question how applications for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such costs can or should be scored since the funds would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disbursed to applicants before the feasibility of a proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project could be established.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, there is a greater likelihood that costs incurred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the pre-feasibility period, rather than during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> post-feasibility period, will not result in the purchase,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction or rehabilitation of housing. Thus, if applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for AHP funds to finance pre-development costs are approved, AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds in perhaps significant amounts could go towards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-development costs that do not result in the financing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of housing. If such costs are authorized, one option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for dealing with this concern could be to cap the total amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP funds that may be used for pre-development costs at a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollar amount or percentage, such as the lesser of $200,000 or 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the Bank's total AHP contributions for the year. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds could be set aside and disbursed in a separate competitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board specifically requests comments on whether funds under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AHP should be used for pre-development costs, how applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for such costs can or should be scored, and what limits, if any,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be placed on the amount of funds used for such purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the AHP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Use of Funds Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.4(b)(1)(i) of the proposed rule provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total amount of a direct subsidy provided by the Bank to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant under the AHP must be passed on by the applicant to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipient. Consistent with &sect;960.9(c) of the Board's existing AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, &sect;960.4(b)(1)(ii) of the proposed rule provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an applicant receiving a subsidized advance shall extend credit to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the borrower at a rate of interest equal to the rate of interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charged on the subsidized advance plus an interest rate spread  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by the Bank. See 12 CFR 960.9(c). These provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act, which provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board's AHP regulation shall ensure that AHP subsidies provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Banks to applicants are passed on to the ultimate borrower. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.4(b)(2) of the proposed rule provides that if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant receives a subsidized advance or direct subsidy from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank or prepayment of a loan originally made under the AHP, any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest or other income earned by the applicant on such funds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not including any approved fee or interest rate spread charged to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the borrower, must be forwarded to the Bank to be used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional AHP projects, except for interest or other income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earned by the applicant within 30 calendar days of receiving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidized advance or direct subsidy or of receiving prepayment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a loan originally made under the AHP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.4(b)(3) of the proposed rule provides that a direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy received by an applicant from a Bank that is provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such applicant to a sponsor may be lent by the sponsor in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection with an AHP rental housing project involving low-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing tax credits (LIHTC), provided the subsidy is lent by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsor for a term of not less than 30 years, with all principal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and interest payments deferred until the end of such term. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a loan is repaid before the end of the 30-year term, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entire amount of the direct subsidy must be repaid to the Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> DAWN UPSHAW IN INAUGURAL RECITAL  </P> <P> With its muted, dusky-rose interior, near-perfect sight lines and 756-patron  capacity, the 2-month-old Irvine Barclay Theatre on the campus of UC Irvine  would seem to be the ideal recital hall.  </P> <P> In fact, it is. Dawn Upshaw, the young American soprano now on the roster of  the Metropolitan Opera, gave the first solo recital in the hall on Thursday  night, and proved so.  </P> <P> This was no debut for the 30-year-old singer from Illinois. Upshaw was first  introduced to Los Angeles-area audiences in a recital at Ambassador Auditorium  nearly three years ago; subsequently, she has sung with the L.A. Philharmonic  at the Music Center.  </P> <P> Her accomplishments, then, could be no surprise, but they could delight, as  they did, in an unhackneyed and satisfying program just a bit short on variety.  Through it all -- music by Purcell, Poulenc, Wolf, Rachmaninoff and Barber,  with encores by Mozart and Ives -- Upshaw was handsomely assisted by pianist  Margo Garrett.  </P> <P> Upshaw was again a thorough and careful song-interpreter, delineating moods,  delivering textual nuances, indicating the thrust and direction of musical  lines.  </P> <P> Still, a diva she ain't. She does not sweep onto the stage like many of her  operatic colleagues; her recital deportment and manner of bowing have nothing  of artifice about them; haughty is not in her repertory.  </P> <P> But the voice is pristine, true, and truly pretty, if not yet distinctive, and  used with intelligence. In her singing, words emerge clear and understandable;  meaning follows. Upshaw the artist creates atmosphere and paints emotions.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most beauteous tone produced in this performance came in Mozart's  "Das Veilchen," the first encore, and an object-lesson in the perfect blending  of song and singer -- genuine type-casting. Upshaw also excelled in projecting  the moods -- also mostly melancholy -- of the six songs in Rachmaninoff's Opus  38. She did the same for Poulenc's subtle "Fiancailles pour rire" and six  lieder of Hugo Wolf.  </P> <P> What proved far from ideal in this program was Upshaw's choice to end with five  of Samuel Barber's wondrous "Hermit Songs." Temperamentally, as well as  vocally, these items, though given honest and sincere performances, did not  suit the soprano at all, but instead revealed a shallowness -- of tone and  artistry -- one would not have expected from hearing the earlier part of the  evening.

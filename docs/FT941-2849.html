			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Oliver takes first step on road to recovery Oliver Group, the multiple shoe retailer, has marked the first stage of its recovery programme with a return to the black in the year ended January 1 1994. Following its exit from non-core activities, the group turned in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 244,000, compared with a restated Pounds 20.87m loss previously. The shares rose 4p to 48p yesterday. Sales in the year fell by 10 per cent to Pounds 73.6m, largely reflecting an average of 72 fewer branches than last time. However, on a like-for-like basis sales growth was 5.7 per cent, which Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, said 'represents a promising step forward.' Mr Cassidy said this year had started well with sales in the first 10 weeks ahead of last year on a like for like basis and in line with expectations. At the trading level, the profit was Pounds 1.12m (Pounds 11.26m loss) before a Pounds 489,000 surplus (Pounds 7.53m loss) on disposal of properties. There was also a Pounds 277,000 charge this time for closure costs, which mainly comprised a Pounds 261,000 goodwill write-off on the Brick Studio business. Net interest was halved to Pounds 1.09m, helped by falling interest rates, a Pounds 2.85m increase in cash and a Pounds 2.7m fall in bank borrowings. Gearing was reduced to 58 per cent (73.1 per cent). Earnings per share were 1.49p (82.08p losses). Again no dividend has been declared - none has been paid since 1991. Mr Cassidy said major improvements in children's footwear ranges had produced impressive gains in 1993. 'We intend to push home this advantage in 1994,' he added.</p>

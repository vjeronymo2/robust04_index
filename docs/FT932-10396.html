			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Sport: Formula which can't find success - Motor Racing THE British Grand Prix at Silverstone is one of the premier events in the sporting calendar, attracting a crowd in excess of 200,000 over three days. The 16 grand prix that make up the world championship all draw big crowds. But motor racing, unlike some other sports, resembles a head without a body. International football matches may pull the punters in, but so does the Premier League every week. Test matches attract big crowds, but so do the one-day knock-out competitions. Apart from the grand prix, however, attendances at motor races are usually very small. Last Monday, there was a Formula 3000 meeting at Donington Park. You have probably never heard of the formula but, in the motor racing pecking order, it is second only to Formula One. The cars look like F1 cars. The engines are very powerful, the racing is always close and, for the drivers, it is the last stepping-stone before F1. Since it was introduced in 1985, virtually all grand prix drivers have graduated via F3000. Yet the crowd at Donington Park was a paltry 5,000 and the one for the meeting at Silverstone tomorrow will be little better. The problem is not confined to Britain. Only when the race is held during a grand prix weekend, as at Spa in Belgium or Hockenheim in Germany, do attendances become respectable. The other exception is the street race at Pau in the Pyrennees when motor racing goes to the people. The fact that F3000 meetings attract such small crowds is partly a function of the limited draw which motor racing remains outside F1. But that is not the only reason. F3000, unlike F1 is starved of publicity. The key is television. This has transformed the profile of F1 since the mid-70s, and is now beginning to work its magic on the British touring car championship which is being broadcast regularly by the BBC. Apart from small satellite stations, however, F3000 gets no television coverage whatsoever. Wandering around a more or less empty Donington last Monday, the inevitable question was: how does the whole thing survive? There are few spectators, no television receipts, and little advertising. And F3000 does not come cheap: a new Reynard, the dominant chassis this year, costs Pounds 115,000, two engines for the season a further Pounds 125,000, and the electronics some Pounds 30,000. This is just for one car, and most teams run two. Then there are the staff, perhaps 15 or so full-time. One could go on: the tyre bill for the average team at Donington was over Pounds 7,000. And then there are the fixed costs, the transporters, the office and so forth. Keith Wiggins, the owner of one of the top teams, Pacific Racing, estimates that, to do the full nine-race season with two cars, he needs to raise Pounds 1.2m, most of it through sponsorship. So far the team has Pounds 600,000. Unlike in F1, though, where the teams raise the bulk of the sponsorship money themselves, in F3000 the drivers are responsible for getting most of it. In Pacific's case that means more than 80 per cent. The two drivers, David Coulthard and Michael Bartels from Germany, have raised money from British and German companies including Crooks Healthcare, Highland Spring and RH Allurad, a German wheelmaker. So what happens if teams like Pacific fail to raise all the money they need for the season? A favoured route is for teams to replace drivers in mid-season with new drivers who can bring in additional finance. Cars can appear for the second half of the season with a new driver and even in a new sponsor's livery. Failing that the team can be forced to withdraw, which is by no means unknown, especially in the present economic climate. The life of a F3000 driver, who is generally in his early or mid-20s, is clearly not an easy one. Apart from driving, he has to raise most of his team's money. The personal financial rewards, meanwhile, are strictly limited. The top drivers may earn in the region of Pounds 50,000-Pounds 70,000, but most earn closer to Pounds 30,000, all paid directly by the sponsors. The lure for them is the promise of a career in F1. So what about television? The rights, as for F1, are held by F1 Constructors' Association and its boss, Bernie Ecclestone. Ecclestone has, it would appear, always been disinclined to give F3000 the boost it needs, perhaps for fear of detracting from the golden egg, F1. At the moment his worries are well-founded. With F1 a dull and predictable procession, the crowds at this season's European grand prix meetings have been down and no doubt this is also reflected in television audiences. Meanwhile, the British touring car championship is busy demonstrating that F1 need not have a monopoly of the big crowds. At the meeting last Monday at Snetterton near Thetford, a record crowd of over 20,000 crammed into the circuit. Last year, a similar meeting at Brands Hatch attracted nearly 50,000. There is no substitute for the power of television in modern sport.</p>

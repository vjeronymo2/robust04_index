			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Technology: Olympic chips go for the gold - The race to build mega-memory devices and asks what advantages they will bring An international team of some 200 semiconductor engineers is gathering in East Fishkill, about 70 miles north of New York, to begin one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the chip industry. This elite group, drawn from the ranks of International Business Machines, Toshiba and Siemens, is to develop a 256 Mbit dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) - a data storage device for use in 21st century computers. The 256 Mbit memory chip is the next grand challenge of semiconductor engineering. It represents a 16-fold increase in the storage capacity of memory chips and promises to transform computers into talking, thinking, listening machines that are different from anything that has gone before. First, however, several critical technology hurdles must be overcome at an expected cost of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m). Hence the decision announced earlier this week by IBM, Toshiba and Siemens to share their expertise and divide the huge costs and very significant technological risks of this project. The costs will be 'generally shared' among the three partners, said Jack Kuehler, president of IBM. But there is far more than money at stake. For each of the participants, success is critical to their ability to remain leaders in the global electronics market. 'Time to market is the key issue,' explains Kuehler. These champions of the chip industry have entered a race against world-class competitors from the US, Japan and Korea. And the company that brings 256 Mbit D-Ram technology to market first stands to reap huge rewards. This semiconductor 'Olympics' will test technological strength and financial staying power, with only the best in the world qualifying. The chipmakers are 'going for the gold', but if today's dismal D-Ram market is any indication, they cannot be sure of winning many profits from the sale of this future generation of memory chips. Currently, D-Ram prices are slumping and supply is outstripping demand. Why then pursue the 256 Mbit goal? The big payback may not come until long after this race is run. Like Olympic champions who are showered with lucrative commercial endorsements after the games, the winners of the 256 Mbit event hope to create technology that will reap long-term benefits. The D-Ram is a 'technology driver'; a proving ground for new generations of semiconductor production technology. The semiconductor structures, production tools and processes needed to cram 256m memory cells on to a silicon chip will go a long way towards enabling the development of logic chips, such as microprocessors, that are vastly more powerful than today's most advanced devices. 'Today we have the capacity to build chips with 2m or 3m circuits. What we are aiming for is a chip with more than 256m transistors,' says Michael Attardo, IBM vice president and general manager of technology products. These 'megachips' will combine logic and memory functions on a single chip, he predicts. 'We are talking about a mainframe computer on a single chip; a single chip solution.' If a pocket-sized IBM mainframe does not sound appealing, think again. Megachips will make computers 'much, much more friendly,' Attardo maintains. The 256 Mbit technology will 'overcome the barriers to enable computers to pervade the masses'. Can shrinking semiconductor circuits really change the world? History provides some powerful examples of the impact of chip technology breakthroughs. The 64 Kbit (64,000 memory cells) D-Ram, along with early microprocessor devices, spawned the personal computer. Today's 4 Mbit and 16 Mbit memory chips, together with 16 bit microprocessors, provide the power for notebook-sized computers. Less well-recognised are the contributions of semiconductor technology in other types of 'hidden' applications; inside cars, domestic appliances, medical instrumentation, factory robots, telecommunications equipment and a myriad of consumer electronics products. By shrinking semiconductor circuits to less than half of their current size, chip makers will be able to make a quantum leap forward in the level of computing power that will fit into a matchbox. The initial impact, however, will inevitably be in the computer field. Higher capacity D-Rams will enable low-cost computers to handle more sophisticated software, the coded instructions that control electronic 'brains'. Complex tasks such as speech recognition and electronic vision which currently require high-priced computer power, and even then frequently fail to live up to expectations, could become an everyday reality. Thus the 'personal computer' of the future will probably speak and be spoken to. The familiar computer keyboard may become an anachronism; something that you might choose to use when composing a written communication, but certainly not the primary man-machine interface. Yet several technological barriers still stand in the way. The most challenging is to shrink semiconductor circuit elements. The 'line width', the critical dimension of micro-miniature circuit patterns on a chip, must come down to 0.25 microns ( a micron is a millionth of a metre), or about 1/300th the thickness of a human hair. Today's most advanced optical lithography systems, in which circuit patterns are imprinted on silicon using a photographic-like process, are capable of getting down to line widths of about half a micron. Until recently, many semiconductor researchers, including those at IBM, thought that it would be necessary to switch from optical lithography to X-ray lithography to create the minute circuit elements of a 256 Mbit D-Ram, greatly increasing the cost of manufacturing. The latest research suggests, however, that it may be possible to fabricate all but a few critical levels of the chip's structure using highly refined optical methods. This is what the IBM-Toshiba-Siemens team aims to do. Another crucial issue will be to ensure the intrinsic reliability of the semiconductor device as the size of individual transistors shrinks to the thickness of a few atoms. The physical and electrical properties of such finely carved materials have been explored in laboratories but never before tested in a commercial product. There is also the challenge of avoiding defects. Although today's most advanced semiconductor plants are far cleaner than any surgical operating room, the chip plants of the future will have to be 100 per cent cleaner. This will probably mean isolating equipment from human contact, which will require higher levels of automation. IBM believes that it will take four to five years to overcome these challenges and to develop a 'production ready' 256 Mbit D-Ram. Only then will decisions be made about where and by whom the new generation of chips will be put into volume production. Building a plant to manufacture 256 Mbit chips is expected to cost in the region of another Dollars 1bn. Yet the 256 Mbit D-Ram is not the end of the story. Already, IBM and other chip makers have begun work in their laboratories on a 1 Gigabit D-Ram, with four times as much storage capacity again. The relentless pace of semiconductor technology progress demands that chip makers work on several generations of devices at once. Thus, the 16 Mbit D-Ram has only recently gone into full-scale production, while 64 Mbit D-Rams are in the later stages of development. The 256 Mbit D-Ram development project has been initiated, yet research on a 1 Gbit chip is already under way. The financial and technological risks are enormous. 'To be competitive we cannot afford to wait until the development of one generation is complete before starting another,' Kuehler explains. Neither can IBM and its partners wait until the chip design is complete before constructing a new plant for the next generation of chips. 'To stay in the race we have to commit to using certain types of production tools even before we have completed development,' adds Attardo. Finding partners to spread the risks has become imperative. The ability to find the right partners and manage high-risk joint development ventures may well become the critical skill of the semiconductor industry of the next century.</p>

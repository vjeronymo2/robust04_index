Addressing the press in Kampala on his return home  from a brief visit to Tanzania, Mr. Museveni suggested that the  leaders of Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Zaire, and Zambia hold a  meeting immediately to find a lasting solution to the Burundi  conflict. He said the formerly minor historical issue in  Burundi had over the decades been complicated by mismanagement.  The Ugandan leader blamed some foreign countries for the  mismanagement of affairs in both Burundi and Rwanda. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Thais urge general to resign as prime minister ABOUT 80,000 Thais surrounded parliament last night demanding that the general who engineered a coup last year resign from his new position of prime minister, police said. As room for compromise between Gen Suchinda and his critics appeared to dwindle, a group of academics appealed to the king to defuse the crisis by dissolving parliament and calling another general election. The Thai monarch would have the power to do that although he normally keeps strictly above politics. Some observers say his intervention might be the only way to break the deadlock. Maj-Gen Chamlong Srimuang, former Bangkok governor and leader of one of the opposition parties, continued the hunger strike he began on Monday. His threat to die if Gen Suchinda does not resign has brought a number of normally passive supporters out on to the street in front of parliament where he is encamped, communicating only in writing. He has predicted he will last only seven days, adding urgency to the crisis which has caused panic on the stock market, whose share price index shed 43.36 points yesterday to close at 717.62. So far, the protests have been peaceful, but observers fear there is a real danger of unrest if Gen Suchinda remains prime minister, as is his constitutional right, and Maj-Gen Chamlong dies. Maj-Gen Chamlong, whose party took 32 of the 35 seats in Bangkok in the March 22 general election, has gained popularity as a modest-living politician. For either to back down would mean a serious loss of face and reputation. Opposition MPs boycotted the start of yesterday's debate when the prime minister presented his first policy statement to parliament. After that, they launched a barrage of criticism, questioning his ability to fulfil promises to maintain democratic government. They accused him of destroying democracy by engineering last year's coup d'etat and putting himself and his military friends in key positions. Members of the five-party coalition defended their constitutional right to pick an outsider to be prime minister. Opposition MPs also addressed the rally outside parliament where the more emotive speeches concentrated on Gen Suchinda's earlier promise not to accept the premiership after this year's election. One MP said the planned 12-hour debate on the policy statement would be a waste of time because Gen Suchinda's word was 'worthless'. MPs, who were expecting to continue until midnight, were caught by surprise when Gen Suchinda left parliament shortly before 6pm and the debate ended abruptly without any explanation. Some opposition MPs said the prime minister feared for his safety because of the large numbers outside parliament. The debate is scheduled to to continue today.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Observer: Battle-ready The search is on for a new general secretary of the Society for Practitioners of Insolvency following the abrupt resignation of the incumbent after only nine months in the job. Indeed, Edward Lowndes has already left - not just the organisation but also the country, partly, it would seem, because he was fed up with the bitter rivalry between the society, which has become the public face of insolvency practitioners, and the rival Institute of Practitioners of Insolvency, which licenses them. Clearly he prefers a more peaceful life. He has taken up a job as administrator to the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Olivier Alsteens: "Toward a European Nuclear </F> Deterrent?"]    [Text] On Thursday 16 June, the Western European Union  [WEU] Assembly will examine the report presented by [Belgian MP]  Armand De Decker on the role and future of nuclear weapons.  This document was adopted unanimously by the Defense Committee  -- including, the author stresses, by the French.    The document was a long time in coming, taking the Liberal  deputy to Washington, Moscow, Paris, and London. One of its  main conclusions is to invite the WEU to create a strategic  study group charged with eventually setting up a true European  nuclear deterrent policy.    Armand De Decker says that in Washington he witnessed "a  veritable cultural revolution in the nuclear domain." It is  true that the Americans have considerably revised their  positions since the end of the Cold War -- "now they have pulled  all their nuclear weapons out of Europe with the exception of  700 small airborne bombs whose significance is more symbolic  than military." De Decker attributes this shift in direction to  the absolute supremacy that the United States has acquired in  the field of conventional warfare.    In Moscow, on the other hand, the nuclear issue appears to  be  returning in force. The document continues: "It seems to us to  be less and less likely that the Russian Parliament will ratify  the Start II agreements. The Russian military world is today  much more independent and dominant than it was during the  Communist era." Moreover, since the Russian authorities can no  longer base their supremacy on conventional weapons, they appear  to be taking an interest in the nuclear domain: "They justified  this by stressing the threat that China will pose in the 21st  century. A nuclear China therefore has indirect repercussions  on security in Europe."    De Decker accepts his previous mistake by revising his  critical positions with regard to the Partnership for Peace  being proposed to the Russians: "The United States was right.  We must go along with Russia and increase our exchanges on the  political level, civil servants, students, etc."    To establish a real European nuclear deterrent, it is vital  to be able to count on the two European powers that already  possess a nuclear strike capacity, namely France and Great  Britain. The British view appears to be clear enough: Their  nuclear force is integrated into NATO's resources with the aim  of "defending the vital interests of Great Britain." This  definition also covers Britain's allies.    On the French side, things are less clear. The idea of vital  interests has never been precisely defined. "However," De  Decker continues, "the doctrine inherited from General de Gaulle  proved itself to be the most reasonable. France never took part  in the arms race. When the Russians and Americans were talking  of limited response, the French stuck to the policy of a final  warning followed by a massive response. That is the most  credible deterrent."    Could France agree to abandon sovereignty over its nuclear  arsenal? De Decker assures us: "The question cannot be couched  in those terms. Things will be done gradually, not overnight.  For example, we could start by setting up a nuclear planning  group based on the NATO model. The Americans always retained  the final say on when their missiles were to be used, even if  they were carried on Belgian, Dutch, Turkish, or Italian planes."    Armand De Decker optimistically claimed he was convinced  that  if General de Gaulle were president of France today, "he would  be very much in favor of a European nuclear deterrent." The  situation has changed considerably since de Gaulle initiated the  French nuclear doctrine, he said: "Today France has its nuclear  weaponry and Great Britain is involved in the process of  European integration. De Gaulle would today defend the  importance and autonomy of Europe." De Decker moreover sees in  this the reason why the Russians and the Americans are now  fighting for a ban on nuclear testing: "It is to prevent Europe  from designing its own weapons system and thus to respond to a  threat that could come from the East, the Middle East, or North  Africa."</p>

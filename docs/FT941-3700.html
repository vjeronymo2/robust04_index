			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Senior BT managers may face compulsory redundancy Senior managers at British Telecom, Britain's largest company, some earning annual salaries of over Pounds 100,000, face the prospect of compulsory redundancy in the coming financial year as the company's drive to cut jobs reaches top managers. Managers earning more than Pounds 50,000 a year are the first to be targeted in BT's drive to cut 15,000 jobs by March 31 1995. The company said 30 to 35 of its 170 managers at director level, who earn on average Pounds 76,000 a year, are being encouraged to leave. Mr Michael Hepher, BT's group managing director, said: 'We need to reduce the number of senior managers significantly by the end of next March. But there are simply not enough volunteers coming forward.' BT's threat of compulsory redundancies for senior managers - extremely rare among large companies - marks a further toughening of its stance. Earlier this year the group froze the basic wages of most managers for this calendar year, and suspended its year-old performance-related pay scheme which it said was too expensive. Only 245 senior managers have taken voluntary redundancy in the current financial year, which is just 3 per cent of the 6,957 senior managers on personal contracts, says BT. In the same period 7,700 engineering staff left, about 9 per cent of the total in these grades. In 1992-93 about 630 senior managers left. BT employs 153,000 staff. 'We will do everything we can to encourage sufficient volunteers but we must face the possibility that, if there are too few volunteers, we will have to move away from a purely voluntary approach for senior managers,' Mr Hepher warned. Compensation payments at BT range from 40 weeks' pay for 10 years of service to a maximum of 72 weeks' pay for 14 years. Staff who have been with the company since before 1971 will get three years' pay. Leaders of the Society of Telecom Executives, which represents BT's middle managers, accused BT of breaching an assurance they alleged had been given last year by Mr Hepher that there would be no compulsory redundancies.</p>

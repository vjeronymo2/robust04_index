			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Quotes of the day 'I have no illusions about how I will be disowned and marginalised about my decision to speak my mind.' Far from providing a sounding board, the shadow cabinet in these circumstances operates as a gag and a straitjacket which suppresses real debate.' Bryan Gould 'It gives an idea of his order of priorities. It seems to be serving the interests of Bryan Gould and not the party.' Bill Jordan AEEU president on Gould's resignation 'The chancellor appears to be on a wholly different course from that of his colleagues and the prime minister has not made up his mind which faction he supports.' John Smith on government disunity 'Two Johns - John Major and John Smith - will decide whether Maastricht goes through the House of Commons.' Tony Benn 'The party . . . has to plan for the future in the light of a considerably reduced income in real terms compared with the last parliament.' Labour party statement of accounts 1991 'The platform cost Pounds 33,000 to build. You can buy a semi-detached house in Bolsover for that.' Dennis Skinner</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Letter: Parties which came out ahead in Maxwell affair A curious silence from one corner of the City prompts a comment about one element of the Maxwell affair that Bronwen Maddox has not explored: who came out ahead? Aside from amounts retained by the Maxwell family interests, and advisers' fees, most of the missing Pounds 900m-odd was paid across in 1990-91 ultimately to bona fide shareholders exiting Maxwell Communications Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers. These investors had originally taken the decision to back Robert Maxwell and his companies, and in the absence of willing buyers for their shares they should by rights have incurred the full consequences of corporate failure. But the share support operations enabled them to avoid such a fate, by benefiting from the receipt of hot money taken from MGN pensioners and others. There is of course no obligation for shareholders who should have lost out, but didn't, to reimburse those that shouldn't, but did. But it is important to identify where most of that missing money went, and to reflect that at least some parties - including eventually some pension funds - did comparatively well out of the Maxwell affair.

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / IMF World Economic Outlook: IMF wants action to bring expansion THE International Monetary Fund yesterday urged governments to take 'effective action' to increase world growth by a combined programme of cuts in interest rates, together with moves to bring down state borrowing. The suggestion, in the Fund's World Economic Outlook, published yesterday, is aimed primarily at Germany, where the level of interest rates has a big effect on borrowing conditions throughout Europe, and where the fiscal deficit has soared since reunification. The study sees 'a considerable risk' that the prospective fall in interest rates across Europe, sparked by likely Bundesbank easing in the coming months, 'might occur too late or be insufficient to contain the negative forces' damping European economic activity and raising unemployment. According to a possible programme of action outlined by the IMF, the 'principal contribution' to a world growth package would be 'a further, significant and progressive reduction in interest rates, starting in Germany'. The IMF says the idea of lower interest rates 'is generally warranted in light of the current weakness of activity and declining inflation in most (industrial) countries'. At the same time industrial nations should cut their rising government deficits to boost confidence of financial markets and clear the way to steady long-term economic expansion. The IMF has slashed its growth projection for the EC this year, arguing this will be a minuscule 0.1 per cent. In its last outlook, last October, it said EC growth would be 2.3 per cent in 1993. Growth in the US is more encouraging and is picking up virtually as predicted six months ago. However, Mr Michael Mussa, director of the IMF's research department, yesterday called on the US government to show 'somewhat more movement' in pushing down its large fiscal deficit, which on current plans is to come down to about 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 1998, excluding social security payments. Even then, it was 'desirable' to cut the deficit by a further 2 percentage points 'over the longer term'. The expected recovery in the international economy is 'hesitant and uneven', the report says, with prospects affected by factors in many nations, including 'extensive balance sheet restructuring, persistently high short-term real interest rates, considerable financial tensions and depressed levels of consumer and business confidence'.</p>

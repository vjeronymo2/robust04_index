			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Something is rotten . . .: FT writers with tales of corporate embarrassment across Europe Something is awry in the soul of corporate Europe. This is the conclusion that can be drawn from headlines this week with disconcerting implications for European boardrooms. Blue-chip groups in several countries have been caught up in allegations of malpractice, casting a shadow over share prices and corporate images across the continent. The reality, however, is not that leading companies in Germany and France - at the centre of this week's episodes - have been suddenly infected by the corruption endemic in Italy during the past decade. Rather, a combination of circumstances - a long and severe recession, a changing relationship between government and business and a less forgiving climate in the media and among the judiciary - has conspired to bring wrongdoing into the open. Mr David Roche of Independent Strategy, the London-based analysis group, says: 'Europe has been too cosy. Now the cold winds are blowing. Stones are being turned up and we're finding lots of maggots underneath.' The most recent business scandals have occurred in continental Europe. But the UK, where the recession came earlier, is by no means immune. In contrast to the Continent, the central figures in large British corporate misdoings in recent years - the collapse of the Robert Maxwell empire, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and Polly Peck International in the early 1990s - have often been 'outsiders', not members of the business establishment. Mr Ian Huntingdon, a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, suggests one reason why scandals directly involving top company figures are less prevalent in the UK is because management controls are more efficient, partly because of growing emphasis on non-executive directors. Mr Dieter Schweer, company news editor at the German economic weekly, Wirtschaftswoche, points to the importance of the sharp German recession in 1992-93 in casting a spotlight on impropriety: 'The (economic) crisis means that weaknesses have become obvious. Skeletons which you used to be able to hide in the balance sheet are now on view.' Mr Volkert Klaucke, managing partner at the Mees Pierson merchant bank in Frankfurt, underlines the change of mood in management and in the press. 'What has changed is the way fraud is handled. In the past, it would have been covered up.' The change reflects, he says, 'the increased aggressiveness of the press' as well as 'a more open corporate culture' in Germany, as younger people ascend the corporate ladder. More rigorous attitudes seem to have been spurred by the uncovering, over the past three years, of widespread illicit ties between Italian politicians and business. As Le Soir, the Belgian daily paper, put it in a front-page editorial on Thursday, the political and business scandals in Belgium 'reflect a new era, in which judges no longer hesitate to question the most powerful as well as the most humble'. Mr Elie Cohen, a Paris university professor, says: 'Judges now feel free to investigate companies, while before they felt it was impossible.' Mr Rolf Breuer, chairman of the German Stock Exchange and a director of Deutsche Bank, warns about drawing sweeping conclusions from the reported spate of misdeeds. 'In Italy, Spain and now in France, management were involved in corruption, for example bribing civil servants. This is not comparable with our crop of scandals in Germany.' However, whatever the reasons for the recent revelations, business is on the defensive. Mr Jacques Friedmann, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris, the insurance group, untouched by recent affairs, says: 'You must not put all of these cases together. They are all separate affairs and, when you look behind these cases, the issues seem quite small. One cannot infer that there is something rotten in the state of France.' Nevertheless, a common economic and political thread joins many of the cases that have emerged recently. They can be separated into three broad categories: Cases where charges against leading business personalities have yet to be laid, let alone proven, but have still caused embarrassment. On Monday, Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, France's third-largest industrial company, was held for more than 12 hours by magistrates investigating alleged misuse of corporate funds. Mr Suard, formally placed under investigation, was freed on bail of FFr1m (Pounds 110,000) early on Tuesday. He has denied any wrongdoing, and describes the investigation as 'a banal non-event'. Mr Suard's detention followed the imprisonment in Belgium for 12 days during May of Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of France's Schneider electrical group. He was been freed on bail, but remains under investigation for alleged fraud concerning two Belgian subsidiaries. He denies the accusations. Schneider has described his treatment in Belgium as 'outrageous'. In another controversial case, Mannesmann, the large German engineering company, on Wednesday decided not to elect Mr Werner Dieter, its outgoing chief executive, as chairman of its supervisory board. The Dusseldorf state prosecutor this week started investigating alleged fraud by Mr Dieter, who is said to have forced a Mannesmann subsidiary to buy hydraulic accessories at inflated prices from another company largely owned by the Dieter family. Mr Dieter said yesterday the allegations were 'grotesque'. Cases of corruption or malpractice that have been under investigation for some time, but have now reached or are approaching a public denouement. On Wednesday, Mr Alain Boublil, former chief aide to the late Mr Pierre Beregevoy, the former French finance minister and prime minister, was sentenced to two years in jail (one suspended) as a result of his conviction in an insider trading scandal dating back to 1988. On Wednesday, Belgian investigators laid fraud charges against the general manager of SMAP, the country's third-largest insurance company, as well as his predecessor and a Swiss insurance executive. This stems from long-running investigations into alleged illegal transactions at SMAP, including those linked to defence contracts. On Tuesday, a Milan court began a trial linked to L150bn of bribes allegedly paid to political parties by the Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group. The 32 defendants include Mr Bettino Craxi, the former prime minister, Mr Umberto Bossi, the founder of the Northern League, Mr Berlusconi's main coalition partner, and several of Montedison's former top executives. Cases where top European corporations, although not suspected themselves of acting improperly, have made serious errors in dealings with clients guilty of misdeeds. On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced the resignation of four senior executives following the publication of a critical auditor's report into the bank's lending to the now-bankrupt Jurgen Schneider property group. Deutsche Bank has faced unusually widespread criticism over the near-collapse at the end of last year of the Metallgesellschaft metals group, in which Deutsche is a big shareholder. After Metallgesellschaft's US trading subsidiary suffered large losses in oil futures markets, Deutsche Bank accused Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the group's former chief executive, of withholding information from the supervisory board - a charge he refutes. The Frankfurt banking community has also been hit by a scandal centred on Balsam, a Bielefeld-based sports flooring manufacturer. Four members of the Balsam board were arrested last month after its finance director confessed to a complex fraud involving Procedo, Germany's largest factoring company. Mr Breuer of Deutsche Bank admits that the three cases throw up a common question: 'Why didn't we detect them (the problems) earlier?' But he also points to differences. 'The Metallgesellschaft case was caused by management not telling the truth early enough (about losses in the oil derivatives business). Balsam was caused by a crook, and Schneider was a crook too. So do these three cases tell you a story? I doubt it . . . There are crooks everywhere.' However, Mr Adolf Rosenstock, chief economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt, says the repercussions go deeper. 'The companies came to grief because someone at the very top did something criminal or half-criminal.' He worries about German managers' lack of self-criticism. 'It is almost as though people do not dare ask the difficult questions for fear of bringing down the system.' Across Europe, investigations into business malpractices are proceeding at diverging paces. In Spain, long-standing inquiries into financial scandals involving the ruling Socialist party seem to have picked up momentum. The judge investigating alleged illegal financing of the Socialist party in the late 1980s has recently questioned the ex-chairman of Banco Central Hispano, one of the country's biggest private banks, over a Pounds 1m payment supposedly routed to the party. In France, the impression of an accelerating anti-corruption campaign has been heightened by the investigations into the business affairs of Mr Bernard Tapie, the Marseilles businessman and MP. In May, Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a former French magistrate, published a 'black book' alleging widespread malpractice in politics and business life. In France, corruption 'which in the US or the UK would immediately send a politician into a distant retreat' is tolerated, he claimed, as part of 'our national folklore'. One prominent French lawyer links the surge in investigations to the disappearance of 'the old administrative Jacobin society'. He says French magistrates have undoubtedly been influenced by Italy's anti-corruption drive. In Italy, on the other hand, after the upheavals of the past few years, the business community has now started to talk about bribery scandals in the past tense. Magistrates investigating corporate bribery cases are taking a lower profile, and Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government is examining ways to clear the backlog of cases, without exonerating the guilty. The proposals, not yet agreed, could include a form of plea-bargaining linked to the repayment of bribes. Mr Sergio Duca, partner with the Italian offshoot of accountants Price Waterhouse, says Italy's business community could set an example for others. 'Some people are starting to say we (the Italian business community) should regain a bit of credibility, because we were able to turn round, whereas other countries haven't yet done it.' Mr Duca's assessment looks over-optimistic. Yet it underlines that, in the league table of European business misdeeds, Italy no longer enjoys natural predominance.

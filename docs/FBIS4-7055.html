			<p>BFN     [Text] The Department of Intellectual Property has been  entrusted to draft a legislation for the protection of rice and  other crop varieties. Deputy Commerce Minister Churin  Laksanawisit says when the legislation takes effect, other  people will not be allowed to make use of the rice and other  crop varieties without consent of the owner who obtains specific  varieties through cross breeding. Mr. Churin says the  legislation will prevent other countries from taking Thai rice  varieties to be further developed in their countries to enable  them to become Thailand's major competitors for rice exports.    He says Vietnam has a policy to promote the cultivation of  Hom Mali variety because of better prices it fetches compared  with other varieties. However, the country has been faced with  the problem of plant diseases; therefore, its Hom Mali output is  still unsatisfactory.    Mr. Churin says Thailand and Vietnam have already concluded  a  memorandum of understanding on cooperation in rice exports.  Both countries will later hold consultations on prices of rice  exports. They may set the median price to avoid price  undercutting.</p>

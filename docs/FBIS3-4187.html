During the deliberations, the Guangxi NPC  deputies discussed and formulated a new blueprint for Guangxi's  economic growth in light of the region's realities, exchanged  views on a series of national issues, and pledged to make  concerted efforts to grasp each and every opportunity to deepen  reform and develop the economy.    Zhao Fulin [secretary of the regional party committee]  said: Premier Li Peng's work report embodied the spirit of the  14th CPC National Congress, realistically summed up the  country's work over the past year, and laid down encouraging  tasks for this year's work. Since the First Session of the  Eighth NPC, the people of all nationalities across Guangxi, like  people in other parts of the country, have unremittingly taken  as a guide Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, firmly adhered to the party's  basic line, and grasped each and every excellent opportunity to  deepen reform, with the result that Guangxi has enjoyed an  excellent situation with respect to nationality solidarity,  social stability, and economic growth. This year, the central  authorities are expected to unfold a series of reforms. We are  bound to encounter a host of difficulties and problems in this  process. In view of the situation, we should show concern for  the country's overall interests, observe discipline, and work  harder in a down-to-earth manner.    Zhao Fulin stated: In order to implement the spirit of the  current NPC session to the letter, it is imperative to make a  success of the following three aspects of work: 1) Deepening  reform -- In order to make a success of reform in 1994, we  should further emancipate our minds, transform ideological  concepts, properly handle ideological issues among cadres and  the masses, and resolve all types of social contradictions,  thereby making ourselves more adaptable to the new situation.  2) Working with one heart and one mind -- To this end, the  higher and lower levels should share weal and woe, and should  forge ahead jointly by braving wind and wave in the interests of  the whole country. The whole country's economic development and  growing economic strength definitely will push Guangxi's  economic development ahead, and will raise the Guangxi people's  living standards as well. To develop the economy, we should  build more communications and energy projects, establish more  overseas trade links, construct more infrastructure facilities,  improve the investment environment, readjust the industrial  structure, make more use of advanced science and technology, and  invigorate enterprises, as well as increase economic efficiency.  3) Strengthening unity within leading bodies, enhancing  nationality solidarity, intensifying comprehensive social order  management, persistently furthering the anticorruption struggle,  successfully carrying out propaganda and ideological work, and  stepping up legal system building.    Cheng Kejie [chairman of the regional people's government]  stated: Reviewing last year's work and looking forward to this  year's development, I am convinced that our party and country  are still full of hope. Last year, the whole country enjoyed  rapid economic growth, social stability, and improved livelihood  -- thanks to good leadership, correct policies, and stronger  efforts. This year, we are going to build more construction  projects in Guangxi. In view of this situation, apart from  redoubling efforts in this regard, we should conscientiously  study the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," volume three; arm  our minds with, and update ideological concepts according to  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory; unify understanding; enhance a  sense of urgency; treasure and seize each and every excellent  opportunity to deepen reform; improve the investment  environment; readjust the industrial structure; and provide more  assistance to poverty-stricken areas; thereby pushing ahead with  Guangxi's economic growth and social progress.    During the deliberations, Ren Xianchun and Xia Baofang, as  well as other Guangxi NPC deputies, also spoke one after another  in light of their respective local realities, putting forward  work proposals for this year and views on Premier Li Peng's work  report.</p>

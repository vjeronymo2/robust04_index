			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / ANC's mines policy 'potentially harmful' The South African mining industry yesterday criticised mining policy proposals put forward last month by the African National Congress. Mr Nick Segal, economics spokesman for the chamber, said that although it would be wrong to suggest the ANC's draft mining policy was 'entirely flawed', it included elements 'potentially highly injurious to the industry' and its role as the country's leading employer and foreign-exchange earner. Mr Segal said the chamber was concerned at the level of proposed state intervention in the sector and the implication that mining companies were not taking advantage of lucrative commercial opportunities by neglecting to develop mineral rights they owned. He was 'unaware of any company which is simply sitting on potentially profitable mineral rights'. Meanwhile, the ANC is trying to bolster local and international investor sentiment damaged by fears of nationalisation and state intervention in minerals marketing. Mr Paul Jourdan, co-ordinator of ANC mineral and energy policy, told a 20-strong delegation from JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley, the US investment banks, that nationalisation of mining companies or mineral rights was not under consideration. The organisation has redrafted its mining policy statement, emphasising the importance of wide consultation with the industry, and is understood to be considering hiring public relations consultants to improve the presentation of its economic policies. 'We have learnt that it is as important to say what you don't mean as what you do mean. Our aim is to present South Africa Inc to attract foreign investment to the country,' Mr Jourdan said. The Chamber of Mines and the ANC have set up a framework for further negotiations.</p>

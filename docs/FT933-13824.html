			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (29): POSTScript THERE IS a natural tendency for first-time investors to concentrate on the UK equity market. But, as the figures show, over the past five years the best returns have come from overseas. The top-performing unit trust sector over the five years to July 1 was the non-Japanese Far East. Investors earned, on average, nearly 145 per cent over the period, with the best returns coming from the Gartmore Hong Kong trust. But investors would have done better in almost any international sector, save Japan, than in the UK market. The devaluation of the pound is obviously a factor here, but so is the length and depth of the UK recession. Another noteworthy statistic is the strong display by bond funds. The boring old UK gilt &amp; fixed interest sector actually did better than the supposedly go-ahead UK growth sector. International fixed income produced higher returns than international growth. Falling interest and inflation rates around the world have been the key; those who believed the 1990s would be the decade of the bond have yet to be proved wrong. Looking at the one-year figures, what is encouraging for unit trust investors is that every sector produced a positive return. Even allowing for charges, all should have beaten the return from the building society over the past year - a factor that is no doubt playing its part in the boom in unit trust sales, which are running at pre-crash levels. Among the investment trusts, the strong performance of Bankers stands out. Not only is it top of the international general sector over five years, but it is the best performer among the funds listed over two and 10 years and is second over one year. The trust is managed by Michael Moule, of the newly merged Henderson Touche Remnant; he also manages Law Debenture, the second best performer over five years. The consequence of his success is that Bankers' shares stand on a very narrow discount to net asset value, and that Law Debenture's shares trade at a premium. Given that the figures reflect share, and not NAV, performance, this limits the scope for returns to be maintained at the previous level. The UK income growth sector attracts more than its fair share of personal equity plan money, and it is accordingly encouraging to see it producing positive returns. The outlook for income funds changed dramatically with the pound's exit from the exchange rate mechanism, and high-yielding stocks have had a very good nine months since then. Investors in substantial trusts, such as TR City of London, Murray Income and Merchants, have all doubled their money over the past five years.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAN TURNER; OFFERED HOPE TO THOSE WITH AIDS  </P> <P> Dan Turner, who survived eight years with AIDS, becoming in the process a  personification of hope to those with that fatal disease, has lost his historic  struggle.  </P> <P> The one-time playwright and actor was 42 when he died Monday in San Francisco,  ending a battle that had begun in February, 1982, when doctors -- who then were  seeing the undiagnosed illness for the first time -- were able to tell him only  that he had "gay cancer."  </P> <P> Thanks in part to an inexplicable suppression system that kept in check the  AIDS virus that normally proves fatal in a few years or even months, Turner  lived to help found many support groups.  </P> <P> Among them were the AIDS Foundation, People With AIDS and the AIDS Switchboard.  </P> <P> "He was a shining symbol," said longtime friend Maura Nolan. "When Dan would  walk into the hospital room of some person afflicted with AIDS, it was as if  hope walked though the door."  </P> <P> Turner was one of the first two patients diagnosed at San Francisco General  Hospital, before the disease was called acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He  was told only that he had a rare cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, which had surfaced  as five spots on his ankle.  </P> <P> Despite the public attention that was to accompany his lengthy fight for  survival, Turner continued to consider himself "ordinary."  </P> <P> But, as he told The Times late in 1987, he also became keenly aware of his  responsibilities to others to keep on living.  </P> <P> "I worry sometimes about getting hit by a car," he said, only half in jest.  </P> <P> He traveled and gave his message of optimism and determination to others, and  was featured on television in a 1987 documentary called "The Fighting Edge," in  which experts discussed how people such as Turner could continue to lead  productive lives.  </P> <P> Turner attributed his survival not just to his physiological fortunes but to  his attitude.  </P> <P> Years earlier, while working as an intern to playwright Tennessee Williams,  Turner was diagnosed with hepatitis. He was devastated.  </P> <P> But he saw Williams -- by then aging and in failing health himself --  continuing to awaken at 4 a.m. daily to write. And it was from the author of  "Streetcar Named Desire" and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," that Turner drew hope.  </P> <P> "I had been perpetuating (my hepatitis) through this negative mind trip. . . .  From then on when my mind said: 'You can't do it,' I'd say: 'But that's just  your mind.' "  </P> <P> In 1982, recovered from the hepatitis, he was to utilize that mind-set for a  second and final time.  </P> <P> He quit his job as a writer to encourage other people with AIDS. Despite a  chronic cough and minor health problems, he increased his regimen of exercise,  working out at a gym and climbing San Francisco's hilly streets.  </P> <P> Born a Catholic, he continued daily prayer and earned a master's degree in  social work while continuing to write plays.  </P> <P> He also tried many therapies, including injections of interferon, acupuncture,  psychic healing and meditation and diet.  </P> <P> "Dan played an important role for HIV-infected people across the world," said  Holly Smith of the Shanti Project, an AIDS support group. "He showed people  they can live, they can accomplish things after a diagnosis. He lived every  moment."  </P> <P> Doctors had encouraged him to vent his feelings about his disease, be it  conversation or creating.  </P> <P> "The sure sign of someone who's going to kick the bucket early," he said in  interviews, "is someone who turns inward, keeps the fear to themselves. . . ."  </P> <P> Survivors include his mother, two brothers and a sister.  </P></p>

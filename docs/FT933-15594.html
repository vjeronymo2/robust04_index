			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Observer: Table talk Don't despair. When Norman Willis retires as general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, his line in homely parables and never-ending metaphors will continue. His successor is already warming up in the wings. Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, rejecting a possible compromise by the Labour leadership over unions' involvement in internal party democracy, said yesterday: 'It's like if somebody wants to knock your greenhouse down and they threaten to knock your house down and then, in discussion, you get back to the point where they say 'oh well, I won't knock the house down, I'll just knock the greenhouse down'. 'That's not much of a compromise, is it?'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>   [Text] The prime minister, 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali,  returned home from the United States after accompanying his  majesty the king on his visit to Washington and after holding  talks at the United Nations on the effects of the sanctions on  Jordan. The prime minister described his majesty the king's  visit and talks in Washington as very successful. He told the  News at Ten that he had also briefed the UN Sanctions Committee  on Jordan's losses due to the sanctions imposed on Iraq and that  the Committee had promised to cooperate with Jordan.    [Begin recording] [Al-Majali] The purpose of the meeting is  to meet with the committee which has been appointed by the  Security Council for the sanctions on Iraq. And I gave them a  paper on this to show what is the damage to the Jordan economy,  especially to our factories, because Iraq is our main market for  most of the industries in Jordan. And again, we explained to  them how much we are affected by the inspection of the cargo in  the high seas which has cost Jordan quite a lot in the last  three years. They were very understanding and they were very  cooperative. And, in fact, we discussed the procedures about  this, that there should be a certain base as a policy for this,  so we do not have to get into the routine towards this. And I  met with the secretary general, as well, to exchange with him  the views about the sanctions, and in the same time to discuss  the peace process.    [Reporter] Have you received any promises from them?    [Al-Majali] I think they will be very serious in discussing  all what we have put to them, and we asked that we should get  contribution for the damage for our economy. And we hope that  we will get it. In fact, when we were in the United States  again we put the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the president  about these things. And they both promised to help Jordan  overcome these difficulties. [end recording]</p>

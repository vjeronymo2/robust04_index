			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Alvaro Machate, a member of the Collegiate  Commission of the National Convention Party (PCN) and head of  the party's administration department has told NOTICIAS that the  PCN will not contest the presidential elections. He said the  PCN will only contest the legislative elections.    He said opposition parties should unite to find a single  presidential candidate because "we are about 16 officially  registered parties, and if each one of us submits its candidate  we will risk splitting the votes and encouraging war." [passage  omitted]    Turning to the system of government that would eventually be  in place in the country, he is for the "establishment of a  government of national unity." He noted that "this country has  gone through many years of war and people do not know each other  well. Hence, it would be advisable for whoever wins the  presidential election, not to consider only his party, but other  people with potential, if he wants to guarantee peace."  [passage omitted]</p>

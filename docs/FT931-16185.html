			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Management: British fail to make the grade - UK car components makers are way behind the best Japanese competition on productivity and quality, according to new research Statistics produced by one of the motor industry's best known gurus, Daniel Jones, appeared to shake rigid some of the UK motor component industry's senior executives assembled in London in November. A benchmarking study* comparing Japanese and UK suppliers provided a chilling insight into just how far most of the UK industry has to go to match the 'world class' productivity and quality standards set by the best Japanese companies. Average productivity levels inside the benchmarked UK companies were found to be less than half those of their Japanese counterparts. And quality standards - measured by rejection rates - were 100 times inferior. Jones, professor of motor industry management at Cardiff Business School, warns that because the UK component makers studied were likely to be typical of UK manufacturers, 'a gap here almost certainly means that much of UK manufacturing falls short of world-class performance by a similar two-to-one margin.' But continental European component makers would be ill-advised to sneer. 'Our experience tells us that a similar set of mainland European firms would probably do no better,' says Jones, co-author of The Machine That Changed The World, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology study into efficiency levels in the world motor industry. It was this study that first coined the term 'lean production' to distinguish production systems (pioneered mainly by Toyota) which use radically fewer resources - in people, materials, time and space - than traditional 'mass production' techniques. The Lean Enterprise Benchmarking Project was undertaken by Cardiff Business School, Cambridge University and the Andersen Consulting group. The project made a head-to-head comparison of UK component makers with their Japanese counterparts, using a wide range of measures to evaluate performance and profile management practices. These included examinations of factory lay-out, work organisation, human resources management, organisational structures and control systems, as well as the nature of relationships with suppliers, distributors and customers. Jones describes the benchmarking process as the most powerful tool available for assessing industrial competitiveness and instigating change. 'After benchmarking one can no longer hide behind excuses or put the clock back. One has to face the facts, however unpleasant, and do something about them,' he says. The project followed a report last year from the National Economic Development Council into Nissan's UK manufacturing experience which concluded that the British components industry was only on a par with the Japanese industry of the mid- to late-1970s when measured by rejection rates. The Nedo report also concluded that continental European suppliers were little better than British ones. The latest study monitored 18 companies - nine in Japan and nine in the UK. They produce a wide variety of components, including wiring harnesses, brakes, seats and exhausts. One-third showed outstanding performance in both quality and productivity. All were Japanese. However, even the Japanese companies were far from uniformly capable. Some lagged well behind the leading 'world-class' group. But the five worst performers were British. UK plants had an average of 2.5 defects per 100 components, compared with 2.5 per 10,000 for the best Japanese plants. The UK plants were also found typically to need twice as many employees to produce the same number of parts. None of the 'world class' plants was found to use hourly pay based on job classifications and their employment practices were 'noticeably more progressive than those of the non-world class plants'. Not least, they were performing at their high level while also making a more complex and rapidly changing mix of products than their rivals - albeit with a slightly higher level of automation. Change is under way as UK-based suppliers absorb the methods and culture of lean production from Japanese 'transplants'. But even though team working, quality circles and other manifestations of Japanese 'best practice' were apparent in most of the UK companies, the benefits showed up in the form of either much improved quality or productivity - but not both together. The world-class plants also involved more of their employees more intensely in problem-solving. In such plants team leaders were pivotal, developing the skills of team members as well as taking responsibility for quality and management issues. Also missing from many indigenous UK companies - but to which Honda, Toyota and Nissan in their UK plants are committed - are identical conditions of employment and performance appraisal for all employees, including management. Jones says another key ingredient for attaining 'world class' status is the organisation of the production process. 'It starts with integrating every production step into an uninterrupted flow - so parts travel the minimum distance and hardly wait for the next operation.' In turn, 'the discipline governing the flow comes from short set-up times and small lots produced just-in-time, thus eliminating waste and work-in-progress. Full utilisation of the whole integrated production system comes from eliminating random interruptions and variability, whether from a defective part, a machine breakdown, supplier hiccup or even chaotic build schedule.' The best benchmarked companies were also shown to have achieved faster throughput, much higher first-time quality, reduced rework, minimal stocks and they worked to stable schedules. But the full benefit of such processes, Jones argues, will not be achieved without a complete supply chain organised along similar 'lean' principles. The benchmarkers found that the world-class chain was tightly integrated between vehicle assembler and even the most preliminary stages of the parts supply chain - an integration marked by minimal stock, frequent deliveries of small volumes of parts, lack of disruption and stable supply volumes. The discipline of the system came from the compressed order-to-delivery lead times and building to customer orders rather than stock. The benchmarking team concluded that such a chain can work only if a 'partnership' relationship existed all along the chain - already a recognised feature of ties between Japan's UK transplants and their 'first-tier' UK suppliers of key components, but a novelty for big suppliers in their own relationships with smaller parts makers. Implicit in this 'shared destiny' is a clear mutual understanding of the need for a fair reward for each party as well as shared learning. Despite the gulf, Jones insists that the UK industry nevertheless has a 'unique window of opportunity' to lead the development of 'lean' companies and supply chains in Europe - thanks to transplants and the UK's own dismal past industrial performance making it willing to learn from Japan. It is the reason, he suggests, why German, French and Italian component groups like Robert Bosch, Valeo and Magneti Marelli are investing in the UK. 'They not only want a slice of the new business created by the Japanese but also want to share in the learning so that they can transfer the lessons learned here to their home plants.' *The Lean Enterprise Benchmarking Project.

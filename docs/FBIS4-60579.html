			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Army Commander General Emile Lahhud has stated  that the army is opposing attempts by anyone to exploit the  Israeli act of aggression in abducting resistance official  Mustafa al-Dirani to harm the morale of the army and citizens or  to circulate rumors to promote divisive stances that do nothing  but cause harm. Everyone must view this issue with  enlightenment, responsibility, and awareness. The enemy seeks  to kindle sedition and cause confusion. Our response should not  in any way jeopardize security.    In his monthly address in the army magazine, General Lahhud  noted that temporary difficulties will not prevent the army from  performing their duty to preserve national security and defend  the south. Referring to the latest Israeli operation in  al-Biqa', which resulted in the abduction of the resistance  official, he said it was designed, among other things, to strike  at our national morale and to create an atmosphere of fear and  doubt. He said: What must be said is that we are still in  conflict with the Israeli enemy because of their continued  occupation of part of the south. As a result of the occupation,  the enemy is suffering from continuous attacks despite their  considerable resources. The enemy expand the scope of their  aggression to boost their morale and to undermine our morale. We  must prevent the enemy from achieving their goal by plugging the  gaps created by their aggression.    He said: What is more important is that, as military  personnel, we know that the army was vigilant from the first  moment of the Israeli operation and tried to do its duty in  coordination with the Syrian Arab forces. Patrols were  operating in the area where the Israeli forces landed and tried  to assess the situation before intervening. But several  military considerations, such as the difficult terrain and  routes and the failure to define the target fast enough,  prevented the army from foiling the operation. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Letter: Exchange rate not the culprit Sir, For heavens' sake let's stop blaming the exchange rate for British manufacturing industry's poor performance in the competition for a fair share of world trade. On an exchange rate basis German products in Britain should be some 35 per cent dearer than they were eight or nine years ago, during which time the D-Mark/Pounds has gone from about 4.5 to 2.95. Also in that period, the German slice of British business has continued to grow. I wonder if it could have anything to do with the right attitude to quality, a financial structure which supports manufacturing, the ability to plan and invest for the long term and finally, just maybe, a belief in one's own product. Both government and population have a lot more to put right in the attitude department before the exchange rate will have any effect at all.

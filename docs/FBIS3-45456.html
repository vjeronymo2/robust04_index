			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by XINHUA reporter Shen Xiaoquan (3088 1321 </F> 3123): "A New Page in Sino-Franco Relations"]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Chinese and French  Governments issued a joint communique on 12 January declaring  that the two countries should restore their traditional friendly  and cooperative relations on the basis of the principle on which  they established diplomatic ties. In the communique, the  Chinese Government restated its consistent position on the  Taiwan issue, and the French Government recognized that the PRC  Government is the sole legitimate government of China, that  Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and it  undertook not to approve in the future arms sales to Taiwan by  French enterprises. It was announced in the communique that  French Prime Minister Balladur will pay a formal visit to China  in the near future. The joint communique indicated that  Sino-Franco relations have begun to be restored after a  difficult period.    As all know, in November 1992, the former French Socialist  Party government, in ignoring the Chinese Government's strong  opposition and principled and stern representations, approved  the sale of 60 Mirage-2000 fighter aircraft to Taiwan. This  action undermined the foundation of the friendly relations  between China and France and resulted in a serious retrogression  in bilateral relations.    In March 1993, the new French government headed by Prime  Minister Balladur took office. In April, French business  circles appealed through the press to the new government to take  action to relax Sino-Franco relations, which had deadlocked, and  they stressed that the French side "should take the first  political step." Later, former French President Giscard  d'Estang, former Prime Minister Chirac, and other French  political leaders called for improving relations with China.  French Foreign Minister Juppe separately issued a statement at  the end of 1993 and early this year in which he expressed the  hope of "restoring relations of greater trust with China at an  early date."    China responded positively to France's gesture. Prime  Minister Balladur sent special envoy Friedmann to visit Beijing  in July and December of last year for consultations on restoring  Sino-Franco relations. On 12 January, the two sides issued a  joint communique declaring that China and France have restored  their traditional friendly and cooperative relations. It can be  said that this indicated that Sino-Franco relations have come  out of their low ebb and that a new chapter has been opened in  their relations.    The improvement in Sino-Franco relations was made possible  due to various factors.    First, tense Sino-Franco relations do not conform to  France's  long-term interests. Sino-Franco economic and trade cooperation  is mainly in the nuclear power industry, transportation, energy  industry, and other technical projects. According to statistics  provided by the French side, as of this date, the amount in  contracts that the French side has lost totals 6 billion francs.  Some people have estimated that if Sino-Franco relations  continued to deteriorate, its losses would reach 30 billion  francs. French business circles have suffered seriously, and  therefore their call to improve Sino-Franco relations had been  the loudest.    The East Asia region currently is the most economically  vigorous region in the world. In particular, since it adopted  the policy of reform and opening up, China's economy has grown  rapidly and in a sustained manner, drawing worldwide attention.  Asia's prosperity and the West's economic recession have formed  a sharp contrast. Currently, Western countries, including the  United States, have set their eyes on Asia and are attempting to  seek markets there. Among EC member states, Germany has led the  way. In the first half of 1993 alone, Germany doubled the  amount of the sophisticated technological goods that it exported  to China. The tense Sino- Franco political relations have  directly affected France's exports of technological goods to  China.    Second, China's international status has kept on increasing.  Both China and France are permanent members of the UN Security  Council, and both of them possess nuclear weapons; therefore, in  the current turbulent and unstable international situation, the  two countries must hold consultations more often and have closer  cooperation to make contributions to maintaining world peace and  stability. The Sino-U.S. summit meeting in Seattle in November  was both a shock and a push to France. France, which has always  embraced an independent foreign policy, felt that it needed to  coordinate with China on such major international issues as  banning nuclear testing and arms control.    This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of  Sino-Franco diplomatic relations. In 1964, because of the  personal concern of General de Gaulle, Chairman Mao Zedong, and  Premier Zhou Enlai, China and France established diplomatic  ties, making France the first major Western country to establish  diplomatic relations with PRC and winning wide international  praise. The achievements of the development of Sino-Franco  relations over the last 30 years were hard-won. Cooperation  between the two countries has a solid foundation; China's market  potential is huge, and France has an advantage in technological  goods -- the two countries' economies are highly complementary  to each other. We believe that as long as the two countries  strictly abide by the principle on which they established their  diplomatic ties and the principle laid down in the joint  communique, Sino-Franco relations will gradually improve and  will develop.</p>

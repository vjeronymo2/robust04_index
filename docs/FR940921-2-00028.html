No. 9993-1), Foam Coat Vaporooter (EPA Reg. No. 9993-2), and Sanafoam Vaporooter II (EPA Reg. No. 9993-3). EPA has determined that continued sale, distribution, and use of the products would cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. EPA bases this determination on data and other information showing that products that contain metam-sodium (sodium methyldithiocarbamate) when used for control of root growth in sewer lines must be classified for ``Restricted Use Only'' to ensure their safe use. The chemical is hazardous, and applicators need to wear protective equipment and receive specialized training when using the products for this use. Airrigation Engineering Co., Inc. (Airrigation) has failed to comply with the Agency's requirement for Restricted Use classification for the products listed above. EPA is therefore issuing this Notice of Intent to Cancel as required by section 6(b) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Requests for a hearing by a registrant or other adversely affected parties must be received by the Office of the Hearing Clerk at the address given below on or before October 21, 1994 or within 30 days from receipt of this Notice by the registrant, whichever occurs later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written requests for a hearing, identified by the document control number [OPP-66200], must be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (1900), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  By mail: Steve Robbins, Acting Product Manager (PM) 21, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Notice announces EPA's intent to cancel the registrations of the pesticide products Vaporooter A Foaming Fumigant (EPA Reg. No. 9993-1), Foam Coat Vaporooter (EPA Reg. No. 9993-2), and Sanafoam Vaporooter II (EPA Reg. No. 9993-3). For the reasons set forth below, the Administrator has determined that these products, when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, will generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on public health and/or the environment unless they are classified for restricted use. This determination is based on the hazardous nature of these products and their active ingredient, metam-sodium; the complex application method for use of these products; the need for specialized equipment and training to apply these products; and the potential for residential exposure to the products due to incorrect application procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Organization of this Notice <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Notice is divided into nine units. Unit I provides introductory information and describes the legal authority for this action. Unit II discusses the factual background for this action, including information relating to the active ingredient metamsodium, and communications with Airrigation Engineering Co. Unit III presents the EPA's determinations with regard to Airrigation's sewer use products. Unit IV describes the role of the Scientific Advisory Panel and the Secretary of Agriculture relating to this action. Unit V sets forth the Agency's determination that these product registrations must be canceled. Unit VI discusses the disposition of existing stocks of the products. Unit VII contains a discussion of the procedures for implementing the actions required by this Notice, as well as the procedures for requesting a hearing. Unit VIII identifies the references. Unit IX gives information on the Public Docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Legal Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before a pesticide product may be lawfully sold or distributed in either intrastate or interstate commerce, the product must be registered by EPA, pursuant to FIFRA sections 3(a) and 12(a)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A registration is a license allowing a pesticide product to be sold and distributed for specified uses in accordance with specific use instructions, precautions and other terms and conditions. A pesticide product may be registered or remain registered only if it meets the statutory standard for registration. Among other things, a pesticide must perform its intended pesticidal function without causing ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment'' (FIFRA section 3(c)(5)). ``Unreasonable adverse effects on the environment'' is defined as ``any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of [the] pesticide'' (FIFRA section 2(bb)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, under FIFRA section 3(d)(1)(C), the Administrator may classify a pesticide for restricted use if she determines that the pesticide, when applied in accordance with its directions for use, warnings, and cautions, or, in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, may generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, without additional regulatory restrictions. Once classified for restricted use, a product can be applied only by or under the direct supervision of a certified applicator (FIFRA sections 3(d)(1)(C), 12(a)(2)(F), 12(a)(2)(G)). EPA has promulgated regulations which establish the procedures EPA will follow when classifying a product for restricted use. Pursuant to 40 CFR 152.165(c)(2), the Agency may notify a registrant of the decision to classify its product for restricted use and require the registrant to submit certain information, listed in paragraph (c)(1) of that section, to comply with the classification decision. If the registrant fails to comply with this notification, the Agency may initiate cancellation proceedings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations at 40 CFR 152.170(a) provide general criteria that guide EPA's decision to classify a pesticide product for restricted use. In general, use of a product will be restricted if the Agency determines that: (1) the product or its use poses a serious hazard that may be mitigated by restricting use; (2) the product's labeling, when considered according to the factors in paragraph (e)(2) of that section, is not adequate to mitigate the hazard(s); (3) restriction of the product would decrease the risk of adverse effects; and (4) the decrease in risks of the pesticide as a result of restriction would exceed any attendant decrease in benefits. Paragraph (e)(2) of that section states that labeling will be judged adequate, and therefore will be appropriate for unrestricted use products, if it meets all of the following criteria: (1) the user would not be required to perform complex operations or procedures requiring specialized training and/or experience; (2) the label directions do not call for a specialized apparatus, protective equipment, or materials that reasonably would not be available to the general public; (3) failure to follow label directions in a minor way would result in few or no significant adverse effects; (4) following directions for use would result in few or no significant adverse effects of a delayed or indirect nature through bioaccumulation, persistence, or pesticide movement from the original application site; and (5) widespread and commonly recognized practices of use would not nullify or detract from label directions such that unreasonable adverse effects on the environment might occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The burden of demonstrating that a pesticide product satisfies the statutory criteria for registration is at all times on the proponents of initial or continued registration. Under FIFRA section 6, the Agency may issue a Notice of Intent to Cancel the registration of a pesticide product whenever it appears to the Administrator that the product no longer satisfies the statutory criteria for registration. If appropriate, the Agency may require modifications to the terms and conditions of registration, such as deletion of particular uses or revisions in labeling, as an alternative to cancellation. If the Notice requires such changes, cancellation may be avoided by making the changes specified in the Notice, if possible. Adversely affected persons may also request a hearing on the cancellation of a specified registration. If they do so in a legally effective manner, the registration will be continued pending a decision at the conclusion of an administrative hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Factual Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Metam-Sodium <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Metam-sodium, the sodium salt of methyldithiocarbamate, is extremely volatile and very unstable under aerobic conditions with a half-life of 23 minutes. Its principal derivative is methyl isothiocyanate (MITC). In water, metam-sodium is rapidly decomposed to MITC and hydrogen sulfide (H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> S). Pesticide products containing metam-sodium are registered for numerous agricultural and non-agricultural uses, including as a soil fumigant to control insects, nematodes, soil-borne diseases, and weeds prior to planting crops. Other uses include wood preservation, tree root killer in sewers, slimicide, and use in sugar refineries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Metam-sodium and MITC show varying degrees of acute and chronic toxicity. Due to the chemical nature of metam-sodium, in that it is readily hydrolyzed to MITC and H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> S, the Agency believes that exposure from pesticide use would be related to MITC rather than metam-sodium (Ref. 1). MITC is shown to be moderately toxic in short-term (acute) exposures to laboratory test animals. In rabbits, MITC is shown to be a severe skin and respiratory tract irritant and a severe eye irritant. Test animals exposed to high levels of air-borne MITC in acute studies show eye irritation, hypoactivity, distressed breathing, convulsions, and death. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Metam-sodium is shown to be slightly toxic to laboratory test animals in acute studies. If on skin or ingested, it is corrosive and causes severe irritation or burns. Metam-sodium has the potential for causing adverse health effects from both acute and chronic exposures. In addition, existing medical conditions may be exacerbated upon exposure to metam-sodium. Acute health effects include excessive salivation, sweating, fatigue, weakness, nausea, headache, dizziness, and eye and respiratory tract irritation. Chronic conditions can include conjunctivitis, photophobia, and blurred vision. Studies also have suggested that the chemical may exhibit reproductive toxicity. Medical conditions that are prone to further aggravation upon exposure to metam-sodium include impaired pulmonary functions and preexisting eye problems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Potential public health and environmental impacts of this chemical were demonstrated when in July 1991, a train derailment resulted in 19,500 gallons of metam-sodium being spilled into the Sacramento River near Dunsmuir, California. All aquatic life and substantial shoreline vegetation along a 45-mile stretch of river leading to Lake Shasta were killed. As a result of this incident, the Agency expanded and intensified ongoing review of this chemical. Registrants formed the Metam-Sodium Task Force in response to the Agency's request for data needed to fully assess the environmental and public health impact of this chemical. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency's review of available data led to conclusions that agricultural uses of metam-sodium may result in unacceptable risk from acute and developmental toxicity effects. In order to mitigate agricultural use risks, EPA and the Task Force entered into an agreement which included: (1) label amendments to limit around-home and small-area uses (lawns, seed-beds, plant-beds, and other non-field limited areas) to certified applicators; products will be labeled with ``Restricted Use''; (2) label amendments to include requirements for protective clothing and equipment; (3) a reentry waiting period of 48 hours for agricultural sites; and (4) a tarping requirement for treated areas adjacent to homes. These requirements are currently in place and were voluntarily implemented with the cooperation of the Task Force consisting of all producers of technical grade metam-sodium as well as other product formulators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to this agreement between EPA and the registrants, both parties initiated reviews of other uses of metam-sodium. These reviews were intended to determine what measures, if any, would be needed to further mitigate risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Use of Metam-Sodium in Sewers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sewer lines are frequently damaged and blocked by tree roots. This is a perennial and costly problem for municipalities. Lateral lines to buildings on private property may also be damaged and blocked by roots. A mechanical remedy involves the use of a rotary cutting tool. This technique only offers temporary results, and may even exacerbate the problem by causing root branching. Rotary cutters also damage sewer pipes. When the damage and blockage are too severe, sewers are dug up and replaced at considerable cost to the community or property owner (Ref. 2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sewer root control via this chemical system involves the use of metam-sodium, dichlobenil, and a foaming agent. Application of this pesticide involves premixing of measured chemicals and a knowledge of calibrated chemical feeding, pressurizing, and foam-generating equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1971 and 1973, Airrigation obtained registrations for two pesticide products to control roots in sewers. Each product consisted of metam-sodium and dichlobenil mixed together just prior to use. A patent was obtained which prevented potential competition from marketing this type of combination product for controlling roots in sewers. The registrant limited sales of its products to a few contractors and encouraged them to train their staff due to the complex application method. Experience with this pesticide treatment over the ensuing years showed it to be superior to mechanical methods and it became the preferred method for controlling roots in sewers. Following the expiration of Airrigation's patent, three additional products have been registered for this use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In March 1993, EPA learned of an incident that occurred approximately 1 year prior to that involving Airrigation's product, Sanafoam Vaporooter II. In that incident, a worker in Los Alamos, New Mexico, improperly applied the Sanafoam product, causing the product to back up into the plumbing of a nearby residence. The residents reported the incident to EPA, stating that they suffered respiratory and pulmonary injury (Ref. 3). Airrigation did not provide EPA with any information regarding the incident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More recently, on July 11, 1994, an incident involving a metam-sodium sewer use product occurred in Roseville, CA, and resulted in a home being evacuated (Ref. 4). The foam product being applied by a municipal sewer maintenance crew flowed into one home and out into the yard of another home located behind it. What caused the pesticide product to flow into the home rather than down the sewer pipes is being investigated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon completing review of the available data base and use history of products in this application, the Agency concluded that the sewer root control use of metam-sodium should be restricted. This decision was based largely upon the potential risks to workers and the public due to the hazardous nature of the chemical, the need for specialized training associated with complex equipment and application procedures, the need for specialized protective equipment, the potential for metam-sodium to enter buildings through drains, and the potential for damage to sewage biological digestion processes (Ref. 8). Technical information supporting this restricted-use classification was obtained from product literature on the registered products, two applicants of pending metam-sodium sewer use products with experience as contract users of similar registered products, and operation records from two large municipal sewage treatment systems. Moreover, the Agency believes that because of the patent expiration and the effectiveness of metam-sodium root control, there is the probability of large market expansion throughout the United States with increased potential risk from new suppliers. The Agency has concluded that the complex application method could pose an unreasonable risk to inadequately trained workers as well as to the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has also concluded that restricted use classification should be phased in over time to allow for development of a training program for applicator certification. This program is being designed by metam-sodium registrants, in cooperation with the Agency. The restricted use requirement will only go into effect after the training manual, testing, and certification are available. The three most recent registrants have agreed to restricted use classification and to support development of EPA/State training programs for applicator certification. The restricted use classification must be reflected on product labeling within 120 days of the issuance of an EPA accepted training manual for applicator certification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Airrigation's sewer treatment products are not currently classified as restricted use pesticides. Therefore, any persons can purchase and apply these products, regardless of their qualifications to do so. Airrigation has asserted that restricting the use of these products is not necessary because Airrigation gives a training program to all customers who purchase the products. However, EPA believes that this system is insufficient to assure that the people who actually perform the product application are adequately trained. If these products were classified for restricted use, it would be a violation of FIFRA for anyone other than a certified applicator, or someone under the direct supervision of a certified applicator, to apply the products (FIFRA sections 12(a)(2)(F),(G)), and EPA would have assurance that the applicators had at least received the requisite training in use of these products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the decision by EPA to classify all metam-sodium sewer use products as restricted use pesticides, the Agency communicated frequently with affected registrants on this matter. The Agency's initial approach to implementing restricted use classification was to request voluntary compliance in the spirit of continued cooperation between EPA and the industry. Except for Airrigation, all affected registrants of both pending and registered metam-sodium sewer use products agreed to comply. Despite numerous meetings and much correspondence with EPA, Airrigation has remained steadfast in its refusal to voluntarily implement EPA's determination. Therefore, on September 24, 1993, a letter was sent to Airrigation which formally requested, pursuant to 40 CFR 152.165(c)(2), that the company submit amended labeling for the above-named products to reflect a restricted use classification and additionally requested a written response to that letter within 10 days (Ref. 5). Airrigation responded in a letter dated October 14, 1993, that was received by the Agency on October 22, 1993. The letter stated that the company declined to agree to the reclassification of its products (Ref. 6). Because Airrigation has failed to adopt the Agency's classification of its products for restricted use, EPA is initiating this cancellation action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Findings on Airrigation Engineering Sewer Use Products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. General Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency has determined, pursuant to FIFRA section 3(d)(1)(C), that restricted use classification for the use of metam-sodium in sewers is required due to the elaborate and complicated methods of applying this chemical and the potential for harmful human exposure. The Agency has examined available information regarding risks from potential exposure to metam-sodium use in sewer root control and has concluded that existing and potential risks are unacceptable, based upon the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. These products pose a serious hazard to workers and the public due to their acute toxicity and developmental toxicity, which are evident from available toxicological studies (Ref. 1). There is a potential, realized in at least one incident, for the products to invade residential and commercial properties during use, causing injury to those inside (Ref. 2). Inhalation and dermal exposure risks to mixer/loaders and applicators exist due to the high volatility of methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), the principle derivative of metam-sodium (Ref. 1). Potential for worker and public exposure, through misuse or otherwise, is significant due to the complexity of the application method used for applying metam-sodium in sewer systems (Ref. 7). In addition, these products have the potential to contaminate ground and surface water, and to damage biological sewage treatment systems (Ref. 8). The Agency believes that these hazards could be mitigated through restricting the products' use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The current labeling of the Airrigation products is not adequate to mitigate the hazard these products pose. Under EPA's regulations, a label will be deemed ``adequate,'' and thus suitable for products classified for general use, only if it meets all of the factors listed in 40 CFR 152.170(e)(2). Those factors are listed in Unit I.B. of this preamble. EPA finds that Airrigation's sewer use products do not meet three of those factors as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Users of these products are required to perform complex operations or procedures requiring specialized training or experience. All of the products' labels state ``RECOMMENDED FOR USE BY TRAINED PERSONNEL'' (Refs. 9, 10, and 11). On August 25, 1993, Agency personnel attended a demonstration of treatment of a sewer line with another metam sodium product to learn first-hand the type of operations that are involved. The procedures and equipment utilized were highly complex and clearly required specialized training and knowledge to effectively operate (Ref. 7). As noted above, the current labeling of these products does not restrict who can apply the products. Although Airrigation states that it provides some type of training to all of its customers, the Agency cannot ensure that only people who have been adequately trained will be permitted to apply these products. Therefore, these products do not meet factor (e)(2)(i). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The label directions for these products call for specialized apparatus and protective equipment that reasonably would not be available to the general public. In order to use the products, the applicator must use a special foam generator to convert the liquid product constituents to a foam form (Refs. 9, 10, and 11). The Foam-Coat Vaporooter label directs users ``USE ONLY SPECIALIZED FOAM APPLICATION EQUIPMENT,'' and then states that this equipment is available from Airrigation Engineering (Ref. 10). This machinery is necessary to produce the foam and to introduce the foam into the sewer lines. The Sanafoam Vaporooter II label only gives directions for use of the product with Airrigation's FOAM MAKER (R) generator (Ref. 11). In addition, that label's directions for use instruct the user to ``[u]se specialized foam application equipment,'' and, if treating a building lateral line, to ``[b]e sure foam application discharge hose is also of a specialized type'' (Ref. 11). Therefore, the Airrigation products' labels do not meet factor (e)(2)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Failure to follow label directions in a minor way could result in significant adverse effects. EPA is very concerned regarding the potential these products have to invade residential or other structures through improper application. The Sanafoam Vaporooter II label acknowledges this danger and states that ``caution must be used to assure foam does not travel into adjacent structures'' (Ref. 11). However, as the incident in Los Alamos, NM, shows, this result is possible in spite of the cautionary labeling. EPA no longer believes that this cautionary statement is sufficient to mitigate these products' potential to expose the general public to highly toxic fumigants. A person who is not thoroughly trained and familiar with the complicated application methods and equipment for these products could easily make a minor error in the application procedure, which could cause widespread human exposure and result in adverse effects to those people and the environment. Therefore, the Airrigation products' labels do not meet factor (e)(2)(iii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Restriction of the use of metam-sodium products in sewers would decrease the risk of adverse effects to the public and to workers. Requiring that all workers who apply these products be properly trained certified applicators, or under the direct supervision of properly trained certified applicators, will ensure to the greatest degree possible that users of these products have the requisite skill and ability to utilize the complex machinery and application methods necessary to apply these products as safely as possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The decrease in potential risk from restricting use of these products will exceed any incidental decrease in their benefits. The Agency believes that restricted use classification will not significantly increase the cost of sewer root control treatment. Because there are other substantially similar products available which will be classified for restricted use when the applicator training program is completed, there will be little benefit to the public from having one product on the market with much higher risks than the others at comparable cost. The need for root control in sewer lines will continue to be met by the other products with less potential for adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Risk-Benefit Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is a significant potential for serious harm to humans and the environment due to the improper application of these products. The Agency cannot adequately mitigate this potential risk through cautionary labeling alone because the products' application method requires specialized equipment and training. The best way EPA can ensure that all product applicators are sufficiently skilled to prevent harm to humans and the environment, to the greatest extent possible, is to require all persons who apply these products to be properly trained certified applicators or under the direct supervision of such certified applicators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are currently three other registrants marketing products which are substantially similar to the Airrigation products. Each of these companies agreed upon registration of its product to participate in developing a training program for sewer treatment applicators, and to label its sewer treatment products for restricted use once the program is made available to the States. EPA believes that the cost of these products is comparable to that of Airrigation's products since the amount of chemicals (active ingredients), the percentage and quality of foaming ingredients are all very similar. The other registrants have indicated to EPA that they do not expect restricted use classification to increase the cost of their products to the public. EPA also believes that these companies' products, and any new products to enter the market in the future, will be sufficient to meet the public demand for sewer root treatment. In performing this function, they will pose less overall risk to the public than the Airrigation products because they will be used only by or under the direct supervision of properly trained certified applicators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in comparison to other available alternatives, the Airrigation products pose serious risks and provide negligible benefits, if any. Unless these products are classified for restricted use under the same phased approach as the other registrants' products, they will no longer meet the statutory standard for registration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Measures Short of Cancellation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under FIFRA, prior to taking regulatory action to cancel a pesticide's registration, the Administrator must consider whether any measures short of cancellation would be sufficient to reduce the risk of adverse effects to an acceptable level. As discussed above, the Agency has determined that restricted use classification would reduce the potential risks of these products to humans and the environment to an acceptable level. That was the basis for EPA's letter of September 24, 1993 to Airrigation. Airrigation refused to comply with the Agency's decision. Accordingly, there are no other measures short of cancellation which would reduce the potential risks from these products to an acceptable level. In order to avoid cancellation, Airrigation must amend the registrations of these products so that they will be classified for restricted use upon issuance of the applicator training program. Additional information on avoiding cancellation can be obtained from the Office of Pesticide Program personnel listed in the section above under the heading ``For Further Information Contact.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Role of the Scientific Advisory Panel and the Secretary of Agriculture <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 6(b) and 25(d) of FIFRA provide certain opportunities for the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the FIFRA Science Advisory Panel (SAP) to review and comment upon a draft Notice of Intent to Cancel, and in the case of USDA, an analysis of the impact of the proposed action on the agricultural economy. These reviews may be waived, and if they are, the Notice may be published without delay. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 2, 1994, EPA asked the SAP and the Secretary of USDA to waive their rights to review and comment on this Notice (Refs. 12 and 13). These requests were made because the bases for this notice are regulatory in nature due to the need for specialized training, and specialized application and protective equipment when using these products. Therefore, a science finding is not required. Moreover, the use of these products does not involve agricultural commodities. On May 23, 1994, the SAP notified EPA that it waived its review of this action (Ref. 14). On May 12, 1994, Nancy N. Ragsdale, Director, National Agricultural Pesticide Impact Assessment Program, USDA, notified EPA that the Secretary would waive review of this action (Ref. 15). Because USDA and SAP have waived their review of this action, the Agency is not delaying issuance of this Notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Agency Determination that Cancellation of Airrigation Engineering's Products is Necessary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has determined that the Airrigation sewer treatment products listed above, without being classified for restricted use, fail to meet the standard for registration under FIFRA for the reasons listed below, and that the registrations of these products must be canceled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. These products pose a serious hazard, due to their acute and developmental toxicity and their complicated and difficult application methods, which could be adequately mitigated through restricted use classification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. There are adequate alternative products which will be classified for restricted use (when the certified applicator training program is available to the States) which will perform the same function and provide the same benefits while posing significantly lower risks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. EPA has informed Airrigation of this determination pursuant to 40 CFR 152.65(c)(2), and Airrigation has refused to comply with the Agency's decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Disposition of Existing Stocks <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this Notice, existing stocks are defined as those stocks of Vaporooter A Foaming Fumigant (EPA Reg. No. 99931), Foam Coat Vaporooter (EPA Reg. No 9993-2), and Sanafoam Vaporooter II (EPA Reg. No. 9993-3) which were in the United States and were packaged and labeled for shipment prior to the effective date of the cancellation of the registrations of these products. The Agency has determined that no further sale, distribution, or use of existing stocks of these products will be permitted after the effective date of cancellation of the registration of the product, except for distribution for the purposes of disposal. Owners of existing stocks of the products may at any time dispose of the product in accordance with applicable local, State, and Federal regulations. The determination is based on the finding that continued use of these products without restricted use classification may result in unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Procedural Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Notice announces EPA's intent to cancel the registration of Airrigation Engineering Co., Inc., products containing metam-sodium for use in treating sewer lines, and any product with any of the registration numbers listed above that is supplementally distributed. This action is taken pursuant to authority in section 6(b) of FIFRA. Under FIFRA section 6(b)(1), registrants and other adversely affected parties may request a hearing on the cancellation actions that this Notice initiates. Any hearing concerning cancellation of registration for any affected pesticide product will be held in accordance with FIFRA section 6(d). Unless a hearing is properly requested in accordance with the provisions of this Notice, the registration will be canceled. This unit of the Notice explains how such persons may request a hearing in accordance with the procedures specified in this Notice, and the consequences of requesting or failing to request a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Procedures for Requesting a Hearing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To contest the regulatory action initiated by this Notice, registrants or other adversely affected persons must request a hearing within 30 days of the registrant's receipt of this Notice, or within 30 days from the date of publication of this Notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , whichever occurs later. All registrants and other adversely affected persons who request a hearing must file the request in accordance with the procedures established by FIFRA and EPA's Rules of Practice Governing Hearings (40 CFR part 164). These procedures require that all requests must identify the specific registration by Registration Number and state the basis for objecting to the cancellation of the product for which a hearing is requested, and must be received by the Hearing Clerk within the applicable 30-day period. Failure to comply with these requirements will result in denial of the request for a hearing. Requests for a hearing should also be accompanied by objections that are specific to each basis of cancellation of the pesticide product for which a hearing is requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requests for a hearing must be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (1900), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consequences of filing a timely and effective hearing request <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If a hearing on any action initiated by this Notice is requested in a timely and effective manner, the hearing will be governed by EPA's Rules of Practice Governing Hearings under FIFRA section 6 (40 CFR part 164). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consequences of failure to file in a timely and effective manner <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If a hearing concerning the cancellation of a specific product subject to this Notice is not requested in a timely and effective manner by the end of the applicable 30-day period, registration of that product will be canceled automatically. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Separation of Functions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's rules of practice forbid anyone who may take part in deciding this case, at any stage of the proceeding, from discussing the merits of the proceeding ex parte with any party or with any person who has been connected with the preparation or presentation of the proceeding as an advocate or in any investigative or expert capacity, or with any of his/her representatives (40 CFR 164.7). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the following EPA offices, and the staffs thereof, are designated as the judicial staff of EPA in any administrative hearing on this Notice of Intent to Cancel: the Office of Administrative Law Judge, the Environmental Appeals Board, the Deputy Administrator and the members of the staff of the immediate office of the Deputy Administrator, and the Administrator and the members of staff in the immediate office of the Administrator. The following offices are designated as the trial staff in any proceeding which may arise under this Notice: the Office of General Counsel, the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances and his/her immediate staff, the Office of Pesticide Programs, and the Office of Compliance Monitoring. None of the persons designated as the judicial staff may have any ex parte communications with the trial staff or any other interested person not employed by EPA on the merits of any of the issues involved in these proceedings, without fully complying with the applicable regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII.

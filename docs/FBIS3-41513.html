			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nanchang, January 24 (XINHUA) -- The increase rate  of forest resources in Jiangxi Province is growing faster than  the consumption rate of the resources.    Five years ago there were about 2.6 million ha [hectares] of  treeless mountain areas, and soil erosion was getting worse.    To reverse this situation the province set up 490 model  tree-planting centers which planted trees on a total area of  about 63,000 ha.    The centers were also responsible for popularizing advanced  technology, and techniques of transplanting trees and  cultivating seedlings.    Now there are more than 13,000 tree-planting units and  forest  farms in Jiangxi which are responsible for their own profits and  losses.    In 1993 the afforested area in the mountain regions of  Jiangxi was about 38,000 ha.    Statistics show that from 1989 to 1992 the afforested area  in  the province amounted to 184,000 ha, and the forest coverage  rate in the province rose from 30 percent in 1988 to 40.3  percent in 1992.</p>

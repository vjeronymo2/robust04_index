			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Gustavo Sierra, who helped discover the  meniningitis-B vaccine, has said that Cuban research into an  AIDS vaccine is progressing. Sierra told Latin American  delegates to the Second Infectious Diseases Seminar that many  researchers believe such a vaccine will be found by the end of  the century, while others believe it will be found much sooner.  Sierra went on to say: We are sure of one thing. If we are not  among the first, we will not be the last and we will not give up.</p>

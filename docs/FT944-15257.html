			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Laporte aims to fill gap with Perchem deal Laporte, the speciality chemicals group, yesterday said it was discussing with Akzo Nobel the possible acquisition of the Dutch-based group's Perchem business. The UK group wants to add Akzo Nobel's small UK subsidiary to fill a gap in its chemical production. Perchem manufactures so-called organoclays - absorbent products with applications ranging from adhesiveness in paints and inks to liquid clarification. 'The purchase price will probably be in the low millions,' Laporte said. Although the details have yet to be finalised, the company yesterday received clearance from the department of trade and industry to pursue the deal. 'Negotiations are therefore continuing with a view to a very early completion,' the company added. The move follows the merger last year of Akzo of the Netherlands with Nobel Industries, the Swedish chemicals group. Since then, the group has divested from some non-core areas and concentrated on coatings, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson on course with recovery BROWN &amp; JACKSON, the discount retailer which operates the Poundstretcher chain of stores and has recently undergone a radical reorganisation, yesterday announced interim results which, as expected, showed pre-tax losses for the nine and six month periods to June 30. But it was emphasised the group was on course with its recovery programme. In the first half of 1992 the group ran up a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.73m, including a Pounds 643,000 exceptional charge to cover the disposal of A&amp;G Imports. That compared to a deficit of Pounds 4.29m in the corresponding period, on turnover which fell by 15.5 per cent to Pounds 67.4m (Pounds 79.9m). On a fully diluted basis the loss per share was 3.3p for six months (1.3p). The group was reverting to a December 31 financial year, so the current accounts would cover 15 months. It also published results for the nine months to June 30. These showed a pre-tax loss, after the exceptional item, of Pounds 2.14m or 0.6p a share fully diluted, on turnover of Pounds 142m. Mr Ian Gray, the recently appointed chief executive who leads a new management team brought in following a revolt by institutional shareholders last year, said trading conditions in the first half were difficult and sales at Poundstretcher, which accounted for about 80 per cent of turnover, were down by about 5 per cent over 1991. In addition, the group was operating for most of the period under severe cash constraints until the proceeds of its Pounds 15.6m share placement and open offer were received in late June. This restricted purchasing which had an adverse effect on both sales volume and gross margins. Nevertheless, the group managed to improve its performance on a quarter-by-quarter basis, reducing pre-tax losses to Pounds 3.89m in the three months to June 30 compared to Pounds 5.85m in the previous quarter, and Pounds 7.6m in the final three months of 1991. Mr Gray said current trading was 'in line with expectations'. COMMENT Analysing Brown &amp; Jackson's results is complicated by its decision to return to an end-December financial year, a move justified because of the extremely seasonal nature of the business - Poundstretcher's 230 shops traditionally incur losses in all but the last quarter of the year. With the recapitalisation only completed in June, the first half results mark a reasonable start on the recovery road. Ian Gray, a retail specialist from Thorn EMI's rental division before being brought in to help rescue B&amp;J in February, has wasted no time in getting to grips with the problems. Two former subsidiaries have gone, the other non-Poundstretcher interests are under review, and the Poundstretcher shops are being updated and refitted. Stocks have been reduced and firmer mangement and cost controls introduced. With luck, and a good Christmas, the group should break-even this year and be back in the black in 1993.</p>

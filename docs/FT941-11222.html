			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Customs chokes on liquid definition The Value Added Tax Tribunal has made the first legal definition of a beverage in blocking an attempt by HM Customs &amp; Excise to claim VAT on a dietary product. Customs conceded in a statement issued yesterday that the meaning of a beverage in ordinary usage covers 'drinks or liquors that are commonly consumed'. The announcement followed a decision by the tribunal that 'liquids that are commonly consumed are those that are characteristically taken to increase bodily liquid levels, to slake the thirst, to fortify or give pleasure'. The case was triggered by an appeal by Bioconcepts, a company based in Havant, which manufactures Bio-Light, an opaque brown fluid designed primarily for slimmers. Customs zero-rated the product when the company began importing it in 1990, then changed its mind. It caved in when Bioconcepts appealed, then again made a VAT demand which the company said would have cost it more than Pounds 100,000. Customs argued that Bio-Light was a manufactured beverage, which would make it liable for VAT at the standard rate of 17.5 per cent, rather than the zero rate applied to foods. Bioconcepts took its case to the VAT tribunal, stressing that Bio-Light was a liquid food and adding that it was rated as such in other European countries. The tribunal found in favour of Bioconcepts, arguing that Bio-Light would not be consumed for pleasure. Customs said the growing number of health- and sports-related products which could be taken as a drink with food were making it increasingly difficult to assess their liability for tax. It said it had also lost a previous case, in which the tribunal found that a liquid sold for body-builders was also a food.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SSA uses special, multi-disciplinary teams of individuals to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct reengineering analyses and identify the best ways to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesign and significantly improve processes. Teams are comprised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of outstanding employees, all of whom are subject matter experts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in operational, programmatic, policy, systems, administrative,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other areas relevant to the business process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reengineering teams focus on identifying those procedural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and policy changes to the process that will: make it more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant and service oriented; greatly increase productivity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process speed; take advantage of opportunities offered by new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology; and improve the empowerment and professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrichment of the employees who are part of the process. Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> teams follow the same basic reengineering protocol, continual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customization is both expected and encouraged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Disability Process Reengineering Project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An Executive Steering Committee was formed to meet on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regular basis to provide advice to the Commissioner on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of the disability reengineering process change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal, and to ensure that support occurred at the highest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of the Agency. The Executive Steering Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established the following parameters and expectations for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project which are driven by targets set forth in the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Strategic Plan and based on percentages of service and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> productivity:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Parameters and Expectations for Reengineering the Disability Determination Process (9/15/93)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``process'' to be reengineered is the initial and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative appeals system for determining an individual's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entitlement to Social Security and Supplemental Security Income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability payments. It includes all actions from an individual's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial contact with SSA through payment effectuation or final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative denial. The system for determining whether an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual continues to be entitled to receive disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments is not part of this ``process.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rationale: The process to be reengineered must be defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broadly to increase the opportunity for improvement. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuing disability review system is not included because it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conceptually and practically distinct from the initial disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Parameters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Every aspect of the process except the statutory definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of disability, individual benefit amounts, the use of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative law judge as the presiding officer for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative hearings, and vocational rehabilitation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiaries, is within the scope of this reengineering effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, analysis and ideas for change should proceed and be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented on two tracks: improvements achievable without changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in statute or regulations and innovations that may require such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rationale: The timing of legislative or regulatory change is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond SSA's control. Such change could not reasonably be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to be implemented in less than 2 years. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limiting the reengineering effort to aspects of the process not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring change in statute or regulations was rejected as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limiting too greatly the possibility of major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvement/innovation in the process. The two-track approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides for both shorter term incremental improvements and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer term, more radical change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Expectations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Unless otherwise specified here, the recommendations for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change should be consistent with the goals and objectives set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth in the Agency Strategic Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Recommendations for change, taken as a whole, should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause changes in benefit outlays unless as a necessary result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvements in service, such as more timely processing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment of claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Process changes should improve service and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> productivity, on a combined basis, by at least 25 percent by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of FY 1997 over levels projected in the FY 1994 budget (it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require about an additional $500 million currently to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> realize such improvement) and decisional accuracy should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease. By FY 2000 additional actions, including any necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory and regulatory changes, should provide a further 25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent improvement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Executive Steering Committee facilitated ongoing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communications between components and the Team, and communicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the need and reason for reengineering the disability process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They were familiar with the current process problems and were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kept apprised of research completed by the Team. In February, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Steering Committee was expanded to include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presidents of the American Federation of Government Employees,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the National Federation of Federal Employees, and the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury Employees Union locals, councils and chapters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representing SSA employees; and the Presidents of the SSA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State Disability Determination Services (DDS) professional and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management associations recognized by SSA as having an interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in disability issues. A list of Executive Steering Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members appears at the end of this appendix.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 18 members of the Disability Reengineering Team, all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whom are SSA or State DDS employees, have varied and extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backgrounds in all aspects of the disability program. A list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Team members appears at the end of this chapter. Team members  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attended a high quality, intensive 3-day SSA reengineering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology training session, and completed extensive reading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assignments on reengineering. Some Team members visited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations who had reengineered their business processes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> learn about successes as well as opportunities for improvement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Team used the following methods to obtain the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to develop a redesigned disability process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Briefings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Members of the Team received extensive briefings from staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in all SSA components that work with any aspect of the disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process including experts in SSA policy, quality assurance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management information, operational, and appellate processes. Dr.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Frank S. Bloch, Professor of Law and Director of the Clinical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education Center at Vanderbilt, briefed the Team on the results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of his study comparing disability programs and processes of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States, Canada, and Western Europe. His work encompasses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility requirements and program goals, benefit award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure and short-term benefits, administrative organization,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and procedures for claim processing and appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Scan Visits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

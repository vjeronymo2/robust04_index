			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> U.S. PROTESTS ARMS SHIPMENT  </P> <P> The State Department said today that it has lodged a strong protest with the  Soviet Embassy concerning the "dangerous escalation" created by Nicaragua's  alleged attempt to ship Soviet Bloc weaponry to leftist rebels in El Salvador.  </P> <P> Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the Central American issue, as a  result of the abortive weapons delivery attempt, will become a prime area of  discussion when President Bush meets with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  on Dec. 2-3 in the Mediterranean off Malta.  </P> <P> The protest note deplores the "dangerous escalation of conflict, contrary to  Soviet assurances," Tutwiler said.  </P> <P> She added that Bush will press the Soviets "to take action to ensure their  allies (Nicaragua and Cuba) cease this outrageous behavior."  </P> <P> The note was delivered to the Soviet charge d'affaires Saturday evening by  Robert M. Kimmitt, undersecretary of state for political affairs, and Bernard  Aronson, assistant secretary for inter-American affairs.  </P></p>

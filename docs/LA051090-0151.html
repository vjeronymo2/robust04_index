			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SIERRA MADRE;  </P> <P> PERGOLA PLANS TO BE ALTERED  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday decided to alter its plans for rebuilding the  pergola outside City Hall after discovering that three construction companies  bidding for the work could not complete the job for the $62,500 estimate given  by the city engineer.  </P> <P> Faced with bids ranging from $66,950 to $104,799, the council decided to  redesign the project and find new funding sources. The city may use Community  Redevelopment Agency money to rebuild part of the pergola nearest the City Hall  entrance and devise other methods to pay for the structure's dome.  </P> <P> The 10-year-old, wisteria-draped pergola, or arbor, was torn down last year  after the wooden crossbeams were discovered to have been weakened by dampness  from the vines.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kurt Reumann: "Schroeder and the SPD Ignite </F> the Two-Stage Rocket; Economic Competence as Secret Weapon"]    [Text] Frankfurt, 14 Mar--It was never as paradoxical as  this: the triumph of the one is the consolation of the other.  Doubtless the success of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany] in the election for the Lower Saxon Landtag represents  a personal victory of its top candidate. Minister-President  Schroeder knew how to show himself to be the more experienced  candidate relative to his challenger Wulff. But can one conclude  from this that the three-time winner Chancellor Kohl will  prevail in the same manner over his young challenger Scharping  in the Bundestag election? That would mean that the experience  and routine of the top candidates decide elections. But what  about the other qualities of the matadors? Furthermore: Is it  really just a duel between the chancellor candidates in which  the parties do not count at all? Does anyone want to assert that  the SPD would have lost its mandate to govern in Lower Saxony if  it had not been for Schroeder or that the CDU/CSU [Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] will win the Bundestag  election despite its weakness because it has Kohl?  <H5>  Schroeder as the Trump Card </H5>   In any case, it is true in this respect that Schroeder was  the best trump card of the SPD in Lower Saxony. Only he made  possible what a minority of 22 percent had expected and only 37  percent had wanted: the SPD gained the absolute majority of the  seats. About half the voters prefer him as minister-president,  according to the latest surveys of the Election Research Group  in Mannheim (it works for ZDF [German TV Two]) and the Infas  Institute in Godesberg (it works for ARD [German TV One]). On  the other hand, only a good fifth (according to Infas) to  one-third (according to the Election Research Group) expressed  themselves in favor of Wulff. Corresponding with this is the  fact that the voters between the Ems and the Elbe assess  Schroeder better (plus/minus 1.4 on a scale of from plus 5 to  minus 5) than the SPD. But the first crack in this explanation  appears when one notes that Wulff (plus 1.2) also appears better  than the land-CDU in the eyes of the voters of Lower Saxony. The  second crack arises in the fact that it is not Kohl (a meager  minus 0.3 on the scale of the Election Research Group) who is  judged better by the voters of the entire nation but Scharping  (a likewise less than exciting plus 1.1). Of course personally  Kohl was never brilliant in preelection polls.    But whenever Kohl triumphed, he had a two-stage rocket to  thank for it: the first stage that advanced him a considerable  distance was the confidence in the economic competence of the  Union. The second stage was the expectation that Kohl would be  best able to apply this competence. The two-stage rocket still  exists and in times of economic crisis it is even the best  wonder weapon in elections. In Lower Saxony, however, it was not  the CDU but rather the SPD that ignited this rocket. What at  least a relative majority normally attributes to the CDU is now  expected of the SPD by the biggest share of the voters: the key  qualification of sound economic policy. The pollsters see this  expectation of the economic competence of the SPD not only in  Lower Saxony, but also everywhere in Germany.    In Lower Saxony, then, the confidence in Schroeder and the  hopes for the SPD have reinforced each other. Only rarely has an  economic theme been so much in the foreground of an election  campaign: almost 70 percent of those eligible to vote  characterized unemployment as the biggest problem; far behind in  second place (15 percent) was environmental pollution. Ten days  before the election, the Allensbach Institute for Opinion  Polling found out that it was above all the unemployed and their  families who are more likely to believe that the SPD rather than  the CDU can solve the problems in Lower Saxony (45.5 to 17.6  percent). But the population as a whole also believed the SPD to  be more competent (34.5 to 18.5 percent). There is also the  impression that Schroeder radiates optimism (61.1 percent  believe this). That also explains why 8 percent of the  SPD-voters came over from the CDU, according to a calculation by  Election Research Group. Where Schroeder got personally involved  to save industrial jobs, the SPD even gained votes in the  election in Lower Saxony. Often the voters do not want to  recognize the connection between the combatting of unemployment  and economic performance, and they attribute to the SPD more  ability to reduce unemployment, whereas they see the CDU as  having more competence to get the economy moving. The thrust is  much greater when the voters see both capabilities united in the  SPD.    With Kohl, the Union will hope that those eligible to vote  do  not really believe that. It will say to itself that the voters  are only half serious about an election of the landtag, but are  totally serious about a Bundestag election. As a matter of fact,  there was a hint in February that the CDU was recovering: in the  mood barometer of the Election Research Group, it rose by 4  percentage points to 35 percent in Germany as a whole, and the  SPD fell 2 percentage points to 42 percent. But the gap is still  seven points and that is a lot. It is even larger in the  Allensbach survey for this newspaper: there the SPD led by 13  percent at the beginning of March, having 47 percent compared  with 34 percent for the CDU. To be sure, the CDU would have done  even worse in Lower Saxony if the election had been in January.  Its slight recovery in all of western Germany stands against  further lost votes in the east.    The second advantage of the SPD is that it appears to have a  secure coalition partner, whereas the CDU does not. Just as in  Hamburg, the FDP [Free Democratic Party] will not be in the  Lower Saxon Landtag either. It lost 1.6 points and that is  devastating for a small party. And presently things do not look  better for the Free Democrats in the nation as a whole. In  mid-February, the Election Research Group signaled that for the  first time since the last Bundestag election the FDP had fallen  below 5 percent in all of Germany; also in mid-February, the  Allensbach Institute for Opinion Polling registered only 4  percent for the FDP and by the end of February and beginning of  March it was a paper-thin 5 percent. A comparable weakness under  conflicting conditions (participating in the government in Bonn  and in the opposition in Hannover) will prolong the FDP's  uncertainty until the Bundestag election on 16 October. The FDP  lacks a personality like Genscher. It is a matter of two things:  the party and its top people.  <H5>  Splinter Parties in a Downward Trend </H5>   The results in Lower Saxony confirm what polls are signaling  for all of Germany: the splinter parties will not be in the  Bundestag, although it cannot be overlooked that the  Republikaner achieved 5 percent in 13 of 100 electoral districts  of Lower Saxony. On 16 October, there will be only one fateful  decision: will the FDP also shrink down to a splinter party? In  this election year, the voters appear to be thinking about the  big parties. The "party of the nonvoters," as Infas calls it,  has not--contrary to what previously happened in  Baden-Wuerttemberg, Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, and  Brandenburg--grown into the strongest party. Return to normalcy?  What would be normal without the FDP? With the Greens as a  normal party, normalcy would shift to the left.</p>

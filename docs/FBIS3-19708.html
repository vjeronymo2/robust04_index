			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aerospatiale President Louis Gallois by </F> Patrick Marx and Francois Roche; place and date not given:  "Government Aid: Louis Gallois Wants a `Marrakesh Round'" --  first paragraph is LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES introduction]    [Text] This year, European aviation will enter a crucial  phase in the face of American competition, especially in the  manufacture of airliners. Confronted with Boeing and McDonnell  Douglas, which, by winning a 35-billion-franc [Fr] contract in  Saudi Arabia, have demonstrated the formidable political and  diplomatic support they receive from the White House, the  partners in Airbus Industrie will have to find a suitable  response. Just like they will have to defend tooth and nail  what they gained from the agreement of July 1992, which put a  ceiling on reimbursable advances paid to Airbus and indirect aid  received by American companies. In this difficult international  context, the improvement in Aerospatiale's accounts brings a  note of optimism to its President Louis Gallois.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] In 1993, Aerospatiale managed to  reduce its losses compared to the previous year by almost half.  What is your comment on this result.    [Gallois] The improvement in the accounts is certainly  insufficient -- we are still making a substantial loss -- but it  is significant. This is all the more true since it is taking  place against the background of a deteriorated economic climate.  With sales down 4.5 percent, the operating results and the net  results have improved by almost Fr1 billion. The need for  operating capital has shrunk considerably, thus making it  possible to reduce the net debt by Fr3.2 billion before the  capital appropriation of Fr2 billion. These figures reflect the  effort made by everyone in the company. They show the company's  ability to adapt to a difficult period, and that is a highly  encouraging sign for the future.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] From time to time voices are heard  calling for a change in the legal structure of the Airbus  Industrie consortium in order to turn it into a genuine, more  efficient company. Do you share this concern?    [Gallois] I would reiterate that, in the space of 20 years,  the Airbus consortium has taken 30 percent of the world market  in airliners with more than 100 seats. Airbus must adapt to the  growth in its sector of activity and stay competitive when  confronted with competitors, who are not inactive. To do that,  it is essential that its industrial partners reduce their costs,  which should encourage them to improve cooperation. Many things  can be done in this respect without changing the legal  structure. If serious obstacles were to arise to the needed  progress, and if they justified a change in the status of the  consortium, we would have to look into it, but then we would  have to be sure that it was worth the trouble, because it would  be an enormous task. I sometimes get the feeling that I am  watching an ideological debate. Let us be pragmatic, and open!    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Could the European aviation sector be  weakened by the Italian Alenia group's plan to take a stake in  the capital of McDonnell Douglas?    [Gallois] That is a good question. We are working closely  with Alenia, with whom we share the ATR [Regional Transport  Aircraft] consortium, which accounts for a major share of their  work load. I have always regretted the fact that Alenia was not  part of Airbus. However, to get the Italians to enter now would  require a new program. The future large military transport  plane, the FLA, which will be the subject of international  cooperation, could provide the right occasion for bringing the  Italians closer to European aviation.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] The Saudi contract of mid-February,  which will entail the purchase by Saudi Airlines of some 50  Boeing and McDonnell Douglas airliners, caused indignation on  the part of the Airbus partners, who were excluded from the  contract because of the highly political campaign waged by the  United States. How do you analyze this affair?    [Gallois] The airplanes were sold a little like how military  aircraft are sold. There has always been political intervention  on the occasion of government visits, for example, but within  certain limits. This time, the announcement of the contract was  made by President Clinton himself. The White House publicly  confirmed its role and Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown said that  he himself negotiated directly with Riyadh. He also affirmed  that the same thing would happen again in the future. The  important thing is not to say whether this is good or bad, but  to learn the lesson. For us in Europe, it means that we have to  adjust our behavior and set up a device making it possible to  act the same way as the Americans.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] The GATT member states are meeting  from 12 to 15 April in Marrakesh to sign the agreements on the  Uruguay Round. It is known that the aviation issue was not  handled in the way the Europeans would have liked, because of  opposition from the United States, and it is still pending...    [Gallois] The GATT talks have demonstrated one thing, for  lack of coming to a close: The Americans want to eliminate the  reimbursable advances given to the partners in Airbus Industrie,  but refuse to exercise any control over the indirect aid  received by their own aircraft manufacturers. We want exactly  the opposite. We want to see the reimbursable advances  legitimized, as was provided for in an U.S.-European agreement  of July 1992 on airplanes with more than 10 seats, and the  control of indirect aid. We must set up indicators to assess  the financing of upstream research practiced in the United  States. This is not always easy, but there are objective data  such as the NASA budget. We must also reach an agreement on the  basis for making the calculation.    NASA, for example, spends large amounts of money on research  into the future supersonic aircraft, which has a significant  impact on many of the technologies currently used, but the  United States refuses to consider this money to be indirect aid  as defined in the agreement of July 1992 because there is no  formal program for developing a supersonic aircraft. We are  proposing, in effect, to take advantage of the Marrakesh meeting  to launch the negotiations, which are provided for in the  agreements concluded on 15 December in Geneva. It must not be  forgotten that Japan and Canada share the European view: To  perpetuate and elaborate the 1992 agreement for indirect aid.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] However, we get the impression that  we  in Europe are still at the "we have to..." stage with regard to  the United States, without actually adopting a firm position.    [Gallois] The concept of a united Europe is not so easy to  put into practice in our sector: We have to display a lot of  pedagogical talent in order to convince certain countries of the  importance of the stakes and to really activate European  solidarity. The Saudi affair could be an important factor in  this.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What do you recommend for making the  European system of reimbursable advances evolve toward the  American system of indirect support?    [Gallois] Economically speaking, reimbursable advances are a  good solution for providing financing because they involve the  sharing of risks between the companies and the governments, and  oblige the former to pay back the sums received. Thus,  Aerospatiale pays back every year several hundred million  francs. Rather than completely abandoning an intelligent system  for another one, we should try to strike a balance between the  two, which is what is stipulated in the 1992 agreement.  Aerospatiale currently receives less than 0.5 percent of its  research expenditures in indirect aid, whereas the ceiling set  by the 1992 agreement is 3 percent of the annual sales of the  aeronautics industry, and 4 percent of the sales of the company  concerned.    So there is room to evolve more toward indirect support  without calling into question the concept of reimbursable  advances. I would also reiterate that these advances, which  were on the order of 60 percent for past programs, were capped  at 33 percent by the 1992 agreement.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SHOT AT 2ND TIME FROM HARBOR PROJECT;  </P> <P> GANGS: MORE OFFICERS ARE CALLED IN TO THE AREA. BOTH ATTACKS ARE SEEN AS  RETALIATION FOR A GANG MEMBER'S DEATH.  </P> <P> For the second time in a week, gang members at a Wilmington housing project  have shot at Los Angeles police in apparent retaliation for the recent death of  a gang member, police said.  </P> <P> Responding to the Thursday shooting, Harbor Division Cmdr. Joe DeLadurantey  said as many as two dozen officers from other LAPD divisions have been assigned  to the harbor area to put more officers in gang neighborhoods. The first of  those officers arrived Thursday.  </P> <P> DeLadurantey, who earlier this week had turned down an offer of additional  officers, said the shooting at a patrol car at Dana Strand Village convinced  him that the way to confront the gangs' recent bravado is with more police  patrols.  </P> <P> "After what happened this morning, there is no doubt we need additional  presence," DeLadurantey said.  </P> <P> "It would be easy for me to call in an army. I'm not going to do that,"  DeLadurantey added. "But I do think we need additional officers . . . and we  need the community to get involved. Enough is enough."  </P> <P> No officer was injured in the shooting Thursday, which happened at 2:30 a.m. as  several patrol cars answered a call about a disturbance at the project. One  teen-ager was arrested on suspicion of assault on a police officer with a  deadly weapon. In the first armed assault on police last Sunday, one officer  was grazed by a bullet.  </P> <P> The Thursday shooting heightened fears among community activists that a handful  of gang members at Dana Strand remain bent on revenge for the death Saturday  morning of John Santos. An autopsy found that the 21-year-old gang member  choked to death on a tiny plastic bag containing what police believe were  narcotics.  </P> <P> Although the contents of the bag have not yet been analyzed by the coroner's  office, the autopsy Wednesday confirmed initial police reports that Santos  choked to death.  </P> <P> The finding contradicts gang rumors that he died at the hands of officers.  Police and community activists said Thursday that the coroner's report is  meaningless to a few raging gang members.  </P> <P> "They've got a couple of hotheads out there who still want to make a name for  themselves," said Dee Wiggington, president of Mothers Against Gangs Support  Services, a local group attempting all week to ease tensions at Dana Strand.  </P> <P> Detective Kim Wierman said Thursday's shooting occurred after police were  called to Dana Strand by a resident who complained of a disturbance in the  central parking lot of the 384-unit housing project, just east of the Harbor  Freeway.  </P> <P> Mindful of rumors that gang members might try to ambush police at the projects,  the officers entered Dana Strand only after a police dispatcher confirmed that  the call was legitimate. Even then, Wierman said, the first officers arriving  at Dana Strand waited for two additional patrol cars before driving into the  project.  </P> <P> As they entered the central lot, Wierman said, the officers found about a dozen  gang members standing around, one of them motioning defiantly for police to  approach.  </P> <P> "Normally they run when they see officers drive up, but this time they just  waved the officers on," Wierman said.  </P> <P> Moments later, he said, one of the youths pulled out a handgun and began  shooting, hitting one of the patrol cars.  </P> <P> The officers, who did not return the gunfire, chased the gang members as they  fled from the projects, arresting the 17-year-old several blocks away, Wierman  said. The teen-ager, not identified because of his age, was still in custody  late Thursday.  </P> <P> By late Thursday, Wierman said, it was unclear if the suspect is the one  responsible for this shooting or one early Sunday, in which a bullet grazed one  of two officers driving past Dana Strand.  </P> <P> The arrival of additional officers from LAPD's gang detail and several other  divisions was seen by police and community activists as regrettable but  unavoidable.  </P> <P> "I hate to see this happen. But it's gotten to the point where there is no  choice but to bring in more police," said Wiggington of Mothers Against Gangs.  </P> <P> The additional officers from the 77th, Southwest and Southeast divisions will  be assigned to routine police calls while Harbor Division police, more familiar  with local gangs, handle beefed-up patrols around housing projects and other  gang problem areas, said DeLadurantey.  </P> <P> The increased deployment, he said, is likely to continue for the next month.  </P> <P> "I think it will take at least that long to show some results, because to be  effective you almost have to treat gang activity like a brush fire that moves  from place to place," he said.  </P> <P> That movement is precisely what Wilmington activists had feared.  </P> <P> "This is horrible. Things are totally out of hand," longtime activist Eleanor  Montano said after learning of the latest shooting at Dana Strand. "I thought  things might finally quiet down," she said, because the fighting between  Wilmington gangs had subsided.  </P> <P> "Now they're going after the police," Montano said.  </P></p>

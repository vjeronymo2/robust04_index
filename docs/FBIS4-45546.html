He also said the INCD has eight agents highly qualified in  the area of investigation, who will work full-time to determine  the activities, whereabouts, and money laundering activities of  Sinaloa's most important drug traffickers and drug producers.  The official said that the 41 federal agents are part of a  select group of investigators, adding that they were taken in  helicopters to bases the Attorney General's Office (PGR) has set  up in mountainous areas.    The official stressed that authorities will investigate  those  who finance the production of narcotics, because the aim is to  specifically punish those who provide the financial resources,  not so much drug couriers. The INCD director asserted that  authorities have detected some marijuana and poppy plantations  in the mountains dividing Durango, Chihuahua, and Sonora.    Meanwhile, Antonio Figueroa Lee, president of the Alberto  Sanchez Gonzalez Bar Association, affirmed that the PGR must  improve the process of selecting agents to effectively fight  drug trafficking.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: EFM Dragon Trust EFM Dragon Trust, the investment trust which took over Drayton Asia Trust earlier this year via a contested bid, lifted its net asset value from 12.03p to 21.36p over the year to August 31. The 78 per cent increase largely reflected the strong performance of the dollar, which rose some 33 per cent against sterling over the period. Sharply higher interest charges, however, prompted a decline in net profits from Pounds 345,000 to Pounds 277,000. Earnings per share, on the increased capital, fell to 0.049p (0.11p) and the single dividend for the year is passed (0.06p) 'due to the small amounts available and the costs involved', said Mr Hugh Byatt, chairman. A 1-for-4 consolidation of shares is proposed.</p>

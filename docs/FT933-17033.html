			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Pique in Paris as Germans refuse to cross the Rhine 'BEYOND the turbulences of the moment, which are inevitable, the French-German relationship will keep the depth and the permanence which are necessary for both Europe and France.' This was the rather portentous way in which Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, sought yesterday in the National Assembly to soothe anxious questioners about the currently shaky state of the Paris-Bonn axis. Independent French experts on relations across the Rhine concur in the basic solidity of the alliance. Ms Anne-Marie Le Gloannec of the Centre d'Etudes et Recherches Internationales pointed out yesterday that France and Germany have successfully weathered previous hiccups in their relationship, notably the initial hostile reaction of many French politicians in 1989-90 to the prospect of German unification. But there is clear concern in France at the proliferating pinpricks between Paris and Bonn. 'They should not be dramatised, but neither should they be underestimated,' said Mr Juppe yesterday. 'None of the disagreements are about anything as spectacular as German unification, but the fact that they are so numerous, ranging from monetary policy and Gatt to bananas and waste recycling, makes them harder to manage,' commented Ms Le Gloannec. They are compounded by the fact that the new Balladur government is proving more assertive of French interests than its socialist predecessor. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, carried this too far last week by appearing to summon his German opposite numbers to Paris for talks on 'concerted' interest rate cuts, while at the same time claiming that an increasing number of countries seemed to be looking to the Bank of France rather than the Bundesbank for the lead in lowering the cost of money in Europe. Not surprisingly, the Germans refused to cross the Rhine last week. But the view in Mr Alphandery's own ministry is that their minister's gaffe does not change 'the fundamentals' which remain in France's favour. These are that France has lower inflation, and less depressing prospects for growth and for budget deficits, than Germany's. Therefore, France, like the Netherlands, will be able to keep its short- and medium-term interest rates below those of Germany, and may be able to cut rates a little bit more, independently of whatever the Bundesbank does. Virtually every minister in the Balladur government believes, or hopes, this will eventually bring recovery in France. The one exception is Mr Alain Madelin, the minister in charge of small business, who in an interview yesterday complained that 'the franc's link to the D-Mark imposes a floor on French short-term rates, which can no longer drop significantly below German rates, as France's situation demands'. But the maverick Mr Madelin did not go as far as urging publicly any change in the franc/D-Mark parity. Mr Balladur has not yet struck any close relationship with Chancellor Kohl, whose relationship with President Mitterrand remains closer. It has therefore become essential for the French prime minister that his 'cohabitation' with Mr Mitterrand stay as smooth as possible. He is banking strongly on Mr Mitterrand using his influence with Mr Kohl, both at the Tokyo summit next week and later.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Bells starts to trade up - Appetisers What do you do when you are a whisky company faced with a decline in whisky consumption as well as a disaffection among the younger drinkers in favour of Bourbon and vodka? If you are Bells you trade up. Instead of the old five-year-old Bells whisky the stuff in the bottle is now eight years old. What is more, the price remains the same. With nearly half the malt whisky distilleries in its portfolio, United Distillers certainly has the wherewithal to make a great blended whisky. The percentage of malt in the new Bells has not changed. The company says, simply, that it has altered the 'balance'. Still, about 60 per cent of the whisky is grain from the UP Cameronbridge distillery. The main malts are Glenkinchie, Blair Atholl, Dufftown, Linkwood, Inchgower, Oban and Caol Ila. Both the Dufftown and a percentage of the Linkwood have a heavy sherry treatment. The sherry shows on the new Bells. Whereas the old 'tinker' had a slightly disagreeable rancid character, the new Bells has a more finely-tuned toffee and raisins flavour from the sherry. Now that most of the large cognac houses seem to have abandoned the UK for the more profitable far eastern market, it is a rare pleasure to see someone still actively selling cognac and good cognac too. Delamain cognacs come from Jarnac on the Charente. The family can trace its participation in the brandy business back to the eary 17th century and is the last privately-owned merchant house in the region, with Alain Braastad at the helm, on his mother's side a direct descendant of the founders of the house. Delamain is special in that it sells only Grande Champagne cognacs which are 25-years-old and over. This means that all their brandies have that rancio character: the aromas of rich fruitcake. Pale and Dry is an average of 25 years, a cognac of great breeding and delicacy. Many prefer it to the more expensive Vesper which averages 35 years and is a heavier, woodier cognac. The oldest commercially available is the Tres Venerable, which is between 50 and 60 years old. (At around 60 years cognac is normally removed from casks to prevent it from becoming too woody.) This cognac has a persistence on the palate which lingers for minutes. It is worth shopping around for Pale and Dry as there are considerable variations in price: La Reserve, 56 Walton Street, London SW3. (071-589 2020), Pounds 45; Selfridges (071-629 1234) Pounds 42.50; Reid Wines, The Mill, Hallatrow Bristol (01761-452645) Pounds 35; and Lea and Sandeman, 301 Fulham Road, SW10 and 211 Kensington Church Street, W8 (071-376 4767) Pounds 36.50. Lea and Sandeman also stocks Vesper at Pounds 49 and Tres Venerable at Pounds 98.99.</p>

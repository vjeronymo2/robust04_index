			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Major to defend economic record MR JOHN MAJOR will today set the stage for the most closely fought British general election since 1974 by launching a vigorous defence of the government's economic record. With a final draft of his party's election manifesto completed late on Thursday, the prime minister will tell a Conservative local government conference in London that the average citizen's lifestyle has improved immeasurably over the past 13 years. His stress on increased prosperity since the Conservatives took power will be backed with figures showing the sharp rise in numbers of young people taking up places in higher education and the spread in ownership of consumer durables. But Labour yesterday seized on BT's plans to cut 25,000 jobs to put rising unemployment under the spotlight in the run-up to next week's Budget. Senior opposition frontbenchers called on Mr Major to take 'the urgent action necessary' on training, jobs and investment. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade secretary, said 125,000 jobs had been lost since the new year, and independent forecasts showed 400,000 more were at risk. Mr Major's speech to Tory councillors is not intended to herald the election campaign. The election date is now thought likely to be announced on Wednesday and the prime minister's rallying call to the party is expected to be made to the Tory central council at Torquay next Saturday. Ministers last night welcomed new figures showing a sharp reduction in Britain's current account deficit last year to its smallest annual shortfall since 1987. But City economists were treating the figures warily, claiming the revision from a provisional Pounds 5.8bn to Pounds 4.4bn was the result of 'unsustainable' features. A frantic week of pre-election manoeuvring ended with the Tories releasing a 256-page dossier, entitled Who's Left?, detailing what they claim are the leftwing political affiliations and statements of Labour MPs. Labour branded it as 'dirty tricks' and 'muckspreading'.</p>

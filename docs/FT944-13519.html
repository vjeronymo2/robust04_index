			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Misreading the road map A web of asphalt spreading over the green fields of England: that is one of the nightmare visions conjured up by yesterday's report on UK transport policy from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. Its authors, 16 scientists and environmental experts, foresee a future where Britain builds miles of new roads, at ever-increasing cost, but fails entirely to relieve the traffic jams choking its cities and junctions. Many share those fears. Environmentalists have warmly welcomed the commission's warnings and most of its 100 recommendations. But this congested report, two years in preparation, does little to clear the road ahead. That is unfortunate because it is entirely right in starting from the principle that road users should pay the full environmental and health costs of the roads: pollution, accidents, noise and loss of amenities. It is indisputably right, too, in observing that it is hard to set such prices. Pollution and noise can be measured straightforwardly, but some health implications are unclear. Medical researchers suspect that exhaust fumes are an important factor behind the rising incidence of asthma, but have not yet proved the link. But such difficulties should not deter calculations; they simply imply that the conclusions should be repeatedly reviewed. The commission provides a good example: it calls use of super unleaded petrol, portrayed for years as 'green', into question for causing emission of high levels of benzene. The figures assembled by the commission, if imperfect, are illuminating. It puts the environmental costs of road use by all vehicles at between Pounds 4.6bn and Pounds 12.9bn. Accidents add a further Pounds 5.4bn. After taking account of building costs, it estimates that revenue raised from road users ranges from 121 per cent of total costs to 81 per cent. The estimates clearly portray heavy goods vehicles as the villains, covering only between half and two-thirds of their unit costs. The commission is right to conclude that measures should be taken to ensure they close that gap. But it begins to veer off its route in addressing cars and light goods vehicles. The report suggests that these more than cover the total costs of their use of the roads. But it nonetheless wants taxes on these vehicles to be raised in order to protect the countryside - an environmental asset it considers priceless. That step reveals the weakness of the report: an excess of morality over economics. The authors assert that it can be morally wrong to trade environmental assets against the benefits of mobility. They exhort people to walk more and get fitter per se, instead of driving. The conclusion the report should have reached is that, provided road use is correctly priced, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with building more roads if needed. That is not to preclude more investment in public transport, one of the commission's main recommendations. In central London, for example, it is clearly wanted and needed. But throughout, the report portrays public transport as a better substitute for roads than it is capable of being, however well maintained. The commission is right that government has done a poor job of assessing Britain's transport needs for the future. Its report does not, however, fill the gap.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 13 -- Defence Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk Monday recalled Spokesman for the Defence Ministry  Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki from the post. At the same time  Kolodziejczyk distanced himself from the text of Rozbicki's  article published in the Thursday issue of GAZETA WYBORCZA.    According to Kolodziejczyk, Rozbicki's putting the signature  of "The Defence Ministry's Press Spokesman" under the article  without permission, was an abuse of his official post and a  violation of journalistic ethics by using the post of the  spokesman to express his personal opinions.    In the article "We Have Disarmed Ourselves" Rozbicki argued  that Poland's signing arms reduction agreements was unjustified.  He also claimed that shifting the military information service  WSI (Intelligence and Counterintelligence) from the ministry's  civilian structures and making it subordinate to the general  staff may bring positive results as, according to him, for the  sake of state security it would be better if a civilian minister  would not have full access to information delivered by the WSI.    Kolodziejczyk expressed regret at the "incident." The  spokesman's opinions attest to the fact that "he does not  understand the principle of a full control of the state  authorities, including parliament, over the armed forces, the  principle obeyed in democratic countries," the defence minister  wrote in a letter to Head of the Sejm Defence Committee Jerzy  Szmajdzinski.    The committee Saturday charged Rozbicki with "incompetence,"  "disrespect for civilian politicians" and "lack of understanding  of the fundamental principle of full control of the state  authorities over the armed forces."</p>

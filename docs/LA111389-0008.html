			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED ARMY CHORUS  </P> <P> As an opening-night ticket holder to the Red Army Chorus performance at the  Shrine Auditorium, I would like to offer a comment.  </P> <P> To our new Armenian neighbors, welcome to our democratic experiment. I am  pleased that you are enjoying the freedoms of speech and peaceable assembly  that our society provides. No doubt you have chosen to join with us because of  a heightened appreciation of these special freedoms. But the blockage of the  Shrine Auditorium on opening night did nothing to enhance these liberties  (Metro, Nov. 4).  </P> <P> In fact this act was a frontal attack on both these basic rights, more in the  spirit of totalitarianism than of democracy. These freedoms, my friends, are  for all of us, equally for you and for me. This is part of our special heritage  as Americans.  </P> <P> BRUCE REIFEL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

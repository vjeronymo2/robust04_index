Kalashnikov-designed assault rifles have a  worldwide reputation. Much less has been written about our  portable antitank grenade launchers. Meanwhile they are worthy  of respect and the highest assessment in their class of weapons.  The RPG-7 is in the inventory of 40 countries' armies and is  being manufactured in some of them.    The RPG-7's design concept was developed at the end of the  1950's. An active-reactive ballistic design for an antitank  weapon (Chief Designer V.K. Firulin) was used in this grenade  launcher for the first time. In other words, the grenade  "gathers momentum" using two engines -- launch and sustainer --  which provides a significant advantage in firing range. The  RPG-7 with this projectile (PG-7V) was accepted into the  inventory in 1961. This design was utilized more than a decade  later in foreign grenade launchers (Sweden, Germany).    The PG-7V basic projectile reliably penetrated the armor of  the main battle tanks of the 1960's. The employment of the RPG-7  in a combat situation, specifically in the Middle East,  convinced us of that.    The PG-7VM and PG-7VS projectiles, which provided a greater  armor penetrating capability with a smaller caliber, were  accepted into the inventory at a later date.    However, the age-old battle of projectile and armor  seriously  intensified with the appearance of layered composite armor that  was developed in England. They used it in the armor protection  of the Challenger (Great Britain), M1 Abrams (United States),  and Leopard-2 (Germany) tanks. It is much more difficult for  armor-piercing and shaped-charge projectiles to penetrate this  type of armor. The development of the PG-7VL projectile, with a  powerful warhead that guarantees an armor penetrating capability  of up to 600 mm, for the RPG-7 was our designers' response. This  was achieved by increasing the caliber of the grenade, the  weight of the explosive and improvement of the shaped charge  [kumulyativnyy uzel]. Indeed, in the process the firing range  was reduced.    The appearance of dynamic protection (reactive armor)  further  intensified the problem of maintaining the RPG-7's effectiveness  (as, by the way, of all other grenade launchers and also ATGM's  [antitank guided missiles]. Reactive armor is comparatively  small units that are attached to the main armor of the tank or  armored infantry vehicle. Elements consisting of two plates that  are separated by a layer of explosives are located in a unit.  When a grenade hits, the element's explosives detonate, the  strike wave and the stream of fragments disperse the shaped jet  and its energy is significantly lost for penetrating the  portions of the plates. Increasing the grenade's power does not  provide increased effectiveness in this case.    And yet a solution to this problem has also been found. The  PG-7VR projectile with a tandem warhead -- with two shaped  charges located one behind the other-- was developed for the  RPG-7 under the direction of Chief Designer I.Ye. Rogozin  ("Bazalt" State Scientific Production Enterprise). They operate  in succession. The first destroys the dynamic protection and the  second penetrates the main armor. In this manner, our portable  grenade launcher was the first in the class of grenade launcher  weapons to provide the capability to combat tanks equipped with  dynamic protection elements.    An RPG-7 with a PG-7VR tandem projectile penetrated an armor  plate equipped with dynamic protection -- a model of the latest  tank armor -- at the arms exhibition in Abu-Dhabi (United Arab  Emirates) in the spring of 1993. This caused a sensation. Just  like this projectile penetrating through a half-meter thick  steel-reinforced concrete cube. We can say that the  domestically-produced RPG-7 portable antitank grenade launcher  that was developed several decades ago is experiencing a second  birth.

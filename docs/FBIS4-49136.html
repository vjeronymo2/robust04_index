			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Beverly Chau in Manila] </F>   [Text] Construction and power magnate Gordon Wu  Ying-Sheung is considering pulling out of mainland power  projects because of the officially imposed cap on returns for  foreign investors. Mr Wu, managing director of Hopewell  Holdings and the recently floated Consolidated Electric Power  Asia (CEPA), said his companies would look for more attractive  developments in Asia. "I find a lot of places which are much  greener than China," Mr Wu said.    CEPA has become embroiled in a row with mainland authorities  on the level of returns offered by China on foreign investments  in power projects. Beijing has capped returns at 12 per cent,  compared with the 18 per cent which Mr Wu said he was offered by  other Asian countries. Hopewell Holdings, the construction arm  of Mr Wu's business empire, is also battling on another front  over the construction costs of the Boca Tigris bridge in  Guangdong province.    The 59-year-old businessman attacked mainland authorities at  a seminar in Hong Kong earlier this week when he claimed the  returns were too low by international standards. He said a  realistic rate was about 18 per cent and 15 to 16 per cent was  workable if the Government cut the red tape involved in setting  up power projects. However, he stepped up his attack in Manila  on Friday on his way to a ground-breaking ceremony for CEPA's  latest power station, a US$1.6 billion (HK$12.37 billion)  coal-fired operation in Pangasinan province. He said he would  consider avoiding China if the issue on capped returns could not  be resolved. "I don't think I can change the mind of the  Chinese people and so I would say it could be better to back  off," he said. He added that he was unlikely to be alone in his  thinking about power developments on the mainland.    CEPA was spun off from the Hopewell group earlier this year  with plans to invest and develop power projects throughout Asia,  but particularly in China. The group has announced plans to  build several operations on the mainland. It has signed letters  of intent to build power facilities in Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong  and Shenzhen and has a preliminary agreement on building a power  plant in Guangxi.    CEPA's development in the Philippines is scheduled to be  commissioned by 1996. President Fidel Ramos was at yesterday's  ground-breaking ceremony and said that plans were in the  pipeline for CEPA to build more power plants under the  Philippines' build, operate and transfer (BOT) scheme.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF and Dasa in two ventures Thomson-CSF, the French defence-based electronics company, yesterday announced two joint ventures with Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) in an attempt to show that it had not been pushed off its expansionary course by losses from the Credit Lyonnais bank that put it FFr2.3bn (Dollars 410m) in the red last year. The Thomson-CSF and Dasa joint companies are involved in 'smart' munitions and missile propulsion. They would have a combined turnover of FFr1.9bn. 'We have not yet finished our expansion,' said Mr Alain Gomez, president, noting that it was only external acquisitions over the past four years that had enabled Thomson-CSF to keep its turnover steady last year at FFr34bn. The French government this week confirmed its decision to renew Mr Gomez's tenure as president of Thomson SA, the group holding company, as well as of Thomson-CSF. Thomson SA had an overall net loss last year of FFr3.03bn, largely due to Thomson-CSF's FFr2.3bn net loss.</p>

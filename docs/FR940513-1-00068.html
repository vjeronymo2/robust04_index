			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Format for the Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The chosen format for the standards for product loading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a percentage of mass emissions reduction. An alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> format for gasoline vapor recovery, a maximum allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration for the vapor processor exhaust is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed. Emissions are prohibited from ballasting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations and from regeneration of carbon adsorber beds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Compliance Deadline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The compliance deadline for existing sources affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the RACT standards is 2 years after the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgation. The compliance deadline for existing sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by the MACT standards is 2 years after the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgation. An existing source that subsequently exceeds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a RACT throughput cutoff will have 2 years to comply once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the source exceeds a throughput cutoff. Similarly, any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source that exists as of the effective date of the standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and subsequently exceeds the MACT applicability thresholds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have 2 years to comply with the existing source MACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. All other new or reconstructed facilities will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to comply upon startup, with the exceptions noted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;63.6 of the part 63 General Provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Initial Performance Tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Owners or operators must perform initial performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests as required by &sect;63.7 of the General Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all combustion or recovery devices except devices such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as boilers or process heaters where the emissions stream is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the primary fuel or boilers and process heaters having a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design heat input capacity of 44 megawatts or more. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test method for compliance for combustion devices is the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 25 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. The test method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for compliance for recovery devices is the EPA Method 25A of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. Flares are not subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same tests as other control devices, but must pass a visible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions test according to the requirements of Method 22 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. The performance tests must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted to include the loading of the last 20 percent of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compartment, and may be spread out over multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compartments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Vessel Tightness Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three alternatives to ensure vessel tightness are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed: (1) Pressure test the vessel, (2) perform a leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test on all components using Method 21 of appendix A of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR part 60, or (3) load the vessel at less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> atmospheric pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Owners or operators using a vent system that contains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valves that could divert a vent stream from a control device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must either monitor vent stream flow to ensure that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not diverted from a control device or secure the bypass line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valve in the closed position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitoring criteria have been established for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion devices (except flares), carbon adsorbers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condensers and adsorbers. In general, facilities would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to establish operating parameters during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial performance test and then monitor combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature for combustion devices, VOC concentration in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust stream outlet for carbon adsorbers, exhaust stream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature for condensers, and VOC outlet concentration for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adsorbers. In the case of flares, owners or operators would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be required to monitor for the continuous presence of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flame and to monitor vent stream flow. Owners or operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeking to use other types of control devices may develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced monitoring criteria for these devices and submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the criteria to the Administrator for approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Recordkeeping and Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sources required to install controls would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fulfill the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 63 General Provisions including submittal of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following reports: (1) Compliance notification report,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) notification of initial performance test, (3) report of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial performance test, (4) quarterly parameter exceedance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report, and (5) quarterly emissions estimation report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These sources must also maintain documentation that vessels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loaded at the facility are vapor tight. All information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be made readily available to the Administrator or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delegated State authority for a minimum of 5 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Rationale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Selection of Affected Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The primary release of vapors during the marine tank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel loading process occurs at the tank vessel through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hatches, vents, and vent systems. However, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impractical for marine tank vessels to carry their own vapor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing systems given the limited space on individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels. It is also much more economical for terminals to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> install and operate control devices that are capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlling emissions from multiple vessels than for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel to control its own emissions. Furthermore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 183(f) requires that ``to the extent practicable such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards shall apply to loading and unloading facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and not to tank vessels.'' Therefore, these regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that terminals install an air pollution control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device and a means of routing the air/vapor mixture from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel to the air pollution control device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vessels will not be allowed to load or unload product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless they are compatible with terminal air pollution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control systems or have a self contained emissions control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system on board. Therefore, vessels loading at a controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminal will need to have their own vapor collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems (i.e., pipes which allow for connection to terminal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air pollution control system) in order to route vapors to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shore. However, vessels are not required to load at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled terminals. As a result, the affected source is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to the terminal, which is in turn required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capture and control all loading emissions, with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception of ballasting and off-shore terminal emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are discussed elsewhere in this preamble. Emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from off shore vessel-to-vessel bulk liquid transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations (i.e., lightering operations) are also not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included as a source affected by these standards because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these operations do not take place at onshore terminals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

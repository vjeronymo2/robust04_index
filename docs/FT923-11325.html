			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Assets rise 10% at Independent Inv The Independent Investment Company, which principally invests in venture capital opportunities, reported a near-10 per cent rise to 60.11p in net assets per share at June 30. Directors said the rise from last time's 54.8p was achieved despite the 'sluggish' economy and a 15 per cent fall in the dollar/sterling exchange rate. Available revenue for the year was Pounds 587,000 (Pounds 660,000), equal to earnings of 0.63p (0.71p) per share. The single dividend rises from 0.45p to 0.5p.</p>

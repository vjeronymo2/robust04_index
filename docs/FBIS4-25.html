			<p>SUMMARY                                         In an apparent at tempt to repair some of the economic damage done  during the conservative backlash that followed the collapse of  East Europe, Pyongyang has again affirmed a reformist economic  agenda.  Pyongyang's renewed stress on this agenda, combined with  the regime's failure so far to place the economy on a war  footing, suggest that it has not ruled out a peaceful settlement  of the nuclear issue.                                       END SUMMARY     Pyongyang's reaffirmation of its reformist economic agenda came  at the 6-8 April session of North Korea's parliament, the Supreme  People's Assembly (SPA).  The session was devoted mainly to  mapping out economic policy for the next three years.  In  reiterating the economic policy of giving priorities to  agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade, the SPA session  continued Pyongyang's shift away from its traditional--and  classically communist--emphasis on heavy industry.  This shift,  which has been proceeding with fits and starts in recent years,  received a major boost at the December party plenum and in Kim  Il-song's New Year's address(SEE NOTE).  Justifying this shift,  the keynote speaker at the SPA session, Premier Kang Song-san,  claimed that Pyongyang's earlier policy of emphasizing heavy  industry had been intended mainly as a way to rapidly develop  light industry and agriculture and that the policy was never  meant to develop heavy industry for its own sake.     (NOTE: As usual for spring SPA sessions, whose main agendas are  the state budget, the latest SPA session was not immediately  preceded by a party plenum.)     Kang's equivocation on the role of heavy industrial development  amplified President Kim Il-song's call in his New Year's speech  to invest "efforts" into the coal, power, and metal sectors "in a  bid to develop" light industry and agriculture (New Year address,  Pyongyang radio, 1 January 1994).  Since the mid-1950's,  Pyongyang had given priority to basic and heavy industry at the  expense of the consumer goods sector.  In the mid-198O's, the  sagging economy and reforms in other socialist economies  encouraged North Koreans advocating economic reform to start  chipping away at the heavy industry-first approach, an effort  which was rebuffed in the aftermath of the fall of communism.     Other Reform Issues     In addition to claiming that Pyongyang  has always sought to develop light industry rapidly, Kang  reaffirmed Pyongyang's commitment to a number of reform agenda  items that had suffered setbacks in the conservative backlash of  the past five years, among them:     + Separation of powers.  Kang seemed to echo the sentiments of  reformers in trying to limit the party's domination of economic  affairs.  Laying out separate areas of responsibility for the  party and the government, he said the government should serve as  "the center" responsible for carrying out "economic works," while  the party should be responsible for formulating those economic  works.  Like other officials before him, he claimed that  separating areas of responsibility between the party and the  government is the way to ensure that the party's leadership is  "firmly established."     + Material incentives.  Indicating the sensitive nature of this  topic in the current atmosphere of ideological rigidity, Kang  made only a brief reference to the issue of promoting industrial  efficiency by means other than political exhortation, another  perennial item on the reformist agenda.  Without mentioning the  term material incentives, Kang endorsed reformers' assertions  that industrial productivity can only be enhanced by rewarding  performance.  He said that plants and enterprises should enforce  a strict cost accounting system, should be allowed to keep part  of the profits they make, and by the same token, should be held  accountable for any losses incurred.     + Free trade zone.  Supporting another putative reformist agenda  item, Kang urged that additional "efforts" be put into the "free  economic and trade zone" now being developed in the Tumen River  basin so as to "fully ensure" conditions for foreign investment.  However, suggesting Pyongyang's continuing uneasiness over the  potential domestic impact, Pyongyang radio's coverage of Kang's  speech left out his remarks on the trade zone.  Only the shorter  KCNA version for overseas audiences carried a summarized version  of his remarks on the zone.     Resource Allocation     Finance Minister Yun Ki-chong's annual  budget message, also delivered at the SPA session (Pyongyang  radio, 7 April), similarly appeared to reflect a reform agenda.  (As usual, Yun gave no actual figures for individual budget items  and expressed the projected expenditures for some items in  percentages, while using vague expressions such as "a huge  amount" to describe other items of lesser priority.)     + Foreign trade.  Reflecting the regime's renewed interest in  international commerce, Yun pledged to boost state investments in  the foreign trade sector by 4.2 percent over the last year and  called for building "more plants and shops" and organizing more  "work teams" dedicated to producing exports goods.  Furthermore,  defying conservatives' pronounced misgivings about the  processing trade,"  Yun vowed to build more bases for combining  foreign capital, technology, and materials with North Korean  labor to earn foreign exchange.     + Light industry.  In her speech, Yun projected an increase of  5.4 percent in state investment in light industry over last year.     At the same time, Yun's speech also seemed designed to avoid  raising popular expectations too much.  Although the 5.4 percent  increase in investment in light industry was a larger than usual  proportionate increase, it still fell far short of the 13 percent  figure used in 1989 to dramatize the Pyongyang regime's professed  commitment to improving the consumer goods sector during what was  touted as "the year of light industry."  Moreover, in this year's  speech she failed to announce construction of new light  industrial plants, promising only to "modernize" existing  facilities.  In addition, she placed more than usual emphasis on  increasing production of "3 August people's consumer goods."  Named after the day in 1984 when Kim Chong-il visited a Pyongyang  exposition of consumer goods made of scrap materials, these goods  have been used to ostensibly relieve shortages over the years.  Yun pledged to "expand and develop" production facilities and  labor force for these goods, indicating that Pyongyang will be  relying heavily on what had started as a stop-gap measure to meet  an increased portion of consumer needs.     Party Cell Meeting     In contrast to the SPA's renewed emphasis  on a more reformist approach to the economy, the SPA session  coincided with  signs that the regime intends to impose tighter  social discipline, ostensibly to forestall any inflow of foreign  influences.  To this end, an unprecedented national conference of  party cell secretaries was held from 31 March to 2 April.  Touted  as "the first of its kind ever" since the party's founding  (Pyongyang radio, 25 March), the meeting pledged "infinite  loyalty" to the party and promised to lead the masses in carrying  out revolution (Pyongyang radio, 31 March-2 April).  In a message  to the cell secretaries, Kim Il-song called on them to prevent  infiltration of any "alien ideologies or unwholesome life-styles"  (Pyongyang radio, 31 March).     Military Aspect     Despite the crisis atmosphere Pyongyang has  created in recent weeks over the nuclear issue, both Finance  Minister Yun's SPA address and the keynote speech at the party  cell conference seemed designed to avoid alarming the population:     +  In her speech Yun projected a only a modest increase in  defense spending proportionate to the total national budget,  claiming that 11.6 percent of state expenditure will be devoted  to defense.  Yun claimed that Pyongyang had actually spent 11.5  percent of last year's total national expenditure for defense.  Although the publicized figures for defense spending may bear  little resemblance to the actual outlays, Pyongyang has over the  years used the proportion of defense expenditure to the total  budget to signal the degree of tension on the peninsula.  For  instance, the announced figures for defense spending for the late  1960's were around 30 percent of the total state budget.     +  Similarly, the party cell keynote speaker, party secretary Pak  Ki-nam, appeared remarkably restrained in his war rhetoric.  Instead of the alarmist warnings issued routinely at mass  meetings, Pak portrayed the army and people as united and ready  to cope with any eventuality.  He praised the army for having  "honorably defended" the fatherland under the leadership of Kim  Chong-il during last year's staging of Team Spirit military  exercise in the South (Pyongyang radio, 31 March).  He went on to  promise that "the army and people" will do the same "if the  United States and South Korean puppet clique" provoke a new war.     Implications     Pyongyang media treatment of the SPA session and  the cell meeting indicate that, despite the heightened war  rhetoric over the nuclear issue, the North Korean leadership does  not wish to place the nation on a war footing at this point and  risk disruption of the already bad economy.  Pyongyang's current  stance is consistent with its recent signals that the regime has  not ruled out a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue.     (AUTHOR:  YIM.

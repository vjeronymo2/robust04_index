			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Fashion: But is your uniform correct? - In our series of dress codes around the world, FT writers look at what to wear on the golf course LONDON Golf is, of course, a Scottish game. Its earliest players trudged the misty greens in serviceable, dun-coloured tweeds, traditional woollies, rugged plus-fours tucked into thick long socks, stolid brogues and a rain-deflecting flat country cap. Women - for the game was initially neither gender nor class-limited - tended to vary the uniform only in the matter of a long skirt, later a divided one. Once you remember those practical origins, today's lurid golfing uniforms are easy to understand; their essential foul-weather nature has merely been corrupted by effete southern taste, advances in fabric technology, American vulgarity and Florida's climate. Arguably, golf is the one sport for which special clothing is unnecessary. Providing footwear is sturdy, gripping and comfortable and the rest is unrestricting, what need for pastel argyll-patterned sweaters, loudly checked slacks, luridly-two-toned zipper-fronted cardigans, green-visored caps and spitefully spiked shoes? The need, of course, is acceptance. Golf's uniform is about belonging to the class of chap or lady - they certainly still call them ladies in proper golfing circles - who belongs to a golf club. Britain is well-supplied with municipal golf courses and persons do play there in their shellsuits and plimmies, but that is not at all what golf is about in modern Britain. For most of the participants golf is a whole, narrowly policed social scene, a bastion of middle-class safety to which outsiders may aspire but which is closely guarded against them. Within its bunkers business deals are done, nephews are fixed up with first jobs, loans are made at advantageous rates of interest. It is all easily done because it all happens between what golfers fondly believe are their own kind. So the uniform, achingly unstylish, is a signal system denoting a set of values to which its wearers all subscribe. That these values are hardly altruistic or even idealistic was demonstrated by America's Ryder Cup team when its petulant members refused to shake the hand of the president who had just increased the taxes on their enormous incomes. As Mary Quant once observed, all specialised sports gear eventually catches fashion's eye and becomes sexy. As she did not add, but might have: except golfing gear - too middle class, too complacent, too ugly. PARIS There are some areas of life where the French are incorrigibly conservative and golf is one of them. The ritual begins with the choice of club. Any old golf club simply will not do. The place where a Parisian plays golf speaks volumes about his, or her, status. So the swankier the club, the better. Saint-Cloud, which boasts President Mitterrand and half the cabinet among its members, is the swankiest of all followed by La Boulie and Chantilly. Yet the uniform is the same wherever you play. Parisians, predictably, dress just as smartly for a few hours on the golf course as they do for any other event. A polo shirt and shorts (neatly cropped just above the knee and tapering to the waist) are de rigueur for summer as are well-cut trousers and a V-neck jumper over the polo shirt for winter. Colours are subdued. White is popular for golfing in warm weather, with occasional glimpses of blue and green for light relief. Shoes are snowy white: the very shade to show off a Cote d'Azur tan to perfection. Hats are acceptable as long as they leave enough room for Ray-Bans and co-ordinate with the other clothes. French golfers tend to regard clashing colours, jaunty ballcaps and two-tone shoes as strictly for the Americans. Anyone who thinks they might be able to worm their way into one of the more sought-after French golf clubs without the requisite kit is doomed to disappointment. Bernard Tapie, the former socialist cabinet's token 'medallion man', sauntered into Saint-Cloud last summer to deliver a speech. The doorman told him to leave. Saint-Cloud, he said, was for members only and Tapie was not one. TOKYO For the Japanese men and women who are wealthy enough to frequent the country's golf courses, fashion on the green is a serious matter. And just as strict conformity to the dress code in the office or on formal occasions is taken for granted, those on the golf course are expected to play by the rule of casual but conservative good taste. So, men on the course will commonly be seen in trousers, polo shirt and vest while women tend to opt for skirts that come to just above the knee or culottes which are easy to move in. Their distinguishing feature is their conformity to the 'golf look,' you can spot them a mile away. As on other occasions, Japanese players in rain or mist favour designer-clothes from Christian Dior to Yves Saint Laurent. In addition to the famous French names, in golf, the good, old traditional names from Britain, such as Burberrys and Dunhill, also go a long way. For those who prefer a more casual look, and accessible price, than either Dior or Dunhill affords, there are countless names from the world of golf to adorn the pocket or cap. Among the more popular are the Jack Nicklaus signature with his polar bear symbol and Arnold Palmer with an umbrella. Such signatures can be found not only on clothes but on everything else from hand towels to socks and accessories. Even though it is more often than not associated with business in Japan, golf being a social occasion and increasingly popular among well-off housewives, more colour than is seen on Tokyo's streets can be enjoyed in the choice of clothes worn on the green. Men who are normally restricted to drab grey and navy suits, do not hesitate to appear in bright green, sky blue or lemon when it comes to a day swinging the iron club. But the real fun of dressing up for golf, the women say, comes after the game is over. Even in Japan, more people are taking advantage of their leisure time to indulge their taste for sport, both as a physical experience and a chance to mingle with others. That in turn has led to a growing taste for casual chic. So, after a long, hot bath at the country club to revive both the body and spirit, the women will join up with their men, looking refreshed in their cashmeres and tweeds, wearing shoes from Italy, perhaps, and sporting a bag made in Spain. NEW YORK Patrick Harverson Being asked to describe what Americans wear on the golf course immediately brought to mind a sketch from the British television show Not the Nine O'Clock News, the one which ridiculed golfers as men doing battle in an elaborate ugly-trouser competition 'And it's Weiskopf now, putting for a birdie, wearing an exceedingly silly pair of trousers. . .' Yet, it would be unfair to lump New York's golfers in with the silly-trouser brigade, for they are a different breed from their canary counterparts in Florida and California. Perhaps in keeping with the north easterner's patrician, faux-European, sensibilities, in recent years New York golf fashions have tended to be more stylish, the colours subtler, the patterns less stomach-churning. A new look is emerging as a younger generation of golfers seek to avoid . . . well, looking too much like golfers. Thus, the starchy, brightly coloured red-white-and-blue shirts and plaid polyester slacks of old are out. In their place are baggier golf shirts in moodier browns and olives or sensitive teals and taupes, and looser, more stylishly cut trousers that would not look out of place in a chic restaurant. The city's golfers, it seems, are sick of wearing clothes that have to be stashed away in embarrassment as soon as the last putt has been holed. In their search for the complete, all-purpose casual wear, men are turning to labels like Ralph Lauren's Polo, Bobby Jones, Cutter &amp; Buck, and Pelican Hill, while women choose new designs from established names like Bogner, Nordstrom and Evan Picone. Essentially, golfers want to return to the elegant days of the 1930s and 1940s, when people regarded a round of golf as an excellent opportunity to get in some exercise and show off the latest duds. There are, however, a few golfers in New York, as there are everywhere, who think that if they dress like the pros, they will play like the pros. This means there will always be someone on the course wearing a hideously bright shirt with a white-shark logo marketed by Australian star Greg Norman, or a garish shirt and plus-fours like the ensemble that Payne Stewart wears to every tournament. In spite of their reputation for savviness, New Yorkers do not seem to realise that at least the pro golfers get paid to look stupid. FRANKFURT Christopher Parkes The pretty golf course at Kronberg, 20 minutes outside Frankfurt, is a quiet place at the best of times. The sound of club on ball is rarely followed by anything more than appreciative mutterings, and, naturally, the occasional clunk of ball on an out-of-bound tree. The players dress in keeping with their decorous behaviour. Long-distance observations by a non-player suggest that in the peak season, summer, women's costumes fall into two categories: pretty and sporty. The first classification requires a white or pastel frock. Together with matching ankle socks the ensemble is reminiscent of 1930s tennis rig. The sportif look requires knee-length shorts with turn-ups, in a choice of pale cottons or light plaids. A cotton eye-shade and a Ralph Lauren polo shirt - or anything with one of the thousands of 'designer' logos which litter German leisure wear - wrap things up. There is one category for men's outfits: pretty sporty, but uniformly in the Bernhard Langer style. To judge by appearances, it is a breach of club rules to be under-equipped. Even the most casual thrash-about in the undergrowth seems to require a full set of clubs (with hats), state-of-the-art trolley, gloves, cap, sweater, pocket knife and trenching tools. But there is rarely a sign of the crunchy waterproofs and the over-sized umbrellas so common in Britain. Swinging in the rain is not a favoured occupation among Frankfurt's fair-weather denizens of the fairways. The Kronberg turf is clearly a place for being seen, not for getting wet. If it is raining, or even cold, it's time to retreat to one of the area's dozens of covered tennis courts.</p>

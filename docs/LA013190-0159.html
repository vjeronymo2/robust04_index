			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: NANCY REAGAN'S TURN ON PHOENIX HOUSE FLAP  </P> <P> Nancy Reagan is fed up with the magazines Vanity Fair and Los Angeles and with  this column for comments about her "backing out of her support" for the Phoenix  House drug program. She says, "Enough already!"  </P> <P> Mrs. Reagan insists she did not "defect" or "back out" of this project, which  was to build a drug treatment center in L.A. (Activists who didn't want the  center in their neighborhood threatened to picket the Reagan house in Bel-Air.)  Mrs. Reagan says she simply took her name off the project because she  reconsidered and because she felt she was overextended and exhausted. She had  just suffered a bout with pneumonia at that time, which very few people  realize.  </P> <P> Here is Nancy Reagan: "I returned to California and found out how strongly  local people here felt about the center being built. It just did not seem  feasible for me to go on. I had already raised $5 million for Dr. Mitch  Rosenthal and the Phoenix House. I did not take any of this money for my own  foundation; I tried to secure it all for Phoenix House. And, as for the few who  pledged who tried to erase their pledges after I withdrew my name -- well, I  have worked hard to convince them not to do this.  </P> <P> "I did not withdraw support from the program. I left Phoenix House with all  that money I had raised. I have never said a word against the Phoenix House,  which is a great program, nor against Mitch. But, you know, I can't do  everything.  </P> <P> "I realized at the time I was spreading myself too thin. Now I don't believe I  deserve all this negative publicity when I have worked so hard. I do wish Grant  Tinker and others who are so exercised had called me before issuing statements.  I never thought that the 'just say no' slogan would solve the drug problem. How  silly! It was simply a phrase that caught on, but certainly there is much more  to do about drugs. Public education and treatment centers are the answer.  </P> <P> "Tell me, where does one working for these good causes draw the line? My own  drug foundation has already given 13 grants, and I am still going to schools  and centers talking to children and to young people all over the country.  </P> <P> "I worked against drugs for eight years in the White House and I will continue.  But I don't think I deserve to be in the spot the Phoenix House supporters --  and the press -- have put me for having decided I was doing too much and for  removing my name from the building of the L.A. treatment center.  </P> <P> "I am all for everything Tina Brown and Grant Tinker and others can do for  Phoenix House. If they raise a lot of money from their March 22 gala in  California, that will be wonderful. . . . But I am tired of being blamed for  not having done enough myself."  </P> <P> THE HOTTEST strip of celluloid these days is a simple little story about an old  woman and a black man who becomes her friend. The amazing "Driving Miss Daisy"  not only won all those recent awards and critical raves, it aced out Tom Cruise  and "Born on the Fourth of July" for the top box office spot last week. Soon,  Lili and Richard Zanuck and their partner, Jerry Perenchio, will take the  Jessica Tandy-Morgan Freeman-Dan Aykroyd movie to Berlin.  </P> <P> The Zanuck Co. is aglow, just like in the good old days. They have "Daisy's"  playwright, Alfred Uhry, writing their next film, based on Josephine Humphrey's  novel "Rich in Love," another tale set in the South.  </P> <P> And they have the talented Robert Towne to write and direct another sizzler.  They paid a million dollars to novelist Kim Rozencraft for her book "Rush," all  about an undercover narcotics agent in Texas. Now Tom Cruise is interested in  starring in it.  </P></p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Leading Article: The pressures on Mr Kohl ANGLO-GERMAN bickering over the Bundesbank's role in sterling's misfortunes entered a new phase yesterday with Dr Helmut Schlesinger's fierce rebuttal of recent British government 'reproaches'. It is clearly futile, as well as indefensible, for the UK to unload the blame for British economic failures on to Germany's independent central bank. What is not, however, in question, is that overall German policy errors since the unification process started in 1990 have contributed to European-wide economic problems. The Bundesbank's high interest rates represent not a symbol of German strength, but the price of German policy weakness, manifested in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's inability to put the financing of German unification on to a healthier footing. Slow economic growth around the continent is one factor - among others - behind the rising discontent over the Maastricht treaty. Mr Kohl wants to salvage the treaty. He also, presumably, wants to rescue his country from the potentially dire effects of the rapid build-up of public sector debt generated by generous state financing of east German living standards. On the 10th anniversary of his accession to the chancellorship, Mr Kohl thus has two compelling reasons for putting Germany's economic house in order. Mr Kohl needs to succeed during the next 12 months in creating the conditions for a self-generating upturn in the eastern part of his country. Otherwise, Germany - as the continent's pivotal economic and political power  -will bear some responsibility for the possible fragmentation of the western part of the continent. German stagnation The threat is not that the Maastricht process will take place at varying speeds, with a small number of countries going ahead at first. This development is the only possible way for economic and monetary union to proceed, and was always implicit in the timetable agreed last year. The greatest danger is that if the German economy runs into fully-fledged recession, European integration as a whole will grind to a halt. Without a solid German core, even a two-speed Europe is likely to be a pipe dream. Germany's domestic prospects are far from encouraging. The economy in the west has been stagnant for months, while the hoped-for recovery in the east has tailed off. The government has made inadequate efforts to cut subsidies and spending. This has led to a position - unsustainable in the long term - under which transfers from the west account for more than half east Germany's gross domestic product. The sharp rise of the D-Mark against other European currencies has depressed chances for export-led growth. Since Germany's unit labour costs are now rising faster than those of most competitors, German industry is in a far worse position to withstand the latest currency revaluation than during the 1970s and 1980s. Inflationary danger The Bundesbank's net monetary reserves have risen by an unprecedented DM68bn in the latest two weeks as a result of action to prop up sterling, the lira and the French franc. The extra liquidity on German money markets, notwithstanding the Bundesbank's comprehensive 'mopping up' operations, is likely to fuel the inflationary pressures which the Bundesbank most fears. This, in turn, will prevent a rapid fall in D-Mark interest rates. Just when robust expansion is needed, Germany could be in store for an ill-timed bout of stagflation. Yet there is a chance for Mr Kohl to break free from the encircling dangers. When Germany set off down the road to unity two years ago, the world knew it would represent the most severe test of the country's resolve and cohesion. Germany has failed to generate the spirit of national consensus needed to meet that test - but it is not too late. In a bid to repair his mistake of two years ago, the chancellor has launched an attempt to spread the burdens of unity financing as widely as possible, under a mooted 'solidarity pact' with trade unions and employers. This is the right first step. Germany's economic policies of the moment are bad for itself and worse for its neighbours. The reaffirmation of Germany' European commitment should start at home.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Siemens, Skoda in fresh talks SIEMENS, the German electronics group, is to meet with Skoda Pilzen of the Czech republic today to talk about possible co-operation in the transport business, Reuter reports from Erlangen. A Siemens spokesman said the talks between Mr Lubomir Soudek, the Skoda chairman, and Mr Wolfram Martinsen, a Siemens management board member in charge of the transport business, were initiated by Skoda. Earlier talks between the groups about joint ventures in power generation and transport have run into difficulties about the terms. Siemens has said it was fundamentally interested in co-operating with Skoda, but the joint ventures had become financially unfeasible due to the demands from Skoda. The spokesman said the two groups would focus on the possible co-operation in the transport sector today and talks on energy co-operation would be a secondary issue. ***** BFG BANK should make a profit this year, according to Mr Michel Renault, managing director of France's Credit Lyonnais, Reuter reports from Paris. The French state-owned bank took a stake of 50 per cent plus one share in the troubled German bank at the end of last year for a cash and equity injection totalling DM1.2bn (Dollars 750m). 'The new team has . . . put in place measures over two years, which should allow BfG to return to profitable business from this year,' Mr Renault said. BfG made a group operating profit, adjusted for extraordinary items, of DM144m in 1991 after a loss in 1990. ***** A CONSORTIUM of four creditor banks and the state-owned Ferunion Foreign Trade Co has acquired Salgglas Rt, the troubled Hungarian glassmaker, Reuter reports from Budapest. Ms Eva Botlik, managing director of Inter Europa Bank, said the consortium, called Glasunion Kft, planned for Salgglas to supply windshields to the Suzuki factory in Hungary and was seeking markets in Ukraine, according to a local news agency. Salgglas, which declared bankruptcy in May 1992, made a 270m forint (Dollars 3.2m) loss in 1991 on sales of 2bn forint. It has not yet reported 1992 results. ***** COCKERILL SAMBRE, the Belgian steelmaker, will continue its investment programme to modernise key facilities despite poor earnings, Reuter reports from Brussels. Mr Jean Gandois, the chairman, met union representatives yesterday and told them the main investments in 1993 will be carried out. These include modernising one blast furnace. Another furnace was due to be modernised in 1994. The company said said last week that it was likely to show a 1993 loss in its steel business. ***** ROUSSEL UCLAF, the French pharmaceutical company, said it had sold its 22.7 per cent stake in Jouveinal to Jouveinal's controlling Roux family, Reuter reports from Paris.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Attempt to end delay on sale of Israeli interests ARTHUR ANDERSEN, admin-istrator of Mr Robert Maxwell's private companies, has arranged a bid of Dollars 18m (Pounds 10m) for the late publisher's majority stake in Ma'ariv Modi'in by another Maxwell Media Trust company in an unorthodox attempt to end the delay of the sale of the Israeli media group. The move appeared chiefly designed to draw out the holders of the remaining 15 per cent of Ma'ariv Modi'in, which publishes Ma'ariv, the country's second biggest daily newspaper, whose right to first refusal on the sale of the Maxwell holdings has been largely responsible for a delay in the bidding process. The three main potential bidders, including Hollinger, the Canadian media group, have been reluctant to reveal their plans while the intentions of Mr Shimon Cheifetz, the Ma'ariv managing director, who holds a 10 per cent stake and first refusal rights, were unclear. The potential buyers have also set a value on the Maxwell stake which is well below the Dollars 18m being offered yesterday by the administrators. Ma'ariv Modi'in is understood to carry debt of about Dollars 30m and is said to require a capital injection in addition to the buying price. The main potential Israeli buyers are a group led by Mr Dov Judkovsky, Ma'ariv editor, and Mr Aharon Dovrat, a director, both of whom were close associates of Mr Maxwell, and Mr Ya'acov Nimrodi, a businessman. The administrators said the offer for the Maxwell stake was being made by Marnline, a wholly-owned Maxwell Media subsidiary to enable the sale process to proceed. It gave the shareholders who have rights of first refusal 15 days to offer at least the same price, or the stake would go to Marn-line. 'Thereafter, the administrators will be in a position to sell the shares in Marnline Limited free of pre-emption rights for either Dollars 18m or any higher figure that they agree,' a statement said. Israeli sources associated with the rival bidders, who are competing with each other to do a deal with Mr Cheifetz, attacked the move by the administrators. 'It is not a genuine bid. Their problem is that no-one is bidding. The sole purpose of this is to get Cheifetz out of the way. It is a sign of desperation,' said one.</p>

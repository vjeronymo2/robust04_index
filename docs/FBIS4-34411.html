			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Political violence in Peru  caused 39 deaths in May, which shows a slowdown. According to  analyst Carlos Tapia today, however, this does mean terrorist  activities will end in the short term.    The June issue of PERUPAZ carries an interview with Tapia  and  the latest statistics regarding violence in Peru.    According to these statistics, 413 people died in May 1992,  169 in May 1993, and 39 in May 1994. Of the 39 who died this  year, 11 were civilians, six police and soldiers, and 22  terrorists and narcoterrorists.    Since May 1980, when the Shining Path [SL] started its  subversive actions, through May 1994 some 27,500 to 30,000  people were killed.    Of this total, 2,459 were members of the security forces,  11,768 civilians, 12,967 terrorists, and 277 narcoterrorists.    Although, according to some commentators, terrorist  activities have decreased by some 80 percent, this does not mean  the SL has been dismantled although it is "seriously wounded."    PERUPAZ asserts that "`Feliciano's' determination to  continue  implementing the SL plan lacks any grounds and has no chance.  `Feliciano'--Oscar Ramirez Durand--has replaced leader Abimael  Guzman, currently in prison, a fact that has divided the SL."    However, the publication states it is not enough for those  who are under arrest to show that they are in favor of peace,  such as Guzman and other leaders, it is also necessary that  those "who are still up in arms to surrender, repent, and hand  themselves in."    PERUPAZ explains that wiping out the current focus of  violence is not enough, that "any chances, no matter how small  they are, that it may resurface must be wiped out."    PERUPAZ maintains that "unhappiness, social protests, and  the  naive tendency to believe that violence will solve the problems  of injustice affecting the country" must be eliminated to  prevent violence from appearing again.    For this reason security measures have been stepped up in  Lima for the eve of 18 and 19 July, when the massacre of 250  inmates charged with terrorism in three Lima prisons in 1986,  when Alan Garcia was president, took place.    The Shining Path considers these dates the "day of heroism"  and authorities fear new attacks.    Analyst Carlos Tapia says it is "irresponsible" to maintain,  as Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori does, that terrorism will  have been wiped out in Peru by the end of his term in office in  July 1995.    Tapia asserted: "It is quite unlikely that the SL, which has  become a phenomenon with social implications that somehow  belongs to Peruvian history and has survived for the past 14  years, will disappear just because the president says so,  because the social processes do not end from one day to the  next."</p>

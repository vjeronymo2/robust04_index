			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Citicorp advances despite Dollars 927m bad debt provision CITICORP, the leading US bank that has been trying to boost its capital and stem losses caused by problem consumer and commercial property loans, yesterday reported a Dollars 116m third-quarter net profit. Although much improved on the Dollars 885m loss suffered in the same quarter last year, Citicorp's performance continues to reflect heavy bad-debt provisions and loan write-offs. The bank said third-quarter bad debt provisions totalled Dollars 927m, up from Dollars 896m a year ago. A Dollars 65m restructuring charge was also recorded in the quarter. The bank, as it forecast two weeks ago, wrote off Dollars 860m of consumer loans, compared to Dollars 786m in write-offs a year ago. Citicorp also wrote off Dollars 234m of commercial property loans in North American, compared with Dollars 135m of such write-offs in the third quarter of 1991. Bad debt provisions for commercial property loans were Dollars 309m, up from Dollars 229m a year ago. The North American commercial property division suffered a quarterly loss of Dollars 267m, against a Dollars 185m loss a year ago. Earnings per share were 17 cents, higher than the bank's forecast of October 5, when it predicted earnings of 8 to 13 cents a share. Mr John Reed, Citicorp's chairman, termed the results 'encouraging evidence of Citicorp's steady progress toward rebuilding its earnings capacity and strengthening its balance sheet despite widespread economic sluggishness'. He said the bank continued 'on track' to meet its objectives. Citicorp highlighted its third-quarter operating margin of Dollars 1.9bn, which compared with Dollars 1.4bn a year ago. The margin reflected strong results from the bank's foreign exchange activities. The bank also stressed that its Tier One capital ratio, the main US regulatory measure of capital against assets, had improved to 4.25 per cent from 3.67 per cent a year ago. Citicorp said it had boosted its total regulatory capital by Dollars 1.7bn in the past 12 months and noted that when a Dollars 1bn preferred stock sale closes on Thursday the Tier One ratio will increase to 4.50 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A special discussion was held at the prime  minister's bureau this morning on the dispute with the PLO over  who will have jurisdiction over Israelis coming to Gaza and  Jericho. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that  Major General Amnon Shahaq and the Foreign Ministry's legal  adviser Yo'el Singer, who participated in the deliberations,  will return to Cairo at noon. The water discussions apparently  concluded successfully. It was decided that Israel will  continue supplying water to the settlements in the Gaza Strip.</p>

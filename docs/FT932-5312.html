			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Technology: Grime removed from Michelangelo's frescoes A DECADE of work by Vatican restorers has removed nearly five centuries of ancient and modern grime from Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, writes Andrew Baxter. But now that the frescoes are clean, how can they be kept so when subjected to the breath and body heat of 2m visitors each year? Today, Pope John Paul II officially accepts the answer - a completed air treatment system for the Sistine Chapel from William Frago, president of Carrier, the world's largest air conditioning manufacturer. Years of research by Carrier of the US and the Vatican's own experts have gone into designing a system that is effective and discreet. Temperature and air flow studies indicated that warm, moist air was rising up towards the ceiling every morning as doors opened and visitors flowed in. The warm air spread across the ceiling, then cooled and descended, leaving behind moisture and dirt on the frescoes. Excessive moisture would encourage the growth of mould and the formation of salt deposits. The solution, therefore, was to install a system that provided a clean, stable microclimate for the frescoes. Control of relative humidity is the most important aim, because large swings allow water movement into and out of the plaster. Minimising overall temperature differences reduces expansion and contraction of the fresco material. A Carrier air handling unit delivers fresh air which has been filtered, washed and processed before entering the Chapel through diffusers under the south windows, about 15m up. These create two air flows, one of low velocity which flows over the surface of the frescoes, and a second which effectively bathes visitors with a 'shower' of clean air at floor level, where the air is extracted. The windows will remain closed to Rome's noise and pollution. Two computer terminals, one in the Vatican's energy centre and the other with the restoration scientists, allow information from the system to be stored and evaluated, to ensure the frescoes retain their new-found sparkle.</p>

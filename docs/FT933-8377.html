			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Buy-out at Fisons offshoot FISONS has disposed of CP Pharmaceuticals, its Wrexham-based hospital and generic products subsidiary, to a holding company formed by a management buy-out team, led by Mr Charles Savage. The price paid was not disclosed. The company was formed by Fisons from a merger of Charnwood Pharmaceuticals with Weddell Pharmaceuticals in 1983, and employs about 200 people. Fisons announced its intention to sell CP Pharmaceuticals last September. Mr Savage said the company intended to make spare capacity available to other pharmaceutical companies on a contract manufacturing basis, and would also be looking to establish strategic alliances with similar companies.</p>

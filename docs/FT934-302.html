			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: Arthur Andersen tops rankings Arthur Andersen has become the world's largest accountancy firm by fee income, according the International Accounting Bulletin. The firm grew by 7.9 per cent to just over Dollars 6bn in the year to August, overtaking by Dollars 17m KPMG Peat Marwick, which has been the largest network since it was formed by the merger of two firms in 1987. Just two of the largest 14 international firms and networks reported any declines: KPMG, which was down 1.6 per cent to Dollars 6bn in the year to September 30, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, down 2.4 per cent to Dollars 5.2bn in the year to September 30. Andersen reported the largest growth, more than half of which came from Andersen Consulting, the computer consultancy provider. It is the only true single worldwide firm, while the others are looser networks and affiliations of national firms. Ernst &amp; Young reported growth of 2.4 per cent to Dollars 5.8bn in the year to September, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu rose 4.2 per cent to Dollars 5bn and Price Waterhouse 3.4 per cent to Dollars 3.9bn. International Accounting Bulletin said the strong dollar depressed the non-US earnings of many firms. In spite of their size and the number of clients for which they work, all of the accountancy firms refuse to provide any details of profits or other detailed financial information. The firms issue their own figures, not all of which have the same year-ends or are prepared on exactly comparable bases.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS AND ASSOCIATIONS  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1993 fee           Growth                        income (Dollars m)         rate (%)  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Arthur Andersen                  6,017               7.9 KPMG                             6,000              -1.6 Ernst &amp; Young                    5,839               2.4 Coopers &amp; Lybrand                5,220              -2.4 Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu         5,000               4.2 Price Waterhouse                 3,887               3.4 BDO Binder                       1,150*              2.2 Grant Thornton                   1,080               1.3 Moores Rowland                     732               2.1 RSM                                688               2.7  -------------------------------------------------------------------- * Estimated by the firm.

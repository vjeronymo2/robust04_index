			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Robson Rhodes out as J Foster auditors ROBSON RHODES were ousted as auditors to John Foster, the Yorkshire-based wool and textile group, at an extraordinary general meeting yesterday. Shareholders voted overwhelmingly to remove the firm in a highly unusual meeting forced by Robson Rhodes' refusal to resign at the request of the directors and without the approval of shareholders. In a circular distributed last month, Mr Victor Watson, chairman, said that while the last audit had been concluded 'satisfactorily', the board - which was revamped about a year ago - wanted a change of accountants. He recommended that Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte be appointed, primarily because of the 'depth of resources' the firm offered. It also tendered a lower fee. Coopers is believed to have quoted at about 65 per cent of the Pounds 42,000 charged for the last financial year. Nineteen of the company's 850 shareholders attended the 20-minute meeting in Foster's mill at Queensbury, near Bradford. Robson Rhodes was represented by Mr Hugh Aldous, national managing partner, and Mr Chris Connor, head of the Leeds office. Mr Connor said the firm had not been given any substantiated reason why it should quit. 'We are here on a matter of great principle,' he said. 'Auditors owe their duties to shareholders as a body and are not the casual appointees of the directors.' Several shareholders criticised the board for acting within a few weeks of Robson Rhodes' reappointment at the last annual meeting and for not disclosing its reasons for the change. They also questioned the quality of an audit conducted at a significantly lower charge. Mr David Breton, a director until last year, said: 'It was an apathy vote. I feel this should all have been done in a more gentlemanly way. The AGM is the proper time to appoint auditors.' But Mr Graham Creswick, finance director, said: 'We were badly let down by the 1991 audit. It was very straightforward and perfectly competent, but it was very quiet. We did not get the benefit we are entitled to expect.' While it met the legal requirements, he felt the auditors were not as questioning as he would have hoped given the recent changes in strategy. He also criticised the 'unnecessary' administrative and legal costs to the company of calling an EGM. Robson Rhodes said it had made a number of suggestions for change which had been ignored by the management. John Foster made pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.24m last year.</p>

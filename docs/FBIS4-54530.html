			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Adam Soful: "Brown-Coal Mines Suspended Their </F> Strike; Solidarity-Government; Marek Pol Signed an Agreement  With Miners"    [Text] Brown-coal miners have suspended their  strikes after signing an agreement with the government. Coal  supplies to power plants have been resumed. But Solidarity  Chairman Marian Krzaklewski does not want to give up escalating  the strike action beginning on 4 May. On Saturday [30 April]  and Sunday, 18 hard-coal mines were on strike. Labor Minister  Miller is surprised with the escalation of the protest.    The "Solidarity" All-National Strike Committee of Brown-Coal  Mines decided to suspend its strike action effective Saturday  afternoon. The government committed itself to initiating an  amendment to a law on retirement pensions for miners that would  place brown-coal employees on an equal footing with those  employed in the sulfur-mining industry. It was determined that  the extra money that will go into the budget as a result of  energy price rises will be distributed in agreement with trade  union experts. Strike participants will not be punished, either.    In return, the miners obliged themselves to supply brown  coal  to power plants. "The level of supplies will depend on the  magnitude of the power generation factor that the National Power  Distribution Center will determine for a given day," said  Czeslaw Maconko, a strike committee member. The trade unionists  have announced that the strike action will be stopped after the  government presents a schedule for meeting the trade union's  demands. Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski stressed that,  so far, the trade union has not received such a schedule from  the government, and it is the same case with a proposal for  negotiations.    "There is a need for strikes, but we also need an openness  to  compromise," Krzaklewski said during Saturday's rally at the  Stalowa Wola steelworks, which has been on strike since 28  April. But the chairman of Solidarity also stressed that a  compromise cannot amount to the trade union giving up on any of  its demands.    During Saturday's press conference in Przemysl, Krzaklewski  accused the government of ignoring Solidarity. In his view, the  precise reason the trade union carried out 774 strikes this year  is the government's arrogance toward Solidarity.    Labor Minister Leszek Miller said on Saturday that, in the  context of Friday's talks with representatives of the trade  union within a trilateral commission, he is surprised by  Solidarity's decision to escalate the protest action. In  Miller's view, by deciding to escalate the strike action,  Krzaklewski either was not aware of the contents of talks within  the trilateral commission or he wants to pressure the  government, which, in turn, makes talks impossible.    Over the weekend, strikes were in progress in 18 hard-coal  mines and three zinc and lead mines. Mine employees stayed at  home, with representatives of strike committees on duty at the  mines. Municipal transportation did not work for two hours in  the city of Rzeszow on Saturday morning.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Arts: Pulp hero pumps up the drama - Cinema TRUE LIES (15) James Cameron BABY'S DAY OUT (PG)Patrick Read Johnson GETTING EVEN WITH DAD (PG) Howard Deutsch For about a third of True Lies - the middle third - Arnold Schwarzenegger attempts to play a troubled human being. You can tell this by the sound of machinery winding down behind the Arnold face. The brows furrow; the voice and features are rearranged, by elaborate computer technology, into a broody quietude. Our hero Harry Tasker, a spy working for a secret agency charged with what the film's publicity calls the 'intervention of nuclear terrorism,' suspects his wife Jamie Lee Curtis of having an affair. Or as Arnold more menacingly pronounces it, an 'affee-ah'. Soon Harry is unleashing all the agency's know-how and manpower on Jamie's nocturnal wanderings, eventually having her caught in what seems a clear case of flagrante. Then he interrogates her to the point of tears through a one-way mirror and voice-distorting intercom. Later still, again incognito, he subjects her to a humiliating strip routine. After True Lies the comedy of domestic jealousy, we return to True Lies the comedy adventure. Only we wonder where we mislaid our sense of humour. For much of this two-hour 20-minute movie, the Austro-American superstar's bid to bounce back from his Last Action Hero debacle resembles Last Action Hero with added misogyny and schadenfreude. Lots of stunts - here a blown-up Swiss chateau, there a pyrotechnic pile-up on a Florida bridge - and lots of quippy one-liners: 'Have you ever killed anyone?', 'Yeh, but dey were all bad.' But there is also a new, worrying sense of let's-pump-up-the-drama. When the Schwarzenegger machismo begins to turn serious, there is something nightmarish about this man. As a paid-up if part-time subscriber to the Arnold Fan Club - call me a country member - I admire his work in peak pulp form: the Terminator movies, Commando, Total Recall. These are comic books made celluloid, with Arnold a perfectly-tooled Nietzschean machine whose ability to seem humanly non-human can also stretch to comedy. (He is funnier  -advertently funnier - than Danny De Vito in Twins.) But True Lies is a pile-up of confused intentions. Directed and scripted by James Cameron, it cost a reported Dollars 120m, beating Cameron's own Terminator 2 to the costliest-film-ever record. If the money went partly on Arnie (Dollars 15m), it went mostly on stunts and special effects that are used like a heart doctor's electric clamps to shock life into a tired, paranoid patient: the plot. In part one, Arabs threaten to blow up America with a nuclear bomb. Part two: Arnold investigates his wife. Part three: back to fighting the Arabs with reconciled spouse in tow. This is clearly the star's bid to be James Bond for the 1990s. (Even the production designer Peter Lamont is a veteran of five Bonds.) All the fun of the espionage romp, with a bit of PMT thrown in - pre-millennial tension - in the form of topical geo-politics and career-stressed marriages. But Schwarzenegger's mega-muscled way with the gore and gags is different from the more dandyish 007's; and even less is it suited to black-comedy biopsies on an ailing relationship. Zombie implacability is the man's speciality, accompanied by the boom of death-dealing epigrams. We cheer him here when he pilots a Harrier jump jet in and out of a skyscraper window; or when he crashes on horseback into a hotel's scenic elevator to pursue a fleeing baddie; or when he sepulchrally quips 'You're fired' to the same baddie, dispatched while clinging to the end of a fighter plane's rocket. Schwarzenegger is a great star in two dimensions. Try to add a suaver third, let alone to extend his style of casual brutality into real life, and the charismatic cut-out becomes a faintly sinister hologram. Baby's Day Out and Getting Even With Dad are the week's self-styled Hollywood 'comedies'. Each has a plot you could sell in five seconds to an excitable mogul. 'Kidnapped baby escapes and has life-endangering adventures across big city.' (Mogul: 'Great] Maisie, pass me a contract form.') And, 'Neglected son stumbles on ex-convict Dad's new crime plot and blackmails him into being a new and caring father.' (Mogul: 'Great] What's Macaulay Culkin's schedule?') Master Culkin, alas, is free. But he is now a long-in-the-tooth twelvish and the voice is descending from pre-pubescent high C to middle A-flat. As for the face, so animated in Home Alone, it seems to have seized up almost completely. Perhaps he has had plastic surgery. He is, of course, re-running his earlier succes d'infantilisme here. Much of Getting Even With Dad involves a knockabout burglar duo (Gailard Sartain, Saul Rubinek) and their 'hilarious' humiliations at the hands of Master Smartypants. That serves for sub-plot. The sob plot is in the hands of Ted Danson as Dad, who must choose between keeping a priceless cache of stolen coins and holding on to the love of Master Culkin. We are amazed he takes so long to make up his mind; and even more amazed that he makes the wrong decision. Baby's Day Out comes to us from the writer-producer of - guess what? - Home Alone. And it has much the same plot about a tearaway infant and his distraught and sundered parents (Lara Flynn Boyle, Matthew Glave). Only difference: the new John Hughes-scripted romp does not feature a knockabout burglar duo. No, in a daring departure from precedent, the burglars here are kidnappers and they are a trio. Joe Mantegna is their leader, mugging gallantly away even when Baby, concealed under a coat on his lap in a public park, is busy with a lighter setting the man's trouser-fly on fire. Later, a fellow gang member puts the flames out by stamping violently on the affected area. Laugh? I thought I had contracted Macaulay Culkin's facial paralysis. This scene proves that misogyny is not the only option in modern American sexual attitudes. The country's puritan legacy lingers on at all behavioural levels, affecting both sexes. But Baby's Day Out is an odd movie in every sense. While the comic opportunities offered by Hughes's story are legion - Baby in a department store, Baby on a building site, Baby at the zoo - the opportunities taken by Hughes's own script and Patrick Read Johnson's direction are almost zero. Scenes are either too short to make an impact at all (department store) or so long (building site) that they stretch a slapstick conceit into a form of serial concussion. The only person to emerge with credit or dignity is the butler Andrews - no relation - and even he, to judge by the two-and-a-half lines of dialogue John Neville gets to utter, seems to have done most of his buttling on the cutting-room floor. By the way, there is also a new Hollywood comedy in town called Blank Cheque. This was not shown to the press but deals, I understand, with a small boy, his neglectful parents and a knockabout burglar with whom he becomes amusingly involved . . . Oh for the wings of a dove. Or the wings of aeroplane, at least, to get us to the Edinburgh Film Festival. There, if you have any time between August 13-28, you should drop by to enjoy the riches. They include: a pair of exotically matched retrospectives (Japan's Shohei Imamura, Hollywood's Andre 'House Of Wax' De Toth), a gala lecture or two (including a masterclass by Bertrand Tavernier) and a whole lot of hits from the year's previous festivals, including the opening film, Australia's runaway drag comedy Priscilla Queen Of The Desert. Oh, and you can also catch Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Unilever dives Anglo-Dutch foods group Unilever recorded its biggest turnover for nearly four years and a second day's steep decline as fears resurfaced over the value of brands ahead of today's press conference on pricing strategy by Procter &amp; Gamble. Selected food manufacturing and drinks stocks weakened as investors took fright at the prospect of price wars, particularly in markets where margins are already under pressure. In Unilever's case this would apply to the detergents business, where P&amp;G has indicated that it intends to bring pressure to bear. Unilever shares followed Monday's fall of 25 with a further drop of 24 yesterday to 953p. Turnover was a hefty 7.4m, its biggest since November 1989. Among other strong 'brand' groups, Cadbury-Schweppes weakened 9 to 439p, Tate &amp; Lyle 5 to 385p, Grand Metropolitan 6 to 409p and Guinness 13 to 454p.</p>

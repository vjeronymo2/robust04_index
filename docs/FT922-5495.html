			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family: SIB shakes up investment industry - The proposals which have emerged from the 13-month review of UK regulations PERHAPS it is appropriate that a thorough review of retail investment regulation in the UK should create a mountain of paper. This week - after 13 months and three separate consultative documents, each of which provoked rather more than 100 closely argued submissions from interested parties - the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) announced the final version of its proposals for disclosure and quality of advice. By comparison, reading the small print on a life policy would be easier. The consultative process had been so exhaustive that Thursday's announcement produced few surprises. Such changes as there were tended to move in favour of the life insurance industry and against the expressed wishes of consumer groups. Only a few hurdles remain. The proposals will need ministerial blessing and should be enacted by the end of this year. Product providers would then have a two-year transitional period before the proposals on 'client-specific' disclosure need be fully operative. This should allow their computer systems time to adapt to the new challenges. In spite of several climbdowns, the proposals could still have a big impact on sales of investment products in the UK. Alert investors will be in a much better position as, perhaps more importantly, will be financial novices. As they stand, the proposals are centred around the simple 'key features' document which must be presented to clients before a sale. This should be brief (able to fit on a page of A4 paper) and should sum up the main points of a particular product. The main recommendations for the content of the key features document, and SIB's other measures, can be summarised as follows: Surrender Values SIB's proposals have been watered down, which is rather disappointing. One of the casualties was a proposal to make product providers reveal the 'break-even year' in which the amount investors would receive on surrendering a policy would exceed the total premiums they had paid. On some 25-year policies, this point might not come for 10 years; but SIB decided to abandon the idea because the timing of the break-even point is affected strongly by investment performance. SIB has, however, insisted that if this point is likely to come after more than five years, this must be spelt out. And the proposal should go some way to preventing first-time buyers who fall into arrears on their mortgages from surrendering their endowments and then finding they have actually lost on the deal - something that has happened often over the past two years. Indeed, SIB has improved on the present position by requiring that projected surrender values for each of the first five years must be printed next to the total amount that would have been paid in premiums at each point. This makes clear to investors that they could make a loss. Effect of Charges The 'reduction in policy proceeds,' which SIB planned to make companies publish as an illustration of the effect of costs on investment returns from life policies, could now be renamed 'reduction in benefits.' It will still be expressed as a reduction in terms of the number of pence per pound spent on charges, and it will remain a crucial addition to the present misleading 'reduction in yield' calculation. RIY is valid actuarially and will continue to be shown but, as expressed now, it is misunderstood widely. It shows the number of percentage points which would be knocked off a given yield by an office's expenses. This makes big reductions in yield look tiny. For example, a 1 per cent RIY on an endowment would deter nobody. But this actually means a reduction of 1 percentage point from a yield of 7 per cent. SIB now insists that this should also be expressed as a deduction of 14p in every Pounds 1. There is still some fine detail to be worked out here, and the Association of British Insurers still does not accept that RIY was not sufficient if explained clearly. But it has pledged to work to make the new disclosure workable. Charges in Illustrations This particularly arcane topic ended up causing some of the most furious arguments. SIB has decided that when illustrating projected maturity values, life offices can assume that their costs will be in line with the industry average even if their costs are, in fact, much higher. Earlier in the consultation process, it had proposed 'own charge' illustrations. Such a move obviously would have encouraged greater competition over cost. But SIB reached what it admits was a marginal decision to maintain average charges because attention might have been diverted from the even more important issue of investment return. The decision also was swayed because even some low-cost offices (which might have been expected to benefit) were worried that the system could be abused. Commission Disclosure Yet another apparently technical issue could be the hottest political potato in the package. SIB is against mandatory disclosure of the precise incentives an independent financial adviser (IFA) has been given by a product provider. The Office of Fair Trading disagrees. The FT's criticisms of the commission system for advisers are well known and Sir David Walker, the chairman of SIB, has made clear that he agrees. Unfortunately, though, there are some good reasons why commission disclosure might not be a good idea. First, Sir David points out that information about the total impact of costs is more important for an investor than the amount of commission, which is just one (rather large) part of this. Then, there is the problem of the 'level playing field.' Most direct sales forces are paid by commission, but it is not difficult for companies to introduce incentive schemes or performance-related pay of some form so that salesmen appear to be salaried. SIB has, therefore, given up on forcing them to reveal commissions, as it feels this would not be enforceable. It would be unfortunate if a cowboy salesman could claim he was paid less commission than a reputable and experienced IFA. Thus, for the good of the independent sector, SIB decided commission disclosure would be unwise. This is, at best, a sad decision. As the OFT disagrees with it, the issue could end up being settled by ministers. Warnings Endowments must now carry cigarette box-style warnings, although these have been diluted somewhat from original suggestions - such as 'Warning]' and 'Danger]' - to the less pejorative 'Be Careful]' This should go some way to preventing a repeat of the ill-thought-out plans many couples made in 1988. Status Disclosure It will now be much harder for the 'white socks brigade' of sales representatives, tied to the products of only one company, to pass themselves off as impartial advisers. SIB is requiring that a company's tied status is advertised prominently on its premises, and is also mentioned in both mortgage and 'image' (a la Scottish Widows) advertising. Stationery and business cards will now need to be in the following form: 'Joe Bloggs represents only General &amp; Munificent for (the products in question).' Standards of Advice This elusive concept is difficult for regulators to control. It is more or less impossible to regulate what an unscrupulous salesman says during a face-to-face interview. But SIB has come up with a promising method for keeping tabs on the advice investors have been given: the 'reason why' letter. Advisers will be required to send a letter explaining why they have made particular recommendations. This should enable investors to spot improper advice before a sale has been completed. If realisation dawns only later, the letter should be valuable evidence in showing that best advice was not given. This will be required both for taking on long-term commitments and for relinquishing them, which should go some way to stamping out dubious advice on surrendering life policies or transferring from company pension schemes. Many issues remain suspended in mid-air. Sir David's irritation at the over-selling of endowments, and support for fee-based advice, remain clear. But little can be done about this without addressing the issue of regulatory scope. Banks and building societies are not within SIB's remit, which makes it harder to establish a 'level playing field' with Tessas and deposit accounts, or to regulate fully sales of mortgages. That will have to be decided after Sir David's departure for Lloyds Bank. After this review, though, he seems certain to leave an industry better geared to the consumer's interests than it was five years ago.</p>

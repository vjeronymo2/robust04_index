			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Trademark award - Legal Briefs Quaker Oats Co has been ordered to pay Dollars 26.5m in damages to Sands, Taylor &amp; Wood Co, a small Vermont company, in what is believed to be the largest award for trademark infringement ever made. Quaker was originally ordered to pay Dollars 42.6m to Sands for infringing its trademark 'thirst-aid' by using it in an advertising campaign for Quaker's best selling soft drink, Gatorade. The award was reduced after a federal appeals court ruled that the original award was too high.</p>

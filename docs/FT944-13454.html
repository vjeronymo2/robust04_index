			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: European operations post Dollars 25m surplus The continuing modest recovery in Europe's new car markets and further cost-cutting and restructuring helped Ford achieve a Dollars 25m net profit on its European automotive operations, excluding Jaguar, in the third quarter. This represented a sharp turnround on its Dollars 217m loss in the same period of 1993 and continues a trend apparent since the beginning of this year. It followed a Dollars 310m turnround in the second quarter, when a net profit of Dollars 244m was achieved compared with a net loss of Dollars 66m in the same period a year ago. The result lifts profit for the first nine months to Dollars 378m compared with a Dollars 264m loss the previous year. Until this year, Ford's European operations, excluding Jaguar, had suffered three consecutive years of losses totalling Dollars 1.5bn. 'Europe is in the early stages of economic recovery and we expect to see continued improvements in most (European) countries,' Mr Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman, said yesterday. Jaguar, Ford's UK-based luxury cars subsidiary, sharply reduced its loss in the third quarter to Dollars 53m compared with a loss for the same period last year of Dollars 108m, which included a Dollars 65m restructuring charge. This brought Jaguar's total deficit for the first three quarters to Dollars 155m compared with a Dollars 226m loss in 1993. The parent group said the new generation of XJ saloons, which have just been launched, are expected to accelerate Jaguar's recovery. Ford expects Europe's total new car market to recover to 13.3m units this year, up from 12.5m in 1993. Its own car sales in the region in the first nine months of this year reached 1,979,913, a 7.5 per cent rise on the year-ago level and commercial vehicle sales were 3.5 per cent higher at 157,397. Ford's share of Europe's car and commercial vehicles markets rose marginally in the third quarter, to 12.7 per cent from 12.5 per cent in the year-ago period. Mr Trotman made clear that the financial recovery is expected to be maintained next year as the market recovery continues and further cost-cutting benefits accrue. Capacity utilisation is expected to increase within the next three years through the launch of a car smaller than the Fiesta, although so far no decision had yet been made on a production location. It may receive a further lift if the go-ahead is given for production of small cars to be sold under the badge of Mazda, in which Ford has a 24.5 per cent stake. A decision is expected before the end of November.</p>

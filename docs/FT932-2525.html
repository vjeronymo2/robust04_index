			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / The Property Market: Return of a deal-maker - Not everyone will be delighted to see Martin Landau back in the UK property market after three years' absence The stock market has welcomed the return to the UK property market of Mr Martin Landau, the property entrepreneur, sending the share price of Clayform Properties soaring this week after he announced his plans to use it as a comeback vehicle. But not everyone will be pleased by the news. 'A lot of people think I am a rat,' he admits cheerfully. The Church Commissioners might be one example. Mr Landau was, until 1990, deputy chairman of Imry Merchant Developers, which went into partnership with the Church in an ill-starred speculative development in Ashford, Kent. Imry offloaded some of its exposure to the project on to the Church two days after the government turned down planning permission for the development. 'Those people do not love me,' he concedes. Some others acquainted with Imry might be similarly alarmed by Mr Landau's return to the property market, after three years of cooling his heels in the south of France. Mr Landau, after all, was responsible for Imry's Pounds 1bn development programme. He had left the company by the time it collapsed in 1991-92, following its ill-judged takeover by a private consortium. The company's failure won it a place in corporate history by forcing its bank, Barclays, to take it into ownership and make the largest single write-down in the record books. But some people who have followed Mr Landau's career closely would make a different assessment. They do not blame Imry's collapse on its own management, but on the consortium that loaded it with debt when it made a Pounds 314m takeover in 1989. They might accept that some of Imry's developments proved expensive mistakes for the institutions that financed them - such as Postel's Rose Court at Southwark, south London, which is still unoccupied. But many of Imry's other partnerships profited both parties. The main reason, however, why Mr Landau still commands some respect within the industry is that his judgment of the market has, so far, been unusually astute. He claims that he forecast the property slump - 'I said 1989 would be terrible; 1990 would be blood on the walls; 1991 would be jumping out of windows'. But his reputation is based principally on his record at making money for his shareholders - and himself - through the 1980s until Imry's takeover in 1989. Mr Landau, who originally trained as an accountant, became involved in property when he was sorting out the property interests of Guinness Mahon, the merchant bank, after the 1974 crash. The bank eventually formed a property subsidiary, Guinness Peat Properties, to develop some of the properties in which it was involved. After heading this subsidiary for six years, he led a management buy-out of most of the GPP properties in 1986. In a series of deals, he created City Merchant Developers which was put into Rivlin, a quoted 'shell' company, which then built up its asset base through acquisitions. In 1988, City Merchant Developers merged with Imry International, led by Mr Martin Myers. When Marketchief, a private consortium, offered to buy the company for Pounds 314m in 1989, with the intention of breaking it up, Mr Landau recommended that the board accept the offer. He left the company soon afterwards, having earned Pounds 25m from his 8 per cent stake. Mr Landau's record has prompted a sharp rise in the share price of Clayform, the small, ailing property company in which he and a partner Anthony Bodie, bought a 5 per cent stake at 14p a share. The news of their purchase sent the company's shares up from a close of 11p on Thursday night to 37p yesterday, as other investors followed his lead. 'There is a shortage of people in the sector who are perceived to be good,' says Mr Chris Turner of BZW, the broker. 'When you have someone who has a proven track record you can understand when people say they are interested in having a bit of the action.' The rise in Clayform's share price - which is being encouraged by Mr Landau's talks to the press and the City about his plans - seems to be an integral part of his strategy. He has indicated that he has a deal up his sleeve, which will be accompanied by a large fund-raising exercise. With a net asset value of 30p a share, Clayform's share price needed a boost in order to issue new paper without diluting its asset value. Mr Landau wants to build the company up quickly. 'I think we will do a quantum leap,' he says. He is confident of his ability to attract funds. 'I would say immodestly there are quite a few serious institutions who would like to back us,' he says. Mr Landau will not be drawn on details of his plans. 'The overriding objective must be to improve net asset value, to have the company on a solid footing and to be in a position, by being big enough, to take advantage of situations as they occur,' he says. His strategy has three parts. First, Clayform needs investment property. 'We need a solid balance sheet so we have income coming in which pays the overhead,' he says. Second, it will engage in developments, although not yet on a speculative basis. Rather, he envisages carrying out project management work or developing pre-let, pre-funded buildings. 'It will always be looking at the bottom line of limiting risk,' he says. Third, he envisages taking over other companies in the sector, which can no longer justify their overheads. 'A large number of people in the property sector are earning far too much money,' he says. He also hopes that his arrival will enhance Clayform's existing assets by taking it off a crisis footing. Clayform has already brought its debt down from Pounds 130m to Pounds 28m in the past two and a half years, but it still has gearing of 200 per cent. He says an injection of Pounds 20m would reduce gearing to 20 per cent and allow it to develop some of its sites. 'For a comparatively small amount of money we can revolutionise this company,' says Mr Landau. The heavily indebted Clayform might not seem the ideal shell company. But in a market glutted with moribund companies, Mr Landau found it surprisingly difficult to find a suitable vehicle. 'We have been stalking UK public companies for 18 months,' he says. He looked closely at eight or nine companies, but dismissed them because of tax or financial complications. 'People still had overblown ideas of what their companies are worth.' Clayform was not judged suitable until it had disposed of Stead &amp; Simpson, its shoe chain, in April. Mr Landau's enthusiasm for the opportunities facing Clayform seems in some ways like a throw-back to the boom conditions of the 1980s. But he is clear that some things have changed. 'I don't think there will be a dramatic surge in values and activity,' he says. Furthermore, many of the people in charge of banks and institutions have changed. In the case of the banks there is currently a reluctance to lend money, particularly to developers. Mr Landau is however confident that the banks will, in time, fund his projects. 'In five years' time the banks will be piling in,' he says. 'Banks are very lazy. They won't lend it to farmers, they don't understand manufacturers, they won't lend to the third world, so they come back to lending to property . . . Bankers are definitely not very bright people.' Mr Landau's arrogance is matched by his ambition. As a man who has already made a fortune, his apparent motivation in returning to the property market is the thrill of building up a large company. He dismisses the possibility of a lifetime of 'golf and shooting and fishing' or even 'watching the vines grow in Tuscany' with a shudder. 'You have to get to the top of the tree,' he says. 'I don't think there is any limit if you have the ability, the desire and are honest.'</p>

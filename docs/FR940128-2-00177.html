Santos, M.D.; Denial of Application</DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 5, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then-Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Ordered to Show Cause to Miquel A. Santos, M.D. (Respondent), HC&hyph;01 Box 6507, Bo. Magas Abajo, Guayamillas, Puerto Rico 00656&hyph;9715. The Order to Show Cause sought to deny Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate of Registration, dated May 29, 1990, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated May 19, 1993, Respondent waived his right to a hearing and presented a written statement regarding his position on the matters of fact and law set forth in the Order to Show Cause. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.57, the Administrator hereby issues his final order based on the investigative file and Respondent's written statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Acting Administrator finds that in February 1984 in Rabun County, Georgia, Respondent was indicted on twenty-one felony counts of violating the Georgia Controlled Substances Act. The indictment was based on Respondent's issuing prescriptions for various Schedule III controlled substances for other than legitimate medical purposes. By Order dated February 16, 1984, the Composite State Board of Medical Examiners of the State of Georgia (Georgia Board) concluded that Respondent's ability to practice medicine posed a threat to the public health, safety and welfare, and determined that emergency action was required. The Georgia Board therefore ordered Respondent to surrender his DEA Certificate of Registration, and any triplicate prescription forms and order forms. In addition, the Georgia Board suspended Respondent's license to practice medicine in the State of Georgia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 17, 1984, Respondent surrendered his DEA Certificate of Registration, AS1270660. Respondent pled guilty to all twenty-one felony counts and, on March 7, 1984, was sentenced to ten years probation, ordered to pay $12,000.00 and prohibited from returning to the Mountain Judicial Circuit for the period of probation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The investigative file reveals that on October 11, 1990, Respondent appeared before the Georgia Board to request reinstatement of his medical license. On December 26, 1990, the Georgia Board notified Respondent of its decision to deny his request. The investigative file also indicates that Respondent is authorized by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to handle controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In his letter of May 19, 1993, Respondent explained that he was currently practicing medicine in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Respondent also alleged that in 1984, he issued numerous prescriptions for controlled substances at the bequest of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI). Respondent claimed that he was working in cooperation with the GBI in the GBI's effort to ``break a ring of drug and arms'' trafficking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Acting Administrator finds, however, that the investigative file, which contains voluminous reports from the GBI, does not support Respondent's assertion that he wrote the prescriptions at issue at the direction of the GBI. On the contrary, the investigative file indicates that the GBI had received information that Respondent was issuing prescriptions without valid medical reason and commenced an investigation. Special Agents from the GBI conducted several undercover operations and were able to obtain prescriptions from Respondent in the absence of a legitimate medical purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 823(f) of the Controlled Substances Act lists five factors which are to be considered when making a determination as to whether a registration would be in the public interest. These factors include: (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority; (2) the applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances; (3) the applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances; (4) compliance with applicable State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances; and, (5) such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety. The Administrator may rely on any one or any combination of these factors when determining whether an application should be denied or a registration revoked. See Neveille H. Williams, D.D.S., 51 FR 17556 (1986); Anne L. Hendricks, M.D., 51 FR 41030 (1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), the Acting Administrator concludes that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. The Acting Administrator bases this conclusion on the actions of the Georgia Board, which has chosen not to reinstate Respondent's medical license, Respondent's past history of prescribing controlled substances in the absence of a legitimate medical reason, and Respondent's felony conviction relating to controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate of Registration be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective January 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Umtata May 24 SAPA -- Eastern Cape Premier Raymond  Mhlaba has banned strikes and protests by provincial civil  servants, according to a circular discouraging what he called  civil disobedience. The circular was sent to directors-general  of provincial departments on Tuesday.    Mr Mhlaba said numerous complaints by civil servants had  been  received by his office and he noted them with sympathy, concern  and appreciation. Committees to be nominated by the various  political parties would deal with all grievances and imbalances.  Until then:    -- no new appointments or re-appointments would be made;    -- no further promotions would be effected directly or  indirectly;    -- no improvement of remuneration or conditions of service  would be processed, whether for parity purposesor not; and    -- no contractual agreements would be made, unless money had  been budgeted and contracts already negotiated.    Such contracts had to be discussed with the relevant MEC  [Member Executive council] before submission to the Executive  Council.    Mr Mhlaba said the former public service commissions of  Transkei and Ciskei should compile a list of grievances to  facilitate the work of the committees.    He called on civil servants to desist from work stoppages,  go-slows, strikes or withholding their best service.    He said the circular had been issued to curb an  unprecedented  high rate of recurrent expenditure in the province.    The curbs would be lifted when normality returned to the  civil service.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Investcorp to inject Dollars 300m into Saks INVESTCORP, the inter-national bank formed in 1982 as a conduit for Arab money into western industry, is to inject Dollars 300m of new equity into Saks Fifth Avenue, the US retail group which it acquired via a leveraged buyout from Britain's BAT Industries in 1990. This is the first new equity financing since the buyout, although Saks has securitised its property and trade receivables and issued Euro-notes as means of paying down bank debt. At the time of the Dollars 1.6bn buyout, the capital structure comprised Dollars 600m of equity and about Dollars 350m of subordinated debt supplied by Investcorp and its associated investors, and Dollars 775m of bank financing, led by Manufacturers Hanover. Yesterday, Mr Arthur Martinez, Saks vice-chairman, said the bank debt had since been reduced to around Dollars 325m by the post-buyout financial restructurings, and the new equity funds would go primarily towards paying down the expensive subordinated debt. There have been rumours of poor operating performance at Saks and late payments to suppliers. However, Mr Martinez emphatically denied the latter, and said that although 'trading was clearly very difficult' and 'it was very hard to achieve plans,' the group remained 'substantially' profitable. Shortly after the buyout, a confidential memorandum surfaced, indicating Saks had fallen short of trading projections. The equity injection, Mr Martinez said, was designed continue the 'de-leveraging' of the company and fund a new 'growth plan'. Saks accompanied news of the equity injection with an announcement of a Dollars 250m investment plan in new stores, renovations and infrastructure improvements. It said that much of this money would be invested in the next two-and-a-half-years, with five new 'replacement' stores planned. According to Mr Martinez, the plans could envisage four to six new stores, although sites are not firm. Saks operates 48 stores.</p>

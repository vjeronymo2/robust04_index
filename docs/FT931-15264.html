			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / British Steel plans price increases to stabilise market BRITISH STEEL plans to raise prices on some of its main products by as much as 13 per cent in a bold attempt to halt the fall in prices that has sent the European steel industry into one of its deepest ever recessions. The privatised UK steelmaker says it will raise prices on plates and sections by 4-7 per cent on March 1, while strip mill products will be raised by 11-13 per cent. The price rises are likely to be followed soon by other big European steel producers, according to observers. British Steel warned that the scale of price reductions over the past few months would necessitate further increases later in the year. European steel prices have fallen by 30 per cent or more since 1989, and producers say current levels are not sustainable if the industry is to fund investment without making catastrophic cuts in capacity. Almost all the big European producers are losing money: British Steel lost Pounds 51m pre-tax in the half-year ended October 3. Yesterday's announcement comes almost exactly a year after British Steel said it would raise prices of its flat-rolled products by between 3 per cent and 4 per cent from April last year. But the increases failed to stick for long because of overproduction by the big European steel producers. However, in November and December almost all west European producers cut their crude steel output sharply. Mr Peter Fish, managing director of MEPS (Europe), the Sheffield-based steel consultancy, said: 'If the producers can follow up with more production cuts in the first quarter, I'm almost convinced there will be a turn in prices for deliveries in the third quarter of 1993.' British Steel said the price rises announced yesterday would help offset recent cost increases, including the effects of the sterling devaluation on dollar-denominated raw materials. Earlier this week, MEPS forecast that steel demand in Europe was likely to decline further this year. It estimated that European Community crude steel output would fall from an estimated 132.5m tonnes in 1992 to 130.5m tonnes. The UK, it says, is the only leading producer country likely to increase steel production in 1993, with output forecast to rise to 16.7m tonnes from an estimated 16.1m tonnes last year.</p>

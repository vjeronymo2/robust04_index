			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Jan 20, Interfax-BNS -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev has termed as "strange" and "hysterical"  the reaction by the three Baltic countries to his remarks made  at a meeting in Moscow Tuesday [18 January].    Russia has no intention to violate the sovereignty of Latvia  in whatever way, but the withdrawal of Russian troops must take  place in a normal and civilized manner, and according to an  agreement, Kozyrev said.    "Russian troops cannot leave at once; this depends on a  number of circumstances that are also known to the Baltic  partners. Russia's firm objective is that the withdrawal should  take place on a legal treaty basis -- this will also strengthen  the sovereignty of these countries," he said.    The Russian foreign minister said his country was following  a  specific line of conduct in its relations with the former  republics of the Soviet Union, or its so-called close abroad,  vacillating between two extreme options: to send in tanks or  demand fully abandoning these regions. Kozyrev said either of  these options would lead to the repetition of the so-called  Yugoslavia scenario on the former Soviet territories.    Kozyrev said the same would happen if Russia's special role  was denied. He said that if Russian troops were pulled out from  Tajikistan, if they abandoned their peacekeeping activity in the  Karabakh, Ossetia and other regions of conflict, millions of  refugees -- all of them not inevitably of Slavic origin -- would  flood Moscow. He said this was a thing Russia couldn't let  happen.    Kozyrev said the West was "not always able to understand  these simple truths."    He warned that Russia was not going to remain still if the  rights of Russian-speakers in the Baltics were violated. Saying  that the negotiations held separately with all three Baltic  countries on the issue of their Russian-speaking population were  going on normally, Kozyrev mentioned that using more rigid  measures was possible if a violation of international legal  norms took place in the Baltics.    "We spoke already before Zhirinovskiy that economic  sanctions  might be imposed against countries which follow such a policy,"  the foreign minister said. But he also warned of the possibility  of provocations by pro-fascist forces in Russia.</p>

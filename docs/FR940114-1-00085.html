			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, participants at the regional meetings and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiations recognized that grounds for cancellation of a loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation under section 437 of the HEA should include a case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where a student was unable to obtain employment after attending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the school, and the school had falsely certified that the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had the ability to benefit from the school's training. This kind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of falsification is both part of the loan certification process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and results in a student being left without needed skills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed regulations focus on the school's false  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representation that the student had the ability to benefit as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grounds for cancellation under this new provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute and regulations have addressed the ability-to-benefit requirement for many years, and the proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect both the legal elements of that requirement and some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement perspectives developed in implementing it. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, the school has always been required to test the ability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to benefit only of those applicants who did not have a high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school diploma, and the school therefore does not certify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anything regarding the ability to benefit of high school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> graduates. Since 1987, students who had a general education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diploma, or obtained one after enrolling, and students who lacked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both a GED and a high school diploma but completed an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutionally prescribed remedial education program, have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deemed by Congress to have the ability to benefit, and the rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would incorporate that congressional judgement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations therefore would generally permit relief in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case of a student whom the school was required to test for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to benefit, but either failed to test at all, or tested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in disregard of the requirements for proper use of the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted. Schools have a continuing legal obligation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administer tests, subject to criteria developed by the school's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accreditor, in compliance with test protocols. These criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and protocols may include requirements related both to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accuracy of the test results as to the individual tested and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the continuing development and validation of the test mechanism.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Non-compliance with testing requirements may warrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative sanctions against the school, but a false  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification claim under this provision requires the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine a different question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A false certification claim depends not on whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school met all its obligations with regard to testing, but on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether a test already given lacks credibility as a measure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student's ability to benefit so that the Department should,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the absence of other evidence, regard the student as lacking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that ability. The Secretary expects that practical, specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards will be needed to help identify those deviations from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing requirements that support an inference that the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lacked ability to benefit. For example, use of photocopied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> versions of tests by the school or test administrator may violate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements of the test publisher, but may have no direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect on the accuracy of the assessment of the student's ability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to benefit. Use of an indefensibly low cutoff score by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school on an ability-to-benefit test does not discredit an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of the ability of those students who score above a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legitimate cutoff score, such as those now published by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary. Similarly, minor deviations from required time limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may have little effect on the validity of the test results. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary intends to address these practical considerations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final regulations, and invites public comment on the content  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of those standards or guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In applying these standards, moreover, the Secretary has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistently recognized that a student may actually have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to benefit from the school's training even though the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school does not test that student's ability or does so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improperly. The proposed regulations therefore recognize that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student who actually obtains employment in the occupation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the school's program was designed to prepare him or her had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the actual ability to benefit from that training without regard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to whether the school falsified its test of ability to benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A student not properly tested for ability to benefit who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nevertheless completes the program of instruction can reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered to have found the training consistent with his or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> her aptitude, and the proposed regulations would provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancellation only if the a student had unsuccessfully tried to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> find employment in the occupation for which the program was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to prepare him or her. Conversely, a student not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly tested who withdraws from the course can be reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarded as having found the training not consistent with his or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> her aptitude, and the proposed regulations grant relief to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kind of student (or a parent PLUS borrower who borrowed on behalf  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the student) unless the student actually obtained employment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in that occupation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

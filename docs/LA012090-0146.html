			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIDELITY FINANCIAL SELLING STOCK BACK TO HAMMOND CO.  </P> <P> Irvine-based Fidelity National Financial Inc. said Friday that it will sell its  23.6% interest in the Hammond Co. and that Hammond will pay $1.9 million to  purchase the Fidelity stake.  </P> <P> The agreement ends seven months of sporadic talks between the two firms about  establishing closer business ties or a possible merger.  </P> <P> Hammond directors and shareholders now will consider turning the publicly  traded firm into a private company, said company Chairman Thomas T. Hammond.  About 10 of the Newport Beach company's 400 shareholders own about 60% of the  firm, he said.  </P> <P> Hammond said the company will use its cash reserves to purchase the stock.  </P> <P> After a recent meeting, Fidelity executives decided that "a mutually agreeable  business operation wouldn't be forthcoming, and we didn't want to pursue  Hammond in a hostile nature," said Frank P. Willey, Fidelity's executive vice  president and general counsel.  </P> <P> Fidelity, a title insurance firm operating in 31 states, agreed to sell its  stake to Hammond for $4.83 a share -- the estimated price Fidelity paid for the  Hammond stock.  </P> <P> "We never got around to talking seriously about an acquisition," Willey said.  "Our conceptual discussions were far enough apart."  </P></p>

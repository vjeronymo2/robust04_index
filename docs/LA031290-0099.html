			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> IRVINE'S PUBLIC-ART PROGRAM HAS PROBLEMS GROWING UP  </P> <P> When you're in a museum, you know the rules: No touching, no doodling, no  climbing on stuff, or the guards will come running. But outdoors it's a  different story. There's no one around to police you, no decorum you've been  trained to follow.  </P> <P> If you saw a sculpture in a public garden or plaza, you would certainly feel  free to touch it. Depending on its shape and size, children would be likely to  sit on it, swing from it or balance on it. If it yielded to the touch of a  penknife, teen-agers might try to cut their initials in it. If it had flat  surfaces, bored and restless types might be tempted to embroider it with spray  paint.  </P> <P> Public art -- long a target of public outcry -- is also a sitting duck for  physical interaction. The nature of that interaction depends primarily on how  welcoming or hostile the art appears to the viewer and the types of activities  suggested by its contours, materials and size.  </P> <P> Recent events in Irvine -- which has been attempting unsuccessfully to  implement a public-art program for several years -- suggest that city employees  are confused about what's entailed in placing sculpture out of doors in a  public area and calling it "public art."  </P> <P> Angie Bray's "Wavering Poles" -- a group of 54 hollow aluminum poles in  graduated sizes from 3 1/2 to 8 1/2 feet, anchored with flexible steel joints  to a flagstone base -- was recently removed from the temporary "Sculpture on  View" exhibit on the Plaza of the Irvine Civic Center because city officials  claimed that it was potentially dangerous. The city's argument was that the  slanted tops of the poles might cause injury if someone pulled on them.  </P> <P> Bray, who says "Wavering Poles" is meant to be played with -- and also to  respond to and reflect changes in air circulation and light -- had submitted  photographs, a description and a diagram of her piece to the city. No one in  the city or FHP Healthcare, which is co-sponsoring the exhibit, raised any  objections until the sculpture was installed late last month.  </P> <P> The delicate-looking piece was incongruously surrounded by stanchions and  police barrier tape, removed for the opening ceremony to make things look as  though all was well, and replaced as soon as the public and press took their  leave.  </P> <P> Granted, we live in a litigious age. It behooves the guardians of our public  places to guard against injury on their turf, if only to ward off long and  costly legal battles. But the watchwords should be consistency and  reasonableness.  </P> <P> If the sharp-edged metal light fixtures alongside the steps of the plaza are  OK, a work of sculpture with similar properties shouldn't be condemned. There  should be a clear set of safety guidelines for public sculpture, and they  should be implemented in the planning stages of an exhibition, not after a work  of art has been installed.  </P> <P> Just before she removed "Wavering Poles" from the plaza, Bray noticed that  while children were pulling gently on the poles in her piece, watching them  sway and tap one another, they approached the other pieces with a different  kind of energy.  </P> <P> Children shimmied up two nine-foot-tall steel pieces, Bret Price's "Passage"  and Daniel Miller's "Wandering Mobius." They jumped off Joyce Kohl's  three-foot-tall concrete work, "Two-Square," threw the gravel inside Pat  Warner's "Earth Wheel" and plunked their little bodies on its slim wooden  "spokes," which do not seem to have been designed as weight-bearing components  of the piece.  </P> <P> "Each piece invites people to do something," Bray said. "My piece does not  invite people to be violent; it invites them to be contemplative and gentle.  </P> <P> "If the city . . . had certain expections of the viewer, why isn't the viewer  made aware of them? Why were pieces picked that clearly invited viewers to do  things that were forbidden?"  </P> <P> Certainly, every public-art program is entitled to its growing pains. But  Irvine's program remains a gangly adolescent that seemingly won't listen to the  voice of experience.  </P> <P> The city's involvement in public art began in 1984, when the City Council  appointed an Art in Public Places advisory board. After much palaver and  requisite fanfare, it commissioned a piece for Heritage Park by Los Angeles  sculptor Mark Lere. The piece, installed in 1988, became a hymn to the Irvine  Co., in which 21 of the 50 inscriptions carved into the artist's spiral of  tiles symbolizing "time" refer to the corporate entity.  </P> <P> The board's second venture into public art was Art Spaces '87, a program that  borrowed six undistinguished works from six artists -- including a brother of  one of the board members -- and plopped them down in various outdoor city  locations for a one-year period.  </P> <P> Last year, an Irvine resident whose family owns numerous pieces by Jack Zajac,  a Southern California sculptor whose star was bright in decades past, received  permission to install them for five months at the Civic Center.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Corporate Patrons (a membership group of Art Spaces Irvine, the  advisory board's fund-raising wing) decided to donate $4,500 to purchase a hunk  of marble for emigre artist Marton Varo to carve one of his blandly derivative  figurative tableaux.  </P> <P> These various and sundry activities do not add up to the kind of public-art  program likely to put a city on the cultural map.  </P> <P> Should we be sympathetic because the program -- hatched by the city but without  public financial support -- has had to beg for corporate and private donations?  </P> <P> Hardly, considering the personal and corporate wealth waiting to be tapped. A  more logical response is sheer impatience because the program still has no  proper leadership. No respected art professional is associated with the  program, no one who has significant experience with public art, wide-ranging  knowledge of the sophisticated world of contemporary sculpture and a genuinely  broad and innovative vision.  </P> <P> Ann Thorne, the city's current part-time public art consultant, is dedicated  and well-meaning, but she has an unsubstantial background in art and lacks the  requisite clout. It remains to be seen what clout and direction will be  forthcoming from the city's fledgling Cultural Affairs Commission, whose  members include Peggy Mears, former director of the Irvine Fine Arts Center.  </P> <P> Viewed simply as an outdoor-indoor exhibition (pieces by three artists are in  the Civic Center lobby), "Sculpture on View" is not exactly a show-stopper. The  cheekiest of the works still on view is Leslie Robbins' two-part "Modern  Times": a telephone pole that leans crookedly against the building and a small  plaster and cement cross-shaped piece that sits nearby on the plaza.  </P> <P> Although the meaning of the smaller piece remains unclear, the pole sends a big  raspberry to the cleanly anonymous architecture of the building and the broad,  blank plaza -- and, by extension, to the airbrushed image of the 19-year-old  master-planned city. Considering that Irvine actually has no working telephone  poles -- the cables are all buried underground -- the image seems even more  apropos.  </P> <P> O you city of the future, where the most grievous sin is to be unsightly, and  where folks must be protected against the small urges that overtake them when  face-to-face with public art.  </P> <P>  "Sculpture on View" -- with work in the lobby and on the plaza by Joyce Kohl,  Daniel Miller, Bret Price, Karen Innes Reid, Leslie Robbins, Dunnieghe Slawson,  Richard Turner and Pat Warner, remains through July 13 at the Irvine Civic  Center.  </P> <P> </P></p>

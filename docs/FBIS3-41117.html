Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said on Wednesday the dagga  was compressed in 127 packages hidden in two pool tables. Its  South African street value was about R[rand]150,000, but it  would have fetched R4 million in The Netherlands.    Durban Narcotics Chief Maj Piet Meyer said Tuesday's arrest  was part of an investigation into a drug syndicate. The same  people had been implicated in about five similar cases in the  past three years. "We are still busy with further investigations  to see if we can close down the syndicate once and for all," Maj  Meyer said, adding that the organisers preyed on unsuspecting  people, manipulating them into doing the "dirty work" for a  portion of the profit.    He said South Africa's superior quality dagga was much  sought  after overseas. Amsterdam's got most of its dagga from South  Africa and Morocco, but "South African dagga is more potent and  it's in demand because the quality is better," Maj Meyer said.    The man is expected to appear in court this week.</p>

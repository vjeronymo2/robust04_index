			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Input price rises threaten profits Recent rises in raw material prices, combined with fierce price competition in retail markets is threatening a profit squeeze in some manufacturing sectors, official figures yesterday suggested. A surge in the price of metals and other imported commodities pushed the cost of raw materials and fuel for manufacturers up by a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent in June, the Central Statistical Office said. However, output prices increases were broadly flat as intense competition prevented UK companies from increasing the price of manufactured goods. The cost of goods leaving factory gates, measured by the core output price index, rose by only 0.1 per cent in June compared to May. Measured over the year to June, the index rose by 1.9 per cent - its lowest annual growth since November 1967. The core index excludes the volatile food, drink, tobacco and fuel sectors, The Treasury yesterday hailed the data as 'welcome good news' ahead of the retail price index and average earnings data which will be published tomorrow But with the rise in input prices higher than City forecasts, the reaction from analysts was mixed. Some fear that input price rises could fuel inflation later this year. A recent Confederation of British Industry survey indicated a sharp rise in manufacturers hoping to raise prices. British companies now face a 'very different world', warned Mr Richard Kersley, UK markets strategist at brokers BZW. Output costs rose faster than input costs in the past two years, but the reversal of this pattern in recent months meant companies now needed to focus on increasing sales volumes, he said. Commodities are calculated to be only 5 per cent of the total costs of UK manufacturers and most companies were already operating with historically strong levels of profit margins. Mr David Owen, UK economist with brokers Kleinwort Benson, warned some sectors heavily dependent upon commodities could suffer a profit squeeze. Businessmen yesterday echoed this picture of growing pressure on margins. Mr Rolf Rittner, raw materials purchasing director at BASF, the German chemicals company, said: 'It has not been possible to close the gap between increasing commodity prices and selling prices.' Mr Jean-Luc Schwitzguebel, managing director of Swiss-owned Ciba Pigments in the UK, said price rises among raw materials were forcing a search for alternatives. Details, Page 12 Lex, Page 20</p>

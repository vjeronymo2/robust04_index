			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. URGED TO INVEST AT HOME TO CUT DEFICITS  </P> <P> The United States needs to boost its rate of savings and businesses must plow  more money into plants and equipment if the nation hopes to slash its external  deficits, economists say.  </P> <P> Progress appears stalled in Washington's battle to reduce the country's trade  gap and current account deficit, which measure U.S. demand for imports against  foreign demand for American products.  </P> <P> While the dollar has declined more than 50% in the past three years, making  U.S. exports more competitive, the currency decline by itself has not reversed  the imbalances.  </P> <P> The United States must make the following basic changes, economists said in  interviews this week:  </P> <P> Boost government, personal and corporate savings to reduce the dependence on  foreign borrowing and free up funds for productive investment.  </P> <P> Bolster investment in plants and equipment to raise productivity, making  American goods more competitive by lowering costs.  </P> <P> Increase research and development and create new, higher-quality products.  </P> <P> Find new markets for U.S. exports to make up for the loss of demand from Latin  America, which is burdened by debt, and from the 13 members of the Organization  of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which are pressured by low oil prices.  </P> <P> Although the Group of Seven industrial nations voiced hopes of reducing global  trade imbalances at its meeting in Washington Friday, economists are not as  optimistic.  </P> <P> Efforts to cut the massive U.S. trade deficit, which makes up most of the  broader current account gap, will be tough, they said.  </P> <P> The trade deficit measures imports against exports, while the current account  includes "invisible goods" such as shipping, tourism and banking. The 1988 U.S.  trade deficit was $126 billion through November, while the current account  shortfall was $135 billion through the 1988 third quarter.  </P> <P> Servicing external debt limits the resources the United States has available  for productive ventures such as factories and thus weighs on present and future  living standards, economists said. Rising trade deficits increase the country's  dependence on foreigners, as they are financed by an inflow of capital from  abroad.  </P> <P> Growing dependence on foreign borrowing is keeping U.S. interest rates high to  ensure continued foreign investment, economists said. A halt of these funds,  for any reason, will send the dollar tumbling and interest rates surging.  </P> <P> Washington also has a political stake in balancing its books regarding foreign  trade.  </P> <P> "The credibility of the U.S. as a world leader was severely undermined when the  nation turned into the world's largest debtor country with its currency  constantly under pressure," said Shafiq Islam of the Council on Foreign  Relations.  </P></p>

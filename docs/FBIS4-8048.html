			<p>BFN     [Text] Taking the floor at the international conference on  the Balkans [in Istanbul], Prime Minister of the Republic of  Kosova Dr. Bujar Bukoshi called on the United Nations, the  Security Council, the CSCE, the United States, Russia, and all  the governments of democratic countries to help Kosova to avoid  the conflict and simultaneously asked from them to recognize the  willpower of the people of Kosova for a free and  self-determining existence.    Dr. Bukoshi told the participants at Istanbul conference  that  the Albanians of Kosova seek to realize their aspirations in a  peaceful way, i.e., to be allowed to exert their political will  in government. Such a peaceful movement is a new thing for the  Balkans and, if it brings results, it can but increase the hope  of the Balkan peoples for a glorious future.    Prime Minister Bukoshi stressed that this would be a clear  and fair signal that all the conflicts in the Balkans could be  solved in a civilized way and not through the use of force.    Commenting on suggestions of some people that the Albanians  of Kosova accept a similar autonomy to the one that has existed  in 1974, Dr. Bukoshi said that this is the same as if we ask the  Albanians of Kosova to remain under the Greater Serbia and the  Serbian dictatorship -- always subjugated, pursued, and agitated  in every possible way and a colonial regime. Those who suggest  this kind of autonomy simply give indications that they are not  ready to deal with the regime of a dictator. The question of  the people of Kosova is not simply a case of secessionism. The  state of which it was a part has been dismantled and no country  deriving from it can incorporate others within its own borders  without their own will.    Further on, Dr. Bukoshi said that the international  community  should strengthen sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, while  their eventual lifting should be conditioned with the  achievement of an acceptable solution for all the problems of  the Yugoslav crisis, including Kosova as well.    Kosova should be demilitarized and the democratic  institutions be turned back to it. A kind of international  protectorate should be installed in Kosova, Dr. Bukoshi  underlined, stressing that Kosova should be considered by the  Balkan neighboring countries as a regional problem, and not as  an internal affair of Serbia, so that these countries play a  more constructive role, because even their peace can be  endangered.    Prime Minister of the Republic of Kosova Dr. Bujar Bukoshi  said that only in this way will the necessary conditions be  created to participate in the negotiations on Kosova equally and  without preconditions. On the contrary, the future will be  uncertain and unpredictable.    Closing, Dr. Bukoshi said that in the name of the Government  of Kosova, we have the mandate to give life to the people's  will, and we will continue to do this.</p>

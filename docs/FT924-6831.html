			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Letter: Recession and air fares both bite Sir, I refer to your headline 'Recession and fares war take BA down 23 per cent' (November 18). I have just arrived back from Milan by BA, travelling economy class, having paid Pounds 341.50 return. On the outward journey I met an American businessman on the flight who had come from Philadelphia by BA. We compared costs and I was amazed to find that, even at today's exchange rate, he had paid roughly the same for his Philadelphia-Milan return ticket. I export 100 per cent of my services to Europe and, like many other small companies, find the going tough. There is no fares war where I work, only recession.

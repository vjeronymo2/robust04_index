			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by the Foreign Ministry of Albania"; place and </F> date not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] Being informed that the Greek Government  representative blocked the decision to grant 35 million ECU's to  Albania for assistance with the balance of payments at the 16  May 1994 meeting of the EC economy and finance ministers, the  Foreign Ministry expresses its regret over this action, which  runs counter to the European Union [EU] Commission  recommendations and the unreserved approval of the European  Parliament. Besides this, no other representative from the 12  EC countries present in the aforementioned meeting had any  objection to granting this assistance. We stress that this  assistance was recommended by the IMF.    We would like to point out that such an act is neither in  conformity with the EC's revolving presidency, which Greece  holds, nor with the relations of good-neighborliness that Greece  professes to have with Albania, and the efforts made to improve  the relations between Albania and Greece.    The claim that the Greek authorities are dissatisfied with  the respect for the rights of the Greek minority in Albania  cannot be taken as sincere and serious, as these cases have been  examined by the EU Commission and Parliament and no other  country of this community that is interested and informed on  developments in Albania presented such observations.    Over the last two years, dozens of international commissions  of the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and the EU have come and  they have made no significant observations, apart from asserting  the great improvement in the situation and in the rights of the  Greek minority.    We also express our regret that, because of political  passions, the Greek Government does not hesitate to penalize,  with this act, the Greek minority, by blocking assistance aimed  at the development of reforms in Albania, from which the  minorities would profit along with all other Albanian citizens.    Considering its timing, such an action is prejudicial for  the  meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries,  proposed by the Albanian side and accepted by the Greek side.    We hope that the EC's 12 other member countries, which have  given great assistance to Albania in this difficult period of  transition, will not comply with such a stance, which aims at  blocking reforms and will influence the approval of this  assistance. We believe that the blocking policy does not do  honor to Greece, the EC's revolving president, from whom its  neighbors are waiting for concrete assistance in the common  interest of integration, stability, and peace in the region.</p>

"In the year 1994, we should move forward toward the world  and the future on the foundation of what we achieved through  last year's reform drive," Kim said.    "I hope we can all be born anew this year after ridding  ourselves of such vices as egoism, falsehood, idleness, vanity  and extravagance," Kim said.    "The ongoing anticorruption drive cannot be stopped or  slowed  at this point because it is my obligation to construct a just  society," the President stressed.    To survive in the new era of unrestrained international  competition, he said, "We must concentrate our ability and  creativity on building up national power. An opportunity, once  lost, is lost forever. An opportunity always follows a crisis.  We should take full advantage of the challenge stemming from  globalization and opening to upgrade our national status,"  President Kim said.    Saying that all people should join in the movement to  strengthen national competitiveness, Kim stressed that each  member of society should not forget that he or she has an  important role to play in international competition.    "We have to win," he asserted.    "We are now at the starting point in our race toward the  world and future. We can't afford to waste any of our precious  time on conflict and enmity. Instead of pursuing meaningless  arguments, we should seek after the practical," Kim said.    Touching on the issue of the domestic agricultural market  opening, the President appealed to the nation to give full  support to the farmers. He asked the people to focus their  wisdom and strength on helping the farmers regain hope and  courage.    "Let's work hard to make 1994 the year in which the  foundation of a New Korea was firmly laid," Kim said.    In conclusion, President Kim made a brief mention of the  North Korean nuclear issue.    "I hope the nuclear matter will be resolved this year so  that  true peace can come to the Korean Peninsula, which has been  scarred by division for the past 40 years," Kim said.    President Kim called for great efforts to help compatriots  in  the North join not only in the worldwide trend of opening and  reform but also in the creation of a New Korea.</p>

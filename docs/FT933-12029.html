			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Whitehall property agencies reviewed THE CABINET office has launched a review into the efficiency with which the Civil Service manages government property holdings. The review will look at the scope for giving departments and agencies greater responsibility for managing their property, including acquisition and disposal. Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's efficiency adviser, will carry out the review, which covers thousands of properties across the UK. The largest organisation managing government property is Property Holdings, part of the Department of the Environment, which manages contracts worth Pounds 2bn a year. With more than 3,000 properties under management it is responsible for 60 per cent of the government's civil estate, housing parts of more than 50 departments and public bodies. The terms of reference of the review indicate that the government is concerned that it should not lose benefits that centralised arrangements offer in the property market. Arrangements to avoid competition between departments will be considered. The review will also examine whether central advice will be needed on matters such as health and safety, fire precautions and environmental issues. It is due to be completed by the end of the year.</p>

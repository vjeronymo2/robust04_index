			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Green themes recognised in Queen's awards COMPANIES selling dress-makers' dummies, pizza crusts and genetically improved breeding pigs are among this year's winners of Queen's awards for export achievement and technological development. More than 150 businesses have won awards for their success in these categories and, for the first time, for advances in environmental protection. The Financial Times group has also received its sixth export award. With the government championing an export-led recovery, the majority of winners received their awards for selling overseas. They include small companies, such as AE Arthur, of King's Lynn, Norfolk, which sells adjustable fashion dummies around the world, and Canadian Pizza Crust of Salford, which supplies pizza bases and fillings. The first 12 winners of the new award for environmental achievement reflect a cross-section of green themes. They include products or processes to clean up industrial effluents, reduce air pollution, save the ozone layer and cut the use of chemical pesticides. Survey, Pages 11-20</p>

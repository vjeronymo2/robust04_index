			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (35): Electronic mail turns into groupware - Technology Update ONE of the main thrusts into groupware has come from suppliers of electronic mail systems. The latest version of Microsoft Mail, version 3.0, is being promoted as a groupware product and WordPerfect has upgraded its Office Mail package to embrace groupware features. The most interesting of these electronic mail products, however, is the recently-introduced Beyond Mail package from US software developer, Beyond. Beyond Mail evolved from a research project at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The project aimed to add 'intelligence' to electronic mail systems by introducing rules for processing messages and help users by 'filtering' out inappropriate ones. 'As electronic mail networks grow, the number of messages flying around the system causes information-overload,' explains Peter Sketch, advanced product manager at ESP, Beyond's UK distributor. 'Beyond Mail gives you the power to process electronic messages with sets of rules which can be turned on and off, according to your needs,' he explains. The rules can be created by users with an easy-to-use Windows-type front end (a Microsoft Windows version will be available later this year). Rules can be used to filter out mail, re-route it or give it a priority and can be based on a combination of criteria. A rule might be used, for example, to filter mail from a specific source and give it higher priority. Another rule might cause the text of the message to be searched for certain key words. 'You can get Beyond Mail to work for you while you are away from your desk,' explains Peter Sketch. 'As well as handling messages, rules can invoke other applications. Data might come in the form of a spreadsheet or a database. You can build a rule to re-format it or update an existing database.' Beyond Mail provides a 'folder' or directory structure for filing messages, including what Mr Sketch describes as a 'tickler' file for date-specific messages: 'You can program Beyond Mail to route certain messages to this file so that they come up on a particular date automatically.' Beyond Mail works on all MS/DOS personal computers and supports gateways into the X400 and X25 networking standards. In addition, it can link to other MS/DOS applications programs.</p>

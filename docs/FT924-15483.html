			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / International Company News: Stoppage hits GIB's first-half profit NET PROFIT at GIB Group, one of Belgium's two largest retail groups, slipped from BFr1.77bn (Dollars 60.4m) to BFr1.68bn in the first half of the year although most of the company's principal activities showed good growth. GIB blamed the negative effects of a strike in February, which cost the company some BFr185m, and the 'gloomy economic climate' for the drop in profits. Turnover rose from BFr105bn to BFr111bn, up 5.2 per cent, or 3.3 per cent adjusted for exchange rate differences and changes in consolidating group companies. GIB, Belgium's largest private-sector employer, said its supermarket and hypermarket sector had shown growth of 2 per cent - 3 per cent excluding the effects of the strike. The company still aims to have electronic point of sale and scanning equipment installed across all its stores by the end of the year.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Cuba's Nafta fears calmed Canada and Mexico will maintain their economic links with Cuba, despite the US embargo of the island, according to Mr Jorge Bolanos, Cuba's deputy foreign minister. Cuba had feared that the US might object to the recent expansion in trade and economic relations between its two partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement, and Cuba. However, Cuba had been told that trade with Canada and Mexico would continue, and that both countries would support an end to the embargo, said Mr Bolanos. 'This is the assurance we sought and which we have finally received. Both Canada and Mexico have argued publicly against the continuation of the economic embargo,' he said. 'There is now no chance that either the Canadian or Mexican governments will concern themselves with what the US has to say about commercial links with Cuba.' In diplomatic discussions with Canada and Mexico, Cuba was told that it had no reason to be concerned for the effects of the implementation of Nafta on Cuban trade and economic relations. However, Cuban officials continued to hint at the possibility of 'subtle pressure' by the US on the other Nafta members to reduce economic links with Cuba or to eliminate them altogether. 'Cuba has now been comforted by both the Canadian and Mexican governments through visits to the island and statements by officials of both governments,' Mr Bolanos said. President Carlos Salinas of Mexico had recently indicated his government's desire to enhance trade with Cuba, and there had been similar assurances on her visit to Havana from Ms Christine Stewart, Canada's parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN JUAN'S PARKING FEES FOR AMTRAK RIDERS  </P> <P> From the commuter's point of view, I must state that this proposed parking fee  is a poor choice on the part of the city of San Juan Capistrano. The city has  built a parking building to relieve the parking woes of the downtown area. This  is all well and good, except we find out that we are expected to park in the  new building and pay for it. We train riders were not asked if we wanted a new  place to park, nor were we asked if we wanted to subsidize the city's new  building.  </P> <P> I believe that the fair solution is to leave things as they are and have the  city utilize its new parking building for theater patrons and shoppers. If the  city must force the passengers to utilize this new building, then the least it  could do is offer a parking pass costing in the neighborhood of $5 per month  for a minimum of six months, increasing only annually, based on the cost of  living.  </P> <P> Oceanside, Santa Ana and Fullerton do not charge for parking at their stations.  Does San Juan Capistrano want to be the bad guy and start the pay-for-parking  routine in addition to the fares that passengers are paying?  </P> <P> RANDALL L. SMITH  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

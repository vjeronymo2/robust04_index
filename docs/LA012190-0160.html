			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS: MONTCLAIR PREP COULD END DOUBTS  </P> <P> We interrupt basketball season to bring you an update on Valley football,  1990-style.  </P> <P> Remember Montclair Prep? That tiny school in Van Nuys dripping with talent? The  school of which everybody had an opinion?  </P> <P> Certainly you heard of the backfield of dreams, with juniors Derek and Leland  Sparks and senior Michael Jones. You heard of the behemoth linemen, such as  Donovan Roy and Jason Blatt. You saw their blowouts against outmanned  opponents.  </P> <P> Perhaps you were among those who questioned the validity of the Mounties' 12-1  season, which ended just one game shy of a Southern Section title.  </P> <P> You heard the rumblings. Montclair Prep . . . who did they ever play?  </P> <P> Well, if things work out as planned, the mighty Mounties will have a chance to  thumb their noses at all doubters and prove something in the process. There is  a chance that Montclair Prep can play a preseason nonleague game against  Chaminade, a member of the newly created Mission League (along with Alemany,  Crespi, Notre Dame, St. Paul, Bishop Montgomery and St. Bernard). Chaminade has  a well-respected program, the kind that lends credibility to an opponent's  schedule.  </P> <P> The Eagles and the Mounties share an open date on Sept. 21, 1990. Chaminade  Coach Rich Lawson has approached Montclair Prep coaches George Giannini and  John Hazelton about a game.  </P> <P> "I mentioned that it would be kind of nice for both schools," Lawson said. "The  kids know each other, so what the heck? I think it would be a good game and I  would enjoy it.  </P> <P> "I guess it's just up to the athletic directors now. They're the ones carrying  the ball right now."  </P> <P> Add big game: Montclair Prep already has taken steps to add weight to its  schedule by participating in a preseason game in Hawaii as part of a national  triple-header that also includes Crespi and Canyon. But a game against a  recognized local power likely would mean more to Montclair Prep -- and draw  much fan interest.  </P> <P> Lawson points out that, because of his team's affiliation with a new league and  its attendant prestige, the Mounties would benefit greatly from a win. Probably  more so than Chaminade.  </P> <P> "It'd be a real big shot in the arm for their program if they win," Lawson  said. "Heck, we stand to lose more than they do. But why not? I'd like to play  as many schools in the San Fernando Valley as possible."  </P> <P> And how does Montclair Prep feel about all this?  </P> <P> Said Hazelton: "It'd finally be a chance to answer our critics."  </P> <P> Quotebook: Lawson, on Chaminade's jump from Division VII to Division I in one  season: "For the other programs, it's not that big a deal. But it's one giant  step for the little Eagles."  </P> <P> It's fair to say, then, that the Eagles have landed.  </P> <P> Royal confusion: John Reed, wrestling coach at Royal High, says that a  misunderstanding led to his dismissal two weeks ago as freshman football coach.  In an interview regarding wrestling, Reed said he was disappointed to see that  in California there is little connection between a school's football and  wrestling programs. In Oklahoma, many football players have wrestled, said  Reed, who attended school there. To him, it appeared that this helped the  football players greatly with agility and from a mental approach.  </P> <P> Reed told the reporter that if he were a head football coach, he would  encourage his players to wrestle.  </P> <P> When the quote was published, it read as if Reed had said that if he were the  football coach, he would encourage same.  </P> <P> Royal varsity Coach Gene Uebelhardt took exception to what he perceived as  unnecessary advice regarding his program and fired Reed as freshman football  coach. Reed is still confused and saddened over the incident.  </P> <P> "I still think it was an innocuous statement," Reed said. "I don't see the  harm. It was never something that was meant to put a blame on anyone or  anything like that. I told Gene, 'I wasn't pointing a finger at you. I was just  making a statement about football and wrestling.' And I will stand by that  statement.  </P> <P> "This is not something I want to make enemies on."  </P> <P> Uebelhardt, however, failed to see it that way.  </P> <P> "I have no comment," he said. "As far as I'm concerned, the subject is closed."  </P></p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: GDP figure subdues the dollar THE DOLLAR was depressed by a poorer than expected headline figure for US growth yesterday, but recovered in the European afternoon on closer inspection of the data, writes James Blitz. US GDP in the first quarter of this year expanded at an annual rate of 1.8 per cent, compared to market expectations of a 2.3 per cent rise. Shortly before the indicator was released, the dollar was trading lower at DM1.5770 to the D-Mark. It then fell to bottom out at DM1.5693. However, the US currency recovered on a closer analysis of the data, which suggested that underlying growth was relatively strong. According to Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America in London, the headline GDP figure was depressed by a record monthly drop in US military spending. He also belives that, if storm damage during the first three months of 1993 is taken into account, underlying growth was in the order of 3.5 per cent. The dollar ended in London at DM1.5815, down about  1/2 pfennig on the day. Towards the close of European trading, the currency remained immobile as dealers awaited the outcome of the G7 finance ministers' meeting in Washington. It finished New York trading at DM1.5785. In Europe, the main focus was on the continuing appreciation of the French franc against the D-Mark in the wake of this week's easing in German monetary policy. For the first time this year, the franc pierced the FFr3.37 level against the German currency to close at FFr3.369 from a previous FFr3.374. A stronger sign of the French currency's strength was the narrowing of the spread between three-month francs and D-Marks, now down to 18 basis points, indicating the withering away of the franc's premium against devaluation. Earlier this week, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, said there was no reason why French rates should not go below German ones. However, a big discount to German rates is unlikely. The French authorities would be wary of lowering French official rates too far for fear of having to instantly reverse an interest rate cut, as they did in the winter of 1991. There were indications, too, yesterday that Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, was troubled by the sharp fall in German bunds following the cut in the repo rate this week. After a dovish newspaper interview earlier this week, Mr Schlesinger yesterday said Germany had not beaten its inflation problem. The Spanish peseta was affected by these comments and fell back in late trading to end at Pta73.20 to the D-Mark from a previous Pta73.07. The pound weakened gently throughout the day on suspicions that the Bank of England was selling sterling to boost foreign exchange reserves. The currency closed  3/4 pfennig down at DM2.4850.</p>

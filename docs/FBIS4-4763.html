			<p>BFN     [Text] Metropolitan police have insisted that missing  Russian diplomat Igor Makeyev has left Thailand after they were  criticized for releasing the information to the press.    "The evidence I have received indicates that Igor has most  probably left Thailand," said metropolitan police commissioner  Pol Lt Gen [Police Lieutenant General] Chaiyasit Kanchanakit,  who is overseeing the search for the Russian Embassy's missing  third secretary.    Chaiyasit said deputy commissioner Pol Maj Gen [Police Major  General] Thawi Thiprat, who is investigating the case, told him  yesterday that Makeyev's credit card records confirm he had  visited the Limelight Restaurant, in Bangkok's Patpong Road  red-light district, and where he had been spotted with a friend  Van Nappier [not further identified] on March 19. Chaiyasit had  previously listed the date as March 23. According to Thawi,  Nappier told police that Makeyev planned to go abroad, after  first sending his family back to Russia.    A search of Makeyev's Soi Saladaeng apartment in Bangkok  revealed that his wife and daughter had moved out, Thawi said.    "But police are checking with the Immigration Division for  further evidence that Makeyev has left the country, when he did,  by what airline and to what destination," he said.    Neither Makeyev nor his laptop computer have been seen since  March 22.</p>

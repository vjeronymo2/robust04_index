			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Factory pay down as productivity rises: Optimism from CBI contrasts with printing industry forecast of 'double-dip' recession MANUFACTURERS are reporting a sharp increase in productivity and a downturn in pay settlements for the second half of 1991, a trend which is expected to be accentuated this year, according to the Confederation of British Industry. The CBI's findings will be welcomed by ministers as further evidence that the recession is bringing wage inflation under control. However, the CBI's optimism contrasts sharply with a report from the British Printing Industries Federation which says the results of its latest trends survey are 'frightening' and show the printing industry heading for a 'double-dip recession'. The CBI's Pay Databank, which has in the past produced productivity statistics more optimistic than the official data, says manufacturers which made pay awards in the third quarter of 1991 reported annual productivity gains of 5.5 per cent, compared with 3.4 per cent in the previous two quarters. According to the labour market statistics published by the Department of Employment last month the increase in manufacturing output per head in the third quarter of 1991 was only 1.7 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. In the current year the CBI expects manufacturing productivity to rise 6.4 per cent. Economists say some increase in productivity is to be expected while the economy is pulling out of a recession as output starts to recover while companies are still shedding labour. On pay, the CBI notes a continuing decline in average settlements in manufacturing. The third-quarter figure averaged 5.4 per cent compared with an average of 6.3 per cent in the previous quarter and 8.8 per cent a year before. Settlements in service companies averaged 6.4 per cent in the second half of 1991 compared with 7.1 per cent in the first half of 1991 and 8.9 per cent in the second half of 1990. Sir John Banham, CBI director-general, said: 'With productivity in UK manufacturing industry rising, and pay settlements now below the level of those in Germany and closing on those in France, the outlook for the competitiveness of British businesses, for inflation, and  - in the longer term for interest rates  - is good.' The British Printing Industries Federation survey was markedly more depressed about the economic outlook. The BPIF said that 'the small light at the end of the tunnel seems to have been extinguished'. The trends survey found that 89 per cent of companies had order books below the seasonal norm at Christmas and only 7 per cent of companies believe that conditions will ease in the first quarter of 1992. Seventy per cent believe that trading will stay at the present depressed levels and 23 per cent see a further decline. Mr Nick Winks, chairman of the federation's government and industry committee, said of the survey: 'The results are very frightening. The printing industry . . . is clearly facing a double-dip recession.' About 80 per cent of larger print companies and 20 per cent of smaller ones have reduced employment and many plan to do so again in the opening months of 1992, says the federation.

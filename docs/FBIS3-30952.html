			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and </F> Croatian President Franjo Tudjman following their talks in  Geneva on 10 February -- recorded; Juppe speaks in French with  passage-by-passage translation into Serbo-Croatian; translated  from the French]    [Excerpts] The meeting between Tudjman and Juppe finished  about an hour ago in Zagreb. We have just received the  declarations made by President Tudjman and the French foreign  minister. [passage omitted]    [Juppe] Ladies and gentlemen, given the time, I shall be  brief. I would like first of all to thank President Tudjman for  having received me at such short notice, as I only decided to  make this trip yesterday. My delegation and I are grateful for  the welcome we have received.    I came to tell President Tudjman to what extent the gravity  of the situation was of concern to France. As you know, France,  with its American and European allies, initiated the decision  taken yesterday by the North Atlantic Council, demanding the  lifting of the siege of Sarajevo and the placement of the heavy  weaponry under the control of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces].  If these demands are not met within 10 days, the decision makes  provision for the use of force. We are totally determined to  implement this decision. In the 10 days before the expiry of  the ultimatum we would like to remind everyone that a  European-sponsored peace plan remains on the table. This  proposal, I repeat, is still valid. It can, I may add, be  adapted in the course of negotiations, and I call on all parties  concerned to allow reason to prevail in order to prevent an  escalation. I hope that Croatia can join in this search for a  peaceful solution.    [Tudjman] For my part, I told Mr. Juppe that Croatia  welcomes  the current EU [European Union] and NATO decisions, adopted with  the approval of the EU and the United States, to undertake  resolute steps not only to bring the suffering of Sarajevo to an  end but also to exert pressure on all sides to achieve peace.  Croatia has also welcomed and done everything to implement the  Juppe-Kinkel plan of action, which later became the EU plan.  Croatia welcomes the new plan and will do everything it can to  prevent further bloodshed and, as Mr. Juppe said, get all sides  to accept the peace plan, which can also be modified, to end the  war and provide conditions for stability and the establishment  of the new international order in this part of Europe. We  highly appreciate the efforts of the French Government as well  as this act by Minister Juppe, who came to the dark Balkans at  this late hour.</p>

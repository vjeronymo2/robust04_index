[Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Sintura, has  the prosecutor general capitulated in favor of drug traffickers  in Colombia?    [Sintura] That is not true. A communique that we released  clearly presents the Prosecutor General's Office position, which  is this: As long as the existing law forbids drug trafficking  in every stage, the Office will continue to fight drug  traffickers and charge them in courts of law.    [Reporter] Does the United States have the moral authority  to  censure us like this?    [Sintura] Well, these are comments that one sovereign state  makes to another. We have said a few things that we think are  important, particularly because we understand that the  generalizations made about the Colombian judicial system can be  based on either incorrect interpretations of our legal system or  insufficient reports.

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Moscow and IMF fail to reach deal on Dollars 1.5bn loan: Russian PM makes final attempt to secure funds Russia and the International Monetary Fund have failed to agree on a further Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) loan which Russia is seeking to help economic reform. After three days of talks, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, will today make a last attempt to persuade top-level IMF officials to release the funds before they return to the US. Mr Chernomyrdin will meet Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, for a final round of talks. The exercise is a vital one for the Russian government. The payment of the loan, the second tranche of Dollars 3bn in funds to help reform, is part of a Dollars 43bn package agreed by the Group of Seven last year in Tokyo. The loan would: Inject desperately needed hard currency into Russia at a time when capital continues to be exported. Signal the IMF's belief continued reform is possible under Mr Chernomyrdin's leadership. Allow Russia to service its debt obligations and thus increase its chances of receiving further debt relief and loans. However, the indications from both sides are that the IMF officials cannot reconcile the budget's assumptions with what they believe will be the out-turn at the end of the year. According to one source, the Russian side had withheld details from the IMF team until the last moment in order to weaken the team's position during the talks. The Fund is concerned that the expenditure in the budget, Rbs183,000bn, will be exceeded long before the end of the year and that the income, of Rbs120,000bn, will not be gathered in because of rapidly falling tax revenues. The Fund also thinks that the Russian parliament, which has only just been sent the draft budget, will not approve it and will demand much higher spending. Mr Chernomyrdin issued the invitation to Mr Camdessus to visit Moscow earlier this month in the hope that face-to-face discussions would break the long deadlock in talks over the loan. Previous meetings between the two men have been frosty. But Mr Camdessus - aware that assisting Russian reform represents the largest and most dangerous challenge to the IMF's abilities since the war - is determined to bend every effort to secure agreement, if one can be brought within the bounds of the IMF's criteria for lending. The Russian prime minister has striven in the past two months to burnish his image as a reformer, following the departure from the cabinet of Mr Yegor Gaidar and Mr Boris Fyodorov, formerly deputy prime ministers and the most prominent radicals. However, it has been widely assumed outside Russia that the reforms are at best stalled. Russian debt traded on the international markets at 55 cents to the dollar in December but halved to 28 cents today, and it is 'still under pressure', according to H. Rivkin and Co, a New York investment house specialising in distressed bonds. On Friday, Mr Mikhail Zadornov, the reformist chairman of the lower chamber's budget committee, said he believed the budget was unrealistic. 'I would rather have a realistic budget, maybe with a higher deficit, than a budget which will be exceeded in two or three months,' he said. Russia finds independent foreign policy, Page 13</p>

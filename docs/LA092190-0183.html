			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OIL PRICES SET ANOTHER RECORD AT $35.10 A BARREL  </P> <P> Oil prices shot above $35 per barrel today for yet another all-time high on the  futures market, as traders responded to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's  statement that his citizens should be ready for war.  </P> <P> Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.,  said the Iraqi leader "made it clear he is not going to retreat, and I think  that has got the market on edge again about the possibility of military  escalation."  </P> <P> In late morning trading today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet  crude sold as high as $35.10 per barrel on November contracts. Crude contracts  for November delivery opened at $34.05, up 63 cents from Thursday's close, and  prices remained near that level as of midday.  </P> <P> This morning's rise, amid heavy volume, became the latest in a series of  records oil has been setting throughout the week. Oil had first risen above $33  per barrel on Monday and surpassed $34 on Thursday.  </P> <P> Before this week's activity, the high futures price of $32.35 per barrel had  stood since 1983.  </P></p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Dismay over leak of Ulster proposal UNIONISTS in Northern Ireland were reported last night to be dismayed at the leaking of a submission to the round-table talks on the province's political future, our Belfast Correspondent writes. The submission from the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party was tabled as part of the first phase of the talks. It proposes a European-style consultative assembly which would involve the appointment of commissioners for the province, including one by Dublin. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, said he was furious at the breach of confidentiality. SDLP officers also expressed anger. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the leak 'rather strikes at the trust which has been maintained until now and I hope will be maintained in the future'.</p>

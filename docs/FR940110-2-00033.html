Such support is authorized by 42 U.S.C. 7141 (d) and 7256(a); Public Law 95&hyph;619, part 3, sec. 2.11(d), which states that the Director of the Office of Minority Economic Impact may provide appropriate assistance to minority educational institutions to enable these institutions to participate in the activities of the Department. It is intended in particular to obtain proposals from post secondary two-year educational institutions, or from teams of organizations including qualified post secondary two-year educational institutions. For purposes of this solicitation, a qualified ``Minority Education Institution'' is a post secondary two-year educational institution of higher learning (such as a community college or vocational college) that is a non-profit entity with a minimum of 25 percent total minority enrollment. Pursuant to Public Law 95&hyph;619, ``Minority'' means any individual who is a citizen of the United States and who is a Negro, American Indian, Eskimo, Oriental, or Aleut or is a Spanish speaking individual of Spanish descent. This notice describes the principal scope of the activity and provides some guidance on submitting proposals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES AND ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Proposals (3 copies) should be submitted to Estela Romo, HRMD, U.S. Department of Energy, 1301 Clay St., Oakland, CA 94612.

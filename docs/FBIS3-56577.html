"Russia's Army will walk out when we become not  interesting for Russia or other states that it cannot ignore  will dictate it. Until then, Moldova and Russia, for their  citizens' life, have to find an acceptable variant for both  parties" Plugaru believes. Asked about the information saying  that the National Security Minister is involved in the activity  of the Ilascu Group, Plugaru said "we supported only those  forces which acted according to Moldovan legislation.  Therefore, I think that if someone infringed it, he should be  made responsible basing on this legislation." The ex-minister  spoke about various forms of people's fight against Dniester  regime, including partisans. The National Security Ministry has  done its best to support all forces that pleaded for territorial  integrity of Moldova. If he did not do so, the ministry should  have been dissolved and its employees sued for criminal  passivity, states the quoted source. Asked about the assertion  that Ilie Ilascu's arrest was organized by the National Security  Ministry, Plugaru said: "We must understand the condition of a  man sentenced to death" but still "we should examine much  seriously this declaration of Ilascu, since it should worry us."  Neither Ilascu nor his comrades have done anything against  Moldova's Penal Code. Three years ago, the new state formation,  that is the Republic of Moldova, "was unable as it is now to  make order without bloodshed" on territories where certain  forces speculating with Romanophobia and difficulties of  republican power have took the power and declared their own  republics, ex-USSR's interests on this territory were also  menaced. Russia has never before had such a rude attitude  towards the people of this land. "It is an illusion that  somebody can win in this situation." Russia must pay for its  presence here, and not raise prices for gasoline and energy,  says Plugaru.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Bidding for Scots pit may reopen BRITISH COAL said yesterday it did not rule out reopening talks with Caledonian Mining, the unsuccessful bidder in the competition for leasing the Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh, James Buxton writes. That follows a report that Monktonhall Mineworkers, a company formed by redundant mineworkers and managers, had yet to complete its business plan and secure finance. British Coal said that it would 'explore all credible alternatives' before taking a final decision, although discussions with Monktonhall Mineworkers were continuing, with no scheduled completion date. British Coal said just before Christmas that it would negotiate leasing the colliery with Monktonhall Mineworkers, rejecting the bid from Caledonian Mining, the privately owned mining equipment company. It did so on the recommendation of the consultants Wardell Armstrong. Mr Ben Mason, managing director of Caledonian, said it was still interested in leasing the pit, the first British Coal has offered to lease.</p>

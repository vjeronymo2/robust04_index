			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Markets: Two scripts with a common theme - The Bottom Line SIR DAVID Lees and Dr John White could happily have swapped scripts for their results presentations this week. GKN and BBA, two of the UK's strongest automotive components suppliers, reported encouraging jumps in profits for the first half that exceeded market forecasts. Both have benefited from painful cost-cutting that was begun early in the present recession, and both have reaped gains from tight cash management with a significant fall in interest charges. Marginal increases in turnover compared with the rise in profits bear testament to the hard-won achievements of both groups. There has been little or no help from market demand and market forecasts remain gloomy for the balance of the year. But both BBA and GKN have gained from higher market penetration, with new business won early in the 1990s now coming on stream. Such diligence has won scant reward this week, however. GKN's share price gained ground ahead of its results' announcement but, after a short-lived bout of excitement, news of its 37 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 65.1m was met with a 12p fall in the share price to 383p at the close on Wednesday. The price had lost further ground by the close last night. The BBA share price moved ahead by 8p to 133p last Monday, helped by the release of news of its 26 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 33m, but much of the gain had been lost by the end of the week. Both GKN and BBA are advancing through means of self-help, but analysts remain cautious about the groups' prospects given the absence of any support from the markets. According to White, the BBA group managing director, there is 'no firm evidence of any generalised recovery.' The belief is echoed by Lees, the GKN chairman. 'Although conditions in certain of our markets in the first half of 1992 were rather better than a year ago, in others they deteriorated so that overall there was little change.' With a strong balance sheet and a positive net cash flow, GKN is seen as a low risk - although still rather expensive - buy into recovery. The question is one of timing, and Lees is more pessimistic than three months ago. 'We do not expect the demand pattern we are currently experiencing in our principal markets to change materially in the next few months,' he says. 'So, profit improvement must come from increases in market share and continued rigorous attention to costs and asset management. That is a formula with which we are growing increasingly familiar.' Both BBA and GKN recorded their main profit progress in their automotive component operations, where they have established world leadership in particular narrow niches. BBA claims a world share of some 35 to 40 per cent for some friction materials for brakes and clutches. GKN is the world leader in the supply of constant velocity joints, with a world market share of around 30 per cent. BBA's automotive sector, which accounts for 49 per cent of group sales and 42 per cent of operating profit, improved its profits in the first half by 36 per cent on sales that rose by only 5.5 per cent. At GKN, its automotive and engineered product division raised its trading surplus by 77 per cent, helped by lower rationalisation charges and start-up costs. Sales rose by only 6.5 per cent. The key to caution over the short-term prospects for the components' suppliers lies in the forecast vehicle market development for the rest of the year, and GKN had little good news. Already in the first half of the year, increases in car production of 4.6 per cent in North America and of 5 per cent in west Europe were not matched by registrations, which were slightly lower in both cases. Now, in the second half, the German car market, in particular, looks at risk.</p>

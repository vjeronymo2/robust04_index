			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COURT URGED TO MAKE BAND PAY $5 MILLION  </P> <P> A British rock band and its record company should pay up to $5 million in  damages to a young fan who allegedly was spurred to enter a suicide pact by  subliminal words hidden in the group's music, an attorney argued today.  </P> <P> Vivian Lynch, representing the family of James Vance, also charged in her  closing arguments that a multitrack original of the song "Better by You, Better  Than Me," by the heavy metal band Judas Priest was altered before it was  presented to the court as evidence.  </P> <P> "If this trial does nothing else than prevent the use of subliminals in mass  communications, then this trial will be a success," Lynch said.  </P> <P> She urged Washoe District Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead, who is hearing the case  without a jury, to award damages of $4 million to $5 million to Vance's family  to repay nearly $500,000 in medical bills and to compensate for pain and  suffering.  </P> <P> Closing arguments in the four-week-old trial were to continue into the  afternoon.  </P> <P> Whitehead will then decide whether the alleged subliminal messages exist and,  if so, whether they promoted the youths to shoot themselves.  </P> <P> Members of the heavy metal group contend that no covert words exist in the 1978  "Stained Class" album.  </P> <P> The families of Vance and Raymond Belknap that backward and subliminal messages  on the album contain blasphemy and promote suicide.  </P> <P> Belknap, 18, died of a single blast from a shotgun held in his mouth two days  before Christmas, 1985. Vance, then 20, blew away the lower portion of his  face. He fathered a child and lived three years before his death on  Thanksgiving Day, 1988.  </P></p>

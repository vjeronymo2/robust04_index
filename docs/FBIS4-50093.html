			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- China's import and  export volume has continued to grow over the first four months  of this year after the implementation of the deepened reform in  the foreign economic and trade field, a high-ranking trade  official said here today.    Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation,  told the 1994 China summit that the operational order of China's  foreign trade has been relatively normal and the operation of  the new foreign trade system has been satisfactory.    In her speech entitled "Deepening Foreign Trade System  Reform, Promoting Sino-Foreign Economic and Trade Cooperation",  she said that the reform of the foreign trade system this year  is markedly different from that carried out during the previous  15 years.    The reform this time is being closely coordinated with that  in other main areas of the national economy, such as taxation,  finance, investment, planning, foreign exchange and enterprises.    "It is unprecedented in terms of scope, dynamics and  difficulties," she said.    To ensure the smooth progress of the reform, she said, it  was  necessary to focus attention on the overall situation of  economic system reform and properly handle the relations between  the foreign trade reform and reforms in other sectors.    It was also imperative to conscientiously handle relations  between foreign trade development and reform and effectively  maintain good order in foreign trade operations, as well as  encourage and protect legitimate competition among enterprises,  she added.    "China has consistently pursued a policy of independence,  maintaining initiative in its own hands, equality and mutual  benefit," she said. "We are willing to develop various forms of  economic and trade cooperation with all countries and regions."    At today's meeting, other Chinese officials, including Liu  Zhongli, minister of finance, Chen Yuan, vice-president of the  People's Bank of China, Liu Hongru, chairman of China Securities  Supervision and Management Commission, Huang Ju, mayor of  Shanghai, Ernest Stern, managing director of the World Bank, and  Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of Germany, as well as some  foreign entrepreneurs, also delivered speeches.    The meeting came to a close this evening.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMP DAVID FORMULA AWAITS REDISCOVERY  </P> <P> It is suitable to open a current political discussion on the troubled Middle  East with a reference to the literary world. The sentencing to death of someone  like Salman Rushdie by Islamic fundamentalists is a reminder that Israel has  always been fighting for survival in the actual zone of collision between  Western civilization and a violent Islamic political subculture. The amazing  experiment in transplanting the 7th-Century concept of jihad, or holy war, to  the 20th Century was tried on the Jewish state of "nonbelievers" while it was  still in its cradle.  </P> <P> This incessant attempt to annihilate Israel has found new ways, now aiming at  the establishment of a PLO terrorist state in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza  district. It would, no doubt, serve as a launching pad for expansion: first  eastward, eliminating King Hussein, and then westward, liquidating Israel, with  the backing of more than 11,000 tanks and 1.9 million soldiers stationed in the  four Arab countries east of the Jordan River. No Israeli or American in his  right mind should agree to the establishment of another version of Libya only  50 miles south of Syria, either directly or by proxy or by default. And since  Israelis understand the nature of this threat, most of them would rather be  unjustly criticized than be poetically eulogized.  </P> <P> Regrettably, the surge in U.S. diplomatic activism has not positively  contributed to the cause of peace in the Middle East. Starting with the  American tendency to consider the Soviet-born concept of an international  tribunal on the Middle East, it continued in the March 4, 1988, Shultz  document, which voided the essential transitional period embodied in the Camp  David accords; this suggested that the United States is considering divorcing  itself from the accords. It culminated in the U.S. initiation of dialogue with  the PLO mur derers, legitimizing both the Arab violence directed against Jews  in the Land of Israel and the PLO terrorist raids across the Israel-Lebanon  border. All in all, by yielding to Arab pressure, the United States signaled to  the Arab jihadists that time is on their side, thus rendering the situation far  less ripe for solution than it could be. The Soviet foreign minister's recent  embrace of both Syria and the PLO and his harsh words about sanctions proved  again that anything you can do he can do better.  </P> <P> In view of these dire straits, the creativity of the Camp David compromise, as  initiated by Israel a decade ago, is outstanding. As too many people reject it  outright, it may be helpful here to give a quick sketch of the framework for  peace in the Middle East as agreed to by the United States, Israel and Egypt:  </P> <P> * Israel will be responsible for its security in the whole area west of the  Jordan River.  </P> <P> * The Arab inhabitants of Samaria, Judea and Gaza will enjoy autonomy through a  freely elected self-governing authority.  </P> <P> * As a substantial confidence-building measure, that authority will be in  effect for a transitional period of five years. Within this period, the final  status of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district will be negotiated. The  agreement on the final status will be an integral part of the comprehensive  peace treaty between Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.  </P> <P> We have a clear position concerning Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district: They  are part of Eretz Yisreal, the Land of Israel; it belongs, by right, to the  Jewish people; we must keep it, we intend to keep it and we shall keep it.  However, we are aware that others have their own claims for the same areas.  </P> <P> In this context, the Camp David compromise offers the transitional period as a  mechanism to defer resolution of the complex issue of sovereignty, with the  hope that building mutual confidence will render the situation more manageable  and the problems riper for solution. It is important to note that the framework  is open-ended. There is nothing in the accord itself that precludes any agreed  solution for the final status of the disputed areas.  </P> <P> It has become fashionable to label the Camp David achievement as junk. Not only  is this shortsighted, it also indicates a short memory. It may surprise some  that as late as January, 1988, in an interview with the Kuwaiti newspaper  Al-Anaba, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak offered the following pertinent  observations:  </P> <P> "Camp David includes two documents, one for the solution of the  Egyptian-Israeli problem and the other, which is the general framework of  principles according to which the Palestinian problem is to be solved in all  its aspects. That is, this is not a binding agreement but a method for a  solution on which we shall agree through general points. The first document  ended in the Egyptian-Israeli treaty and the return of the Sinai to Egypt. As  for the second document, concerning the resolution of the Palestinian problem  in all its aspects, when we discussed it with the Israelis, I realized that our  brothers attacked Egypt because she tried to reach a solution of the  Palestinian problem. Had we continued the talks on the second framework of Camp  David, we would have been in a better situation, in stages."  </P> <P> Yes, indeed. In the last decade, no substantially new ideas were offered to  alleviate the difficulties in our corner of the Middle East. The Camp David  compromise still rises high above any of the non-starter formulas, being  practical, gradual, generous and wise. It should be given a fresh look and a  new chance.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Large-scale battles between Cambodian government  troops and Khmer Rouge guerrillas will be prevented because both  sides will be starved of military aid, the First Army Commander  Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo said yesterday.    Chettha said he believed military aid would not be  forthcoming because that would break the 1991 Paris Peace  Accords on Cambodia.    "If any country wants to give arms support, it will have to  think twice. But I don't think that will happen and therefore  the warring in Cambodia will come to a halt," he said.    Chettha said the collapse of peace talks between Phnom Penh  and the Khmer Rouge was not a worry for Thailand.    However, some people might be affected if fighting spilled  across the border into Thailand.</p>

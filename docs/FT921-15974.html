			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Indonesia seeks large rise in tax revenues INDONESIA'S budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1 will rely on a big rise in tax revenues to fund an 11 per cent increase in spending. President Suharto, in his budget speech to parliament yesterday, announced a drive to improve tax collection. 'The public must become even more aware of their duty to pay tax. The number of taxpayers must be constantly increased, the tax administration and collection must continuously be improved,' he said. Development projects, which will comprise nearly 41 per cent of spending, will especially involve the improvement of Indonesia's weak infrastructure, particularly the road, communications and electricity sectors. Revenue from income tax is projected to increase by 36.3 per cent while revenue from value-added tax will increase by 34 per cent. Growth in non-oil exports is also projected to contribute to the growth in revenues. A domestic fuel subsidy is being eliminated. Revenues and expenditure in the 1992-93 budget, which by law has to balance, are to increase by 11 per cent to Dollars 28.9bn. The budget shows a growing reliance on domestic income as Jakarta tries to move away from dependence on foreign aid. The budget assumes a 7.4 per cent drop in foreign aid to Dollars 4.9bn. President Suharto said that Indonesia would continue to use available foreign aid to accelerate development but that 'the key remains in our own hands, namely to discover and develop domestic resources for development.' Sectors other than oil and gas are projected to supply nearly 70 per cent of domestic revenues, or Dollars 16.3bn, an increase of more than 29 per cent over the current fiscal year while revenues from oil and gas will contribute Dollars 6.9bn based on a projected average oil price of Dollars 17 per barrel. The budget projects total exports rising by 8.8 per cent. Inflation for the 1992-93 year is put at 8 per cent compared with an official level of 9.52 per cent in 1991-2. GDP growth is estimated both for the current fiscal year and for the next at 6 per cent, a slight drop from rates of more than 7 per cent in the two previous years.</p>

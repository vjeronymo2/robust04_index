			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses react to weakness in the dollar Last Friday Mr Sushil Wadhwani, global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs in London, said that, if the dollar were to go into a free fall, global equities should underperform bonds with European equities perhaps the most vulnerable. The dollar fell again yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff; and, in Europe, equities mostly underperformed bonds in a big way. However, said Mr Wadhwani, bond markets were assuming that a strong D-Mark would encourage the Bundesbank to cut key interest rates, and in this they could be disappointed. FRANKFURT saw the dollar fall to DM1.5308, and the September bund future rise strongly as the DAX index fell 17.61 to 2,048.05 in turnover up from DM4.6bn to DM6.4bn. 'The dollar decline has really started to hurt,' said Mr Jens Wiecking at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf. The current rate compared with a range of around DM1.70 to DM1.80 at the beginning of this year, on which German companies priced their contracts. Accordingly, he said, it was big exporters, or raw material suppliers with their contracts expressed in dollar terms which were most severely hit. The trucks company, MAN, fell DM11.50 to DM408, and Degussa and Metallgesellschaft in raw materials dropped DM15 to DM460, and DM4.40 to DM196.80 respectively. PARIS reflected the fact that the market would be closed tomorrow and Friday. The CAC-40 index lost 7.67 to 1,942.08 in turnover estimated at just under FFr3bn. Both Daiwa Europe and James Capel issued overweight recommendations on the French equity market. Daiwa noted that investors had been unsettled by the recent number of alleged corruption scandals, but commented that it did not expect the downside to be as great as had been experienced recently in Italy. Forecasting a sharp increase in corporate earnings this year Daiwa expected a rise in CAC-40 earnings per share of nearly 50 per cent. James Capel agreed that the corruption scandals could depress the market and noted that the financial sector in particular was vulnerable to a downward revision of earnings. However, it said, France had now underperformed Germany for five consecutive quarters - the longest period since the early 1980s - and most of the risks to market performance had already been discounted. MILAN was lower in largely technical trade ahead of today's expiry of options and the close of the July trading account on Friday. The Comit index fell 6.25 to 678.10 as investors hoped that today's cabinet meeting might at last bring clues on the government's plans to tackle the budget deficit. Mr Enrico Ponzone at Kleinwort Benson commented that the sudden deterioration of the budget deficit forecasts had exacerbated an already tense situation. Instead of acting to regain the market's confidence, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, had focused on issues of power rather than substance. 'In the face of this failure to deliver we are adopting a more cautious stance but believe that ultimately the government will have little choice but to follow its predecessor's stringent economic policies.' Generali fell L309 to L39,891: one large foreign sell order placed at the start of business helped depress the mood. Ina lost L25 at L2,375, falling below its L2,400 placing price for the first time since its launch on July 6. AMSTERDAM followed the dollar lower and the AEX index closed off 1 per cent in low turnover, down 4.03 at 383.21. The big multinationals with dollar exposure bore the burden of the day's activity on the currency exchanges: Royal Dutch slipped Fl 3.70 to Fl 185.30 and Unilever Fl 2.80 to Fl 181.70. BolsWessanen, off Fl 1.00 at Fl 36.90, announced that it was in co-operation talks with Campari of Italy, while Heineken, helped by the summer weather, went against the trend with a rise of 30 cents to Fl 213.30. MADRID was minded to follow its bond market but it closed off its best on profit taking after falls on Wall Street and in other European bourses. The general index, however, still ended 2.68 higher at 298.72 in turnover of Pta28.4bn. WARSAW climbed for the sixth consecutive session as investors became convinced that the bearish trend of the last few months was over. The Wig index rose 648.2, or 6.75 per cent to 10,258.2. TEL AVIV, too, registered its sixth consecutive gain following last week's 1994 low, the Mishtanim index recovering another 4.14, or 2.45 per cent to 172.82.

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Bundesbank backs deal on solidarity pact LEADING figures in Germany's banking community and members of the Bundesbank council yesterday welcomed the cross-party agreement on finance for a solidarity pact for east Germany, in spite of concern about a rise in public sector borrowing. Mr Reimut Jochimsen, president of the state central bank in North Rhine-Westphalia, and a leading Bundesbank council member, described the deal as a great success. He greeted it with 'great relief', while stressing that many of the figures had yet to be agreed in detail. Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, believed the central bank would not be entirely satisfied, but would continue to relax its monetary policy. The deal is expected to provide a substantial increase in funds for investment in east German industry, and double the money available for a housing modernisation programme from DM30bn (Pounds 12.7bn) to DM60bn. Interest payments on the credit will be directly subsidised by the federal budget in Bonn, and the central government will also assume responsibility for servicing DM31bn in outstanding debts on the east German housing stock. The costs are all likely to add to the government's net borrowing requirement in the next three years. A further rise in borrowing in the current year is almost inevitable, because of an agreement to provide an extra DM2bn for job creation schemes, pushing up the 1993 borrowing requirement of the central government from DM51bn to DM53bn. However, the Finance Ministry in Bonn said yesterday that no figure had been put on the increase in the borrowing limit of the Treuhand privatisation agency, reported at the weekend also to be raised by DM30bn. A spokesman for the ministry said it was intended to keep the borrowing increase of the Treuhand within an agreed 'buffer' of DM8bn per year for 1993 and 1994, on top of the DM30bn per year it is currently allowed to borrow. The extra money is intended both for restructuring 'core industries' which cannot immediately be sold, and for cleaning up the ecological damage caused by the old industries. Overall, the solidarity pact will provide the five eastern states with DM55.8bn from 1995 to finance their running costs, DM51bn at the expense of the central government, and DM4.9bn from the western states. The Bundesbank council meets on Thursday amid continuing market speculation about the likelihood of further interest rate cuts. Editorial Comment, page 21</p>

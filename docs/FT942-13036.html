			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of civil servants resisted Sir Robin Butler, head of the civil service, is resisting an independent survey of civil servants to find out if management changes have affected morale or weakened the public-service ethos. The survey has been proposed by the Commons Treasury and civil service committee as part of its probe into the impact of the changes on the civil service. In the light of evidence in the arms-for-Iraq inquiry, the committee is considering whether a statutory code of ethics is needed to protect civil servants who are asked by ministers to behave unethically or mislead parliament. Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, has promised to consider the idea. However, Sir Robin told the committee yesterday that he feared a survey might prejudice the political neutrality of the civil service. 'The questions proposed go into matters of political controversy,' he said. 'The results could be used to bring the civil service into political debate with the government on matters affecting the management of the civil service.' Mr Mike O'Brien, a Labour member of the committee, pointed out that a survey of top civil servants by the Cabinet Office's efficiency unit had found a strong belief that the public-sector ethos was being eroded. The committee wanted to find out whether this opinion was held among the rest of the civil service. Sir Robin said that allowing a body outside the Whitehall management structure to carry out a survey could have damaging consequences. 'If you seek to separate the civil service as an independent body of opinion from ministers, then ministers will want to ensure sooner or later that that body of opinion is amenable to them,' he warned. 'That will lead to the politicisation of the civil service.' He said that the committee should ask witnesses such as himself about the state of morale. 'There is a good deal of evidence already available,' he said.</p>

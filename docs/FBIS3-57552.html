[Kardava] The keys to the resolution of problems in western  Georgia, in particular in Mingrelia, lie in Tbilisi. All events  that are taking place and being provoked in Mingrelia are being  directed from the capital Tbilisi. Various politicians have  always used Mingrelia and the problem of Zviadism as a card in  their dirty game. Now, prominent people from the Cabinet of  Ministers headed by the prime minister are standing behind those  people who are preparing a coup directed against the rational  policy being implemented by the current leadership of the rayon.  Wasn't he [Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia] Zugdidi Gamgebeli  [head of the local governing body] when, last winter, a  relatively small group of Zviadists miraculously seized a large  amount of military equipment that was being dispatched for the  purposes of military combat in Abkhazia? In this case, it is  not important whether Tengiz Kitovani, the defense minister at  the time, knew about this or not.    What has been done cannot be undone. Today, in Zugdidi,  former Zviadists, having united into a group and having received  the status of military police, present a danger. After all,  these are the same people who, in their time, having been in a  position to help Sukhumi, did not cross the Kodorskiy range. I  am in possession of precise information according to which they  are being backed by important political figures.    I spoke about this at a closed session of the NDP congress  and at the conference of the Mingrelian branch of the NDP. I am  certain that this is clear sabotage against the head of state,  and people are taking part in this whom one would not accuse at  first sight. However, the culprits will, nevertheless, be made  to answer. Their hidden game is becoming too obvious.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Toronto rushes to make up for lost ground - Bernard Simon asks if the TSE can sustain the upward momentum seen since Monday's referendum Over the past six weeks, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) has fallen into a deep trench and then dug itself out again. The TSE 300 index plummeted by more than 300 points, or almost 10 per cent, on the back of a surge in interest rates ahead of last Monday's referendum on proposals for a new Canadian constitution. But with the referendum now out of the way, the market is rushing to make up lost ground. This week, the TSE 300 soared by 89 points to yesterday's close of 3,336. Trading volumes on Wednesday were the heaviest of the year. The question now is whether the market can sustain the momentum or whether it will flatten out between 3,350 and 3,600 where it has been stuck most of this year. Ms Barbara Taylor, vice-president for Canadian equities with the Ontario Hospitals Association (OHA) pension fund, says that the TSE 300 can 'at least get back' to the 3,450 mark. Even that, however, would be well below last January's peak of almost 3,700, not to mention the August 1987 record of 4,112. Ms Taylor notes that many companies, especially in resource industries, are still trading at prices below their book value. The OHA took advantage of the recent sell-off to invest its entire fourth-quarter equities allocation in the first week of October. But a portfolio strategist at one Toronto investment management firm says that the Canadian market, having recovered from its referendum jitters, is now unlikely to move much further ahead without some outside stimulus. 'We're now going to play to the same drummer as the US and Japan,' he predicts. The best performers over the next month or two are likely to be concentrated in three categories: the big banks, selected resource producers, and industrial companies whose earnings are starting to pick up. Bank shares normally benefit from falling interest rates, as loan losses shrink, margins improve and the economic turnround approaches. Lower returns on fixed-income investments improve the attractiveness of the banks' dividends. Mr Roy Palmer, banking analyst at Bunting Warburg in Toronto, predicts that Bank of Montreal's share price, now at about CDollars 47, could climb to CDollars 55 by the end of next year. Bank of Nova Scotia could advance from CDollars 24 to about CDollars 30. But his forecasts are conditional on the Canadian economy getting up a strong head of steam in 1994, and Mr Palmer is starting to wonder whether the upturn may not take longer to materialise. 'I'm less confident about 1994 now than I was about 1993 a year ago,' he says. The drop in the Canadian dollar from over 89 US cents a year ago to just over 80 cents now has given a boost to commodity exporters' earnings. Hopes for a further rise rest on a US fiscal stimulus in the early months of a Clinton presidency, and on a European recovery as interest rates come down in Germany and the UK. For some resource companies, the worst could be over. Abitibi-Price, the newsprint producer, posted a third-quarter loss of CDollars 73m from continuing operations. But it noted that the low point for newsprint and groundwood papers appeared to be reached in the second quarter. 'Conditions are continuing to improve, with volume up and price increases being implemented in newsprint,' Abitibi said. Mining analysts however are generally advising buyers to wait until the recent slide in base metal and gold prices is arrested. For the moment, their attention is riveted on the stampede for diamonds in the Northwest Territories. Mr John Hainey, an analyst at Canaccord Capital, calls an investment in the junior resource companies which have joined the diamond rush 'pure gambling'. But he notes that 'the signs are so exceptional that I'd be surprised if it peters out into nothing'. The leader of the pack, Dia Met Minerals, is trading on the Vancouver Stock Exchange at close to CDollars 20, a 20-fold increase over the past year. Some market watchers say that they have begun to detect a consistent improvement in the performance of many industrial and retail companies, based on third-quarter operating earnings. A prime example is Northern Telecom, which surprised analysts earlier this week with an 11 per cent rise in net earnings, including a small gain at the operating level. Northern's share price has rocketed by 12 per cent in the past week to almost CDollars 48. Imasco, the conglomerate controlled by BAT Industries, saw its share price jump by more than CDollars 2 on Wednesday to CDollars 39 1/2 , its highest level this year after reporting advances in earnings from its tobacco, drug store and fast-food businesses. With political uncertainty on Canada's future pushed to the sidelines for the time being, investors are taking the view that they have more to lose by staying out of the Toronto market than by getting in. Share prices may not rise much further for the next month or two, but they seem less likely to fall. Those who decide to buy now, however, may need some patience until the business recovery finds a firmer footing.</p>

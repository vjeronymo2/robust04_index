It is for the first time that the Russian peace-keepers will  be armed with mortars, anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft  weapons. Earlier the Russian soldiers had only firearms with  them.    The service of the Russian airborne troops told TASS on  Thursday that the paratroopers were dispatched upon a request of  the commander of the UN peace-keeping forces in former  Yugoslavia and with the knowledge of the UN Security Council.    It added that it is hard for the current strength of the  Russian battalion to fulfil its mission on the border between  Krajina Serb and Croatia. The zone monitored by the Russian  force is 100 kilometres long and 30 kilometres wide and has 24  checkpoints.    Both Croats and Serbs regularly violate ceasefire there.    The train with paratroopers is expected to arrive in place  on  January 9.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report from submarine base </F> by V. Tarasov]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Komsomolets tragedy  slightly lifted the veil of secrecy shrouding the loss of  submarines in the former Union. So, at present, five nuclear  submarines and 43 nuclear warheads are resting on the bed of the  world ocean. No doubt, many submariners today remember  colleagues who failed to return. This day should rightly become  a national day of commemoration for all sailors who have  perished.</p>

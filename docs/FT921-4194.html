			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Letter: Costly water mishap points to advantage of indoor meters Sir, With reference to your article 'Most customers find water metering satisfactory in trials' (March 3): I would point out that there is a problem with the metering of water if the meter is, as in this district, near the road, and not in the house. I had the misfortune that the main from the meter to the house leaked for some four months and, being buried and invisible, nobody knew. The courtesy of the South West Water Company excused me from having to pay a large part of the cost, which would have been more than Pounds 2,000. I would suggest that serious consideration should be given to mounting water meters in the premises. John Graham, Quarry House, Heath Road, Brixham, Devon TQ5 9AU</p>

The three parties were also completely agreed as to the  latest initiatives for the resolution of the Bosnian conflict,  said ministry spokesman Richard Duque. He said this in  announcing that Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on Thursday night  talked on the telephone with U.S. State Secertary Warren  Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.    The spokesman, however, said nothing about France's proposal  for the U.N. to carry a resolution to place Sarajevo under U.N.  administration.    French media assert this proposal will not easily pass the  U.N. Security Council, knowing that Moscow apparently disfavours  it while Washington has not yet made up its mind.</p>

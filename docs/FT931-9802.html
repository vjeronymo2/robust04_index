			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Challenge over EC passport checks THE EUROPEAN Commission has been formally challenged to act on a specific complaint about continued passport controls in the EC's barrier-free internal market. Euro Citizen Action Service (Ecas), a lobby group, has asked the Commission to act urgently against the Dutch authorities for refusing to let a Dutch citizen board a ferry from Vlissingen to Sheerness in the UK without a passport. Ecas opened a telephone line in the first weeks of 1993 to gather comments about internal border controls, which it believes should have been lifted on January 1. It hopes to use the complaint of Mr Abraham Mooy, a Dutchman living in Belgium, as a test case against countries which have refused to lift such controls. For now, all 12 member states have continued passport checks on intra-EC travellers arriving at airports. Nine continental member states are trying to lift controls by year-end, but Britain, Denmark and Ireland are likely to maintain checks beyond then. Mr Mooy's complaint is against Dutch immigration authorities and officials of the shipping line, which refused to let him board the ferry on January 15. He had forgotten his passport and showed officials his Belgian identity card. The case could embarrass the new internal market commissioner, Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, who has said he does not want to provoke a confrontation with member states over passport checks.</p>

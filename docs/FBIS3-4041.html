If he continues to disregard exhortations, he will bear  all consequences rising therefrom.    At an appointment he made with German DER SPEIGEL reporter  Chou Chin-heng yesterday morning, Han Zuomin, deputy director of  the Information Department of the mainland Foreign Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, stated: Wei Jingsheng is a criminal released  on parole. According to law, foreign journalists are not allowed  to contact criminals released on parole. Han Zuomin went on to  say: He made the above remark on behalf of Wu Jianmin  [spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs].    It has been learned that the reporter of German nationality  was stationed in Beijing in 1990. After Wei Jinhsheng was  released from jail, the reporter got acquainted with him. In  early March this year, on the eve of U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's visit to Beijing, together with his wife of  Taiwanese origin and child, the reporter was interrogated by the  public security organ for an hour and a half. The next day, an  official from the Information Department of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs appeared personally to warn the reporter that,  according to law, contacting criminals released on parole is a  violation of law, and Wei Jingsheng is precisely such a  criminal. He hoped the reporter would understand the point.    Early yesterday morning, the mainland Ministry of Foreign  Affairs again summoned the reporter and warned him not to carry  out activities in violation of law by making use of his wife of  Taiwanese origin and son. Immediately after that, the reporter  issued the above report to various news agencies.</p>

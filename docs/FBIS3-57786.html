			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Lothar Ruehl: "A Step Toward NATO"] </F>   [Text] The prospect of Central Europe's association with  the Atlantic security area is opening up on the horizon of the  NATO summit early in 1994. Has a "window of favorable  opportunities" been opened -- as was the case in 1989 for  Germany's unification -- which could be closed again under the  pressure of internal developments in Russia? Or are stable  conditions emerging that could guarantee for Russia's western  neighbors independence in secure borders?    Boris Yeltsin suggested to the NATO states in October a  common security guarantee in "partnership" for the former USSR  allies as an alternative to their "selective admission" to the  alliance. But security partnership between NATO and the Russian  Federation is only one side of the problem to create stability  and security in the East. The other side is the relationship of  NATO with the countries that do not want to return to the  dangerous insecurity of an "interim Europe" (1919-39).    The consequence must not be -- as Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev warned -- "a new cordon sanitaire" to isolate Russia,  with a relapse into "bloc mentality." Vaclav Havel has adopted  a counterposition that is shared by Lech Walesa. Responding to  the thesis of Russian Intelligence Chief Primakov, who has said  that Russia would be threatened by "an advance of NATO's  military might to the Russian borders," Havel said that NATO's  coming closer to Russia's border would not mean that "an enemy  is approaching, but a sphere of democracy and stability."    The NATO Council will have to draft a strategy to create a  firm relationship of at least four East Central European states  with NATO and connect these with a more comprehensive peace  partnership that would include Russia. Without these two  connections -- that of East Central Europe with the Atlantic  security area and that of Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic states,  and southeastern Europe in a pan-European framework with NATO --  it will not be possible to set up a "security architecture" on  solid ground.    The NATO defense ministers have formulated the principles  for  the North Atlantic Council in this sense in four main points.  In this respect, the German concept that was expounded by  Volker Ruehe as the spokesman for the European group has been  generally accepted:    1. The enlargement of NATO must be seen as a political  principle in a process and must be opened up as a prospect,  without individual countries being mentioned as applicants, and  without a timeframe being set up.    2. The concept of Partnership for Peace is interpreted as a  useful first step but not as a substitute for subsequent  admission to NATO.    3. Russia will not be given the right of veto against the  admission of other European states to NATO or the Western  European Union [WEU]. Any consideration for legitimate Russian  security interests must be brought into line with the legitimate  security requirements of Russia's western neighbors.    4. Solving the problem through the association of Poland,  Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia with the WEU can only  be a temporary arrangement and interim step toward subsequent  NATO membership; it can be no substitute. Such an association  cannot be as close as that of the NATO members with the WEU,  which take part in common defense and are members of NATO's  military structures.    Moreover, an enlargement of the WEU would increase its  political importance outside NATO, instead of inside NATO as a  "European pillar" of the alliance. Should NATO refuse to open  up to the countries in the East, they will urge membership  within the WEU. The result would be an increasing  differentiation between NATO and the WEU, which now form a  closed alliance system. To the extent that countries would be  admitted to the WEU because NATO would remain closed to them,  both parts of the Western alliance would develop and move away  from each other. To the extent that the WEU would assume  functions for "broader security" in East Europe and take over  functions to "preserve peace" in Europe in crises by military  means, whereas NATO would remain passively in reserve, the  Atlantic alliance would lose in importance for European security  -- and the reason for the United States to get involved in the  defense of Western Europe would decrease as well. NATO cannot  split up into two treaty areas -- a security area of common  defense, and an area for security policy consultations --  without jeopardizing its unity.    Thus, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher demanded at  the NATO Council meeting on 2 December regarding the summit  statement to be adopted on 11 January 1994: "We should signal  that we are considering an evolutionary enlargement. Our most  important task will be to say how the alliance will be enlarged  to the East." He added: "It is true that Partnership for Peace  is an important step in itself, but it can also be a key act for  NATO membership."</p>

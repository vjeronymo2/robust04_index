			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: Brazil pins growth hopes on reforms - The Emerging Investor Brazil's volatile stock market has shown spectacular growth this year and, with a new currency bringing down inflation and a modernising new president about to take office, many analysts are tipping it as the star emerging market for 1995. They point to Brazil's economy of 157m potential consumers, a dynamic private sector operating at well below capacity and a stock market they regard as heavily undervalued when taking into account the country's growth potential. 'There's a lot of excitement at the prospect of Brazil returning to its heyday of the 1950s to 1970s when its annual growth rate averaged 7 per cent,' says Ms Emily McLaughlin, a director at London-based Foreign and Colonial Emerging Markets. Although trading has recently been sideways or down, the Sao Paulo stock market's selected index of the 55 most traded shares has appreciated by nearly 70 per cent this year thanks to optimism about the new Real currency, which has led to a sharp fall in inflation, and the prospect of economic reforms under future president Fernando Henrique Cardoso. But there are doubts. Some investors remember that a year ago Mexico's market was being touted as one of the great prospects for this year, but has instead fallen owing to a combination of political violence and poor company results. The prospects for Brazil's market, which had a capitalisation of Dollars 190bn at the end of October, depend on the introduction of economic reforms to provide a base for long term company earnings growth, say analysts. These reforms include tackling an unwieldy system of public finances, a complicated and inefficient tax system and a social security system facing severe funding problems as well as speeding up privatisation. There is little likelihood of quick progress early next year. Mr Cardoso, who takes office on January 1, is naturally cautious and will have to negotiate reforms with a new Congress which takes office in mid-February. Mr Robert J Pelosky, chief strategist at Morgan Stanley Latin America Research in New York, is sceptical about how quickly Brazil will move on reforms and he notes that the selected index has appreciated by about 300 per cent in the last two years, much of that due to expectations of economic stability. 'The easy money has been made in Brazil and next year the government will have to take some tough decisions. It will be a gradual process,' he says, adding that the Brazilian market is comparatively expensive, trading at 19 times estimated 1995 earnings. This scepticism appears to have been partly reflected by investors recently. Since Mr Cardoso was elected on October 3 the selected index has fallen by about 20 per cent due to profit-taking and the rise in international interest rates as well as investors' belief that the reform process will be slower than first expected and that privatisation of companies such as Telebras, the telecom holding group, and Petrobras, the oil company, are unlikely in the short term. The market has also been worried about the precariousness of some parts of the financial system during the current stabilisation. Two weeks ago the selected index fell 12 per cent after worries about a central bank liquidity squeeze, which has led to the liquidation of seven small banks since the Real was launched in July. A central bank announcement that it was relaxing the squeeze on smaller institutions helped calm investors. But trading has been flat. Average daily trading volume, including options, was Dollars 315m in November compared to more than Dollars 500m in September and October. Analysts say the market is waiting for Mr Cardoso to announce his reform proposals, including probable changes to the Constitution, and to evaluate the chances of their approval in the new Congress. Another uncertainty surrounds the future behaviour of foreign investors, who have been one of the motors of growth for the market. Last year net foreign investment in Brazil's capital markets, mainly in the stock market, was a record Dollars 5.5bn and that helped the selected index more than double in value. But in the first 10 months of this year the net inflow has been Dollars 3.4bn and few analysts expect a huge inflow of foreign capital early next year. Analysts point out that Brazil, like other emerging markets, has been hit by the turbulence in world interest rates this year. 'As usual Brazil is going against the tide. Just as international interest rates are attracting money away from emerging markets the country is about to implement reforms,' says Mr Roberto Serweczak, head of trading at brokers Barings in Sao Paulo. And Mr Pelosky notes that Brazil could be a target for profit-taking by overseas investors: 'Worldwide stock markets are under pressure and Brazil would be one of the obvious markets for profit-taking because of its gains this year.' A reduction in overseas portfolio investment could, however, please Brazil's central bank which has been concerned about a large inflow of foreign exchange contributing to an overvaluation of the Real. The new currency has appreciated by about 15 per cent against the dollar since its launch and although this has helped keep inflation down, by making imports cheaper, many Brazilian exporters are suffering. To signal its concern about dollar inflow the bank announced in October a 1 per cent financial operations tax on new foreign money brought into the stock market. Analysts believe the bank is unlikely to increase the tax unless there appears to be a serious threat to the Real's stability caused by a high dollar inflow. The government, say bankers, is keen to develop Brazil's stock market with the help of foreign investment and it will probably need overseas investors for its privatisation programme. Some analysts believe the only substantial sell off next year will be Light, the electricity company, although Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the iron ore mining giant, is a possibility. This lack of privatisation perspectives has led some investors to switch to second line private sector companies, particularly in consumer related areas expected to benefit from increased purchasing power following the fall in inflation. The trend has been reflected in the performance of the FGV-100 index, which tracks private sector non-bank shares. So far this year, and especially in the last three months, it has outperformed the selected index, which is dominated by government-controlled companies. The FGV was up 175 per cent in dollar terms at the end of November compared to a 71 per cent advance for the selected index.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Ten best performing stocks  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Friday    Week on week change Stock                       Country    2/12/94    Dollars     %  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Yapi Ve Kredi Bankasi       Turkey      0.1023     0.0327    46.90 Turk Demir Dokum            Turkey      0.2101     0.0571    37.35 Cukurova Elektrik           Turkey      0.2810     0.0571    25.47 Bagfas                      Turkey      0.2647     0.0489    22.65 Sui Gas North               Pakistan    1.4216     0.2459    20.91 Teletypos                   Greece      5.1150     0.8294    19.35 Michaniki                   Greece     14.9959     2.3261    18.36 Alarko Holding              Turkey      0.8322     0.1220    17.18 Grupo Financiero Banamex    Mexico      7.0400     0.8018    12.85 Brisa                       Turkey      0.2074     0.0216    11.64  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

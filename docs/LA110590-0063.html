			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BULGARIAN PIANIST DELIVERS AN UNCONVENTIONAL GRIEG  </P> <P> From the brutal opening chords of Juliana Markova's Grieg Piano Concerto, it  was clear that her approach to the familiar concerto would be anything but  conventional.  </P> <P> The Bulgarian pianist's muscular, high-voltage performance proved to be a great  crowd pleaser at the San Diego Symphony's Friday night Copley Symphony Hall  concert.  </P> <P> It was, however, an idiosyncratic view of Grieg that remained at odds with  custom and with the genial but disciplined direction of guest conductor Vernon  Handley. Markova was in the driver's seat, even though Handley held the baton  on the podium.  </P> <P> Markova demonstrated a wide range of keyboard techniques, including a seamless  legato and a refreshingly flexible sense of rubato in quieter sections. She is  a clearly virtuosa of formidable technique. But her shameless, thundering  fortes -- which made the orchestra's Steinway sound brittle and strident -- and  her willful distortion of the work's contours came close to caricature. The  distance between Grieg and Rachmaninoff is much greater than she imagines.  </P> <P> Handley redeemed the evening with a sympathetic, probing reading of Elgar's  First Symphony. A British conductor who was until recently the principal  conductor of the Ulster Orchestra, Handley has specialized in the music of his  fellow countrymen.  </P> <P> For the Elgar symphony he chose broad but unflagging tempos that kept the  work's inner tension clearly focused. The orchestra warmed to the composer's  dense textures and irregular motives, providing an appropriately burnished,  majestic sonority. Notable was the deep, covered timbre from the brass and  horns.  </P> <P> In a new configuration on stage, the strings displayed admirable blend and an  improved overall balance. Handley placed the second violins at the front of the  stage to his right, moving the cellos back to where the second violins usually  sit behind the first violins. This arrangement, unusual for today's orchestras  but not without historical precedent, deserves further testing.  </P> <P> Beethoven's Overture to "Prometheus" opened the concert on an uncertain note.  Fortunately, midway through the work, orchestra and conductor met on common  ground and pulled together for a respectable finale.  </P></p>

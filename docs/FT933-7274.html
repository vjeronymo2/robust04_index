			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Sales drive in Continental markets urged UK COMPANIES should start promoting sales in continental Europe following the recent widening of fluctuation margins in the European exchange rate mechanism, the Chartered Institute of Marketing says today. The institute, which represents marketing managers, says in its latest quarterly report that the effective suspension of the ERM will cause interest rates outside Germany to fall. Professor Douglas McWilliams, the institute's economic adviser, says in the report that Continental markets 'should stabilise over the next nine months and be growing by the second half of 1994' as a result. Prof McWilliams forecasts a general improvement in the world economy for 1994-95. He warns, however, that in the near term Britain's recovery may slow after a rapid start because of weakness in the UK's main European markets and likely government spending cuts and tax increases. The institute expects Britain's economy will grow by 2 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent a year in 1994 and 1995. Prof McWilliams says the risk of inflation damaging the UK economy in the near future is diminishing and scope exists for the government to cut interest rates if the economy slows. Institute forecasts anticipate a fall in bank base rates to 5 per cent by the end of this year from 6 per cent at present, and further declines to 4 per cent by the end of next year and 3 per cent at the end of 1995.

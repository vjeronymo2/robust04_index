			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> FISHERMEN TAKE CUES FROM DOLPHINS IN RARE PARTNERSHIP  </P> <P> In what may be a unique swapping of roles, a group of dolphins in a lagoon near  the southern tip of Brazil seem to be leading the local fishermen in a highly  successful cooperative fishing operation.  </P> <P> Historical accounts, going back to Pliny the Elder (AD 23-79), offer repeated  examples of joint dolphin-human efforts to trap mullet against beaches. In  these accounts, ranging from the Mediterranean to North Africa to Australia,  men on shore observe mullet traveling along the coast, too far to reach from  land. If dolphins happen to be passing, the men shout, whistle or slap the  water to attract the dolphins. If the dolphins then move toward shore, the  mullet are trapped, and men scoop or spear them in the shallows.  </P> <P> But these events, recorded centuries and continents apart, appear to have been  sporadic, opportunistic and seasonal examples of joint predation, associated  with the inshore movement of breeding mullet.  </P> <P> Not so in the 143-year-old dolphin-human fishery at Laguna. A complex  choreography has evolved in which the fishing is initiated and controlled by  the dolphins. And as such, the behavior may be unique.  </P> <P> The water at Laguna is extremely murky; visibility is less than a foot. The  fishermen cannot see the fish and must depend on the dolphin's behavior to know  when to cast their nets. The dolphins detect fish, round them up and deliver  them to waiting fishermen near the shore.  </P> <P> The fishing at Laguna occurs primarily on the shores of an inlet that extends  from the ocean to a brackish lagoon near the center of town. Fishermen and  townspeople said the fishing takes place all day, every day, except during bad  weather, and all year except in the Southern Hemisphere winter months of July  and August.  </P> <P> According to town records, the unusual arrangement began in 1847. Some  fishermen said their fathers and grandfathers fished with the dolphins,  sometimes with the same individual animals, many of them recognizable by marks  and scars. In at least one "family" of dolphins, three generations of  recognized animals are now working in the fishery.  </P> <P> While mullet are the main catch, other species taken include the Brazilian  croaker and the black drum. The catch is sold in nearby markets, and the  dolphin-associated fishery appears to be the primary source of income for about  100 families.  </P> <P> But this is strictly a business relationship. Like many joint ventures, there  is mutual respect but no obvious friendship between the partners.  </P> <P> Here's how the enterprise usually works:  </P> <P> The fishermen, each with a circular nylon throw-net rimmed with weights,  position themselves in a single line, a net's diameter apart, in knee-deep  water parallel to the shore. One or two dolphins station themselves several  yards outside the line of men, facing seaward, floating or moving slowly at the  surface. From time to time a dolphin submerges, usually moving seaward, and the  men ready themselves.  </P> <P> The dolphin reappears, usually in a few seconds, traveling toward the line of  men. It comes to an abrupt halt and dives just out of net range, 15 or 20 feet  from the line, making a surging roll at the surface that is quite different  from normal respiratory surfacings.  </P> <P> The men wait for the dolphin's signal and then cast their nets. Successful  fishermen return to the beach to harvest their catch, and others replace them  on the line.  </P> <P> The timing and placement of the net cast are crucial because refolding the nets  takes time and may cause a fisherman to miss a better opportunity.  </P> <P> Cues by the dolphins give the fishermen vital information. The timing of the  roll indicates that fish are present; the direction of the dolphin's movement  indicates the location of the fish, and the vigor of the movement appears to  tell whether the school is large or small.  </P> <P> And what's in this partnership for the dolphin? When the nets fall, the fish  schools lose their rhythm and cohesion and become easy prey. Individual  dolphins, including females with calves and at least one dolphin the fishermen  said was more than 70 years old, can catch mullet with minimal effort.  </P> <P> Successful fishing episodes are often followed by bouts of the dolphins'  feeding behavior. They dart about rapidly under water, wave their flukes in the  air and thrust their heads out of water, fish clenched in their jaws.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the human partners are profiting. In half an hour, a single dolphin  can bring fish to the line six times. In a typical dolphin fish delivery, one  or more fishermen will catch fish, typically 10 or more weighing up to 4 1/2  pounds each. One man in a boat, working with a single dolphin, can catch more  than 220 pounds of mullet in about two hours.  </P> <P> The fishing appears to be initiated and controlled by the dolphins. Fishermen  and their families often wait along the shore in hope of a dolphin's arrival,  and the process does not begin until a dolphin decides to start work.  </P> <P> Sometimes a working dolphin leaves the line of men and moves to another section  of beach; immediately the men run through the water to re-form a line in the  new site selected by the dolphin. One young male dolphin sometimes makes the  men move repeatedly, apparently for sport.  </P> <P> The fishermen do not call out, signal or attempt to affect the dolphins'  behavior, which sets this activity apart from the informal man-dolphin  interaction in other parts of the world where dolphins have been known to play  or socialize with swimmers and boaters.  </P> <P> The Laguna fishermen do not think they train the dolphins. They never give them  a fish. They do not attempt to touch them. Several fishermen said it is  important not to distract the dolphins from their work.  </P> <P> The participating animals have been named and recognized by many fishermen.  Even animals without obvious marks or scars can be identified by fishermen at a  distance of 160 feet or more.  </P> <P> Dolphins that are not in the partnership are called "bad" dolphins (ruim in  Portuguese). The ruim may occasionally interfere with the fishing, typically by  dispersing fish and by damaging nets. Dolphins in the partnership were reported  by fishermen to be aggressive in defending the fishery. And the fishermen said  they believe the "good" dolphins stay close to their work, being mostly  resident in the lagoon.  </P> <P> Although the human-dolphin cooperative fishing has long been part of daily life  in Laguna, the situation is fragile. Tourism and increasing industry in the  state of Santa Catarina are luring fishermen's sons into construction work and  taxi-driving.  </P> <P> Working dolphins have been drowned in commercial fishing nets offshore, and  attempts to widen or deepen the lagoon entrance, to accommodate vessel traffic,  might destroy the principal fishing beaches. Scientists hope to work with  Brazilian environmental organizations to protect this unique example of human  and animal cooperation.  </P></p>

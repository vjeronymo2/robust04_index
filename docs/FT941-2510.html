			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / US clears way for Asian bank's capital increase Negotiations on a capital increase of more than Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.4bn) for the Asian Development Bank could be completed in the next few months, after the US agreed to the injection of funds. Finance ministers from the 18-nation Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum agreed in Honolulu this weekend on the need for the ADB to double its capital resources - an increase which would amount to about Dollars 23bn. 'A consensus on doubling the capital is in the making,' said Mr Hirohisa Fujii, Japan's finance minister, after the Apec meeting. The Manila-based bank's lending for development projects in the Asia region is limited by its statutes to the total of its callable capital and reserves. It has already run close to that limit and, with new borrowing members such as the former Soviet republics of central Asia on board, it is expected to have to trim lending this year. But the US has been in arrears on its current obligations to the ADB, and the Clinton administration, besides facing tight budget constraints, has only recently been convinced by the ADB's efforts to reform its operations to agree to the capital injection. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said: 'We look forward to the concluding negotiations for a general capital increase for the Asian Development Bank. It will mean more than Dollars 20bn for this region, doubling the bank's resources.' The US and Japan are the largest shareholders in the ADB, with about 16 per cent each. Only a small percentage of the capital increase would have to be paid up, reducing the budgetary cost for each to an estimated Dollars 40m. The US also faces a larger payment for a Dollars 40bn capital increase at the Inter-American Development Bank. Apec moves: page 5</p>

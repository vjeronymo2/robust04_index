			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Passengers say new trains create strain BRITISH RAIL'S new Networker trains, intended to bring relief to the 130,000 commuters using Network SouthEast's poorly performing Kent Link suburban services, look in danger of running into ingratitude. Many who have sampled the 'state-of-the-art' trains on trial runs say they are cramped and some say they are worse than the 40-year-old 'slam-door' trains they are due to replace.

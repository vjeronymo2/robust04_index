Payments to the Defense Ministry are constantly  being delayed. The government's debts to the suppliers of  defense production and the military are growing all the time.  At present, they stand at 3 trillion rubles. In  February-March, 70 percent of servicemen did not receive their  money allowances. If the current pattern of financing the  industry, including defense enterprises, remains unchanged,  there will be no hope to receive the revenues that are planned  in the draft budget.    Approving the second-quarter budget in accordance with the  estimates presented by the Finance Ministry, Mr. Kokoshin  believes, would only exacerbate the critical situation regarding  budget revenues; as a result, not only the Defense Ministry and  the defense industry, but the entire budget sector of the  Russian economy will disintegrate.    The Defense Ministry stands first of all for purposeful,  joint efforts by the executive and legislative branches aimed at  increasing the budget revenues. The government and the State  Duma need to approve a list of emergency measures to lend  substance to the budget's revenue part in a realistic fashion.  In that regard Mr. Kokoshin thinks it necessary: to resolve  the problems of enterprises' mutual debts by using commodities  and financial bills of exchange; to make a one-time investment  of money in the industry to restart the industries that have  suspended production; and to pass legislation tightening  punishment for tax evasion.    If these measures are taken everyone will be better off,  including the Defense Ministry, Andrey Kokoshin said. If the  current situation with regard to budget revenues is preserved,  social turmoil and an irreparable collapse of the domestic  industry are inevitable.</p>

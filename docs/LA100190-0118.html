			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INDIA'S HIGH COURT CALLS HALT TO JOB QUOTA PLAN  </P> <P> India's Supreme Court today ordered the government to halt its job quota  program. The court said it hopes its temporary injunction will stop a wave of  student protests and suicides.  </P> <P> The five-judge panel also advanced the date for hearing arguments on the  legality of the program by two weeks, to Oct. 25, Press Trust of India  reported.  </P> <P> The court said the government could continue preparations for carrying out the  plan, which reserves 27% of federal jobs for low-caste Hindus.  </P> <P> The government is assembling a list of thousands of castes that will qualify  for preference in job applications. Another 22% already are set aside for the  lowest strata in the rigid hierarchy of Indian society -- tribespeople and the  so-called untouchables.  </P> <P> Acting Chief Justice Ranganath Mishra said he hopes peace will be restored  while the issue is being studied by the court.  </P> <P> In the northern town of Jammu, 17-year-old student Sandeep Sharma set himself  on fire today in the latest suicide bid to protest the job quotas. He suffered  third-degree burns.  </P> <P> At least 70 persons have died in demonstrations against the plan. About 20 were  upper-caste students who committed suicide by self-immolation or poisoning  after claiming they were victimized by the plan.  </P> <P> Prime Minister V. P. Singh announced the policy Aug. 7 to increase the quota  for low-caste Indians in government jobs to 49%, saying he was seeking social  justice for Indians discriminated against because of the social station of  their birth.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lome, 26 May (AFP) -- Togolese Prime Minister Edem  Kodjo's party, the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD], today  expressed its "satisfaction" at the formation of the new  government on 25 May. The UTD holds three out of the 19  ministerial posts. In a communique, it reaffirmed that it  belonged to the "parliamentary majority" which is made up of six  UTD and 34 Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] parliamentarians.    The CAR has fallen out with Prime Minister Edem Kodjo and  refused to join the cabinet. It rejects the premier's claim of  belonging to the "parliamentary majority."    In addition to the three UTD ministers, the new cabinet  includes eight "independent" parliamentarians and eight  ministers who are close allies of President Gnassingbe Eyadema.    The UTD implicitly called on CAR to rescind its decision  saying the first priority now was to "fill the political vacuum  and put an end to country's social and economic ruin." The  party was pleased that it was an open government, in which "the  people are broadly represented by ministers chosen on the basis  of competence and efficiency."    Just as Premier Edem Kodjo stated yesterday, the UTD also  expressed its determination to implement the government policy  formulated in collaboration with the CAR.</p>

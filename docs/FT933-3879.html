			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Shame about the high prices JAPANESE consumers will from next month be able to compare officially vetted import cost prices with astronomically high retail prices. The move is part of the new government's drive to encourage consumers' interests in a country traditionally run with reference to producers' lobby groups. It is among a series of measures under preparation for inclusion in an economic stimulus package later this month, to lean on companies to pass on the benefits of the yen's strength to consumers. Finance ministry officials say they will soon publish monthly lists of average importers' cost prices of 20 basic goods, such as meat, fruit and whisky. The aim is to shame distributors into dropping prices, when consumers learn of the huge profit margin usually added to imported goods during their journey through many layers of middlemen between warehouse and shop. A box of imported US nappies, for example, bought in central Tokyo last week, cost Y2,000 (Pounds 12.26) while 200 grammes of Parmesan cheese could be had - on special offer - at a local supermarket for Y900 yesterday morning. This could hasten the growth of discount stores, selling clothing, food and electrical goods, which have emerged in Tokyo in recent years. Welcomed by bargain-hunters, the new stores are even becoming fashionable.</p>

This is not a symbolic fact.  Robaina, Cuba's foreign minister, is a frontrunner. He speaks in  a fresh language and has a very personal style he calls  "impromptu diplomacy."    Playing with words and exhibiting his permanent good sense  of  humor, Robaina says he is not a "career diplomat." He was  appointed to the post approximately a year ago at a time of very  serious economic difficulties in Cuba.    Since then he has tested his capabilities, "immediately  aware  of the importance of a duty by which we open the world's doors  to become part of a new international political format, in  particular, to tell our truth in our own voice."    I followed him through Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and  Vietnam,  and finally, in what was supposed to be a relaxing interview but  what became a maze of ideas by an interlocutor impressively  ready for a dialogue.    Discussing many matters at the end of his tour through eight  Asian countries was the reward he gave me for my tenacious  effort to secure an exclusive interview for PRENSA LATINA.    Cuba's economic crisis looked to me as the best option for  the first question.    [Robaina] It is true the situation is still difficult and  that it will take big efforts to find adequate solutions to our  project, but I am pleased to say the worst is over. The crisis  hit rock bottom and we are now in a launch phase. We see the  light at the end of the tunnel. We are moving with greater  security.    [Triana] In this new light, what economic options does the  Cuban Government have?    [Robaina] A group of measures have been adopted and other  measures are being discussed to revitalize the economy without  renouncing the fundamental achievements of the Revolution.  Openings to foreign investments have developed, our foreign  relations have been diversified, and we continue developing, in  spite of the huge pressure from the U.S. blockade, which also  boycotts every effort Cuba makes to initiate negotiations and  pressures those who want to invest in our island.    [Triana] Is there any change of attitude in the current U.S.  Administration with regard to Cuba?    [Robaina] The United States is now using a less aggressive  language, but we know that internal mechanisms will keep  Washington from changing its attitude toward our country even if  it has this intention. Therefore we do not see, for example, any  surprise lifting of the embargo. We are prepared to negotiate,  as we have often said, on the basis of respect for our  independence and sovereignty, and the right our 35-year-old  Revolution gave us to speak out.    [Triana] Ever since you became foreign minister, you have  worked on a very intense diplomatic offensive throughout the  world. What is the object of this policy?    [Robaina] To explain the truth of our plan, to listen to the  economic experiences of many other countries that have had  successful results in that field, and to explore all the  cooperation possibilities. Latin America and the Caribbean are a  priority. This is the setting from which we were removed and the  setting we are recovering. We are talking now in terms of a  diplomatic offensive because we are tired of sitting on the  defendant's bench.    [Triana] What does your tour through Indonesia, Thailand,  Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam mean?    [Robaina] In this region of the world, there have been  significant economic transformations, and we are interested in  analyzing and learning from them to apply in Cuba whatever may  be applicable. We want to directly report on our openings to  foreign investments and announce our aspirations to have  mutually beneficial cooperation and exchanges in all possible  fields.    [Triana] Any comment on your Asian tour?    [Robaina] It was successful because we found respect and  understanding, unanimous condemnation of the U.S. blockade  against Cuba, and the possibilities of economic cooperation.  Vietnam deserves special mention. This is a dear country that  after going through big sacrifices and challenges was able to  build a road to development without renouncing its socialist  principles.    We applaud what Vietnam is doing and its achievements  encourage us tremendously. We also celebrate the end of the  economic embargo to which it was unjustly subjected by the  United States. We are closely following the Vietnamese process  and once again thank this heroic people for their specific  solidarity with Cuba and their decision to comply with this  year's trade agreement.    [Triana] You return to Havana and almost immediately begin  another tour through Latin America including Peru, Argentina,  Uruguay, and Paraguay, after the 22-24 April meeting with  representatives of the Cuban community abroad, and this is  followed by a tour of Arabian countries. Is it your youth which  allows you to tackle so many tasks in a row?    [Robaina] Fortunately, in Cuba we work with a group spirit.  It is a great responsibility to be foreign minister right now,  and success mostly depends on the officials who accompany me. We  have a large group that is very well prepared, technically  speaking, and personally speaking, since I am young I am  compelled to try to represent the new generations as best I can.    [Triana] The international media said the call for "The  Nation and the Immigrant Community" meeting in Cuba is an  audacious step taken by the island's government. What is the  purpose of that meeting?    [Robaina] We invited Cubans who live in the United States,  Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, the Caribbean, and other  places and who are willing to participate in a dialogue with  their homeland. We did not invite hysteria or aggressiveness,  but some of those who were not invited to the meeting hastened  to reject an invitation that was not extended. Our goal is to  normalize relations with the Cuban community abroad, as is done  by all countries in the world.    [Triana] People in Cuba and abroad talk about Robaina's  youth. You greatly impressed your Cambodian counterpart, Prince  Norodom Sirivuth, during your Far East tour. In Cambodia like in  the rest of the countries he visited, the head of Havana's  diplomacy made an unusual request for this kind of trip: a  bicycle. The Cambodian prince was so enthusiastic that he went  an early morning ride through Phnom Penh with the Cuban envoy.  "In barely 24 hours, we got to know each other so well that I  felt duty bound to visit Havana this year," Sirivuth commented.    [Robaina] The most important news in my country is not a  young minister, but the essential role young Cubans have in the  country's economic, political, and social development. In other  words, the place they have earned. As far as I am concerned, my  goal is to constantly hold consultations on a wider scale with  the people I represent.    [Triana] What advise would you give your generation?    [Robaina] I do not believe I am in a position to give  advise.  I believe each generation has to face -- in its place and under  its own conditions -- the role it has to play. Nevertheless, if  you insist on asking that question, I would tell the young  people: The most important thing is not to resign yourself to  what has been done. New generations should not settle for what  has been done and they should not talk only about history and  what was done; they should make their own history, a  contemporary history.    [Triana] How can you possibly take on so many tasks and  still  have time for the family?    [Robaina] It requires a personal effort to find time during  the day so I can, for example, take time in the morning to get  my son ready to go to school or to take him bicycle riding on  the weekend, and talk with him. My family has its own  responsibilities. A housewife's tasks are as difficult as a  minister's tasks in Cuba.</p>

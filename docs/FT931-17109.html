			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Letter: Inflation factor that makes early leavers the big pensions losers Sir, Re Alan Smallbone's letter (December 30), I believe adequacy of pensions is more significant than security. Deferred members of defined benefits schemes subsidise schemes, via inflation, to provide promised benefits for the few who reach retirement with the same company. You have reported a well-known insurance company as calculating the shortfall for early leavers to be equivalent to a 70 per cent increase in combined contributions to company schemes. I calculate that, nationally, the loss caused by inflation is about Pounds 20bn a year for early leavers. Many deferred pensioners joined schemes as a condition of service. One can draw one's own conclusions on the ethics of such schemes and government reluctance to act decisively to end completely the anomaly created by inflation.

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House Today's auction of the rump of Trafalgar House's rights issue marks a radical departure for the London equity market. By turning its back on the established system - whereby shares are placed with institutions at a discount to the market price - Swiss Bank Corporation has attracted brickbats. Such placings have long been a source of cheap stock for institutional investors and means of patronage for stockbrokers. As a relative newcomer to the London market with a run of aggressive deals to its credit, Swiss Bank is already out of favour with corporate financiers of the old school. But if the auction results in shares being sold closer to the market price, Trafalgar's shareholders - even those who declined to take up their rights - stand to benefit. The main reason for caution in principle is that auctioning a very large rump of shares from a badly failed rights issue could arguably result in a more volatile market than the old softly-softly system. Since Trafalgar's share price has risen by more than 25 per cent in the last month, though, the rump is likely to be modest. If that turns out to be the case, the proof of the pudding will be in the price.</p>

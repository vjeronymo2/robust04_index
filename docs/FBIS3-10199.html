			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Colombia's economic developments monitored through 1  March 1994.    Revenues from income taxes, the VAT [Value-Added Tax], and  foreign trade increased by 44 percent in 1993 following the  implementation of the tax reform law passed in 1992. The  Treasury collected 400 billion pesos during the first half of  February and expects to collect 200 million pesos in the third  week. The treasury placed a sizable portion of the collected  funds in securities to prevent instability in the financial  system.

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa to spin off businesses Lufthansa is to spin off its cargo, aircraft maintenance and information technology services into three independent profit centres with effect from January 1, Germany's flag-carrier airline said yesterday. Announcing the final stages of a 'life-saving' re-organisation started three years ago, the airline said EDS, the General Motors subsidiary, would take a 25 per cent stake in, and share management control of, the information subsidiary, Lufthansa Systems. The new business would be launched with a contract worth up to DM300m (Dollars 194.8m) to supply Lufthansa with all its information technology resources for at least three years, EDS said. As with the other new companies, Lufthansa Cargo and Lufthansa Technik, it would also be expected to develop profit sources outside the group, aiming to provide 'packaged' services to the travel and transport industries. As a legally independent company, Lufthansa Technik would have a 'good chance' to keep its place in a market currently characterised by over-capacity, newcomers and mergers, according to the airline's internal newspaper. Heavy cost pressure could only be offset by more flexibility than allowed within the group organisation, it added. The cargo company would absorb all the group's interests in the sector, including a 25 per cent stake in DHL and a similar holding in the Luxembourg Cargolux Airlines. Lufthansa AG, the holding company, will concentrate on mainstream passenger airline business and provide central management to the group, which also includes the Condor charter flight and LSG catering businesses. Yesterday's announcement comes days before subscriptions open on Tuesday for a rights issue marking the start of an important phase in the airline's privatisation. The Bonn government, which owns 51.4 per cent of Lufthansa, will not take up its rights, therefore diluting its stake to little over 40 per cent. Mr Jurgen Weber, chairman since September 1991 and driving force behind the restructuring, said the spin-offs were intended to encourage entrepreneurial behaviour and increase awareness of customers' needs. He expected group turnover to grow by up to 5 per cent a year until 1997, and has set his sights on lifting Lufthansa's share of the European market from 16.7 per cent now to more than 20 per cent. Meanwhile, there will be further cuts in the workforce, and management is working on building up its network of alliances. The airline was 'still good for a few surprises', Mr Weber said. In a presentation to analysts and press, he claimed productivity had risen 31 per cent in the two years to June this year. The workforce had been cut 17 per cent and unit costs, by 15 per cent.</p>

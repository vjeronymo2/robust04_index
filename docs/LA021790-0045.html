			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANT OF THE WEEK: GARDENING;  </P> <P> RUMEX SCUTATUS, FRENCH SORREL  </P> <P> Perennial herb with tender leaves and clusters of small red flowers.  </P> <P> French sorrel's complex sour flavor is the main component in a classic French  soup and several sauces, and this alone is reason enough to grow it. Another:  Sorrel is rarely if ever found on supermarket shelves, being quite perishable.  And still another: It grows in Southern California with little water and less  care.  </P> <P> Sorrel isn't the most beautiful herb in the garden; the rather plain,  light-green leaves look like large arrowheads, offering no subtleties of  coloration or shading. Sorrel just sits there, a pleasant mound that will  eventually reach about two feet in height and in diameter. For gardeners in  frost-free areas, sorrel is constant, providing the cook with abundant leaves  throughout the year from the coolest winter to the hottest summer.  </P> <P> Sorrel is related to a wild herb called wild sorrel (Rumex obtusifolius) or  dock. The wild version has coarser leaves and a more bitter taste. The common  culinary species, Rumex acetosa, requires a moist, semi-shaded location. French  sorrel is the one that can take heat and drought. If you have tried  unsuccessfully to grow sorrel from seed, you may have been sowing common sorrel  seeds; many seed companies just sell "sorrel" without any qualifier.  </P> <P> Once you have located the seeds, plant them indoors in potting soil or outdoors  in the garden any time between now and the end of March. Don't let them dry out  because they don't become drought-tolerant until maturity.  </P> <P> Be sure to thin the plants when they start to crowd each other, and continue  thinning until plants are at least 1 foot apart. Put transplants in the garden  when they're about 3 inches tall.  </P> <P> Unless you are addicted to cream of sorrel soup, you probably won't need more  than two plants. But then, sorrel's leaves and flowers make a greenish-yellow  dye, and one book claims that a strong infusion of these leaves will clean your  linen, wicker and silver, although I have not tried this. Maybe you'll want  several plants.  </P> <P> * Taylor's Herb Gardens Inc., 1535 Lone Oak Road, Vista, Calif. 92084  (catalogue $1) offers both acetosa and scutatus seeds; they also have French  sorrel plants.  </P> <P> * Nichols Garden Nursery, 1190 N. Pacific Highway, Albany, Ore. 97321  (catalogue free) has the Rumex acetosa seeds that grow like scutatus. JUDITH  SIMS  </P></p>

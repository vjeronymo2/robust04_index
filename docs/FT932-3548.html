			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Labour warns of skill shortages SKILL SHORTAGES represent a 'ticking bomb' under economic recovery, according to a survey of Training and Enterprise Councils published by the Labour party today. The survey was prepared by Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour's industry spokesman. He said that an analysis of labour market information showed: Skill shortages represented a real constraint on economic recovery. Employers are already facing difficulty in recruiting appropriately skilled people in certain occupations. The basic skills of school leavers were causing employer discontent. Several other recent surveys have pointed to skill shortages. West London Tec last week published a report on information technology and said there was a shortage of appropriately skilled people. Mr Fatchett said Tecs were already warning that skill shortages represented a constraint on sustained indus-trial recovery and that such shortages were most likely to emerge in engineering and high-technology sec-tors. He said: 'Without a concerted effort from the government industrial recovery could be choked off by skill constraints before it has hardly begun.' The survey quoted labour market assessments by several Tecs. Centec, which covers central London, said in its latest survey: 'What is clear is that, with current staffing levels pared to the minimum, once businesses start to prosper again the shift from staff cutbacks to staff shortages, particularly in the clerical and secretarial area, will happen very quickly.' The National Council for Educational Technology, a body funded by the Department for Education, is today launching a campaign to persuade young women to take up careers in information technology.</p>

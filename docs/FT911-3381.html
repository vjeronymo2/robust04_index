			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Big Apple apartment workers' strike bites THE streamlined city lifestyle of thousands of New Yorkers has been thrown into turmoil this week. From the most high-toned Park Avenue apartment blocks to hovels in Hell's Kitchen, residents are confronting a strike by 30,000 building service workers. This is no joking matter. Jobs done by striking employees - members of Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International - range from internal rubbish collection to building maintenance. Many doormen, security guards, lift operators and caretakers have joined the strike. At issue is a new wage contract. Neither side has been forthcoming about the negotiations, but at the weekend, when the strike began, the union claimed that the building owners, represented by the Realty Advisory Board on Labour Relations, were offering wage increases of only 2 per cent a year over three years. Even so, the strike seemed to take some union members by surprise. 'The first I knew about it was when we were called out on Sunday,' said one doorman. To date, the dispute seems to have been largely good-humoured. Good doormen are a valuable commodity in New York, and those residents inclined to whinge are careful to do so out of the strikers' earshot. Many apartment blocks, meanwhile, quickly instigated temporary arrangements, asking residents to take out their own rubbish. Even in extreme situations, it seems commonsense prevails: two striking Fifth Avenue doormen were reported to have abandoned their picket-line yesterday to rescue a maid who had set fire to her wealthy employer's apartment with an overheated iron. How the dispute will be resolved is unclear. The union claims that many building owners are settling individually, saying that these numbers now run into three figures. The owners claim that this trend is being over-played and that the number of individual settlements is much less. In the meantime, New Yorkers can only grit their teeth and put out the rubbish.</p>

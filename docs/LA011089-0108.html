			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COVINA MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO SETTING FOREST FIRES  </P> <P> A Covina man pleaded guilty in Los Angeles federal court Monday to setting two  fires that destroyed more than 12,800 acres of the San Bernardino National  Forest.  </P> <P> James Lonczak, a carpenter and handyman for the Monrovia-based international  relief organization World Vision, admitted throwing lighted cigarettes attached  to matches into the brush near Lytle Creek on at least two occasions last year.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors have said a total of 24 fires were set under similar  circumstances during a three-month period last summer.  </P> <P> In one case, Assistant U.S. Atty. Adam B. Schiff said, Lonczak was photographed  by U.S. Forest Service video cameras driving into and leaving the area near a  35-acre blaze on Aug. 27.  </P> <P> Lonczak also has admitted touching off a brush fire in the Texas Hills region  north of Rancho Cucamonga that eventually burned 12,800 acres and destroyed a  home, several garages and cars.  </P> <P> In a statement to U.S. District Judge John G. Davies, Lonczak said he drove  about half a mile into Lytle Creek Canyon on Aug. 27, made a U-turn, then threw  out a burning cigarette with a match attached to it. Lonczak said he started  the Sept. 28 Texas Hills blaze in a similar manner.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Lindsay Weston refused to comment on why Lonczak started the  fires.  </P> <P> Lonczak faces up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine when he is sentenced  Feb. 27. He also could be liable for restitution to cover the government's  estimated $2.1 million in firefighting and reseeding costs.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. RELATIONS WITH CHINA  </P> <P> The official party line given by the Chinese authority for the brutal crackdown  on the democracy movement has been the necessity to restore social stability so  that economic reform and business ties with the outside world can continue.  Deng Xiaoping obviously believes that he can cut off Western reporters, kill  and imprison Chinese who believe in Western democratic values, and at the same  time, attract Western businessmen and tourists to spend money in China.  </P> <P> In deciding to order the murderous assault on the students, Deng must have  figured that his old friend President Bush would put American business  interests ahead of American principles, and business with the United States  would remain as usual. The reluctance of the Bush Administration to go any  further than symbolic gestures and halting minor military sales might have been  the confirmation Deng was waiting for.  </P> <P> To continue trade with China would strengthen the hands of the progressive wing  in China, some Administration officials argued. But for the past 10 years,  trade with China did strengthen the hand of Deng Xiaoping, whom we thought to  be the most progressive leader in China, and we saw how he used that strength  against the people. Further sanctions would only hurt the Chinese people,  President Bush insisted. But without serious threat to his economic program,  Deng has nothing to worry about in his relentless effort to suppress the  Chinese people.  </P> <P> In this time of turmoil, it is certainly prudent to keep all diplomatic  channels open, but we must also call into question the economic policies that  benefit the unpopular rulers in China.  </P> <P> In this country, we witnessed the efforts of the Jewish community to focus our  government's attention on the plight of Soviet Jews and the economic pressure  by the U.S. did help change the Soviet treatment of Jews. The black community  is doing the same for the blacks in South Africa. As the outcry from  Chinese-Americans can be heard across the country, can we expect some  sympathetic consideration from Washington?  </P> <P> CHARLES WOO  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRADING PLACES: LOS ALAMITOS, NOT SERVITE, IS THE TEAM TO BEAT  </P> <P> Most seasons, a game against Servite High School would be the highlight of Los  Alamitos' schedule. It's a chance to play one of the powerhouses of Orange  County football, a chance to draw a big crowd and attract a lot of headlines,  particularly if the Griffins could pull off an upset victory.  </P> <P> But this season, Los Alamitos is the top-ranked team in the county. The  Griffins' roster is filled with high-profile players. They're the ones drawing  all the attention this time around.  </P> <P> On the other side of the line scrimmage will be a Servite team that has a new  coach and a cast of young, unproven players. The teams meet in the county's  featured game at 7:30 tonight at Gahr High in Cerritos and it's Servite that  will be hoping for an upset.  </P> <P> "It's a pretty big game for both of us," Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes said.  "It gives them something to really shoot for. If the shoe was on the other  foot, it would be the same way. I'm sure they're using this as a great  motivating factor, as a stepping stone to a great season. I'm sure a win for  them would be a great feather in Coach (Larry) Toner's cap."  </P> <P> Servite opened its first season with Toner as coach with a 21-0 victory over  Long Beach Wilson.  </P> <P> Toner, an assistant at Servite during the 1960s, '70s and '80s, had missed out  on the Friars' recent tradition. He was coaching in Portland before moving back  to Servite this season.  </P> <P> He never saw Derek Brown run with the ball or linebacker Garrett Greedy chase  down a ballcarrier.  </P> <P> "I don't really know what I missed," Toner said. "There's no point of  reference."  </P> <P> But Toner's been pleased by what he has seen so far this season.  </P> <P> Running back Mike Wallock rushed for 55 yards, caught four passes for 28 more  and scored a touchdown last week. The Friar defense held Wilson to 117 yards in  offense.  </P> <P> "I liked the fact that the boys didn't have exceptional first-game jitters,  especially with a new staff," Toner said. "A lot of boys played varsity  football for the first time. There were a lot of big, big question marks. I was  pleased with how they did the first time out."  </P> <P> Los Alamitos also had an easy opening night, beating Marina, 42-22. Quarterback  Todd Gragnano passed for 280 yards and three touchdowns and ran for another.  </P> <P> The Griffin defense, led by defensive lineman Hart Brown, looked better than  Barnes had anticipated.  </P> <P> "We were a little better on defense than I thought we'd be," Barnes said. "It's  the youngest defense we've had. We have a lot juniors and sophomores. We were a  lot quicker and tougher than I thought. That was a pleasant surprise."  </P> <P> Other games at 7:30 tonight:  </P> <P> Foothill (0-1) vs. Woodbridge (1-0) at Irvine High: Foothill started the regime  of Coach Marty McWhinney by losing, 17-6, to Tustin, its bitter cross-town  rival. The Knights lost four fumbles and gained just 115 yards. Woodbridge made  Coach Gene Noji's return from a one-year sabbatical a successful one as the  Warriors beat San Clemente, 24-12. Quarterback Gary Fishel, who threw for 142  yards, is a key to the Warriors' fortunes.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach (1-0) vs. Pacifica (0-0-1) at Bolsa Grande High: Huntington  Beach, which upset defending Southern Section Division VIII champion Corona del  Mar, looks as if its going to be a contender in the tough Sunset League. The  Oilers won just two games last season, but with players like running backs Doug  Cunningham and Kelly Cotton, there is a renewed excitement at Huntington Beach.  Pacifica was tied, 14-14, in its opener by Santa Ana Valley. Quarterback Bobby  Anderson, who threw for 185 yards and two touchdowns last week, is one Pacifica  player to keep an eye on.  </P> <P> Santa Ana (1-0) vs. Saddleback (0-1) at Santa Ana Stadium: This is a battle for  Santa Ana city bragging rights and is one of the harder-hitting nonleague games  you will see. Santa Ana got its season off to fast start, but nearly blew a  21-8 halftime lead. Oscar Wilson, a defensive lineman, is one of the best  football players in Orange County this season. Saddleback is looking for an  upset after losing its opener, 24-7, to Ocean View.  </P> <P> Sonora (1-0) at Valencia (1-0): Sonora hasn't been very good in the in the  1980s, but after the first week of play anyway, the Raiders have a winning  record. Linebacker Scott Sanders, who returned a blocked punt for a touchdown  in last week's 21-18 victory over Northview, is a Division I college prospect.  The Raiders face stiffer competition this week. Valencia's tradition of  hard-nosed teams appears as if it will continue again this season. The Tigers  defeated Bellflower, 35-6, last week. Richard Wells' debut at quarterback was a  smash as he completed 12 of 17 passes for 158 yards.  </P></p>

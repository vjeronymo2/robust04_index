			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (14): Unravelling the nightmare - The Pacific Rim / The eastward-bound stampede When Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's global strategist, turned maximum bullish on Asian markets, he sparked an eastward-bound stampede into a part of the world which was ill prepared for floods of foreign money. Paper-based systems buckled, bottlenecks expanded and, in some cases, custodians caught in the middle were forced to close their doors to new business. As Darwin Doo, director of institutional services with Standard Chartered Equitor Group, says: 'The good fortune of markets turns out to be a nightmare for custodians.' Standard Chartered Equitor Group, like Hongkong Bank, operates in the region as a sub-custodian handling on-the- ground execution for the globals who do not themselves have an agency network, such as State Street. 'If it is a paper-based market, then as a sub-custodian you are always vulnerable to sudden increases because those markets are less efficient. In other places where there is a central depository, such as Hong Kong and Thailand, it is relatively easy to absorb large volumes,' says Jeremy Davies, senior manager for Asia Pacific Securities Services at Hongkong Bank. On the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange, turnover on April 15 1993, just before the boom, was a typical USDollars 0.96bn. Less than a year later, during the peak at January 5, it had surged to USDollars 2.02bn - higher than Wall Street. Equitor Group was closed to new business in Malaysia for six months, after expanding the local staff base to 225 at the peak (in March this year) from 45 at the beginning of 1993. Citibank, after closing its doors in Malaysia, is now open on a selective basis. Even worse problems were encountered in India, where a USDollars 250,000 deal can translate into a truckload of scrip, bringing an 'unduly high' degree of risk to the custodian and his clients. Says David Handmaker, vice-president at JP Morgan in Hong Kong: 'The western institutions are the most demanding investors the Asian markets have met. They invest huge amounts of money, they come from mature markets and expect things to look as clean and as easy through the global custodian on a new market as happens on the stock exchanges of New York or London. Their job is to seek returns and they cannot sit and wait for custodians to make the markets efficient.' But the markets are becoming more efficient, as governments - often advised by the custodians - seek to eliminate the problems of the past years. In the Philippines briefs have already gone out to tender and Indonesia plans to move to a central depository system starting from the middle of next year. In Kuala Lumpur automation is already under way. Other Asian markets were quicker off the mark, including Hong Kong, Thailand, Taiwan and Sri Lanka, which last put in fully automated and clearing systems before the floods of money came rushing in. Among the emerging markets, China scores highest in terms of efficiency as the country's two exchanges started life with scripless systems. Custodians such as Citibank worked with the stock exchange in Shanghai to devise processes and procedures when it set up its central depository. Christine Tam, vice-president of Citibank in Hong Kong, says: 'In China we sat down with the stock exchange officials and went through the procedures with them and explained international investors' perspective and perception of risk. Then we helped develop a system to box in those risks. This is the advantage of China over a paper-based system - it started with a blank piece of paper, so there was not masses of paper, registrars or existing processes to work with.' A further demonstration of the global custodians' role in weaning emerging markets towards maturity came when the Malaysian central bank, in a bid to quell speculation in the ringgit, insisted foreign banks with big ringgit deposits pay a reserve on those deposits - a move tantamount to telling foreign depositors their money would earn negative 3 per cent interest. For the banks who were holding cash on behalf of investors waiting to buy stock this was a nightmare. Mr Handmaker says it was down to the global custodians to explain the situation to investors, to absorb the 3 per cent levy, and to sit down with officials of Bank Negara and explain that not all deposits added up to currency speculation, but were instead a symptom of the settlement system then operating in Kuala Lumpur. The flip side of greater sophistication and automation in emerging markets is that new entrants are enticed in and customers expect to pay less for the custodians' services. Competition in Asia has grown, and custodians talk of pitches where the contract is carried off by the manager quoting zero fees (looking to earn his living from added services such as stock lending). Mr Doo says: 'From what people are saying in the market place, there might be a big shake-out among the big global custodians in the coming two years. There are just too many competitors.' For the global custodians it has also become more competitive, says Mr Handmaker. 'Any pressure the sub-custodians are seeing, the global custodians see first. It is common for people to say to global custodians: 'You are just the conduit, why am I paying you so much money?' So the global custodian goes to the sub-custodian and cuts him down. Both the global and sub-custodians are always running to catch up.' Custodians are responding to this pressure by ensuring pricing is competitive and beefing up the services offered; both vanilla services such as information and trade settlement, and newer added value services such as proxy voting (as pension funds, especially American ones, play a more active shareholding role), catering for individual investment decisions within pension funds, contractual income and settlement or stock lending. Demand for custody of fixed income instruments in the Asia Pacific regions is also expected to grow. State Street, like Citibank one of the world's top five biggest global custodians, adds value in the area of technology, which it uses to produce high value custody services such as performance measurement and portfolio analysis, which looks at investment returns, risk, currency attribution, trade execution (for example comparing broker commission against strike price over a period of time to see how efficient brokers are), soft dollar information, currency overlay management and universe comparisons. Robert Williams, managing director of State Street in Hong Kong, says: 'Very few clients only use us for custody. That cross-selling is what tends to protect your margins as your product matures. But part of it also is to keep the product young, to keep enhancing it.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Which Party Will Solve the Economic </F> Problems? -- Median-Poll on Party Programs"]    [Text] Every sober political force hopes that the election  campaign will not get rough, and its main issue will be the  competition between party programs. Therefore, it is important  to know what the citizens think about the parties, whether they  have a program and, if so, whether their program provides  answers that are also regarded as important by the public.    At the beginning of the election campaign, 45 percent of  citizens did not know that there were parties that had already  formulated their programs for the upcoming elections; 3 percent  thought that there were no such parties, and 3 percent thought  that every party had a program.    Only 29 percent of those who do not want to vote think that  some parties have already formulated their programs, and only 59  percent of those who will certainly go to vote think this.  Those who think that at least a few parties are preparing for  the elections with programs mainly think of parliamentary  parties.    The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] held its  program-formulating general meeting two weeks before this  opinion poll. Only 20 percent of the people surveyed had heard  about this meeting, and this also shows that the good position  of the SZDSZ is due not so much to information, but to the fact  that a considerable number of citizens have consistently  regarded the SZDSZ (as well as the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF]) as a program party since the 1990 elections.    It is also important to know the extent to which supporters  of individual parties "follow their feelings" and the extent to  which they evaluate the party program. We cannot give an exact  answer to this question, but the way voters judge their own  parties is also characteristic from this viewpoint.    Supporters of the SZDSZ, the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP]  and the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] are higher the  average in thinking that their party has an election program,  while supporters of the MDF are more uncertain than the average.  A considerable proportion of voters for the Christian  Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is made up of women older than  60, living in villages, and disinterested in politics; in their  election decisions, religion plays a bigger role than the party  programs. In this respect, the Federation of Young Democrats  [Fidesz] resembles the two government parties more than the  opposition parties. Since shrinking to a third of the figures  prevailing in December 1992, the Fidesz supporters are  increasingly connected to a certain age group: Half of the  present Fidesz supporters are younger than 30 and three-quarters  are young than 40. Political disinterest can often be found  among the younger generation, and many of them are only  attracted to Fidesz for emotional reasons.    There is a broad consensus in the fact that politics should  first of all solve the economic problems; however, many voters  have no idea which party could best solve the problems facing  the Hungarian economy. Many voters do not think that the party  they want to vote for is capable of doing this. This shows the  limited commitment of some of the Hungarian voters. These are  facts that every party should face more deliberately during the  election campaign.    About the same number of people expect economic improvement  from the MSZP and the MDF as the number of people who would vote  for these two parties, but we are not talking about exactly the  same people. Some 4 percent more people than the actual  supporters think that the SZDSZ could improve the economic  situation. Almost the same applies to the FKGP. However, only  a small percentage of their supporters think that the Fidesz and  the KDNP could improve the economy.    The new government will have several possibilities at its  disposal to solve the economic problems. The surveyors of the  Median Opinion Poll Institute asked the people surveyed to  choose three out of 10 possibilities they regard as the most  important to implement, and another three possibilities they  regard as the least important to implement. On of a scale of  100, the figures under 50 show that people do not regard the  implementation of the given task as particularly important, and  the figures above 50 show that they regard it as important. On  another scale of 100, the people in the survey listed the four  most popular parties according to the extent these parties would  strive to solve a given task if they became part of the  government. Only 18 percent of the people were able to list the  parties according to all the 10 tasks. Some 36 percent of the  people could not list the parties. This also means that the  data represent the opinion of more politically-informed people.  This explains that, while a relative majority expects the MSZP  to improve the economy, the SZDSZ is leading regarding the  impelementation of every concrete task. Among the four parties,  the MDF is rejected the most. In two cases, however, the MSZP  came in the last place: People generally do not regard the flow  of foreign capital and privatization as goals of the socialists.  However, this will not cause the MSZP to lose many voters,  because the majority of people do not regard the aforementioned  tasks as really important.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / BMW to cut jobs at sales subsidiary BMW, the German carmaker, is cutting the workforce of its UK sales and marketing subsidiary after a 30 per cent decline in BMW (GB)'s trading profit last year, Kevin Done writes. Mr Tom Purves, BMW (GB) managing director, said that the company's trading profit had dropped to Pounds 25m last year from Pounds 41.1m in 1990 and a peak of Pounds 59.7m in 1989. Since the start of the recession the BMW (GB) workforce has been reduced by 18 per cent from 450 at the end of 1990 to 370 following a second round of 29 job cuts this week. BMW has increased its market share during the recession, but profitability has been affected by the deterioration in the mix of its sales in the face of the sharp drop in luxury car sales in the UK, Mr Purves said. While the overall UK market for new cars fell by 31 per cent from 1989 to 1991, the luxury car market plunged by 65 per cent from 18,700 in 1988 to 8,300 last year. Mr Purves forecast that the economic recovery in the UK would be slow. He said the the luxury car market was unlikely to recover its earlier size but could improve to 15,000 by 1995. BMW's overall UK sales volume has fallen by only 21 per cent in the past two years from 49,000 in 1989 to 38,700 last year, allowing it to increase its market share.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Arbusta <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Arbusta, we calculated purchase price based on packed F.O.B. Quito prices to unrelated customers. In accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A) of the Act, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight. We also made deductions for export taxes imposed by the government of Ecuador, in accordance with section 772(d)(2)(B) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We calculated ESP based on packed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for quality-related credits, foreign inland freight, export taxes, air freight, U.S. customs duties, U.S. brokerage and handling expenses, U.S. inland freight, and credit expenses. Also, as described above, we deducted the greater of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arbusta failed to report foreign inland freight expenses for a small number of transactions in its ESP sales listing. As BIA for these expenses, we assigned the highest freight amount for any other of Arbusta's ESP transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding export taxes, Arbusta did not report these taxes in its sales listing. Because the taxes are included in the USP, we, therefore, calculated them based on the formula given in Arbusta's response. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arbusta calculated U.S. customs duties for its sales agents in Miami on the basis of sales volume. Because these duties were incurred on the basis of sales value, we recalculated them accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arbusta calculated credit expenses using an interest rate based, in part, on loans taken outside the POI. Therefore, we revised the interest rate to reflect only POI-related borrowings and recalculated credit expenses using this revised rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding indirect selling expenses in Ecuador, we based these expenses on BIA because Arbusta did not report them in its sales listing. As BIA, we included the per unit expense reported in Arbusta's calculation of CV. However, because Arbusta did not include the indirect selling expenses of one of its four related farms, as an additional BIA amount, we divided the expenses of the other three related farms by three and added this to the total expense amount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding indirect selling expenses incurred by Arbusta's related party in New York, we determined that Arbusta's calculations contained a number of errors. Accordingly, we based these expenses on BIA. As BIA, we used the single highest amount reported for any sales transaction by this related party. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding indirect selling expenses incurred by Arbusta's other U.S. related parties, Arbusta reported monthly indirect selling expenses instead of a yearly average. Accordingly, we recalculated the expenses reported for one of these parties as a percentage of annual sales value. However, the expenses reported for the other related party appeared to pertain to another expense, unrelated to indirect selling expenses. Therefore, we based the calculation of this expense on BIA for sales through this company. As BIA, we applied the annual percentage noted above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Floricola <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Floricola, we calculated ESP based on packed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for quality-related credits, including billing and other credits, foreign inland freight, export taxes imposed by the government of Ecuador, air freight, U.S. customs duties, U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection fees, U.S. inland freight, and credit expenses. We also made deductions for U.S., Panamanian, and Ecuadorian indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs and brokerage and handling expenses, because these services were performed in-house. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Floricola did not report export taxes. Because it is clear from other questionnaire responses that all exporters pay this tax and that the tax is included in the USP, as BIA, we calculated it using the formula provided in Arbusta's response. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Guaisa <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Guaisa, we calculated purchase price based on packed F.O.B. Quito prices to unrelated customers. We made deductions, where appropriate, for quality-related credits and foreign inland freight. We also made deductions for export taxes imposed by the government of Ecuador. We corrected respondent's inaccurate foreign inland freight calculation by reallocating truck maintenance expenses over the entire POI. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We calculated ESP based on packed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for quality-related credits, foreign inland freight, air freight, U.S. customs duties, U.S. brokerage and handling expenses, and credit expenses. Also, as described above, we deducted the greater of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guaisa reported that it earned a rebate, as well as six free round-trip tickets, from its air freight carrier based on its volume of sales to the United States during the POI. We deducted the rebate from Guaisa's air freight calculations. However, because it is not clear that the airline tickets affect air freight costs, we did not adjust air freight for the value of these tickets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, Guaisa did not include the administrative expenses of its U.S. sales subsidiary in its calculation of U.S. indirect selling expenses. Moreover, Guaisa included employee commissions in its indirect selling expenses. Because the U.S. subsidiary is solely a sales organization, we reclassified its administrative expenses as indirect selling expenses, and included these expenses in our calculations. In addition, we reclassified employee commissions as commission expenses and made a separate adjustment for them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In calculating FMV, wherever there were no sales of comparable merchandise in the home market or third country markets, we based FMV on CV. In addition, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, for price-to-price comparisons, we compared U.S. sales to third country sales made at the same level of trade, where possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of fresh cut roses in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of export quality roses to the volume of third country sales of export quality roses in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined that none of the three non-BIA respondents had a viable home market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For sales made by Arbusta and Guaisa, we based FMV on third country sales or CV, when there were no third country sales of comparable merchandise. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.49(c), we selected for these respondents more than one third country because a single third country did not meet the Department's viability standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 19 CFR 353.49(b), we selected the appropriate third country markets for Arbusta and Guaisa based on the following criteria: similarity of merchandise sold in the third country to the merchandise exported to the United States, the volume of sales to the third country, and the similarity of market organization between the third country and U.S. markets. For a complete discussion of the selection of third country markets, see the June 14, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONALISTIC DREAMS OF UNITY IN MIDDLE EAST  </P> <P> The U.S. Congress is asking Japan and Germany to shoulder some costs for the  Persian Gulf military intervention. They are not being turned into "scapegoats"  as your editorial suggests ("Why Scapegoat Germany, Japan?" Sept. 13).  </P> <P> Rather, these two countries, which have a great need for imported oil and have  the financial resources to assist in the military buildup, appear to be failing  in their duty to resist the action taken by Iraq. If the military might of the  U.S. were not present now in Saudia Arabia, it is likely that Iraq's invasion  of the oil-rich countries in the gulf would be more extensive than it is. Also,  future threats from Iraq may well have to be addressed. If not, now, when? If  not by the international community, then by whom?  </P> <P> NATASHA GIBBS  </P> <P> West Hills  </P></p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / New South Wales minister quits THE conservative government of New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, suffered a serious blow yesterday when a senior minister told a hearing into corruption allegations he would resign. Mr Tim Moore, environment minister in the Liberal/National party coalition government, said he was resigning for personal reasons, and would leave parliament before the next state election, due in 1995. Mr Moore made his announcement on the first day of an inquiry by the state's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) into the appointment of Mr Terry Metherell, an independent MP, to a senior public service job. Mr Moore played a key role in the appointment, which has been described as 'a straight political deal' by Mr Nick Greiner, the state premier. The government subsequently won a by-election in Mr Metherell's safe conservative seat. Mr Greiner, Mr Metherell and Mr Moore all deny any impropriety. However, Mr Greiner has been censured by parliament, and the ICAC is investigating opposition claims that Mr Metherell voted with the government on an important bill in return for the job. The coalition government controls only 48 seats in the 99-seat parliament, compared with 47 held by the Labor opposition. It relies on the support of four independent MPs to remain in office. The independent MPs say they will demand Mr Greiner's resignation if he is criticised by the ICAC report. If the premier refused to go, the independents say they would put Labor into power.</p>

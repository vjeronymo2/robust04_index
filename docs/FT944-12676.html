			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Newport News Greek ship deal Newport News Shipbuilding said yesterday it had become the first US shipyard since 1957 to win a foreign commercial ship order when it signed a contract with Eletson Corp, a Greek shipping company, for two 46,000 ton tankers. The contract also includes an option for two more tankers, and follows the US Transportation Department's approval of a loan guarantee to Eletson. The first of the two vessels, which can carry up to 343,000 barrels of oil, is due to be delivered in 22 months. Newport News has been heavily dependent on naval shipbuilding orders, but Tenneco, its parent company, has been seeking to diversify into commercial shipbuilding.</p>

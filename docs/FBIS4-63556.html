			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Valkowski: "Conversion Will Be Continued </F> Despite Difficulties"]    [Text] How many Belarusian enterprises worked for defense?  This is still unknown, but one can definitely say that at least  a vast majority. All of them are currently living through hard  times. There are no contracts, no subassemblies; nobody knows  what to do with products piled up in warehouses (of course,  Belarus used to produce only a part of the end product).  Enterprises manufacturing civilian goods are in no better  shape. It is hard to get access to new markets, some  technologies have become desperately obsolete and thus, the  products are not competitive.    There exists a well-known way to resolve the situation -- by  means of structural reshaping and conversion. These are very  complicated processes.    At the headquarters of Belarusian producers -- the State  Committee for Industries and Interbranch Ties -- much has been  done and is still being done in this field.    A program for the structural reshaping of Belarusian  industries in the 1990's has been drafted, discussed, and passed  by the Council of Ministers. According to Mikhail Prakharenka,  department chief at the State Committee for Industries, the  program has determined priority industries -- the building of  metal-processing machines, electronic devices, instruments,  computers and communication equipment, pharmacology, polymer,  and construction materials. The priority nature of these  branches will be supported by a package of advantages, direct  investments from the state budget, and regulation of imports by  means of tariffs. The aim of these measures is to fill the  market, increase exports, and decrease imports by means of  developing the branches capable of manufacturing goods that are  currently imported.    The committee is paying serious attention to conversion. Due  to assistance rendered by committee experts in 1993, a number of  enterprises undergoing conversion have definitely changed the  proportion between military and civilian production. In most  cases the ratio of 92 to 8 percent has been changed to that of 8  to 92 percent. There are fewer military contracts. However the  state policy is also aimed at preserving the existing level of  production of armaments and military hardware and enhancing  exports of competitive products. It is also necessary to supply  the Belarusian Armed Forces.    The scientific and technological potential of defense  enterprises is quite high. Sometimes it cannot be used at  civilian enterprises because military technologies are several  decades ahead of the current level. The primary goal of  conversion is to preserve the accomplishments and reorient the  existing scientific and technological potential toward  manufacturing competitive civilian products. Defense  enterprises are engaged in a majority of nationwide projects and  scientific-technological endeavors.    Many Minsk residents have abandoned hope of ever having  telephones installed. The program drafted by committee experts  will help speed up installation of telephones in Minsk homes.  It envisions the use of high-tech equipment in the field of  communication, namely radio telephones. This does not demand  the laying of costly telephone cables. New automated telephone  stations will also be cheaper than traditional ones.    It is hard to enumerate all concrete programs drafted for  various industries. All in all, there are 17 of them.    The aim of these programs is well-defined -- to enhance the  efficiency of production and reduce consumption of power and  materials. The implementation of all the priority programs that  involve more than thirty scientific staffs, has begun. There  have been results, too. More than 2,000 sample products have  been manufactured within the framework of these programs,  including consumer goods never produced in Belarus.    Instrument-builders are unquestionable leaders in this  competition. Thus far, they have designed and launched  production of 28 models of wood-processing equipment, a number  of new machines for the production of bearings, universal  knee-type milling machines and lathes, as well as high-precision  thread milling machines.    Machine builders can be proud of the new diesel engines, the  new type of MAZ trucks, and truck-mounted cranes capable of  lifting up to 20 tonnes.    Radio electronic devices deserve to be mentioned separately.  This industry is the basis for developing other branches because  it determines the technological level and exports potential of  industries producing home appliances, radio electronic and  information systems, means of communication, medical equipment,  and various means of transportation.    A large number of radio electronic enterprises are  concentrated in Minsk alone. Their modernization and realigning  to novel technologies would entail huge costs. However it is  clear that this is inevitable. The Belarusian computer market  is flooded with equipment assembled in Asia which, very often,  is of poor quality. Yet our personal computers are inferior even  to these low-quality products. That is why our state  enterprises and institutions bought almost $3 million worth of  computers in 1993 alone. This money could have been paid to  native producers provided they offered competitive equipment.    The State Committee for Industries concentrates its efforts  on these targets. What we can produce ourselves we should  produce here, and not buy overseas. Otherwise our industries  will not survive.</p>

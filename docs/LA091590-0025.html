			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV GEOGRAPHY, UCLA FOOTBALL TEAM MATCH MARKS OF 'F' IN OPENER  </P> <P> I thought football was complicated, but Terry Donahue says it's simple.  </P> <P> I thought UCLA was clobbered by Oklahoma last Saturday because the Bruins were  outplayed and out-coached. But Donahue informs us it was because of two dropped  punts.  </P> <P> His genius is being wasted. He should leave the coaching of Bruin football to  lesser minds and figure out how to ship Medflies to Iraq and how to keep Bert  Parks out of Atlantic City.  </P> <P> MARSHALL L.

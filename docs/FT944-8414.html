			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Travel: Conversations with a very Canadian dog - Nicholas Woodsworth takes a philosophical canoe journey down the Gatineau river It is autumn, perhaps the most beautiful time of year in Canada, and I am trying to enjoy the lovely autumn weather in peace. But my temporary guide and companion, Jenny, is determined to give me a cultural as well as scenic tour of the area. Once she gets an idea in her head she does tend to rattle on. 'The Canadian character', she is saying, 'has over the years become a sort of jokey cliche even among Canadians themselves.' I sit back, as much as one can sit back in a canoe, and wait for the rest. On the foibles of human character Jenny is outspoken. 'Our souls are preoccupied with an endless search for something called 'the Canadian identity'. Domestically, we tie ourselves into knots with political quibbling of the most literal sort; never mind if something is going to work or not - 'is it constitutional?' we want to know. And when we want to make our mark globally, we join some hopeless, doomed UN humanitarian effort. We are well-intentioned and civic-minded. We are pleasant and wholesome. We are dull. Do we make the most of this country? No, we do not.' Now, I cannot be sure that Jenny is really saying these things, because Jenny is a dog. A golden retriever, to be precise. However intelligent and communicative retrievers are, no one could be blamed for having doubts about a dog's ability to pass judgment on national developments. Besides, Jenny is 12 years old and, I fear, getting a bit beyond it - she has arthritis in her legs, for which she takes an aspirin every day. Goodness knows how sound her ideas might be. But try it yourself, and you will see. Sit alone with a dog in a canoe on a river in the Canadian wilderness for a few days, surrounded only by sighing boughs and whispering bullrushes. After a while you cannot be sure what you are really hearing and what you are merely imagining. However fanciful Jenny's notions of Canada may be, she is certainly more aware of what is going on here than I. Although I am nominally Canadian, I have been away so many years I have almost forgotten what this vast northern country is all about. Now, on a short visit back to my parent's home on the Gatineau River, I am trying to pick up the traces. Jenny, on the other hand, knows the country well - she spends her summers cavorting about the water chasing ducks and playing dangerous games with porcupines, her winters lolloping down snowy trails on the river's frozen surface. So every morning now I walk down to the woodshed where Jenny sits watching my father stack cords of birch and maple for the coming winter, and I borrow her. She may be old, but those cocked ears, that eyebrow semaphore, that twitching and investigative nose reveal Jenny as an acute and experienced observer of the local scene. What source, human or animal, could better inform my slow-drifting, paddle-dripping musings on what it is to be Canadian? 'I doubt the Parti Quebecois could win an independence referendum next year', Jenny opines during a quiet moment as we sit immobile in the reeds one afternoon, watching dragonflies make aircraft-carrier landings on a floating log. 'But frankly', she adds darkly, 'I am afraid there are other ways of forcing the issue.' Where does an outdoor dog like Jenny, at home in the great wilderness spaces, get hold of her ideas, you might be asking. The extraordinary thing about the Gatineau River, wild and unspoiled as it is, is that it sits just 15 minutes drive from Ottawa - capital of the country and nerve-centre of its national debates and gossip. Jenny does not even have to wander from the Gatineau hills down to the House of Commons cafeteria to pick up the most recent gossip on the greatest Canadian debate of all - the long-running and now fast-growing argument over French Canada's place in the nation. Nor is speculation about Quebec's secession from Canada - a move promised by the province's party in power, the Parti Quebecois - far from her inquiring ear. For the Gatineau, itself just inside the Quebec provincial border, is the preferred home of senior Ottawa civil servants, government speech writers, party spin-doctors, parliamentary journalists and electronic media types. Each evening they retreat from the city to well-appointed cottages, cabins and country homes scattered in the woods along the river banks, not far from the hurly-burly but far enough that racoons still make a mess of the garbage. All Jenny has to do is wander about on a Saturday morning back-door-begging from deputy ministers' wives. Along with the tit-bits she receives - she likes a nice piece of bacon - she is also likely to pick up some juicy political fat to chew on. Jenny, though, has fundamentally different views from most of Canada's politicians. 'What a pathetic lot they are', she whines as one day we paddle off the broad Gatineau and up Blackburn's Creek. It is a sinuous, swampy, forest-lined waterway, home to beavers, loons, muskrats and other Canadian things, and just the sort of place Jenny loves. 'Take a look around]' she launches in. 'Here we are, a G-7 nation, one of the most industrialised and prosperous countries in the world, and we're still fortunate enough to have all this. Name me one country in the world where unspoiled nature sits on the capital city's doorstep?' Jenny is beginning to get over-excited, although the sight of a flock of merganser ducks feeding not far away may have something to do with it. 'Can Canadian politicians possibly have their eyes open?' Her big pink tongue lolls with agitation. 'Do they travel? Do they read? Do they ever switch over from 'Hockey Night in Canada' to the CBC news? Do they have any idea of how difficult, dirty, strife-torn, poverty-ridden, over-crowded, under-privileged, race-divided, environmentally-ravaged and generally miserable life can be elsewhere on the planet? Jenny pants, out of breath. 'I doubt it.' She pauses to lean over the gunnel and lap a bit of creek water, then starts in again. 'If they did, they would be out here enjoying what Canada has to offer instead of threatening to tear the country apart. Do you realise you could put France, the largest nation in western Europe, three times into the province of Quebec alone? Dogs and cats aside, there are just 28m inhabitants in the second-largest country in the world] There is more clean water, more resources, more space than most people could imagine. Yet Canadians, French and English, are going at each other more blindly than any dogs and cats. Behind the mild-mannered image are some very spoiled, selfish and stubborn people. If Canadians aren't careful, they are going to lose everything.' Well, after that tongue-lashing we both shut up for a while and simply drift down the river. We feel somewhat ashamed, she for her outburst, I for our national failings. Instead we gaze at the weathered, pinky pre-Cambrian granite that fronts the water; at brilliant blue kingfishers dropping like stones after unsuspecting fish; at autumn trees along the banks, bursts of red, yellow, vermilion flame; at the V made by a beaver as it swims through quiet water; at another V, high in the sky, of geese heading south. And after a while, lulled and soothed by these things, we feel better. 'You know', sighs Jenny, 'the Group of Seven - the closest thing Canada ever had to a post-impressionist painting school - believed a sense of national unity could be fostered by a sense of the land. So they painted magnificent landscapes of all the things we enjoy looking at. Very rugged and wild, very Canadian their tableaux were. 'I know what you mean, Jenny', I say, only half listening. I am thinking about the sharp nip I can feel in the air, and imagining the fierce Canadian winter that is not far away now. 'As far as I am concerned, it is the climate, not cultural differences, that is the country's biggest drawback. 'Six months of snow and six months of hard sledding', I tease Jenny as I turn the canoe around and begin the long paddle home. 'There's nothing to it', she growls, settling down for a snooze with her nose under her tail. 'Just wear a warm coat, like I do.'</p>

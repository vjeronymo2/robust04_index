			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Money Supply Down: All three measures of the nation's money supply fell in the  week ended July 24, the Federal Reserve Board reported. The measure known as M2  fell $1.5 billion to a seasonally adjusted $3,121.2 billion from $3,122.7  billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, fell $4.6 billion to  $4,004.3 billion from $4,008.9 billion. The narrowest measure of the money  supply, M1, fell $1.3 billion to a seasonally adjusted $776.2 billion from  $777.5 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts  and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts such as savings deposits  and money market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as  certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $100,000.  </P></p>

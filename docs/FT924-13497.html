			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fight to establish minority role - The battle for boardroom control at Andrews Sykes THE OUTCOME of the bitter battle for boardroom control of Andrews Sykes will be decided tomorrow at an extraordinary meeting called at the request of Mr Jacques Murray, the dissident shareholder who controls a 29.2 per cent stake in the specialist industrial services group. From the outset the six week-long battle has been as much an argument about minority shareholder power and boardroom votes, as it has been about the financial performance of the group. It has pitted Mr Murray, 72, an Anglo-French investor, against a team led by Mr David Hubbard, Powell Duffryn's 56-year-old chairman and former Peat Marwick accountant. Mr Hubbard took over as Andrews Sykes' non-executive chairman last autumn when the group's former chairman retired. At the time Mr Hubbard's appointment was seen as an important step in maintaining shareholder confidence. This was needed because earlier that year it had sacked its acquisitive young chief executive, Mr Andrew Fitton, seen its profits and share price fall sharply, and changed its name from Braithwaite. Mr Murray, who is also chairman and majority shareholder of Nu-Swift, the fire protection, office cleaning and property company, acquired his initial stake in Braithwate during 1990. Since then Mr Murray has had a number of discussions with Andrews Sykes' board about what role he and his associates might play in the company. Nevertheless, after voting in favour of Mr Hubbard's reappointment at the group's annual meeting at the end of July, the relationship apparently turned sour. Early last month European Fire Protection and Midland Bank Overseas Nominees, Mr Murray's investment vehicles, requisitioned the extraordinary meeting to consider resolutions removing Mr Hubbard and Mr David Crowe, one of the two other non-executive directors, from Andrews Sykes' five-man board, and replacing them with Mr Murray and three of his associates. In a series of letters to shareholders the two sides have since set out their arguments. Mr Murray's central theme has been that Andrews Sykes has 'repeatedly failed to meet profit expectations' and to realise 'the considerable synergy benefits' that were forecast in May 1988 when Braithwaite acquired SPP. In particular he has cited the 81.6 per cent drop in pre-tax profits between 1989 and 1992, and the decline in earnings from 27.6p to 1.2p per share over the same period. In response Mr Hubbard has urged shareholders to reject what has been characterised as 'a back-door attempt' by a minority shareholder to gain control of Andrews Sykes. He has emphasised that the current board has a majority of independent directors. Mr Hubbard says the company 'has made significant progress,' despite the background of 'severe economic pressures.' In particular he cites the almost 20 per cent reduction in bank borrowings in the latest financial year, significant reductions in operating expenses and employee numbers, and the rationalisation and modernisation of its depots. At the same time he has challenged Mr Murray's motives, highlighted his adversary's financial performance at Nu-Swift, and raised questions over some aspects of Nu-Swift's accounting procedures and its own dealings with minority shareholders. Despite this public debate the battle may well have already been decided in the series of meetings both sides have held behind closed doors with institutional investors. Two of those institutions, Royal Insurance Asset Management, which holds an 8.19 per cent stake, and Postel Investment Management, which has a 4.71 per cent stake, have said they will back Mr Hubbard and the board. Royal Insurance in particular appears to have stung the Murray camp with its comment that 'the growing trend for overseas investors to seek control of quoted UK companies through a minority shareholding should be vigorously resisted.' One of Mr Murray's associates noted that 'it has turned into a political rather than a commercial discussion.'</p>

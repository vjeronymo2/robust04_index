			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Bosnians and Croatians draw up ceasefire plan Croatian and Bosnian negotiators yesterday drew up plans for a temporary ceasefire aimed at ending weeks of heavy fighting in central Bosnia. However, diplomats described a planned ceasefire as 'tentative' and Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic said on German television there had been 'no great result'. There had also been failure, after two days of talks in Bonn, to resolve the future status of Mostar in western Hercegovina and agree on a Bosnian request to give the rump state access to the sea. Implementation of a ceasefire has still to be worked out but diplomats said agreement might be enough to secure the future of the Geneva peace talks which are due to resume later this week. Bosnian government forces had earlier this month pushed back Croat troops from around Vitez, central Bosnia in an attempt to gain control of arms plants. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia had warned that he would increase the number of Croat troops to win back this territory. But diplomats said that pressure from Germany, France and other western countries might have persuaded Mr Tudjman to consider a ceasefire. 'We just do not know if either side mean what they say,' said a western diplomat. 'Croatia might have agreed to this for public relations and because of the growing international pressure on Tudjman. But we don't know if the commanders on the ground will stop the fighting.' Despite Croatia's goal of creating a Greater Croatia, similar to Serbia's aims in Bosnia, senior Bosnian officials confirmed yesterday they still wanted to forge an alliance with Croatia. An alliance between Zagreb and Sarajevo was formed in early 1992, but Croatian-backed troops in Bosnia continued to gain territory in Hercegovina, and around Mostar, the regional capital, in an effort eventually to link it to Croatia proper. But a Bosnian negotiator at the Bonn talks said: 'We must try and cement a new alliance with Croatia. We will need Croatia once this war is over for economic, social and political reasons'.</p>

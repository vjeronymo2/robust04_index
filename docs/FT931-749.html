			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / International Company News in Brief: BTP Fougerolle BTP Fougerolle, the French construction group, shrugged off the building industry slump to muster a modest increase in net consolidated profits of 2.2 per cent to FFr410m (Dollars 73.2m) in 1992 from FFr401m the year before, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. It suffered losses on its property interests and was forced to make hefty provisions on the fall in value of its properties. Fougerolle, its construction business, increased net profits in spite of a 6 per cent fall in sales to FFr37.2bn.</p>

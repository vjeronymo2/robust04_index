			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian  Democratic Union) sticks to his view that a German head of  government should not attend the celebrations of the former  Allies in commemoration of the landing in Normandy. "This is  not the day on which the German chancellor would be in the right  place there," Kohl said in Munich on Friday [3 June]. The  meeting in northern France next Monday will be attended by heads  of state and government of the former anti-Hitler coalition.    As an example of how this occasion should make "one look  forward," Kohl cited the meeting that he and French President  Francois Mitterrand have agreed to hold in Heidelberg two days  later. There "a festival of friendship will take place with  thousands of young people," he said at a lecture at the  Christian Democratic Union's Economic Advisory Council.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy setback in Shell THE ROUT of the oil sector, triggered by sliding oil prices, and helped on its way by BP's poor results last week, continued yesterday following acutely disappointing results from Royal Dutch/Shell. Shell Transport shares weakened 15 to 440p, the lowest closing level since February 1991, on turnover of 31m shares, the highest daily total for more than five years. Profits were at the bottom end of the market's expectations but it was the dividend decision that prompted the sell-off. The final dividend of 12p exceeded some of the most pessimistic forecasts but was below the general consensus of 12.2p to 12.4p. Analysts moved quickly to reduce their dividend expectations for the current year. Mr Jeremy Hudson at Shearson Lehman shaded his forecast to 21.9p but pointed out that he saw only 5 per cent downside in Shell Transport shares from here. At Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, Mr Keith Morris, one of the more bearish analysts on Shell ahead of the figures, saw the results as 'disappointing but not catastrophic' and pencilled in a 21.7p dividend forecast for this year, describing the shares as a sell. Strauss Turnbull, among the market's most vociferous bears of oils over the past year, predicted a dividend of 21.6p for the year and said: 'The signal from Shell is quite clear; the outlook is poor and getting poorer, we see the stock yielding 40 per cent more than the market, and that points to a share price of 400p.' An oil specialist commented: 'Fund managers are now reducing their weightings in oils to neutral and that means there is some more big selling to come.' The big selling of Shell yesterday was accompanied by aggressive switching out of Royal Dutch into Shell and further exceptionally heavy activity in BP. The BP share price stabilised to close 3 firmer at 254p on volume of 23m. Turnover in BP since last Thursday week's figures is just short of 200m shares. Glaxo volatile Half-year results from Glaxo yesterday prompted significant volatility in the stock, which saw more than 15m shares dealt in one of its heaviest daily volumes for at least five years. Just after the market opened, Glaxo shares were up strongly. They firmed further on the announcement of a 41 per cent rise in the dividend. However, the gain was reversed on further consideration of the results, particularly disappointment over sales growth for Zantac, the company's anti-ulcer drug. The shares tumbled almost 60 points from the day's high before they were considered to be oversold. In the afternoon, light US buying lent support to the stock and the shares picked up slowly to close only 10 off on the day at 816p. The profit figures appeared to fit in with the views of most financial observers. Cautious houses such as Nomura retained their sell stance, regarding the results as 'a bad day for Glaxo'. Bullish BZW remained a buyer, believing the declining sales growth for Zantac had been adequately justified by the company. Expectations for 1992/1993 now vary between Pounds 1.55bn and Pounds 1.77bn as observers take varying views on the speed of development of Glaxo's three principal new products, Zofran (the most well-established), Serevent and Imigran. Rank sold Leisure group Rank Organisation dropped 22 to 681p as investors turned bearish ahead of the stock going ex-dividend on Monday. There was also renewed interest in Rank's accounts, published this week, with the group coming under scrutiny at the first of a series of analysts' meetings yesterday. Rank has surged ahead since its results three weeks ago and many in the market feel the run had been overdone. Mr Paul Heath at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said: 'There has been some profit-taking on fears that a lot of people may pull out of Rank after banking the dividend next week.' Banque Paribas, the French-owned broking house, drew attention to Rank's accounts, analyst Mr Nigel Reed pointing to 'the size of the release of the provision on the Mecca acquisition', of some Pounds 48m Reports that James Capel had joined County NatWest in recommending a switch out of Rank and into Ladbroke were denied by Capel. Ladbroke was steady at 231p. More big buying of TSB drove the shares higher to 126 1/2 p, while vague takeover stories and a broker buy note helped Standard Chartered improve 13 more to 449p. Lloyds, due to reveal preliminary figures today - the market range is from Pounds 550m to Pounds 700m compared with last time's Pounds 591m - hardened to 387p. It is expected to be the only bank in the so-called 'big four', comprising Barclays, Lloyds, Midland and NatWest, to lift its dividend. Provident Financial advanced 17 to 487p after the better than expected dividend. The rights issue announced by Germany's Allianz triggered a fresh bout of takeover speculation in Guardian Royal Exchange, up 3 at 123p. There was evidence of more selling and splitting of the Electricity Package, although the unit price moved up 20 to Pounds 2,815. Enthusiasm from securities house Smith New Court helped Rothmans International to pick up 23 to 1081p. The house reiterated its long-term buy recommendation, citing Rothmans' net cash position, its medium-term opportunities in the Pacific Rim and eastern Europe and its attractive assets in Dunhill and Cartier. Reuters Holdings gained 13 to 1150p as US buyers absorbed selling in London and securities house Henderson Crosthwaite continued to argue the case for Reuters with clients. The house published a buy note this week which points out that the stock is on a low cash flow multiple and argues that Reuters' automated trading system Dealing 2000-2 is well ahead of rival products. Racal Electronics attracted speculative buying, amid revived stories that Tomkins, the conglomerate, may be about to make either a full bid for the electronics group or buy Racal's Chubb division. There has been intense speculation for a number of weeks, and suggestions that a stake-builder has been operating in Racal, which firmed 2 1/2 to 57p on turnover of 7.2m yesterday. Headline Book Publishing, floated on the stock market last April, moved ahead 12 to 174p after revealing more than doubled profits of Pounds 1.3m. Reports from a conference in Florida that Philip Morris repeated its aim of making acquisitions in Europe renewed bid speculation in Cadbury Schweppes, which put on 3 to 469p. Tate &amp; Lyle rose 7 to 430p, boosted by dollar strength and a buy recommendation from Warburg Securities. The broker expects the shares to outperform the market over the next year on above average dividend growth of 12 per cent and the potential approval of a new product, Sucralose. Unilever gained 8 to 955p ahead of next week's results. The company's proposed sale of its low-margin agribusiness provided support. In the food retailing sector, Albert Fisher gave up 3 1/2 to 63 1/2 p following the overnight sale of 1.5m shares at 63p. Heavy activity continued in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, which firmed a penny to 16p with almost 19m shares dealt and US investors said to be keen. Dealers said the interest had been sparked by a press report highlighting an upturn in advertising spending in the States. A positive statement from Yorkshire Chemicals and a one-for-one scrip issue prompted the tightly-traded shares to jump 36 to 644p. P &amp; O shrugged off recent gloom and improved 10 to 402p, with Panmure Gordon, a broker to the company, reported to be among the day's leading buyers. US demand lifted British Airways 8 to 267p. Lehman Brothers has placed the stock on its international buy list. Turnover reached 7.4m. Profit-taking, along with a calmer view of Wednesday's results, left British Aerospace 3 lighter at 300p as turnover reached 5.3m. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (82).

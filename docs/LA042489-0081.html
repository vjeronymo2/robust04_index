			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> F-18 STUNT THAT INJURED PILOT WILL BE DROPPED FROM EL TORO AIR SHOW  </P> <P> The familiar sight of a lone Marine Corps F-18 skirting the borders of the El  Toro air station, making tight turns, low passes and a giant upside-down loop  in front of hundreds of thousands of gaping spectators, will not be a part of  this year's Navy Relief Air Show at El Toro.  </P> <P> The Marines have decided to cut the stunt from this year's show, which is  scheduled for next Saturday and Sunday, because of the near-fatal crash of a  lone F-18 during last year's presentation.  </P> <P> "I guess the bottom line is I'm not willing to take the chance," said Maj. Gen.  Donald E. P. Miller, commander of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at El Toro. "We  damn-near lost one of our group commanders -- and obviously we lost an airplane  that cost $18 million -- in front of 350,000 people. I'm not sure it's worth  the risk."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Miscalculated Altitude  </P> <P> It was a year ago on a hazy, warm, Sunday afternoon during the air show that  Col. Jerry Cadick brought his F-18 in low across the field at about 400 m.p.h.  and shot straight up into the air to begin the big loop.  </P> <P> As he went over the top of the loop and started down, the highly decorated  Vietnam pilot, descending at 10,000 feet per minute, miscalculated his altitude  and slammed into the runway at the bottom of the loop.  </P> <P> Cadick survived the crash, something even his doctors call a miracle.  </P> <P> "It was a very moving experience for me out there on that Sunday last year,"  Miller said. "When the accident happened it was so quiet it was almost eerie. I  saw people with their heads bowed and people who cried after seeing the  accident.  </P> <P> "While some might want to think that the American public would like to see  somebody get bashed like at a boxing match, I don't think there is anyone out  there who would come hoping something like that would happen."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Retired From Marines  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Cadick retired from the Marine Corps with a medical  disability. He is still recovering from multiple broken bones and internal  injuries he suffered in the crash.  </P> <P> Although he talked with reporters last year while recuperating in a Navy  hospital in San Diego, Cadick declined to talk when contacted at his home last  week.  </P> <P> Cadick, who said he was determined to fly again for the Marines, did not take  his retirement easily, Miller said.  </P> <P> "Just think of the thing you like to do the most and imagine waking up one  morning and they told you you couldn't do it anymore," Miller said.  </P> <P> This year's air show -- which is free to the public -- will be almost like last  year's, with the exception of the Marine F-18. It will include a Soviet MIG-15  that will be flown by a former Marine helicopter pilot, and there will be  skywriting, dogfighting and wing-walking acts.  </P> <P> As in years past, the Air Force will demonstrate its F-16 Fighting Falcon, and  the Navy will fly its F-14 Tomcat.  </P> <P> Also, the public will be allowed to get a close look at military hardware. The  displays include the free world's fastest and sleekest helicopters, fighter  jets and transport aircraft. The biggest exhibit parked along the tarmac will  be the C-5A, the military's version of the Boeing 747.  </P> <P> And the Blue Angels, a traditional favorite at the El Toro air show, will  return.  </P> <P> Military officials hope this year's air show will raise $600,000 or more from  the sale of food, souvenirs and memorabilia. The money is used to help needy  sailors and Marines through the Navy's relief program.  </P> <P> The change in this year's lineup at El Toro comes at a time of increasing  concern over air show safety.  </P> <P> Last August, an air show disaster at a U.S. air base in Ramstein, West Germany,  killed 70 people when three aircraft of an Italian air force aerobatics team  collided, one of them then careening into the crowd. Hundreds of people were  injured.  </P> <P> The U.S. Air Force canceled all of its air shows in West Germany for 1989,  authorities announced in February.  </P> <P> In March, a pilot flying a T-28 military trainer in the Valiant Air Command Air  Show in Titusville, Fla., was killed when the single-engine plane crashed.  </P> <P> Another pilot of a vintage two-engine plane was killed last October when he  crashed in a Texas air show sponsored by the Confederate Air Force.  </P> <P> The crash last year at the El Toro air show was not the first there.  </P> <P> In 1985, a World War II-vintage plane flying in the air show plowed into an  empty chapel on the air station. The pilot and his passenger, both civilians,  were killed as about 200,000 people watched.  </P> <P> Gen. Miller said there has been no pressure locally to discontinue the annual  air show because of its potential danger.  </P> <P> "I guess we the American public accept that aviation is dangerous and we are  going to have crashes," Miller said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree with petitioners. In cases where a parent company is an investment holding company, it is the Department's practice to allocate a portion of G&amp;A expenses incurred by the parent company to the respondent under the theory that the parent's G&amp;A expenses are incurred on behalf of the parent's investment holdings. (See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon from Venezuela (58 FR 27524, May 10, 1993).) Since there is no verified information on the record to support KT's claim that all G&amp;A expenses incurred by KT's parent for the benefit of KT were already charged to KT and included in the submitted G&amp;A calculation, we adjusted KT's G&amp;A to include a proportional amount of its parent's administrative costs based on KT's parent's stock ownership of KT. Additionally, we revised KT's G&amp;A expense computation to include the omitted amortization of pre-operating expenses as recorded on the company's financial statements, as well as to correct for a clerical error found at verification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 6:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners claim that the production yields reported by KT are inaccurate and unrealistic and cannot be relied upon by the Department for its final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> KT argues that production yields are irrelevant because the costs used for the final determination are KT's actual material expenses, not standard costs. Thus, KT maintains that whether or not the production yield used under the standard cost system is accurate is irrelevant to the Department's analysis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The apparent unrealistic production yields appear to be generated from KT's usage of theoretical production weights. Since this same theoretical weight was used to convert production costs from a unit of weight basis to a unit of length basis, the effect of the apparent unrealistic yield rate is offset. (See, Comment 4, above.) Therefore, no adjustment was deemed necessary for the final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 7:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners contend that the stainless steel coil costs KT used in its original response were not consistent with information on the coil invoices obtained by the Department at verification and, moreover, were inconsistent with the coil costs reported by KT in its second cost questionnaire response. Petitioners argue that the Department, therefore, should reject the stainless steel coil costs reported by KT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> KT argues that petitioners' claim that KT reported inconsistent stainless steel costs is incorrect. KT asserts that petitioners are basing this claim on a comparison of non-comparable figures. Specifically, KT states that the figures taken from Exhibit 16 of its original cost response are net of all adjustments for work in process, exchange gains, and scrap expense and revenue, whereas the figures in the second response include these expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

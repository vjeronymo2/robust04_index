			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "Jurkans Founds Peoples' Accord </F> Party"]    [Text] Riga, 6 February--Some of the deputies of the Accord  for Latvia faction in the Saeima joined others of the same  political views in founding the Peoples' Accord Party (PNS)  Saturday on the Latvian University campus. A party program and  charter and several resolutions were adopted at the congress.  Janis Jurkans was installed as party chairman. The founders of  the PNS will continue to work in the Accord for Latvia faction  in the Saeima.    The party constituent congress was attended by Saeima  deputies Andris Ameriks and Igors Bukovskis, and the party  declaration was also signed by Lyudmila Kupriyanova. The PNS was  founded on the basis of the Latvian Support Fund. Some of the  Accord for Latvia deputies who were not involved in the  establishment of the PNS--Edvins Kide, Juris Janeks, Yevgeniy  Zashcherinskiy, Vilnis Edvins Bresis, and Janis Lucans--will  form their own party at the end of March and join the National  Economy and Prosperity bloc. The programs of the two groups will  continue to agree with the platform of the Accord for Latvia and  Recovery for the National Economy bloc. When Saeima Deputy Igors  Bukovskis addressed the congress, he said there was no split in  the faction. It was simply that the bolder members were quicker  to form their own party. He expressed the hope that the other  deputies in the faction would join the PNS soon.    Forty people voted in favor of the creation of the PNS at a  general meeting, including Mavriks Vulfsons, Nikolajs Nejlands,  Juris Rozenvalds, Ilze Jurkane, Ivars Kezbers, Vladlens  Dozorcevs, and Janis Aboltins.    One of the authors of the party program, Juris Rozenvalds,  remarked at the congress that the PNS would take a centrist  stance, would support the market economy and the development of  entrepreneurial activity, and would defend the active voting  rights of residents in local elections.    In his opinion, the PNS's closest neighbors in the spectrum  of political parties are the Democratic Party, the Democratic  Party of Labor, and the Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party.    The PNS program advocates the election of the president of  the state by all of the people, calls for the unity of the  Latvian public, and requests the Saeima to pass a declaration on  ethnic and social reconciliation. The PNS believes that people  who have lived in Latvia for the last 10 years and have a  conversational knowledge of the Latvian language are entitled to  citizenship, but preference in the granting of citizenship  should be given to permanent residents who were born in Latvia  (with the exception of foreign servicemen on active duty and  their descendants) and the family members of citizens of the  Latvian Republic. The PNS recommends that the naturalization of  non-citizens start as soon as possible.    The PNS sees Latvia's main foreign policy objective as the  normalization of relations with Russia and other CIS countries.  The economic section of the PNS program expresses support for  the market economy, as well as for the state as the largest  owner of capital and the coexistence of various forms of  entrepreneurial activity.</p>

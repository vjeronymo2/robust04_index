			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: DOWNEY;  </P> <P> COMPROMISE WORKED OUT TO ALLOW PESTICIDE STORAGE  </P> <P> The Downey City Council on Tuesday gave final approval to a compromise  agreement that will allow the county to store thousands of pounds of pesticides  in a new warehouse near the southwest corner of Imperial Highway and Garfield  Avenue.  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors is expected to approve the agreement in coming  weeks.  </P> <P> The city would then drop its lawsuit against the county, which was filed last  December.  </P> <P> For months, Downey officials have opposed the county's plans to store  pesticides at the facility, which is near residential neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Of special concern were plans to fumigate the stored squirrel bait --  poison-laden grain that can become infested with insects. Small amounts of  poisonous gas are vented into the air after such fumigations.  </P> <P> Under the compromise, the county would fumigate only if the air-conditioning at  the facility failed. Insects could breed in the grain if the temperature in the  storage bin rises above the low-50s.  </P> <P> The county plans to store nine pesticides at the facility, including 9,500  pounds of squirrel bait.  </P></p>

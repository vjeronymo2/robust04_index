			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / World Trade News: ABB urges India to stick by rail deal ASEA Brown Boveri, the European engineering combine, yesterday urged India not to abandon a controversial Dollars 190m (Pounds 110.4m) contract to buy imported high-tech locomotives. ABB executives, in India to plead their case, insisted New Delhi should stick to its March decision to award the contract to ABB after a four-and-a-half-year bidding process. ABB won the contract for the supply of 30 locomotives against tough competition from three other international bidders, including a partnership between Sumitomo and Hitachi, the Japanese trading and engineering companies. But protests have since surfaced on the grounds that India does not need expensive imported technology when it has large railway workshops of its own. The government has yet to sign a contract with ABB, or indicate when one might be signed. The arguments show that despite the economic liberalisation programme launched by the government of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, doing business in India can still be fraught with problems. ABB, which has a large Indian affiliate employing 4,000, has been supplying Indian railways since the 1960s. When India decided in the early 1980s to start replacing some of its steam- and diesel-powered locomotives with electric ones, ABB was a front-runner. In 1986, it supplied six of 18 electric locomotives India imported on an experimental basis. Locomotive technology then underwent a drastic change, with the introduction, principally by ABB, of a new generation of micro-chip-controlled alternating-current engines. So, when India invited offers for 30 more locomotives, it was able to consider a more modern engine, but one which was more expensive. After four years' deliberation, the railway ministry awarded the contract to ABB, but the decision went for review before the railway convention committee, a government panel. The panel recently advised the government to act in its own best judgment, but only after committee members had dropped hints urging scrapping of the contract. The committee's concerns focused on the cost of the project and a desire to promote India's own engineering industry. Members questioned whether it would not be better to buy home-made locomotives costing about a tenth the price of the imports. Yesterday, Mr Amandus Jaeger, vice-president of ABB Transportation Systems Switzerland, an ABB subsidiary, said the advantages of the new-generation technology for India were 'tremendous'. The contract included the transfer of the technology needed to make them. India would be able to produce the new high-tech engines in Indian factories.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Bank may lose control over Russia budget THE Russian government is to set up a federal treasury, which could act as a substitute for the central bank in the key area of budget implementation and control. The idea of creating a parallel structure which would take over the crucial budgetary functions of the central bank has been long mooted. It has a legal foundation in a decree signed last December by President Boris Yeltsin. Now, according to reports in the daily Kommersant and the Interfax news agency, the project is well advanced. Kommersant said the treasury would 'supervise all operations which have to do with budgetary resources' and would be 'like a bank, with government funds being paid in and out'. It would be under the control of a deputy finance minister, with its headquarters within the Finance Ministry, offices in the regions and republics, and branches at district and city level. As well as depriving the central bank of one of its main functions - that of crediting budget expenditure - the government also plans to reduce parliament's authority over the budget to merely confirming it once it has been presented by the president. The aim is to address the problem of the central bank authorising greater expenditure than that provided for in the government budget. But it would do so through the classic Russian method of sidestepping a problem by creating a new organisation to deal with it. Mr Yeltsin has vetoed a banking law passed by parliament in July which ordered the central bank to review licences already granted to a handful of foreign banks, including Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale, Dresdner Bank and the Bank of China, on the grounds that it put 'unjust' limits on them. The final 30 soldiers at Russia's last military base in Lithuania left their barracks yesterday and headed for Kaunas railway station on their way home from the Baltic state, Reuter reports.</p>

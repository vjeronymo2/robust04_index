			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Thorn EMI pays Branson Pounds 510m for Virgin Music MR RICHARD BRANSON yesterday sold Virgin Music Group, the world's largest independent record company, to Thorn EMI for Pounds 510m in cash. The deal, agreed after 14 months of talks, means Thorn, the UK music, rentals and light fittings group, shoots straight into the top league of world music groups, with turnover of more than Pounds 1.3bn and a share of about 18 per cent of the world market. It also consolidates the transformation made by Thorn in the past five years, shedding more than 60 companies to concentrate on music and equipment rental. Virgin Music, created 20 years ago by Mr Branson, brings to Thorn artists such as the Rolling Stones, Phil Collins, Genesis and UB40. It adds the copyright to 25,000 songs to Thorn's catalogue of 800,000 titles, which already includes Singing In The Rain, Over The Rainbow and Happy Birthday To You. Mr Branson said yesterday that the Rolling Stones had told him when they signed with Virgin at the end of last year that they would be untroubled if the company were taken over by Thorn. Mr Branson added: 'It's also important to me that we managed to reach an agreement with a British company.' Mr Branson will receive nearly Pounds 380m from the sale, part of which he is expected to invest in the expansion of his airline Virgin Atlantic Airways, and the Virgin Megastore chain of shops in the UK, Japan and continental Europe. The price also marks a substantial profit for Fujisankei Communications, the Japanese conglomerate, which three years ago paid Dollars 150m for 25 per cent of the music group. Mr Branson also remains president for life of Virgin Music, and said yesterday: 'I get a really enormous salary but I won't tell you what it is.' Thorn is financing the acquisition by a one-for-four rights issue at 650p, a 17 per cent discount on yesterday's opening price of 785p, to raise Pounds 516m net of expenses. Because the deal is conditional on EC regulatory clearance, the issue falls in two parts. Shareholders will pay 40 per cent of the price immediately, and the balance on clearance and completion of the deal. If the deal is not cleared, the company will use the Pounds 211m raised from the first instalment to reduce debt. In the year to July 1991, Virgin Music made operating profits of Pounds 21.2m on turnover of Pounds 330.1m, compared with EMI Music's sales of Pounds 1.016bn and profits of Pounds 109m. Thorn takes on Pounds 50m of debt within Virgin Music Group. Mr Colin Southgate, Thorn's chairman, said yesterday its manufacturing and distribution, which Virgin lacked, would bring immediate savings. He expects to treble Virgin Music's profits in the first full year. On that basis, Thorn has told shareholders it expects no earnings dilution after the first year. The market welcomed that estimate, marking up the shares 21p at 806p. Thorn's path to world leadership Page 9 Market report Page 13 Lex Page 22</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Letter: Taurus the victim of unclear objectives Sir, The Taurus fiasco ('Stock market chief quits over Taurus', March 12) shows the folly of trying to implement complex information technology projects without clear objectives related to requirements of the end customer. In this case vested interests, particularly registrars with jobs on the line, appear to have been most in mind. Any first year computer student knows the problems involved in splitting up databases without real need. William of Ockham had it right first time - Keep it Simple, Stupid] Last July we changed our bank, and produced 30 or so unnecessarily complicated transfer forms on our own computer for the appropriate registrars: we are still fielding payment errors. Separate registrars are redundant in such a system; the whole process should be centralised and payment instructions altered on the authority of the registered beneficiary without the need for all trustees to sign. National Savings are much better organised and far less costly and bureaucratic, and we had few problems with other government departments. Smaller private investors without their own administrative back-up should steer clear of the stock market - with or without Taurus. Derek H Broome, Potters' End, Mears Ashby, Northampton NN6 0DZ</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Sharp fall in Euro car sales NEW car sales in west Europe fell by 9.4 per cent last month as demand dropped steeply for the third month in succession. In the first quarter new car sales declined by 17.3 per cent to around 3.06m. Sales in March declined to 1.18m from 1.3m in the same month a year earlier according to industry estimates. Demand in March was lower than a year ago in 15 of 17 markets across west Europe with higher sales registered only in the UK and in Greece. The rate of decline moderated in March following steep falls of 23 and 17 per cent in January and February, but leading carmakers are being forced to lower further their already pessimistic sales forecasts for the full year. General Motors, the US carmaker, said yesterday it now expected new car sales in west Europe to fall by 11 per cent to only 11.95m this year from 13.45m in 1992 compared with a 1993 forecast of 12.3m. In Germany, the single biggest market in west Europe, new car sales fell by 14.9 per cent in March to an estimated 363,000. Sales plunged by 21.7 per cent in the first quarter. Most leading carmakers in Europe have been forced to implement extensive short-time working and are cutting workforces in the face of shrinking profits or mounting losses. The rate of decline has accelerated in Italy, where new car registrations fell by 20.8 per cent in March to 190,000. New car sales in France in March were 9 per cent lower than a year ago, while demand in Spain dropped steeply by 22.7 per cent. The only significant relief to the downturn across Europe is being shown in the UK, where new car sales in March were 12.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Sales in the first quarter rose by 11.6 per cent. After plunging by a third during more than three years of recession new car sales in the UK have been higher than a year ago in each of the last six months. Rover, the UK car producer and a subsidiary of British Aerospace, increased its sales in west Europe by around 11 per cent to 86,000 in the first quarter supported by a 22 per cent increase in volume in the UK. Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, which recently disclosed a net loss of DM1.25bn (Dollars 750m) for the first quarter, suffered a 17.9 per cent fall in new car sales in west Europe in the first three months to 515,000. Mercedes-Benz, the German maker of executive and luxury cars, has been hardest hit with a 29 per cent sales decline in the first quarter.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MPK/MPN/GGD: "Mr. Havel Asks European Union </F> To Show Moral Dimension"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Strasbourg, 8 Mar (BELGA) -- "The development of the  European identity and its accessibility to everyone," is the  main challenge the European Union (EU) will have to meet if it  wants to ensure its viability, Czech Republic President Vaclav  Havel said, in substance, on Wednesday [2 March] to the European  Parliament [EP] in Strasbourg.    The Maastricht Treaty is a "remarkable work," a "perfect  machine," but this "grandiose administrative machinery" is  lacking a "spiritual, moral or emotional dimension," said Mr.  Havel during a speech that was loudly applauded by the members  of the European Parliament.    "Many people could have the impression that the EU consists  of interminable debates on the quantity of carrots that some  people are authorized to export to other people, or on the body  that sets or checks quotas," said the Czech head of state.    To remedy this situation, the EU must now engage in renewed  debate on the European identity, he added. He also suggested  that the EU draw up a charter clearly defining its major ideas,  its meaning, and the values to which it aims to give substance.  "If the citizens of Europe understand this is not just a  restrictive, anonymous bureaucratic monster that goes so far as  to deprive them of their identity, but a new model for the human  community, which, on the contrary, considerably broadens their  freedom, then the EU will have nothing to fear as regards its  future," he said.    Mr. Havel also reiterated the Czech Republic's wish to  accede  to the EU, although he did not set a date for accession, and  Europe's interest as a whole in seeing the EU expand by  insisting on the interdependence of the various regions of the  European continent.    European history shows that "calm, peace, and prosperity  cannot flourish in one part of Europe, without taking account of  what is happening in the other part," he added. "The Cold War  era, during which the cohesion imposed in the Soviet bloc  nourished the cohesion of the West, is definitely over," and the  events in the former Yugoslavia remind us that "disturbances,  chaos, and violence are, by nature, infectious and contagious,"  he continued.    He reminded the listeners that the Czech Republic and the EU  have been linked since last October by an association agreement.</p>

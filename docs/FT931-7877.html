			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (7): A world of locations - Venues, The choice is becoming more varied THERE was a time when conferences were considered an easy source of income by hoteliers and others who found themselves with large halls or bedrooms that would otherwise stand empty. Unwary conference bookers were faced with unreliable service, awkwardly shaped conference rooms and ever-rising charges. Now, however, conference planners find an industry with high standards and enormous capacity to fill during a recession. Customers can assume venues will be amenable to tough negotiations on price, without withdrawing the extras - high tech audiovisual equipment, notepads and soft drinks at each delegate's place, hairdriers and chocolates in every room - which have come to be expected. The recession has made many European clients anxious to avoid the appearance of extravagance, according to Ms Sally Greenhill, of conference production specialists Spectrum Communications. Conferences have become shorter, numbers smaller and locations less lavish, though high standards are still expected for meeting rooms, equipment and service, she says. Maturing markets also mean that demand for large conferences is levelling off or declining in most of Europe and the US, but the small meetings sector of the industry, encompassing training, internal management meetings and small conferences, continues to expand. On the other side of the world, there is still considerable room for growth in the Asia-Pacific region's conference market. There is already a wide choice of large venues in the region, with another ambitious conference centre due to open in Singapore next year, but there is space for more hotel development in some of the newly industrialised countries. Cultural differences mean the Asian market is developing in slightly different ways to the more established American and European markets, says Mr Geoffrey Breeze, vice-president for corporate marketing of Hilton International, part of Ladbroke. For example, Japanese companies tend to hold small meetings and training programmes in-house, so clients for Hilton's smaller meeting rooms in Japanese locations are mostly international rather than domestic companies, a reverse of the usual pattern. The Australian conference industry, with ties to both western and eastern markets, has seen rapid growth recently. In Sydney, 32 four- and five-star hotels have opened since the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre on Darling Harbour began operations in 1989. But the fast rate at which new accommodation and meeting space has come on line, combined with an economic slowdown, has left the new hotels competing harder for business, particularly at the international end of the market. However, Ms Lani Sullivan, sales director of Novotel's Sydney branch, says the Australian meetings industry has benefited from a government initiative which requires companies to spend 1 per cent of profits on training. Demand for small meeting rooms has soared. The growing sophistication of British conference planners and intense competition among meeting-space providers has led some operators to develop niche markets, while others have reacted by broadening their range. The De Vere hotel chain, which runs 26 four- and five-star conference hotels, has been forced to keep prices down, but by branching out into golf and other leisure pursuits it has raised the average spend by conference delegates, compensating for slimmer profits on core activities. Ms Janice Eagleson, group sales and marketing manager at De Vere, says that as another recession-surviving measure, the group decided against taking short cuts on quality, and risking the loss of long-standing customers. Instead, it aimed to increase volume. This has meant pointing out competitive rates for small meetings to clients who might normally use the chain only for their biggest events, and cross-marketing leisure breaks to conference guests, and conferences to single business travellers. Hotels no longer insist on separating different categories of guest. One company adopting the opposite approach is Hayley Enterprises, a subsidiary of A1 Exports, the car parts group. Hayley already owned one hotel, but saw a gap in the market for a small, business-oriented conference venue, free from the distractions of holidaymakers and children. Sedgbrook Hall, in 13 acres of grounds near Northampton, was the result. It opened a year ago, after Pounds 5m had been invested in converting the Victorian country house into meeting rooms, and building a new wing containing 60 four-star standard bedrooms, and hotel-type catering facilities. Sedgbrook Hall's client list is drawn from the top 100 companies, according to Mr Norman Bellone, its general manager, and the core business is training and management meetings. In its first year the centre had a turnover of Pounds 1.5m. 'People have got to communicate with each other, regardless of the fact that there is a recession on. In fact, they have to communicate with each other more,' says Mr Bellone. He attributes Sedgbrook Hall's success to its provision of a businesslike environment which facilitates communication and learning. For example, a common request from companies booking rooms for training purposes is for plentiful natural light. Specialist management centres frequently score better on this point than hotels, which have often been designed with evening social functions in mind. British universities have been used for conferences for decades, but not by most corporate conference organisers. However, Mrs Carole Formon, general secretary of the British Universities Accommodation Consortium, says that the recession has made companies take another look. 'If you hadn't been to a university for 10 years, and you went back now, you would see a tremendous difference,' she says. The 63 universities and colleges represented by the consortium, ranging from former polytechnics to 500-year-old Oxbridge colleges, have all made investments in upgrading facilities in recent years. Universities still cannot compete with purpose-built conference centres and luxury hotels when it comes to upmarket conferences for a few hundred people, but they do well at two opposite ends of the market: high attendance, low budget conferences, and smaller training and management seminar type events. What other kind of venue could provide meeting rooms, accommodation and catering facilities for several thousand people within walking distance, at an all-in 24 hour rate of Pounds 32? Students, as well as conference delegates, are now accustomed to greater creature comforts, and many universities are improving standards of student accommodation. More universities are moving upmarket by opening year-round management centres for meetings of up to 200 people. Whether purpose-built or converted from country houses, the centres are usually fitted out to at least three-star standard, with sophisticated audiovisual equipment. Unlike most university conference facilities, availability is not limited by the academic timetable. There are at least 30 such centres, with more due to open this year. Jaded conference planners, to whom all conference hotels are beginning to look alike, might be tempted by a novel meeting package put together by Stena Sealink, the ferry operator. It offers a one-day conference on board a ferry plying the Harwich-Hook of Holland line. Guests go on board in the morning, and by the time the ship sets sail at 11.30am, the conference can be under way in the purpose-built auditorium seating up to 230. Before disembarking next morning, delegates have the added attraction of stocking up in the ship's duty-free shop. Rates start at Pounds 74 per person for three meals, one night's use of an outside cabin, and conference room hire.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                            HOTEL SATISFACTION*  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Group             Average score    Group             Average score  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Ciga                   7.9**       Pullman/Sofitel        6.8 Inter-Continental      7.8         Scandic                6.7 Hyatt                  7.5         Ramada                 6.6 ITT Sheraton           7.4         Holiday Inn            6.6 SAS                    7.4         Concorde               6.6** Meridien               7.3         Forte                  6.4 Marriott               7.3         Penta                  6.4 Hilton International   7.2         Sol/Melia              6.3** Maritim                6.8**       Jolly Hotels           5.8**  -------------------------------------------------------------------- * Ratings obtained from European meeting planners **Fewer than 45 responses  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Official Meeting Facilities Guide (Reed International)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                      APPEAL OF DESTINATION  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Destination    Average score      Destination   Average score  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Paris              8.0            Los Angeles        6.4 Hawaii             7.8            Lisbon             6.4 Hong Kong          7.5            Budapest           6.3 Singapore          7.5            Brussels           6.3 New York           7.5            Edinburgh          6.2 Geneva             7.4            Copenhagen         6.1 London             7.4            Milan              5.9 Cannes             7.3            Stockholm          5.9 Monaco             7.3            Istanbul           5.8 Rome               7.1            Cyprus             5.8 Florence           7.1            Munich             5.8 Nice               7.1            Frankfurt          5.7 Vienna             7.0            Athens             5.6 Amsterdam          6.9            Dublin             5.6 Bangkok            6.8            Luxembourg         5.3 Barcelona          6.7            Marbella           5.3 Berlin             6.7            Helsinki           5.2 Madrid             6.4            Cairo              4.9 Miami              6.4            Dubai              4.3 Zurich             6.4            Glasgow            4.2  -------------------------------------------------------------------- * Ratings obtained from European meeting planners  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Official Meeting Facilities Guide (Reed International)  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

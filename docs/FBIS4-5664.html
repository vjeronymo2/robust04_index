			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- Executives of the  governing coalition parties agreed on Wednesday [13 April] to  continue efforts to synchronize their basic policies and install  a new government as quickly as possible.    Social Democratic Party (SDP) Secretary General Wataru Kubo  told a news conference that the coalition executives will seek  approval of their accord from their party leaders and resume  negotiations on Wednesday afternoon.    Kubo, the No. 2 man in the largest coalition contingent,  also  revealed that the executives agreed the coalition party leaders  have the final word on the choice of a successor to exiting  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the lineup of a new cabinet.    The eight-month-old coalition, an alliance of seven parties  spanning a wide political spectrum, moved to avert split on  Tuesday after days of wrangling over procedures to select a  successor to Hosokawa, who announced Friday he was resigning.    The governing parties on late Tuesday moved toward  maintaining their unity and staying in power together.    Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata has  emerged as the favorite for the premiership, political sources  said.    "Mr. Hata is the most likely candidate as new premier,"  Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, who is also the leader  of the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters Wednesday  morning.    The coalition may also agree to nominate kubo of the SDP as  new chief cabinet secretary, who serves as the top government  spokesman and chief of staff for the premier, the sources said.    Both houses of the Diet are expected to vote on a new  premier  early next week after Hata returns home from an international  trade meeting in Morocco, they said.    Hata, who heads Shinseito, a major component in the  coalition, left Tokyo on Wednesday and will return home on  Sunday.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the head of new  party Sakigake, however, said Wednesday the coalition leaders  must first discuss the shape of a new coalition government  before talking about the choice of a new premier.    Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has given up the idea of  defecting from the main opposition party and running for the  premiership, according to LDP sources.    Watanabe, who has signaled his readiness for such a move,  failed to muster a sufficient number of followers from among LDP  members, the sources said.    He is scheduled to meet LDP President Yohei Kono later  Wednesday to compare notes on the selection of an LDP candidate  for the premiership, they said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 23 Feb (INA)--A source from the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] today accused northern Yemeni forces,  including the al-'Amaliqah brigade, of continuing to expand and  deploy to confront southern forces close to the border between  the two parts of Yemen. In a statement over Aden television a  short while ago, the source said that the southern forces have  been defending their positions since last night.    The source said that the al-'Amaliqah forces, the  presidential guard, the central security forces, and other units  are still expanding and deploying in three border areas of Sabil  Yahya, al- Raqma', and Saqab [names as received] in Abyan  Governorate in the direction of the al-Dali' border area.    The source said armed clashes took place between the al-  'Amaliqah brigade and the southern Madram [name as received]  brigade and the 39th infantry battalion stationed 100 km from  al- 'Amaliqah. He said the southern units are still repelling  the al- 'Amaliqah attack that began last night. The source did  not mention human or material losses sustained during the  clashes.    On another level, Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas  has announced that the recent Abyan military clashes have  resulted in a number of casualties among the Yemeni Armed Forces.    In remarks upon arrival in Aden from the Sultanate of Oman  today, al-'Attas said that the recent military incidents have  escalated the Yemeni crisis to an unprecedented level. He said:  "We did not expect such a thing from our brothers," alluding to  north Yemen with which an agreement was signed in Amman recently.    Al-'Attas said that there is no way out of this crisis  except  by adhering to dialogue and by strict compliance with what has  been agreed upon.</p>

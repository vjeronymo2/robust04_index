			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 27 Apr (PL) -- Zambian President Frederick  Chiluba visited places of economic and social interest in Cuba  today to strengthen bilateral cooperation, he said. The  president, on an official and friendly visit to our nation upon  invitation from his Cuban counterpart, Fidel Castro, visited an  agricultural cooperative in western Havana Province and  "Hermanos Ameijeiras" Hospital, one of the country's most  important. Cuban Health Ministry sources said 22 Cuban  specialists render their services in that southern Africa  nation, and we hope to increase that number.    The Zambian Government has stated its interest in reaching  cooperation agreements in the sugar industry and its  derivatives, the pharmaceutical industry, and the public health  and sports sectors.    Local Foreign Ministry sources have announced plans for the  construction of a sugar refinery by Cuban technicians, and  Lusaka will finance all the operations. The exchange of trainers  in several sport disciplines, such as boxing, soccer, and  baseball, is also expected.    Chiluba was awarded the "Jose Marti" national order, the  highest distinction granted by the Cuban Government, and he held  official conversations with Fidel Castro, during which they  discussed issues dealing with current international politics and  the situation in Angola.    The Zambian delegation will leave for Varadero Beach,  approximately 100 km east of the capital, tomorrow and will  travel next Friday to the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba,  where many young people from this African nation study.</p>

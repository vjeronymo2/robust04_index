			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Arts: Drama strong on flashback - Television It is remarkable how often television dramas come along in pairs: two set in India, two about ancient history, two with eccentric policemen as their main characters. Last night's Anglo-Saxon Attitudes on ITV was the second within three days to begin its opening episode with the digging up of a skull, to feature Douglas Hodge (who played Declan in Capital City) in one of the main roles, and to use flashback not merely as a routine technique but as a primary structural element. The other was A Fatal Inversion which began on BBC1 on Sunday. If you watched Anglo-Saxon Attitudes last night you will presumably need little urging to watch the other two parts. If you missed it, find someone with a cassette and bribe them if necessary to lend it so that you can catch up before next week's episode. This is one of those rare television productions in which everything works well: writing, acting, direction, locations, even the period detail which, refreshingly, is not rammed under our noses. I cannot be so sure in the case of A Fatal Inversion, having seen only the first of the three episodes, but this, being a mystery story written by Ruth Rendell under her 'Barbara Vine' pseudonym, is if anything even more compelling in its narrative tension. Having seen the hares that were set running in the opening episode it would be unthinkable to miss the other two. Whether you consider it fortunate to have two such excellent serials appearing simultaneously, or irritating not to have them better spaced out, presumably depends upon your attitude: do you see a glass as half full or half empty? Since A Fatal Inversion is a thriller it is unlikely that there will be much talk about whether Sandy Welch's adaptation takes liberties with the original but, given Angus Wilson's reputation and especially the increase in regard since his death, we can expect those who would like to be thought 'literary' to start squawking as usual about lack of faithfulness in Andrew Davies' adaptation of Anglo-Saxon Attitudes. It is nonsense of course. Does anyone care that Laurents changed the Montagues and Capulets into Jets and Sharks for West Side Story? If so, what do they say about the liberties Shakespeare took when he pinched the story from Brooke's Tragicall Historye Of Romeus And Juliet? Or the way that Brooke played fast and loose in adapting from Boaistuau? Or Boaistuau's casualness when he lifted the story from Bandello's 'Novelle'? What we have in Anglo-Saxon Attitudes, regardless of its literary antecedents, is splendid television, full of solidly three dimensional characters, inhabiting a wholly believable world, with social, political, sexual and historical comment whizzing off like sparks from a catherine wheel. Set in the 1950s, but with its plot originating in an archaeological dig in 1912, it is essentially a comedy of manners largely concerned with the idiosyncracies and hypocrisies of the English middle classes. Davies, now established as one of the best writers for the medium, either of his own work (A Very Peculiar Practice) or of adaptations from others (most recently Amis's Old Devils) has, of course, used techniques which rarely succeed on the printed page. As any true master of television (for example Dennis Potter) knows, you can move through time and space more easily in this medium than in print. Davies toggles effortlessly between 1912 and 1950 and, having established Gerald Middleton as both a young man (Hodge) and older man (Richard Johnson with a quiet and controlled but utterly telling performance), he occasionally inserts the older version of Middleton into the flashbacks when we are, naturally, expecting the younger. The effect is a peculiarly powerful conflation of youth and age into a single life. Because this serial tells the story of two generations of an English middle class family with one important in-comer from Europe, repeatedly uses flashback, and contains some explicit sex, it is difficult to avoid comparisons with The Camomile Lawn, but Anglo-Saxon Attitudes surely comes out well ahead. In The Camomile Lawn incident followed incident as one link in a chain follows another; the sex scenes, for instance, were quite fun but only loosely connected to other events and scarcely central to the plot. But in Anglo-Saxon Attitudes it is vital that we appreciate the sexual passion between the young Gerald and Dollie if we are to understand the subsequent void at the centre of Gerald's life and the failure of his relationship with wife and family. In this drama the development of plot and character is more like the construction of a building, with the ground floor depending on the foundations, the first floor on the ground floor, and so on. It is honest, comic, enlightening and entertaining, so self righteous lectures about television failing to stick to every last detail in the book should be seen for what they are: yet another example of the widespread desire to appear superior to television. No doubt there will be fewer squeaks of concern over A Fatal Inversion because less is expected of a thriller and there are fewer brownie points to be gained from an officious defence of the book. Yet the opening episode suggests that we have here a very superior thriller indeed. This time the flashbacks are across only 12 years, and the evidence suggests that Hodge will be giving his best television performance to date as the young father and successful professional looking back to a teenage summer that began idyllically in the big country house which he inherited that year. In the opening episode director Tim Fywell captured that quality of youth which sometimes seems like innocence, sometimes like idiocy, sometimes like mere inexperience: it is manifest in the unspoken assumption that life is endless and that there is consequently infinite time to laze, argue, or make love. It is a characteristic which few of us are lucky enough to sustain beyond the age of about 20 and it is not the sort of thing which is easy to convey in a television drama, yet here it seeped out of every frame. The tension arose from the stark contrast between that idyll and the suspicions aroused by the discovery of the human remains in the grounds of the country house. What on earth happened that summer, and whodunnit? It would take a very cold fish not to tune in next week. Saturday brought the opening episodes of two new four-part drama series, The Nightmare Years on Channel 4 and Frankie's House on ITV. Each is about a young man newly arrived in a foreign country dominated by its military forces, in each case the man works for a news agency, in each case, as we know from history, a major war is in the offing, and both stories are about real people. In The Nightmare Years American William Shirer has just arrived in Berlin in 1934, and in Frankie's House Englishman Tim Page has just arrived in Saigon in 1964.</p>

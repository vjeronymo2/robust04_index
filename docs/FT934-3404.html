			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Colosio plays up role of Mexican democrat Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling party, is to invite independent observers to evaluate next year's election, allow external auditing of the country's electoral roll and periodically publish his campaign finances. The proposals formed the central part of a speech delivered last night, in which Mr Colosio accepted the presidential nomination from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party. Mr Colosio promised a 'democratic transformation' of Mexico, a much stronger pledge than ever made by outgoing President Carlos Salinas. The overwhelming favourite to win next year's election, he also outlined his economic and social programme for the next six years should he be elected president. While underlining his commitment to low inflation and sound public finances, he described a more activist industrial and social policy than pursued by Mr Salinas. The PRI has been in power for more than six decades, and many of the electoral victories, including that which brought Mr Salinas to power, have been marred by charges of fraud and ballot-rigging. Mr Colosio's democratic proposals seem part of campaign to assure the public his party can win cleanly. He promised that 'the PRI does not need nor want a single vote outside the margin of the law'. In response to those who attack the excessive power of the Mexican president, he called for a reform of Mexico's government which would strengthen Congress, improve the system of justice, and expand human rights. Reducing poverty would be his government's top priority. 'The most important commitment of my government would be to better the lot of those who have least,' he said.</p>

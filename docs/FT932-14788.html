A year earlier, Microsoft earned Dollars 179m, or 69 cents. Revenues in the three months to March 31 soared nearly 41 per to Dollars 958m. Most analysts had expected earnings of about 78 cents a share.

Nine-month revenues grew nearly 40 per cent, to Dollars 2.71bn from Dollars 1.94bn. Mr Frank Gaudette, chief financial officer, said: 'We have expanded core businesses, introduced new product lines and maintained our emphasis on operating efficiencies.' Microsoft has licensed more than 25m copies of its Windows operating system since its debut in 1990. Windows is pre-installed in about 60 per cent of personal computers.

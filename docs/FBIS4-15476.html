			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 7 Apr (TANJUG) -- The sanctions against  Yugoslavia have become meaningless and should be abolished as  soon as possible. This is the main conclusion reached during  the talks in Moscow this evening between Ivan Rybkin, chairman  of the Russian State Duma, and members of the Yugoslav Assembly  delegation led by Radoman Bozovic, speaker of the Chamber of  Citizens.    The delegation arrived in Moscow today at the invitation of  the Russian parliament. This is the first official visit of the  Yugoslav parliamentary delegation to a foreign country -- at the  invitation of partners -- since the introduction of the  sanctions against Yugoslavia.    The Yugoslav delegation includes: Borisav Jovic, Milan  Komnenic, Milan Gajovic and Milan Rochen, Yugoslav charge  d'affaires in Moscow.    The talks focused on parliamentary cooperation, the  situation  in the two countries and in former Yugoslavia, as well as on  possibilities for ending the conflict and abolishing the  sanctions.    In a statement for Yugoslav reporters after the meeting,  Ivan  Rybkin said the sanctions against Yugoslavia are unacceptable --  this being his personal opinion and the opinion of the majority  of Russian deputies. In his words it is first necessary to  secure peace and this is the order of things which must be  respected. Rybkin said that the conflict must be resolved in a  peaceful way and that many international factors are involved in  this process.    In his statement for the journalists Radoman Bozovic said  that the Russian State Duma is the place where the essence of  the Yugoslav crisis and the pointlessness of the sanctions are  best understood. He added that only a just peace can be  permanent and stable. He is convinced that the sanctions are  not only pointless but also that they fail to help resolve the  crisis in Yugoslavia -- they are harmful and suit the advocates  of war.    We were pleased to hear, Bozovic said, that all deputies'  groups share this opinion and that they have influence on the  Russian Government and the international public concerning the  sanctions, which are punishing a nation and encouraging those  who favor continuing the war.    The Yugoslav parliamentary delegation, which will spend  several days in Moscow, will resume talks with Russian officials  tomorrow.</p>

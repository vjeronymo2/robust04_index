			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhuo (3769 3820): "The Law of Reproduction </F> and the Mechanism of Market Regulation"]    [Text] As a market mechanism for regulating the  distribution of production factors, the law of value is an  important regulatory mechanism for invoking the law of  reproduction. When pursuing the the socialist market economy  system, we should pay special attention to both the law of value  and the law of reproduction. Here, the law of reproduction  refers to the objective inevitability of distributing the  quantity of labor in society according to a certain proportion.  In ordinary language, that is, economic development requires a  balance between gross supply and demand, and a well-balanced  structure. If this balance and harmonious relationship are  upset, the law of reproduction is being violated and the benign  cycle of social reproduction inevitably will be disrupted.  Therefore, we should make clear the relationship between the law  of value and the law of reproduction.  <H5>  Importance Should Be Attached to Both the Law of Value and </H5> the Law of Reproduction    The law of value plays a role in regulating the distribution  of the production factors in the production of different  commodities. This regulatory mechanism functions through changes  in the market price signals. Under the conditions of a market  economy, commodity prices are determined by two basic factors:  First, the necessary quantity of labor in society for the  production of a certain commodity; second, the condition of  supply and demand with regard to this commodity. Provided the  necessary quantity of labor in society for the production of a  certain commodity remains unchanged, what determines the changes  in the commodity's price is the condition of supply and demand  in the market. In general, if the supply of a certain commodity  increases to a degree exceeding market demand, the price of the  commodity will fall to the level below its value. According to  this market signal, enterprises will redistribute production  factors and shift part of their resources from the production of  the oversupplied commodity to the production of other  commodities. On the contrary, if the demand for a certain  commodity increases and the commodity becomes in short supply,  its price will rise to a level above its value. Enterprises  then will redistribute production factors according to this  market signal and will shift more resources to the production of  the commodity in short supply. From the simplified example, we  may clearly see three points: 1) It is the objective proportion  in the law of reproduction that determines whether a certain  commodity is oversupplied or is in short supply, and this is not  determined simply by the law of value. 2) It is the objective  proportion in the law of reproduction that determines how much  and to where the production factors will be shifted, and this is  not determined simply by the law of value, either. 3) Being  determined by the law of reproduction, the law of value is  turned into a market regulation mechanism for adjusting the  distribution of production factors among different commodities  (enterprises and departments). Under the conditions of  large-scale social conditions, without the invisible hand of  market regulation, it is hard to smoothly meet the objective  requirements of the law of reproduction. Therefore, we must  attach great importance to the regulatory role of the law of  value, thus ensuring that the market mechanism plays a basic  role in the distribution of resources.    Opinion once held that the law of value did not play any  regulatory role in the realm of production. I think this is an  erroneous theoretical generalization, but we also should notice  the blindness of the law of value. Therefore, the adjustment of  resource distribution cannot rely merely on the invisible hand  of the market force; it requires another, visible hand: The  macro-control mechanism based on social interests.  <H5>  Maintain the Benign Cycle of Social Reproduction </H5>   This is a historical subject in the study of Western  economics over the past nearly 100 years. In the past, Western  economists stressed simple reliance on the invisible hand in  order to adjust the distribution of production factors, to  perfect the realization of the law of reproduction, and to avoid  economic and unemployment crises caused by overproduction. The  outbreak of the Great Depression in the capitalist world in the  1930's proved the thorough failure of this theory. The  replacement was the academic school represented by Keynes, who  advocated the market economy with the state's macroeconomic  intervention. It admitted that without the macro-intervention  of the state, the invisible hand alone would not be able to  adjust the distribution of the production factors reasonably,  would not be able to perfect the realization of the law of  reproduction, and would not be able to avoid economic and  unemployment crises. However, the stag-flation in the  capitalist countries in the 1970's posed a new challenge to  Keynesian theory. Facts show that the primary precondition for  maintaining the benign cycle of reproduction is a reasonable  economic system. The greatest obstacle to the realization of  the law of reproduction under the capitalist system is the lack  of effective market demand. This is not a contradiction that  can be solved by any economic structure. The contradiction is a  product of the capitalist system, and is a phenomenon derived  from the law of surplus value of capital. When the capitalist  class is pursuing the exploitation of surplus value, on one  hand, it deprives the working class of part of their consumption  demand; on the other hand, it accumulates a huge quantity of  capital. When the capital is used to expand reproduction, it  encounters the contradiction caused by the relatively  insufficient consumption demand of the working class. This is  the inherent antagonistic contradiction in the capitalist  system. Even the most ideal model of the market economy can  bring about only some stopgap measures to mitigate the  contradiction, but can never remove it.    The effort to realize the law of reproduction under the  socialist system will encounter no obstacle caused by the  system, but will encounter theoretical and structural obstacles.  In the development of the socialist system over the past more  than 70 years, there were a number of theoretical and structural  errors. In the 1930's, for example, socialist construction gave  priority to the development of heavy industry, and the  production of consumer goods developed very slowly and lagged  behind the increase in purchasing power. This gave rise to the  phenomenon of disproportion. Some people regarded this as an  objective law. This then gave rise to the demand-inflationary  economy in the form of value and the supply-shortage economy in  the form of real materials. Both the inflationary economy and  the shortage economy were specific demonstrations of violations  of the law of reproduction. The erroneous theory had a  prevailing impact over a fairly long period of time.    Another more serious error was the viewpoint that regarded  the commodity economy as incompatible with the socialist system,  holding that only the highly centralized planned economy was  representative of the essential requirement of the socialist  system and that only such an economic structure could ensure the  planned and proportionate development of the national economy.  According to this viewpoint, under the socialist system, only  if economic regulation was done artificially by the planning  mechanism, would the law of reproduction be invoked smoothly,  and there was no need for any regulation by the market  mechanism. Moreover, the structure of the planned economy was  oriented to and served state interests only, and ignored or  negated enterprise, local, and other interests. Economic  management was highly centralized in the hands of the state  authorities. Localities, departments, and enterprises could  only "eat from the big pot" of the state, and they all stretched  out their hands to scrabble resources from the state.  Corresponding to this excessively centralized economic  structure was the administrative control mechanism in the  process of macroeconomic management. As a result, the  enthusiasm of the masses was dampened, and the state also failed  to guarantee the harmonious and stable development of the  national economy.    In the course of invoking the law of reproduction, a  socialist country does not encounter the contradiction caused by  the insufficiency of effective demand; on the contrary, it is  repeatedly faced with the contradiction caused by the swelling  effective demand. This is not a problem caused by the system,  but a structural problem. To solve this contradiction, it is  necessary to carry out economic structural reform, through which  state-owned enterprises are changed from government affiliates  into commodity producers bearing sole responsibility for their  own profits and losses, and the modern enterprise system can be  established. At the same time, it is necessary to use the  market mechanism to conduct economic regulation. However, such  macroeconomic adjustment must be put in place mainly by economic  means. Thus, invisible and visible hands will function jointly  to regulate the operation of the economy, and the development of  the socialist market economy will meet the requirements of law  of reproduction and effect a benign cycle of social reproduction.</p>

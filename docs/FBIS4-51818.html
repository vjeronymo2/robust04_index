			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 25 (YONHAP) -- A Seoul court Monday  granted a suspended sentence to the vice chairman of a shipping  company affiliated with the Hyundai Group, the nation's largest  conglomerate, accused of tax evasion and forming a "secret fund."    Upholding a lower court's ruling, the Seoul appellate court  sentenced Chong Mong-hon, 47, vice chairman of Hyundai Merchant  Marine Co., to three years in prison but suspended the jail term  for five years, saying, "the accused contributed greatly to the  national economic growth while serving the nation's leading  conglomerate. Furthermore, he did not appropriate the secret  fund for private use," although he was found guilty of having  formed the secret fund illegally.    On the count of violating the foreign exchange control law,  the court acquitted Chong, saying his company did not borrow  money from an American firm but just "stood security" for a  Hyundai subsidiary in America to borrow money from a U.S. bank.    Three other former employees of Hyundai Merchant Marine  including former President Pak Se-yong, 54, charged in  connection with the tax evasion and foreign exchange control  violations, were all given suspended jail terms ranging from  three to four years.    Chong and the others were arrested by the prosecution and  accused of evading taxes totaling 5.5 billion won (about 7  million dollars) and forming a 21.1-billion-won secret fund from  1987 to 1991 by manipulating the company's documents, including  yearly project reports and the minutes of senior staff meetings.</p>

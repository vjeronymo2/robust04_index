			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Cost-cutting and weaker krona boosts SSAB profit COST-CUTTING and the weaker krona helped SSAB, the Swedish steel group, more than double first-half pre-tax profits to SKr338m (Dollars 42.5m) from SKr128m despite the difficult market conditions which continued to depress sales. The group, privatised last year, said it had cut processing costs by 5 per cent since the 1992 first half and by 10 per cent since 1990. Staff numbers have fallen by 2.5 per cent to 9,700 since the year-end. Lower volumes led to a 2 per cent decline in sales to SKr6.35bn, even though prices were 3 per cent higher in krona terms because of the weakening of the Swedish currency. The group's steel plate division, SSAB Tunnplat, lifted profits to SKr58m from SKr16m, while the heavy plate unit boosted profits to SKr109m from SKr55m. Both the building products division, Plannja, and the Tibnor trading unit returned to the black, with profits of SKr33m and SKr13m respectively. SSAB said it expected to make a profit in the second-half for the first time since 1990. Last year it made a SKr165m loss.</p>

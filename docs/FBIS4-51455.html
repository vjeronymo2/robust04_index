			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] The Government is likely to grant a tourist visa to  Wu'er Kaixi, a leading Tiananmen Square student activist, if he  promises to maintain a low profile and does not declare his  intention to take part in open political activities during his  planned July visit.    Despite intense Chinese criticism, the Government also  intends to continue giving sanctuary to Han Dongfang, one of  China's best-known labour activists. A senior government  official said last night that Wu'er's application for a visa  would be considered on its merits, adding that the decision  would also have to take into account public interest. However,  it is understood that Wu'er has not yet applied for a visa.    Last week, Wu'er said he intended to visit Hong Kong "to see  friends" in late June and July. A Chinese official reacted to  this angrily on Wednesday, and accused the Government of  intending to turn Hong Kong into a "subversive base" by  sheltering Han, who has returned to Hong Kong from the United  States.    China's condemnation was rejected yesterday by the  Government. A spokesman said Han's case had nothing to do with  allowing him to use Hong Kong as a "subversive base". "We  simply gave him a visa to stay here so that he can continue to  press his case with the Chinese authorities to return to China."    The deputy to the Governor, Anson Chan, said yesterday that  it was for the Government to maintain and safeguard the basic  freedoms of the Hong Kong people. "These basic freedoms include  the freedom to express one's views freely in a peaceful and  lawful manner.    "The question of offering hospitality for visitors to Hong  Kong who might use Hong Kong as a base for subversion is quite a  different matter. Neither the Hong Kong government nor the Hong  Kong people wish to see Hong Kong being used as a base for  subversion and we intend fully to abide by the concept of "one  country, two systems" and, of course, this is a two-way street."    It is understood that Chan's remarks were in response to  rumours that some Chinese democratic movement activists were  heading for Hong Kong to attend or organise public gatherings to  commemorate the fifth anniversary of the June 4 massacre.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- Papers here today carry  articles upon the beginning of "the week of support to the  struggle of the Palestinian people."    Stating that various forms of activities supporting the just  cause of the Palestinian people and expressing solidarity with  it will take place in Korea during the week, NODONG SINMUN says:    The Korean people have consistently supported the  Palestinian  people's struggle for retaking the lost territories and  restoring their legitimate national rights.    The agreement on Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho  signed between Palestine and Israel on May 4 was a fruition of  the Palestinian people's patient efforts.    If the Palestinian issue is to be finally resolved, Israel  must completely withdraw from the occupied lands. The master of  the Palestinian issue is the Palestinian people themselves. The  Korean people hope that the agreement will serve as a foundation  for the founding of an independent state.    MINJU CHOSON declares that the Korean people will as ever  fully support the just cause of the Palestinian people.</p>

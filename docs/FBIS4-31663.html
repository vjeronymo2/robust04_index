			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "A Realistic Green Philosophy"] </F>   [Text] The Slovak Green Party has been registered under  the altered name of Slovak Green Alternative (SZA). The SZA's  objective is to constitute the party on a realistic approach to  green philosophy, a philosophy that will push for the optimum  relationship between Slovakia's economic development and a  healthy environment. This is the guarantee for a healthy and  also socially secure individual and whole of society. The SZA  Preparatory Committee is organizing the party's constituent  congress on 18 June in Nitra. A decision will also be made on a  coalition partner at the congress. The Preparatory Committee has  held informative coalition talks with representatives from the  Association of Slovak Workers (ZRS) and the Slovak National  Party (SNS). Coalition talks will also be held in the near  future with representatives of the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia.</p>

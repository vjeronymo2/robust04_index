			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Oftel is urged to order BT price cut BT, THE telecommunications group, should be required to make a one-off cut in its prices because it is earning 'excess' profits, consumer organisations said yesterday. The National Consumer Council and the Consumers' Association, the UK's two leading consumer groups, argued that consumers should receive a cut in phone bills as part of price controls being negotiated by BT and Oftel, the industry watchdog. That would be in addition to annual price cuts, which are expected to be a part of the deal. The council said BT's profits were high enough to allow a 6 per cent across-the-board price cut or a 20 per cent reduction in rental and connection charges. Both organisations said in evidence to Oftel that BT's profits - Pounds 3.1bn in the 1990-91 financial year - were not solely the result of efficiency. They also resulted from higher-than-expected levels of inflation in the past few years. Oftel refused to comment on the submissions by the consumer groups. In the past, though, it has been reluctant to contemplate one-off cuts in BT's prices, preferring gradual annual adjustments. BT said its price formula, which requires it to cut the price of a basket of its main services by 6.25 per cent less than inflation each year, was the toughest for any UK utility. 'Making a profit is not a mortal sin,' it said. The council also argued that residential users had lost out badly as a result of competition between BT and Mercury. BT is trebling the staff at its software development centre in Glasgow with a Pounds 5.5m investment which will create 200 jobs for software engineers, James Buxton writes. The centre was set up in 1988 to develop software to support BT's service and network management systems. BT's new investment in the centre has received a large grant from the Scottish Office and the project is assisted by the Glasgow Development Agency, part of Scottish Enterprise, the development body.</p>

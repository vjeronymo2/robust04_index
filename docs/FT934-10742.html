			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / A Dollars 7m curtain callfor Degas' dancers: Saleroom A 14 x 19 inch pastel by Degas of two young dancers taking a curtain call sold for Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.76m) at Christie's in New York on Tuesday night. The price, almost double the pre-sale estimate, helped to confirm the slow improvement in the international art market. Christie's auction of 60 lots brought in Dollars 51.37m, (Pounds 34.7m) and only 15 of the lots on offer failed to find a buyer. But among the casualties was the second most important painting in the sale, 'Maternite' by Renoir, depicting his wife breast-feeding their son. It was bought in at Dollars 4.8m. An encouraging feature of the auction was the breadth of buyer interest for works fresh to the market. The Monet went to a private European collector while the second highest price, Dollars 3.96m, was paid by an American collector for a Pissarro view of Dieppe. Most major lots sold on or near estimates. Mondrian's minimalist 'Composition avec bleu, rouge and jaune' made Dollars 3.5m; a rare landscape by Kandinsky, showing him moving towards abstraction, sold for Dollars 2.75m; and a typical work by the Fauve artist Derain of boats at the port of Collioure realised Dollars 2.6m. The auction, the most important this winter by Christie's, suggests serious collectors are being tempted by fresh works, carrying resonable reserves. The speculative frenzy of the late 1980s is quite absent.</p>

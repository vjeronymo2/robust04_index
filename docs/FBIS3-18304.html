			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Leo Wieland: "The Foreign Trade President"] </F>   [Text] The cultivation of normal international relations  is not one of President Clinton's strengths. In contrast to his  predecessors Bush and Reagan, who were influenced by experiences  gained during the war and the post-war period, the younger  Clinton has a different image of the world. Even though in  security issues he firmly supports the Transatlantic Alliance  with NATO as the core and framework, his latest trip to Europe  cannot hide the fact that the interest in the Old World has  weakened, while attention to Asia has increased.    Some traditional allies, who -- like Margaret Thatcher's  Great Britain -- had a "special relationship" with the White  House, feel the atmospheric changes. Prime Minister Major, who  is expected to visit Washington at the end of February, must  accept that shortly before his visit, Clinton granted a visa to  IRA-friendly Irishman Gerry Adams -- disregarding his advisers'  recommendations and protests from London.    However, the fact that Clinton dedicates only a limited  amount of time to foreign affairs and has a weak team, which  lacks both Shultz's moral authority as well as Baker's  diplomatic skills, does not mean that he does not have any  foreign policy. Its focus is foreign trade. As the U.S.  foreign trade policy president, Clinton has placed greater  emphasis on his interest in a "fair share" for his country and  has prepared old friends and new partners for greater egotism.  Thus, he did not shy away from open discussions with Prime  Minister Hosokawa and frankly stated that he prefers no  agreement over an "empty agreement." The Japanese, who have  promised to open their markets for decades, but have instead  busily increased their enormous trade surplus with the United  States, now have to expect sanctions, regardless of free trade.    Almost all of the six foreign policy priorities, which  Secretary of State Christopher formulated at Clinton's order --  economic security, reform in Russia, new shaping of NATO, trade  with the Far East, peace in the Middle East, and nuclear  nonproliferation -- are directly or indirectly connected with  the economy. Clinton himself thinks that the conclusion of the  GATT talks, the ratification of the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA), and the attempts at rapprochement at the  American-Pacific economic conference (APEC) are among his most  important successes so far.    Lifting the longstanding trade embargo against Vietnam also  fits his political geography, which is linked more strongly with  interests. In addition to the desire to strengthen Hanoi's  readiness to cooperate in the search for missing U.S. soldiers,  the complaint of U.S. businessmen that they would lose a  potentially lucrative market in Indochina also played an  essential role. The smoldering quarrel about an extension of  the most-favored-nation clause for the PRC -- Clinton must  decide on an extension by summer -- also has two facets: human  rights and the determination to use this means of pressure to  urge for a balance of the trade balance, which shows an extreme  surplus (similar to Japan) for China.    The exception from the economically motivated exercises in  loosening up is right on the U.S. door step: Cuba. So far,  Clinton has not shown any inclination to lift the 30-year  blockade of the Castro regime or even just the restrictions on  travel. The sugar island, which is no longer a military threat  to Washington because it has lost its godfather in Moscow, would  certainly be a market. However, in this case, other  considerations are important, apart from the historical and  political ones. In contrast to the 10 million Cubans who have  become poor in communism, there are 1 million refugees who are  living and prospering in Florida. They have influence, votes,  and the means to fill the election campaign coffers of  candidates for president and Congress. As long as Castro clings  to power, Cuba is, therefore, primarily part of U.S. domestic  policy.    Because of his increasingly criticized "fixation" on Russia,  Clinton announced that he will put his ostpolitik on a slightly  broader basis and include the other states of the former Soviet  Union more. This was done in the interest of denuclearizing  Ukraine. Ukrainian President Kravchuk can now go on his  longed-for trip to the United States. Something similar was  done this week during the visit by Kazakh President Nazarbayev.  Clinton praised him twice: for economic reforms and for the  confirmed desire for disarmament.    Thanks to its enormous oil and natural gas reserves, which  are developed mainly with the participation of U.S. companies,  Kazakhstan is an attractive partner. On this occasion, Clinton  advised Nazarbayev, who still seems to be unsure regarding his  tactics, to lay his export pipelines rather through Russia than  through the territory of America's archenemy Iran. The trade  relations between Iran and the FRG, which are uncannily  intensive from Washington's point of view, are still a factor of  irritation in the U.S.-German relationship, even though they are  essentially based on an attitude, which is orientated toward  Germany's own economic prosperity -- an attitude that is not  alien to Clinton's pragmatic administration in other fields.</p>

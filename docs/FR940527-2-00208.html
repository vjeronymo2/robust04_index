While declining to identify any particular type of proposed project as superior, HUD is identifying several criteria which must be addressed within the project design, in order for the application to receive the maximum project impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications must include a well developed description of homeownership needs in the applicant jurisdiction, focusing particularly on the needs of low- and moderate-income persons. The description also should include, if applicable, any alternative approaches which have been considered in meeting homeownership needs. Project feasibility must be addressed as part of the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application must demonstrate that the proposed project would make effective use of all available funds. This would include any local, State or other Federal funds which would be utilized by the proposed project. If other such funds are included as part of the proposed project, the applicant must demonstrate that such funds are committed and truly available for the project. Any efforts which would affirmatively further fair housing, by promoting homeownership among minorities as well as homeownership throughout the community, must be outlined in the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application must explain how the project would benefit low- and moderate-income homebuyers, particularly focusing on first-time and minority homebuyers. The application also should address any homeownership counseling services, including counseling pertaining to Federal, State, and local fair housing laws and requirements, which would be provided to persons selected to participate in the proposed project. Finally, the application should describe how the project would utilize public/private partnerships to promote homeownership, particularly in the sense that private sector financing would be accessible, as necessary, to project participants to complement available public sector funds, including CDBG money.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD will review each application which meets the threshold against the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Maximum (400 Points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Project design is appropriate to meet demonstrated homeownership need and alternative approaches to meeting the need are shown to have been considered. Additionally, there are no feasibility questions regarding the implementation and execution of the proposed project according to the schedule. 2. The application documents serious homeownership needs in the community and the proposed project would make effective use of available funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

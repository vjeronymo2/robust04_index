			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 15 March carries in its  regular 5-minute newscast the following reports on the fighting  in the republic.    Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports on the  situation  in the area and says that "several 120-mm howitzer shells were  fired at the town center this morning, while antiaircraft  machine guns and snipers are blasting away at all the  residential areas of the town."    Mirza Sadikovic, reporting from Bihac, says that "since 2200  last night until the time of filing this report, it seems that  the fighting has abated somewhat. The Bihac town center and  Cazin are being targeted less frequently. However, mortars and  howitzers are still targeting the outskirts of both the Cazin  and Bihac municipalities, as well as roads and the Bihac  industrial zone. Although less intensely, artillery and  antiaircraft weapons are still active on the defense lines.  There has been an intensification of sniper activity. In the  early morning hours, 10 tank and mortar shells were fired at the  Grmusko-Srbljanksi plateau and Grabez. Moreover, there was some  activity overnight on the (?Stotejski) and Pljesivica part of  the front which is part of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO]  operational zone. Provocations have also been registered last  night and this morning on the confrontation lines with the  remnants of the so-called para-army of the Kladusa autonomy."    An unidentified correspondent from the 3d Corps Information  Center reports that "the cease-fire with the HVO is mostly  holding. Only single extremist soldiers have violated the  cease-fire with small arms provocations in the Lasva River  valley and around Gornji Vakuf."    Correspondent Enes Sakic reports from the 4th Corps Press  Center in Mostar and says that "in the region of the North  Operative Group, the cease-fire has been observed by both sides.  Only the forces of the Serbian aggressor used howitzers and  mortars to shatter the calm."    An unnamed correspondent from the 1st Corps Information  Center says that "this morning again shows that the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army troops are the only ones who are  observing the cease-fire, while the Chetniks started their  activity early this morning from their positions around the  city. A sniper wounded one of our (?soldiers) in the region of  Stup, while another two soldiers were wounded in Dobrinja.  Therefore, it is to be expected that the chetnik killers,  unscrupulous yet sadly unpunished, will today continue their  activities, so citizens are warned to exercise the usual caution  when moving around the city."</p>

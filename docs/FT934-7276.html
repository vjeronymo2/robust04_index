			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A tax with no supporters Sir, The 75 Conservative MPs who recently expressed deep unease about the planned imposition of VAT on domestic fuel ('Many Tory MPS want deeper spending cuts', November 15) were, in my judgment, a very accurate reflection of Tory grassroots opinion in the constituencies. During 25 years work for the party, I have never encountered a measure which was so widely unpopular with fellow members. The poll tax was unpopular, but it did have its supporters within the party. VAT on domestic fuel appears to be friendless, and the government would be wise to reconsider. Noel Paulley, 'Corfu', Cardiff Road, Creigiau, Cardiff CF4 8NL</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cultivating a taste for gourmet coffee At about 8am at Coffee Connection, a gourmet coffee shop chain in Boston, dozens of people on their way to work line up to order espressos, cappuccinos, and exotic brews hailing from countries such as Guatemala and Kenya. In Italy or Latin America, the scene would hardly seem noteworthy - but in the US, birthplace of the watery, tasteless brew, the growth of speciality coffee shops is a remarkable phenomenon. What is unusual about this success story is that these speciality coffee stores did not simply fill a market niche; they created it. 'When we started up (in the 1980s) people didn't really know what a good cup of coffee was,' says George Reynolds, head of marketing for Starbucks, the chain which began the craze on the west coast. 'So we faced a double challenge: not only did we have to make good coffee, we also had to create a desire for good coffee.' The speciality coffee chains - which also include San Francisco's Peet's Coffee &amp; Tea and Gloria Jean's (a division of Brother Gourmet Coffees) - follow strikingly similar marketing strategies. If they are new to an area, they use free tastings to get the word out. 'If there is a museum exhibit opening, or a sports event, we are there, handing out free coffee,' says George Howell, president of Coffee Connection. After they have hooked their initial customer base, the chains rely mainly on word of mouth and education. They offer lectures, and print free 'newsletters', available in the stores, covering everything from a special plantation in Kenya, to the art of making a good espresso. 'Through education, we perpetuate the coffee culture,' says Suzanne Vanbemmel, director of operations for Peet's Coffee &amp; Tea. 'If we can get people talking about coffee, in the same way that a lot of people talk about different kinds of wine, then that will help create a demand.' Location is also crucial: 'Not many customers are going to walk more than a couple blocks for a cup of coffee, no matter how good it is,' says Michael Cronin, an analyst at Weston Presidio Capital. 'So these companies' customer base is really concentrated in a very small area around each store's location.' Local media attention has helped. 'When we open in a new market, we're flooded with calls to appear on local television stations or talk with the local press about our coffee,' says Reynolds. Many of the stores also sell coffee beans for home brewing and coffee paraphernalia, including stove-top espresso machines, coffee grinders and espresso cups. They maintain quality by buying and roasting the beans themselves, and can be fanatical about freshness. 'After two weeks, we sell roasted beans half-price,' says Curtis Bean, head of operations for Coffee Connection. 'After a month, we give them to charity.' The formula seems to work. Craig Bibb, an analyst with Paine Webber, estimates that the US gourmet coffee business is now worth Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) and will exceed Dollars 2bn by 2000. Analysts say the gourmet chains have reversed the long-term decline in total coffee consumption in the country. For the first time in more than a decade, consumption is increasing. As they expand into new cities and into each others' territory, the coffee chains will face greater competition. But they seem unconcerned, at least in the short-run. 'There's so much room for this market to grow, we're not worried, says Kenneth Toltz, vice-president of marketing at Brothers. 'With new players in the market, gourmet coffee gets even more attention, and that's good for all of us.'</p>

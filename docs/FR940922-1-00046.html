			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is not now proposing that Virginia adopt the OTC LEV program state-wide, but requests comment on this issue. Congress designated only the northern portion of Virginia that is part of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as part of the OTR. Therefore, Congress clearly intended that Northern Virginia can be treated separately from the remainder of Virginia for the purposes of ozone transport, and that pollution control in northern Virginia is particularly important for attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the northeast. Also, there has been no motion under section 176A to extend the OTR to the rest of Virginia on grounds that the rest of the state contributes significantly to nonattainment in the region.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, certain commenters questioned a state's authority to adopt California standards in part of a state. Though EPA disagrees with such comments, as discussed below, EPA requests comment on whether its final action should require Virginia to adopt the OTC LEV program state-wide. While EPA believes that there is good reason generally for the program to apply state-wide and region-wide in the OTR, EPA does not believe that state-wide application is legally required under section 177. Section 177 was clearly designed to deal with nonattainment of standards. This is consistent with the heading for section 177: ``New Motor Vehicle Standards in Nonattainment Areas.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 61 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 177 does not require statewide implementation of California standards; nor do any of the explicit requirements of section 177 imply a requirement for statewide implementation. Section 177 merely requires that the state adopt standards that are identical to the California standards. EPA believes it is most reasonable to interpret the geographical area in which the standards apply to be a part of the California program that is not an aspect of the term ``standards'' in section 177(l). Of course, other states applying the California standards will necessarily apply them in a variety of places different from California. And the underlying rationale for the identicality requirement that other states not adopt standards creating a ``third vehicle'' is not implicated by limitation of the program to part of a state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 61 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See letter from EPA Administrator William Reilly to Elizabeth Haskell, Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources (January 7, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Conclusions regarding need for OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) for purposes of attainment by the dates provided in subpart 2 of part D of title I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's approach has been to analyze the reductions needed in the OTR for purposes of attainment, and then the options available to achieve those needed reductions. As discussed above, EPA believes that a 50% to 75% reduction in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions throughout the OTR and VOC emissions in and near the urban areas will be necessary for attainment throughout the OTR. This range is based on studies that used a 1985 emissions baseline. Updated inventory information indicates that the 1985 inventory underestimated actual emissions. Therefore, EPA believes at least 50% to 75% emissions reductions, and possibly more, are needed from the 1990 emissions baseline. EPA's modeling analysis has focused generally on the inventory in the year 2005. As discussed in section IV.A.2.(a), the percentage reductions necessary from the 1990 baseline for purposes of attainment do not change over time and do not depend on EPA's choice of 2005 for purposes of modeling. Still, control options for achieving those reductions by a particular time can vary, if it takes time for certain measures to be developed or to be implemented and to achieve reductions. Also, the growth that states must counteract in order to achieve the percentage reductions from the 1990 baseline will continue to rise over time. EPA's conclusion that the OTC LEV program is necessary for attainment in the OTR applies for all of the serious and severe areas with attainment deadlines of 1999, 2005 and 2007.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the analysis focusing on the 2005 inventory, EPA believes that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary for the severe nonattainment areas in the OTR to attain by the 2005 deadline. EPA believes there is no basis to find that its conclusion that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary would be different for emissions that contribute to nonattainment in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut severe area, which has a 2007 attainment deadline. The control options EPA assessed will not achieve such greater reductions in the extra two years so as to make up the shortfall in reductions needed for attainment without the LEV program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, it is important to note that each of the states in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut nonattainment area needs the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program in order for the other two to reach attainment by 2007. These three states are part of a common airshed and represent a single area in which pollutants from VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions mix to form a plume of high ozone concentrations. In addition, there is considerable interstate travel by commuters between these states within this nonattainment area such that non-LEV vehicles from one state would reduce the effectiveness of a LEV program in the adjacent states. For similar reasons, these states may also need the LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program in order that the southern New Jersey-Philadelphia nonattainment area (that abuts the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area) may attain by 2005.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> The world's first rock seance was a partial success, promoter Loni Specter  reports.  </P> <P> The ceremony, held at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood, was intended to lure the  spirits of deceased guitarists Jim Hendrix, Duane Allman and others into making  guest appearances at the L.A. Guitar Show.  </P> <P> There was some controversy. One medium refused to preside because, he said, the  late John Lennon had advised him he was upset at the commercialization of the  event.  </P> <P> During the seance, two spectators said they felt Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix  speaking through them. But the spirits of the late guitarists left their  instruments home. No otherworldly rock music was heard. Perhaps the spirits  refused to play out of sympathy with the musicians on strike in Las Vegas.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS WRANGLE OVER THE BUDGET  </P> <P> The breakdown of the budget negotiations and its consequences may be my fault.  </P> <P> As a non-voter, Congress does not know or care how I feel on any issue. Well,  things are going to be different. It is never too late to use our "people"  power to give notice to the government. I urge all eligible citizens to get off  their duffs and vote. This is the only way to show politicians that they have  to take their responsibility to the electorate seriously.  </P> <P> RAY MARRERO, San Diego  </P></p>

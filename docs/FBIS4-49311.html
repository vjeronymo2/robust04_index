			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 5 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Chinese  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin this afternoon  categorically ruled out the possibility of setting up an  information service in Tibet, as proposed by the U.S. Congress.    In reply to inquiries about this during a news conference,  Wu  Jianmin said: Tibet is an inalienable part of China's  territory. Whatever the U.S. side intends to do there must be  approved by China. China certainly will not agree to such  doings by the United States. (Note: This refers to the U.S.  Congress' decision to set up an information service in Tibet, as  mentioned by reporters.)    Wu Jianmin continued by saying: I would like to take this  opportunity to point out that Tibet has been an inalienable part  of China's territory since the 13th century, and no country in  this world recognizes Tibet as an independent state, neither  does the United States.    Wu Jianmin said: In the recently adopted U.S. foreign  relations authorization law for the 1994/95 fiscal year, the  U.S. Congress undisguisedly called Tibet a country. It has gone  surprisingly far, indeed, in despising the basic norms governing  international relations, flagrantly infringing on China's  sovereignty, and attempting to split China.    Wu Jianmin stressed that the Chinese people had engaged in  bloody struggle over a long period of time to safeguard their  nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Without  exception, all the plots throughout history which aimed at  separating Tibet from China have ended in shameful failure.  Anyone who intends to slip back into the old rut certainly will  come to no good. China demands that the U.S. Government  strictly abide by its stance on Tibet as a part of China;  scrupulously observe the basic principles prescribed by the  three joint communiques signed between China and the United  States, as well as codes of international relations; and remedy  the faults it has committed.</p>

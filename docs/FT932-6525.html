			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Inland Steel predicts profitability this year INLAND STEEL Industries hopes to achieve profitability sometime in the second half of the year, Mr Robert Darnell, president and chief executive officer, said yesterday. The company expected a period of sustained profitability after 1993, he told shareholders at the annual meeting in Chicago, in which the good years would match the record results of 1988, when net earnings neared Dollars 120m. He added that the trough years in the business cycle would still see the company in the black. With first-quarter net losses cut from Dollars 694m to Dollars 31.4m, Mr Darnell said the underpinnings were in place for a return to profitability.</p>

[passage omitted]    While the statements attributed to U.S. President Bill  Clinton, in which he considered "Jerusalem the unified capital  of Israel," have provoked Palestinian condemnation, the Foreign  Ministry believe that these statements "cannot be taken  seriously, because they were remarks reportedly made by the U.S.  President at a dinner banquet and did not emanate from him  personally."    In a statement to AL-HAYAH a Foreign Ministry source added  that, if these statements were "a declared official position,  they would have been dealt with differently." Besides, "the way  in which they are currently being dealt with is exaggerated."    Meanwhile, official sources have denied that Cairo offered  to  host a meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin in Egypt. They said:  "The offer is American." Cairo expressed willingness to host  the meeting if 'Arafat agrees and believes that it would be  useful. They said that "'Arafat turned down the offer."

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Mozambique peace pact promises end to 16-year civil war THE OPPOSING leaders in Mozambique's civil war signed an accord yesterday which could bring peace to the country for the first time in three decades. At a ceremony in Rome, President Joaquim Chissano and Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Renamo rebels, agreed to end hostilities in the 16-year civil war by October 1. The war, which followed a guerrilla conflict seeking independence from Portugal, achieved in 1975, has devastated the already impoverished country. War and drought have forced a quarter of the 15m population to flee, and fighting has seriously hindered efforts to avert starvation. The six-page agreement, the result of nearly two years of intermittent talks, calls for the international community and the United Nations in particular to help monitor the agreement, which provides for Mozambique's first multiparty elections. Implementation of the pact will be a formidable task, given the destruction of the infrastructure and fears that Renamo is not so much an organised movement as a collection of gangs and warlords. Yesterday's news that Renamo attacks continued during the latest peace talks may be a symptom of this kind of indiscipline. Participants in Rome remained optimistic, however. 'This is an historic day for the people of Mozambique and Africa . . . Please, no more deaths,' said Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe, who, with church leaders and the Italian government, helped arrange the pact. President Mugabe and President Chissano paid tribute at the signing to the role played in the long peace process by Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive of Lonrho, the British conglomerate. 'Well done, Tiny,' said Mr Mugabe, embracing Mr Rowland, while Mr Chissano spoke of 'our friend Tiny'. Lonrho has big commercial, agro-industrial and mining interests in Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Mr Rowland's involvement in the peace process goes back over two years, when he arranged the first meeting of the two sides in Malawi. He has also been trying to mediate in the Sudanese civil war.

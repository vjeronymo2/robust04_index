			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / New stock market listings boosted by venture capital NEARLY HALF of the companies that obtained a London stock market listing in the year to the end of June were financed at some stage in their development by venture capital. Of the 75 companies that gained a listing in the period, 36 - or 48 per cent  -had received venture-capital finance, the British Venture Capital Association said yesterday. Half of the venture-backed companies which floated had been formed by management buy-outs. The remainder had been supported by the venture-capital industry in the start-up, early stage or development phases. Most of the companies that went to market were still quite small. Nine had an initial capitalisation of less than Pounds 20m while 11 were in the range of Pounds 20m to Pounds 50m. Among the largest recent listings that were venture backed were Anglian Group, a double-glazing manufacturer capitalised at its listing at Pounds 183m, and MFI, a furniture retailer and manufacturer, capitalised at Pounds 668m. Both were originally buy-outs. Listings have returned to favour after a long period during which most venture-capital backed companies were sold to another company. Buyers seeking to expand could usually offer more than a company could raise by flotation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "The situation in Crimea is normal," Crimean  Interior Minister Valeriy Kuznetsov told INTERFAX on Sunday [22  May]. "The ministry staff are working according to plan.  Officers on duty keep working, while the others are having a  rest," he said.    To quote Kuznetsov, the Crimean interior ministry units were  not put into a state of combat readiness on Saturday.    "Only individual precaution measures were taken," said  Kuznetsov.    He said that on Saturday evening, he was informed that the  Ukrainian national guards had planned to seize the Crimean TV,  radio and communication centers, and the buildings of the  parliament, Cabinet and bank. "A group of Crimean deputies, who  visited a unit of the Ukrainian national guard, could see that  the national guards were ready and wanted to do so. Moreover,  national guards themselves told the deputies that such a task  had been assigned to them," said Kuznetsov.    He also announced that on Sunday this information was  partially confirmed by Ukraine's First Deputy Interior Minister  Valentin Nedrigailo, who admitted that at his request the task  of establishing control over the Crimean TV center had been  assigned to the national guards. "The TV center and the  parliament building are always guarded by the police," said  Kuznetsov.    He pointed out that no weapons had been given either to the  police or to the special unit Berkut, because both of them were  always armed. Berkut units daily patrol the streets. On Sunday  they detained a 29-men strong grouping. On Saturday Berkut  units were asked to find out what was happening near the  parliament building, so they came to the place, assessed the  situation and went away, he said.    Kuznetsov admitted that he had issued the order to enhance  vigilance and that he had put only part of the personnel into a  state of alert. "Now everything has got back to the initial  situation. We are working tranquilly and are not planning any  moves," he said.    To quote Kuznetsov, Crimea remains part of Ukraine. "If Kiev  does not explode the situation, everything will go tranquily,"  he said.    He said that the hysterical campaign (over the Crimean  parliament's decision to restore the constitution of 1992 --  INTERFAX) had been launched by the forces which intended to foil  presidential elections scheduled for 26 June, not by the whole  of Ukraine.    He pointed out that he meant President Kravchuk in the first  place. [sentence as received] He noted, however, that other  forces' attitude to the Crimea was "not quite loyal," either.    He believes that Crimea's position in relation to Kiev is  similar to the position of Tatarstan in relation to Russia prior  to the conclusion of the bilateral agreement. "Who has suffered  from the agreement signed by Kazan and Moscow? The same might  be said about Crimea," said Kuznetsov.    Kiev is absolutely unpredictable, he went on to say. "But if  the Kiev politicians show common sense, everything will be  normal: there are no reasons for fanning tensions. All problems  can be solved at a negotiating table," he said.    He expressed hope that the talks between the Russian and  Ukrainian prime ministers, to be held in Moscow on Monday, would  be a success. "I think this meeting will confirm once again  that all disputable issues must be tackled through talks. No  one has the right to issue the order to use force," he said.    He pointed out that the political events had not had any  impact on the crime situation in Crimea.    He acknowledged, however, that at this dramatic moment the  interior ministry personnel were alarmed.    He said that the people of Crimea had the right to a choice  within the limits not affecting the territorial integrity of  Ukraine. "Nothing has changed. The constitution has been  restored, but Crimea has not drifted away from Ukraine. One  must simply give Crimea economic independence, so we could take  care of our people on our own," said Kuznetsov.</p>

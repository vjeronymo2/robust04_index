			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stefan Ragaz: "Bosnia Testifies to Clinton's </F> Aimless Foreign Policy"]    [Text] Washington -- "We have crossed the Rubicon." This  is the way in which the former U.S. secretary of state and  former ambassador to Belgrade commented on the failed air  strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. Thus, the only military  option that is left is the massive shelling of Serbian positions  in Bosnia and Serbia.    In the United States, however, where the signals on the  future course of policy on Bosnia are contradictory, readiness  for military escalation is declining. Washington is desperately  trying to find a way out of the foreign policy quagmire.  Basically, President Clinton's "considerations" about  "nondiplomatic methods" against the Serbian besiegers of Gorazde  do not change anything.    Encouraged by European reservations one year ago, and unable  to lead the United Nations to a credible policy of strength, the  Clinton Administration is trying to avoid responsibility --  particularly in the humanitarian-ethical sphere. Now that it is  apparently too late to save Gorazde, Serbian hopes are being  realized: Washington has neither the willingness nor the  courage to intervene in Bosnia.    The case of Gorazde has unmasked U.S. policy on Bosnia: The  fact that the United States is now afraid of a loss of face is  the result of a careless foreign policy. Just as in Somalia,  when Clinton insisted on chasing Aidid, he also misjudged the  situation in Bosnia.    In fact, he gave rise to expectations, particularly among  the  victims of the aggressor, but shrank back from the consequences;  he uttered threats, but he then withdrew with his hesitant  attitude and readiness for compromise. As a result, doubts  concerning the moral authority, the determination, and sincerity  of the United States developed even before Gorazde. Above all,  the Clinton Administration lacks cohesion. Senator Orin Hatch  from Utah is critical: "We are referring to the United Nations,  otherwise the U.S. policy is unclear." The fact that the United  States continues to accept the UN Security Council as the  supreme authority and does not take the initiative has become  the subject of public criticism in Washington.    Military planning, too, is characterized by a lack of  cohesion. The Pentagon has apparently deviated from the Powell  doctrine and forgotten the lessons of the Vietnam and Gulf wars.  Colin Powell, general chief of staff under President Bush,  linked the deployment of U.S. troops with the feasibility of  military goals and massive superiority on the battlefield.    Henry Kissinger believes that the air strikes are only a  "symbolic tit-for-tat during the final phase of a completed  operation."    The realization that the Serbs are about to achieve the goal  of "objective cleansing" in the territorial conquest in Bosnia  also leads to a new realpolitik assessment of the U.S. role in  Congress. Some in Congress have already called for the complete  withdrawal from Bosnia, because it is not possible to force the  Serbs to participate in negotiations by using bombs. Since the  military options are exhausted, as Kissinger noted, voices  calling for the abolition of the weapons embargo for the Bosnian  Muslims are being raised.    However, Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, also warns that, in view of Russian resistance in the  United Nations, an abolition is only conceivable as a unilateral  act by the United States. But this would mean that Washington  would have to enter the conflict and wage a large part of the  war on the side of the Muslims.</p>

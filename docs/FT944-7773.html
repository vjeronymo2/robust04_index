			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UBS wins test of strength on proxies: Showdown at meeting attracts record attendance as Ebner loses The board of Union Bank of Switzerland yesterday narrowly won the first proxy battle to be fought over a major Swiss company when it defeated Mr Martin Ebner, the maverick Zurich bond fund manager, at an extraordinary meeting which attracted a record 6,700 UBS shareholders. The board needed to win a two-thirds majority of all votes and won 66.8 per cent of those cast by both the company's registered and bearer shareholders. The vote was over the board's proposal to convert registered shares into bearer shares. Sentiment in the packed sports stadium in Zurich during the two-and-a-half hour debate was clearly behind the board, partly reflecting the presence of many employees who feared for their jobs if Mr Ebner took control. Mr Ebner, whose BK Vision is UBS's largest shareholder, immediately filed an application for an injunction to prevent the bank from proceeding with its plan to convert its registered shares. BK Vision claims the registered shareholders should have been allowed to vote separately on a plan that would strip them of their extra voting rights without compensation. 'No one can leave this meeting with a good feeling,' Mr Ebner said after the vote. 'There are no winners today.' The board hastily put forward the share conversion proposal because it feared Mr Ebner and his allies were trying to win control of the bank through the accumulation of registered shares, which have a par value one fifth that of the bearers. The proxy battle, which was really over the board's strategy and performance, attracted huge interest in Swiss financial circles. The number of shareholders who attended yesterday's meeting was double that of the last AGM in April. More than 88 per cent of the 35.9m shares with voting rights were represented, compared with 58.2 per cent in April. Even before the vote, the event was something of a moral victory for Mr Ebner who has been pressuring the UBS board for three years to become more sensitive to shareholder interests. Mr Nikolaus Senn, UBS chairman, said in an opening speech that raising the group's earning power and exercising strict control over risk were the main goals for the 1990s. But Mr Ebner won applause for his complaints about the strong pressure put on employees and customers to vote their shares in favour of the board. BK Vision now has a week to produce evidence supporting its demand that UBS be prevented by injunction from converting the registered shares into bearer shares until an appeal is made. If the injunction is granted, BK Vision will have two months to prepare its appeal to the commercial court. This would almost certainly mean that the registered shares, with their extra voting power, would still be in existence for the next meeting in April. Lex, Page 28</p>

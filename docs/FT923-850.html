			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: United Newspapers When United Newspapers produces a 20 per cent increase in interim profits, the market has to ask itself whether it has been too niggardly in putting the company on a multiple below its peers. The answer could be a cautious yes. True, the first half interest charge benefited from lower US rates, over which the company has no control. Newsprint costs may also not remain so favourable. The sterling price of paper will have to reflect the stronger dollar despite the glut. The company is conspicuously silent about the fortunes of the Daily Star, but the remarkable turnround at the Sunday Express has helped produce a sharp increase in display advertisement revenues, and costs throughout the group have been held in rigorous check. This forms a good springboard from which to reap the benefits of economic recovery, especially for a company that derives over half its revenues from advertising. There are two caveats, though. First, the bunching of capital spending in the second half of this year makes a further reduction in gearing unlikely. It will only be from next year onwards, when spending returns to more normal levels, that debt will start to drop significantly. Second, last year's dividend cover was only 1.3. The chances are that the payout will grow more slowly than earnings in a recovery.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Amanda Brown, Health Correspondent, PA News] </F>   [Text] A leading Government health expert is insisting:  "There is no killer bug sweeping the country."    Dr Diana Walford, Director of the Public Health Laboratory  Service [PHLS], attacked the barrage of publicity over the  flesh-eating disease necrotising fasciitis.    She issued a new official list which showed there had been  15  cases due to the disease since January 1, including four of the  seven reported cases from the Gloucestershire area.    Although she did not specify how many of the cases had  proved  fatal, at least 10 deaths are being officially attributed to the  disease.    The move, aimed at calming growing public fears of an  epidemic, followed a top-level meeeting of public health experts  and microbiolgisits, who have painstakingly sifted through the  figures.    Dr Walford's comments came as cases continued to emerge of  the horrifying virus which can devour flesh in hours.    The unofficial death toll this year rose to 13 with news of  the case of an 85-year-old woman from Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan,  earlier this month, but there were also reports of a 71-year-old  woman who died in March from the bug in a Newcastle upon Tyne  hospital.    Dr Walford said of the official statistics: "These low  figures therefore confirm that necrotising fasciitis arising  from Group A Streptococci (bacteria) remains a rare disease.    "The public should be reassured that there is no `killer  bug'  sweeping the country."    Earlier yesterday, Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley  appealed for calm, insisting everything possible was being done  to fight the bug.    She did not think it was necessary to make it a notifiable  disease.    "The Chief Medical Officer is briefing ministers regularly.  There is no evidence that the numbers we are seeing are  untoward," she added.    Shadow health secretary David Blunkett called for the  Government to reverse cutbacks and redundancies planned for the  PHLS.    He said: Instead of acting swiftly to maximise safety and to  allay the understandable fears of many people, the Government is  axing the vital research designed to protect us from this type  of threat.    "Virginia Bottomley cannot simply sit tight and hope that  this outbreak is going to disappear."    The widow of a man killed by the flesh-eating bug received a  letter from a hospital saying he was getting better -- three  days after he was cremated on January 28.    Doreen Bargery was told by St Peter's Hospital in Cherstey,  Surrey, that Les was making "slow but shaky progress", more than  a week after he died.    Mr Fash, chief executive at St Peter's Hospital, said: "We  did apologise to Mrs Bargery profusely at the time. Mrs Bargery  is understandably very upset about her husband's death.    "We were investigating a number of points she raised about  her husband's illness and we had kept in touch with her  husband's case periodically."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [David Dodwell report: "GATT Condemns EU Over Bananas"] </F>   [Text] A potentially embarrassing report criticising  Europe's controversial banana import regime was released last  night by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade after the  collapse of negotiations intended to persuade Latin American  complainants to withdraw their backing from the report.    Contents of the report are unlikely to be made public for 30  days, but participants confirmed yesterday that the GATT report  condemns the European Union's [EU] preferential trading  arrangements with former colonies.    The five Latin American states which last year brought a  formal complaint to the GATT over Europe's banana import regime  -- Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Guatemala --  have come under intense pressure from the EU to drop their  complaint. Over the past four days, all but Guatemala appeared  inclined to bow to EU pressure, which was linked to offers of  improved quota access to Europe's protected banana market.    However, at the eleventh hour the Latin Americans backed  away  from compromise when it emerged it would lead to deep divisions  among them.    Apart from Guatemala which accounts for a tiny 1.5 per cent  of EU banana imports and has remained adamantly opposed to the  EU proposals, it emerged yesterday that Costa Rica, which  accounts for 20 per cent of EU imports, was also paralysed ahead  of general elections on February 6.    One Latin American negotiator yesterday voiced regret that  no  compromise had been possible: "A solution is still necessary,"  he said. "If time conspired against agreement today, then we  must still aim to find a solution in the month ahead."    It was unclear yesterday whether the EU would keep on the  table an offer made in December to give Latin American suppliers  improved quota access to its banana market. Letters written to  Latin American ministers in recent days insisted that the offer  would be withdrawn if compromise was not reached before the GATT  panel report was released.    The deadline for releasing the report passed at the weekend.  GATT officials agreed to delay for two days as the EU and Latin  Americans sought compromise.    A hard-hitting first panel report on the EU banana import  regime was released in July last year. This upheld Latin  American complaints and ruled that the Lome convention of  preferential trading arrangements between EU members and their  former colonies could not be defended as a free trade agreement  or a customs union.    Negotiators have insisted that a GATT ruling in favour of  the  Latin Americans would be embarrassing, but otherwise a pyrrhic  victory, since the report is unlikely ever to be adopted. GATT's  rules require that a dispute panel report is supported by all  GATT contracting parties before adoption.</p>

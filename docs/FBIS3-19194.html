The federal  Government says it has agreed to extend the mandate for  providing peacekeepers to the UN force in Bosnia and Croatia for  another six months. But it has refused to increase the number  of soldiers Canada is providing. Michael McCullough reports:    [McCullough] Canada's commitment to keep troops in Bosnia  and  Croatia was due to expire at the end of this month. For a time  there seemed to be some legitimate doubt concerning whether or  not Canada would renew that commitment. There were concerns  about costs estimated at $180 million a year, and Prime Minister  Cretien openly wondered if, given all of the dangers Canadian  soldiers faced, it is really worthwhile. But it is worthwhile  according to Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet. He says  Canada will commit to keep its soldiers there for another six  months and provide assistance in a number of other ways.    [Begin Ouellet recording] We will continue financial support  for various international humanitarian aid agencies and make  military flights available to the United Nations to deliver that  aid. [end recording]    [McCullough] Ouellet also downplayed the fact that while  Canada has agreed to maintain its current troop strength, it has  turned down the UN's latest appeal for additional soldiers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Despite all the appeals, nothing seems to be able to  put an end to the fighting and slaughter in Rwanda. However,  the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] is hoping to  increase the number of its staff in Kigali, but it also fears  that the work of its staff will become increasingly difficult in  the capital. (Daniel Oxberger) is the ICRC delegate:    [Begin recording] [Oxberger] Unfortunately, the situation  has  worsened this evening. I take this opportunity to call on all  Rwandans to respect the actions of the Red Cross, its  humanitarian work, and to enable its staff to work. We are  trying to help all civilians who are the victims of the  conflict. The situation is extremely worrying today in Kigali,  where we have lost count of the number of wounded and dead.  Unfortunately, our work has become extremely difficult over the  last few hours. It is important to repeat the need to respect  the neutrality of the ICRC delegates who are trying to evacuate  the numerous wounded people in town.    [Unidentified correspondent] Has the ICRC already decided,  whatever happens, to leave its staff on the ground?    [Oxberger] If need be, we are going to call all delegates  back to the ICRC headquarters in Kigali and, should the  situation deteriorate further, we would consider other measures.  For the time being, far from withdrawing, the ICRC is even  increasing the number of its staff. As I speak, five medical  staff are flying to Bujumbura and we are hoping that they will  arrive in Kigali tomorrow morning if the roads are still open.  [end recording]</p>

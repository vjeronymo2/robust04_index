			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK reserves That UK official reserves fell sharply in August can come as little surprise. The Bank of England intervened to the tune of getting on for Dollars 2bn on Wednesday last week alone. But what is not shown up by the figures is the full extent to which the Bank has been selling the mark, for example through buying dollars against marks: such action has little net effect on reserve values in the short term. From now until at least the French vote on Maastricht the UK authorities are locked in to a struggle with the foreign exchanges. The Bank's tactics - keeping its powder dry until the barbarians are at the gate - seem to be working for the moment. Critics who argue that leaving action to the last minute means that intervention has to be heavy may be proved wrong. Speculators shorting sterling get very nervous within sight of the ERM floor. This is not to say the Bank will win the psychological battle - further trouble could come as soon as tomorrow if the US employment report weakens the dollar further. September's drain on foreign reserves is unlikely to be less than that in August.</p>

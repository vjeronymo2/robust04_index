			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>   [Text] Almaty, 22 January -- Any attempts to use  interethnic relations for one's own ends should be strictly  punished by law, President Nursultan Nazarbayev is convinced.    He has decided to set up a Council for Citizens' Rights  under  the president. This representative body will draw up bills for  the Supreme Council and recommendations for the executive  authority aimed at fundamentally increasing accountability for  inciting interethnic dissension, for all forms of provocations,  destabilizing the sociopolitical situation in the republic, and  offending citizens' honor and national dignity. Nazarbayev  stated this in an interview published in today's KAZAKHSTANSKAYA  PRAVDA.    My aspiration is for Kazakhstan's citizens to live  prosperously as a single amicable family, he commented. I call  upon all compatriots as before to strengthen peace and accord in  our common home, to yield to no provocations, and to analyze  critically those populist slogans and calls of pseudo-democrats  that are being proclaimed so vigorously at rallies in the run-up  to the elections to legislative and representative bodies of  power scheduled for 7 March. One must also regard with healthy  criticism those publications in the local and foreign press that  are constructed upon biassed and amateur statistics.    Touching on the topic of the "Russian-speaking population,"  Nazarbayev commented that this is a term he does not accept at  all. Virtually all residents in the republic, including Kazakhs,  he said, are Russian speakers. You would hardly find anyone in  Kazakhstan who does not speak Russian. Russian has been  recognized as a means of interethnic communication, whereas  Kazakh is the state language. In the republic there are legal  guarantees preserving the sphere of use of the language of  interethnic communication and of other languages, and it is  categorially banned to restrict the rights and freedoms of  citizens because they do not speak the state language or the  language of interethnic communication, he stressed.    The question of dual citizenship, the president believes,  could split society, could divide it into "us" and "them." This  is why we should not resort to introducing dual citizenship in  the republic. This could breed chaos and mistrust. It is far  better not to get people worried, but to create within the CIS  states conditions for free movement and communication; to make  it possible, for instance, freely to acquire Russian citizenship  when moving to Russia, and Kazakhstani citizenship when  returning to Kazakhstan to one's permanent domicile. It would  be even better if everyone could have a document permitting him  to live wherever he wants within the confines of the  commonwealth, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.</p>

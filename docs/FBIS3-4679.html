			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was disclosed on 25 February that the United  States unofficially delivered requests which the United States  expects Japan to incorporate into voluntary market opening  measures it has started to map out. Among other things, the  main points of the U.S. requests are: 1) to significantly  increase the budget for the fundamental 10-year project for  public investment; 2) to voluntarily set a goal designed to  reduce Japan's huge trade surplus; and 3) to front-load a plan  to implement agreements, reached at the Japan-U.S. comprehensive  trade talks, regarding priority areas of negotiations.    The United States is assuming a stance of "watching the  situation because Japan is voluntarily preparing measures,"  (according to a U.S. Government source). Because of this, the  United States did not make an official request in writing.  However, it is said that the United States unofficially  informed Japan, through several channels, including the Japanese  Embassy in the United States, that the United States is "very  much interested in Japan's voluntary measures." On 25 February,  the Japanese Government decided to prepare market opening  measures before the end of March by holding meetings, which will  be attended by the appropriate ministers. However, since the  United States conveyed the requests, the focal point has moved  to how many of the U.S. requests the market opening measures  will reflect.    The fundamental plan for public investments, which the  United  States is interested in, is designed to spend 430 trillion yen  over the 10 year period starting in fiscal 1991. However, the  United States wants Japan to significantly increase this amount,  saying that it is not enough to reduce Japan's trade surplus.  According to a U.S. Treasury Department calculation, the rate  of public investments in the GNP will become lower than the  current rate should Japan keep the 430 trillion yen. The same  department also says that the current public investment rate  will be maintained if 100 trillion yen is added.    The United States has not disclosed the actual amount of  increase it wants Japan to make. However, on the basis of the  calculation by the Treasury Department, it seems that the United  States thinks that an increase of 100 trillion yen is needed.</p>

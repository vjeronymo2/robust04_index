In the second year after the end of the bipolar structure,  the countries of the world are facing even fiercer competition  in the advance toward the 21st century. A complicated situation  has taken shape as this competition has unfolded in the process  in which various forces of the world are realigning and  regrouping and are striving to grab favorable strategic  positions for themselves. However, taking an overall view of the  world's situation and international relations, both detente and  turbulence still exist in the world.    In 1993, global detente has continued and developed to some  extent in the following ways:    First, the big nations, especially the big powers, are  formulating or enforcing the strategy of "economic priority,"  and a tendency toward international economic regionalization and  economic blocs has come to take shape distinctly. The U.S.  Clinton administration, after it was formed early this year,  first mapped out "a plan to revitalize the U.S. economy," and in  a strong belief that the possibility of a world war is  decreasing, it shifted its defensive emphasis "from preparations  for nuclear war to tackling regional wars." Meanwhile, the  integrated European Common Market was officially inaugurated at  the beginning of this year; the North American Free Trade  Agreement was ratified at the end of this year; the informal  leadership conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  organization was convened; and various regional economic  organizations among Asian, African, and Latin American countries  were formed and consolidated.    Second, more importance has been attached to coordination  and  dialogue in international relations. The Chinese and U.S.  presidents had their first formal talks in more than four years,  while the Uruguay Round of the GATT multilateral negotiations,  which had dragged on for seven years, eventually reached an  agreement in December. All this indicates the desire for and  capability of coordination between concerned parties. In 1993,  a major breakthrough was achieved in solving the Middle East,  South African, and Cambodian issues -- the three hot spots whose  problems had remained unsolved for a long time. The people's  yearning for peace and hatred of war have prompted many troubled  areas of the world to seek political solutions instead of  military confrontation.    Third, international arms reductions and arms control have  made some new progress. The United States and Russia formally  signed the second stage of START -- the START II Treaty -- and  115 nations including the United States, China, and Russia  signed the convention banning the use, production, and  stockpiling of chemical weapons. The United Nations began to  implement the agreement on transparency in armaments which was  passed in 1991. Although problems remain regarding the  implementation of the agreement and the convention, the moves  are conducive to detente. Besides, the world's total spending  on the military in 1993 decreased for the sixth successive year,  and the decline in this spending is continuing.    On the other hand, the world of 1993 has been plagued with  contradictions, wars, and conflicts. Regional disputes,  collisions, and unrest have been on the rise and have combined  to form interference that kept pounding at the international  environment, thus creating an unstable world. This can be seen  in the following manifestations: The contradiction overshadowed  by the struggle for hegemony between the two superpowers in the  past came to light further; frictions were frequently triggered  by new changes in the political, economic, and military forces  in the world after the end of the bipolar structure; economic  recessions affecting the Western powers, except in the United  States, Canada, and Britain, have not ended, and the  contradictions among them have increased to some extent; some  members of the CIS are still struggling in crises, as  highlighted by the situation in Russia; quite a number of  countries failed to do a good job of adjusting their national  policies, thus leading to the downfall of governments, to social  unrest, and to armed conflicts; and there are many hot spots of  various degrees in the world which cause military unrest in  several countries. Some big Western nations have resorted to  power politics abroad, which has angered lots of developing  nations. In the field of economic competition, the inferior  situation in the South is becoming more obvious, and the gap  between the South and the North is widening.    The principal factors causing regional turbulence and  unrest are the shock wave stemming from the end of the bipolar  structure, the U.S. attempt to dominate the world, and the ever-  fiercer economic competition throughout the globe.    -- The end of the bipolar structure has shaken the  traditional alliance formed by Western countries and maintained  by their joint efforts in dealing with the Soviet Union; the  contradictions between them have been sharpened. The United  States and Europe have become divergent and have quarreled over  the trade issue, aid to Russia, Somalia and Bosnia-Herzegovina,  bombing raids on Iraq, and the trade embargo against Cuba. The  feelings of "Cold War victory" in the West have been replaced by  unbearable endless worries. NATO's plan to recruit East  European members has met with setbacks and boycotts. Meanwhile,  an "earthquake belt" has emerged from the Balkans through the  outer Caucasus to Central Asia. Turbulence and uneasiness have  arisen in Europe, a continent which has remained stable for a  long time.    -- President Clinton has emphasized: "The United States must  lead the world, for which we have to pay much." [sentence as  received] In an attempt to dominate the world, this year the  United States has decided on its "three pillars" foreign policy  (economic security, military backing, and support for democracy  and freedom). While scaling down the size of its armed forces,  the United States is heightening the mobility and  casualty-inflicting power of its armed forces and is meddling in  conflicts elsewhere in the world. Wielding the "human rights"  club, it is attempting to place the rich and colorful world  under the rule of Western values. This has led to  contradictions and confrontation.    In economic competition, although there have been efforts to  strengthen economic cooperation and to promote balanced  benefits, the rise of "priority for national interests" and  trade protectionism has triggered more and more contradictions.  No matter how we look at it, this competition is unfair because  "the poorer you get the more losses you suffer." It has become  the major factor leading to the world's instability.    Judging from the current situation, the unrest in some parts  of the world will not bring disaster to the entire world. The  coexistence of detente and turbulence and of collision and  coordination will continue in the years to come. The world will  surge ahead in the midst of contradictions and struggles.</p>

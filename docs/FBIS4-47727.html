			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Miguel Trovoada by correspondent </F> Walter Medeiros in Lisbon on 29 April -- recorded]    [Text] The Social Democratic Party will today, Saturday,  hold its already traditional Lisbon Meeting at the Riba Fria  Estate on the outskirts of Sintra. It is something along the  lines of an international get-together to reflect on political  and economic issues. Among those present this year will be,  among others, Mozambique's foreign minister, the secretary  general of Angola's MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola], and Miguel Trovoada, the president of the Republic of  Sao Tome and Principe. Earlier this evening the latter granted  an interview to our colleague Walter Medeiros.    [Medeiros] Good evening, Mr. President.    [Trovoada] Good evening.    [Medeiros] I would like to begin with a question to which  some political analysts have been addressing themselves of late,  that of the very survival of the state of Sao Tome. Twenty  years after the Portuguese April 1974 revolution, many observers  are saying that Sao Tome and Principe and, by the way, Cape  Verde as well, do not need to be independent, that an autonomous  status similar to that enjoyed by Madeira and the Azores might  be a better solution. They back their argument with the fact  that Sao Tome and Principe, for example, subsists practically on  foreign aid, that the feebleness of its economy makes  self-sufficiency impossible. What are your views on this, Mr.  President?    [Trovoada] I think those are people nostalgic for the  colonial era who have not yet realized that history moves on,  that some of its stages must be left behind, that the historical  process is irreversible. You mentioned economic problems that  might lead some people to wonder about Sao Tome's viability as a  state. I would point out that Sao Tome is not the only state  depending on external aid, there are numerous cases....    [Medeiros, interrupting] But its dependence is huge. You do  recognize that, don't you?    [Trovoada] The dependence is huge. The dependence is huge,  but it is only a temporary stage. We must not forget that ours  is still a type of economy that was not created in the interests  of the Sao Tomeans, but rather in those of the colonial power.  This is an important point. Most African countries have not  yet managed to get out of this kind of situation.    [Medeiros] Mr. President, is democracy not in danger in Sao  Tome?    [Trovoada] Democracy is in danger wherever there is an  inability to solve the basic problems of the populations.    [Medeiros] That is what is happening in Sao Tome.    [Trovoada] It is happening in many countries.    [Medeiros] Including Sao Tome?    [Trovoada] Including Sao Tome and Principe. It is true that  there is disenchantment stemming from the fact that the people  had pinned great hopes in seeing their problems solved by the  establishment of a democratic system. They were expecting  immediate results.    [Medeiros] Some three or four years have already gone by,  Mr.  President.    [Trovoada] Yes, but well, listen, have all of Portugal's  problems been solved in the 20 years since April 1974?    [Medeiros] Of course not.    [Trovoada] We are talking here in connection with the 20th  anniversary of the 25 April revolution. Have all of Portugal's  problems been solved?    [Medeiros] Of course not.    [Trovoada] Right. So it seems that there is tendency to  expect miracles from the African countries that other peoples  are unable to perform. Democracy in the African  countries....[pauses] As soon as there is the slightest  turbulence it is immediately seen as evidence of the African  peoples' inability to manage a democratic system. How many  centuries did it take the other countries, namely the European  ones, to establish democratic systems? Let us not lay down  criteria for African countries that are not applied to others.    [Medeiros] Speaking of managing. At the very beginning of  your term of office, Mr. President, I believe you had to manage  a crisis. The government fell, the prime minister was replaced,  and there was a huge movement of popular protest in Sao Tome.  Relations between yourself, President Trovoada, and the  government, are not exactly the best. How do you deal about  this, Mr. President?    [Trovoada] I do not agree with your view that there is a  lack  of institutional cooperation. We -- namely the president of the  republic -- must deal with the situation within the framework of  our institutions, of our Constitution, with absolute strict  respect for boundaries defining each body's area of jurisdiction.    [Medeiros] But there have been clashes, Mr. President.    [Trovoada] I say it again: Can you name anywhere in the  world  where such clashes do not occur? Not the United States, not  Portugal, not even the world's oldest democracies. As I said  before, let us not hope for miracles from the African countries  that others have not performed and are in no position to perform.    [Medeiros] Do you not fear that there may at present be a  certain nostalgia for former President Pinto da Costa?    [Trovoada] That is a question that should be addressed to  former President Pinto da Costa.    [Medeiros] But do you not fear it? Surely you have your  opinion polls.    [Trovoada] Fear? Fear?    [Medeiros] Yes, yes.    [Trovoada] Why? We have a democracy. Former President  Pinto da Costa is a Sao Tomean citizen. He was our country's  first head of state. He certainly has a role to play in Sao  Tome and Principe. Therefore, I do not see why in a democracy  one should be afraid of a citizen like any other.    [Medeiros] Mr. President, I would like to take the  opportunity of this interview to raise the Francophone versus  Lusophone question. Allow me to explain: There are increasingly  insistent voices pointing to a growing French presence, not just  in Sao Tome and Principe, but also in Guinea Bissau and  throughout that part of Africa. I will give you an example:  Under its cooperation agreement with Sao Tome and Principe,  Portugal has paid for the construction of the Principe dam that  will provide electricity for the island of the same name. Now  people are saying that when the power station is ready it will  be run by the French. Moreover, there is also the question of  the media -- television, radio, and so on. Only recently, I  believe, there was an agreement signed with Radio France  International. Is this because the Sao Tomean elite is markedly  influenced by Francophone culture? What is going on?    [Trovoada] I am frankly astounded....    [Medeiros, interrupting] I would just like you to clear this  up for me.    [Trovoada] No, but I am astounded when such questions are  put  to me.    [Medeiros] But it is good that they should be asked.    [Trovoada] Why so?    [Medeiros] So as to clarify matters.    [Trovoada] Why? You know, I lived in France for nine years  during my second term of exile. There are hundreds of thousands  of Portuguese in France. You also know that nowadays French  interests are increasingly represented in Portugal. And yet no  one is afraid that Napoleon Bonaparte, or a new Napoleon, might  land on Portuguese shores, or cross the Pyrenees bent on  invasion.    [Medeiros] It is not my personal view, I am merely echoing  concerns.    [Trovoada] I fail to see why people should still regard  Africa as a game reserve for competing hunters. We are  independent countries, we have the most open of relationships  with various states....    [Madeiros, interrupting] And a special one with Portugal?    [Trovoada] In the context of cooperation, relationships are  made special by historical and cultural ties, as is  particularly, the case regarding Portugal. But we are open to  cooperation with other countries. It seems to me tantamount to  treating us as though we were underage, if people think that  because we have relations with country A, B, or C, it must  follow that we have a special relationship or wish to be taken  into its sphere of influence.    You mentioned the Principe dam built by Portugal. In effect  I formally opened it about a year ago. I must tell you that it  has not yet come into operation.    [Medeiros] Quite so.    [Trovoada] So when you talk about France running it, I do  not  know how France can run something that has not come into  operation.    [Medeiros] No, I said France will be running it when it is  ready.    [Trovoada] Well, we are in the here and now....[pauses] As  for the matter of future intent, we do not know.    [Medeiros] But don't the French run the whole of Sao Tome's  electricity supply grid?    [Trovoada] But is that in any way an anomalous situation? I  must tell you, in effect our water and electricity supply  networks are run by a French company, yes, operating with huge  subsidies from France -- for equipment, for fuel, and everything  else. If we are speaking about running things, it is a known  fact that there are Portuguese companies in Sao Tome and  Principe in much better positions than French ones, such as  Marconi with its Sao Tomean subsidiary CST [expansion unknown],  such as TAP [Air Portugal] with Sao Tomean Airlines, such as our  sole commercial bank, the BISTP [expansion unknown], whose  majority holdings are Portuguese.    [Medeiros] So the more anxious spirits can be reassured that  Portugal has its role in Sao Tome; our ties with Sao Tome will  definitely not be loosened...    [Trovoada, interrupting] Portugal has its role in Sao Tome.  I am convinced that Portugal will continue playing a role in  Lusophone Africa, and the bigger that role the better, but the  Lusophone African countries are now independent and are totally  at liberty to establish ties also with other countries, in their  interest, and in the interest of the development of their  peoples.    [Medeiros] The voting has ended in the South African  elections. How do you envisage the future for South Africa?  Very quickly, if you would, Mr. President, as we are running  out of time.    [Trovoada] It is an extraordinary process, yet again a  historical process of extraordinary importance, insofar as it  signals the end of a regime, frankly, words fail one to qualify  it -- the apartheid regime, and ushers in a new era of democracy  for the entire South African people. I can say that, as far as  we Africans, the black community in general, are concerned, this  is a high point in the history of this community. And for  mankind too, it is a high point, as a climate of greater  fraternity, greater equality, and inextricably, greater freedom  begins to be established in South Africa.    [Medeiros] Have a good stay in Portugal, Mr. President.  Thank you for coming to Antenna-1's midnight newsreel.    [Trovoada] Thank you very much. Good night.</p>

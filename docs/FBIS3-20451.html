The meeting mainly discussed the  issue of the All Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Chinese  Patriotic Prodemocracy Movement [AHKASCPPM].    The backbone of AHKASCPPM was made up by radical democrats  in  Hong Kong, and AHKASCPPM was led by Szeto Wah and Martin Lee.  They had seized the opportunity provided by the activities of  people of all sectors in Hong Kong in support of the patriotic  student movement at Tiananmen, and had established AHKASCPPM,  which had achieved unprecedented development. This was a united  front-type organization which was mainly based on center-right  forces, while including also people of the left, the center, and  the right. The leadership of the organization was in the hands  of radical democrats. At that time AHKASCPPM incorporated almost  all the democracy- and autonomy-seeking organizations of various  tendencies in Hong Kong as well as many of those centrist  associations which had been rather politically apathetic before  or even some leftist organizations. During the 4 June Incident,  they had adopted exceptionally radical strategies in fighting  Beijing, shouting the slogans, "down with Deng, Li, and Yang"  and "down with fascism"; they had declared that they would not  recognize the legitimacy of the "Li Peng regime," and had vowed  not to have any contact with the "Li Peng regime."    At the meeting Beijing argued that this was an organization  attempting to subvert the Chinese Government and a tool used by  some Western countries and local anti-Communist forces in their  joint effort to turn Hong Kong into an anti-Communist base, and  demanded that Britain "outlaw" it. Ji Pengfei agreed to the view  expressed by Li Hou [2621 0683] that "we should take up the  matter of the British Government's tolerating AHKASCPPM with the  British Government and demand that the British Government  nullify the registration of AHKASCPPM and outlaw AHKASCPPM."    The CPC Hong Kong and Macao Work Committee's view was  somewhat different. According to our intelligence units, we  argued at the meeting, there really are a small number of people  in AHKASCPPM who are using this organization in carrying out  activities of fighting the Chinese Government, and among those  few people there are representatives of foreign and outside  forces who are attempting to turn Hong Kong into an open or  semiopen anti-Communist subversive base; but as for the broad  masses who participated in activities and shouted radical  slogans because of their indignation, we should adopt a policy  of dividing and winning over people--winning over the majority  and isolating and striking at a small minority. We are in favor  of having the British outlaw AHKASCPPM in accordance with the  law of Hong Kong. The law of Britain prohibits activities to  subvert the British sovereign. With regard to openly calling for  the subversion of the Chinese Government and shouting the  slogan, down with the Chinese Government, we may take up the  matter with the British Government, but we estimate that the  chance of Britain's accommodating us is not great; therefore it  is still necessary to mainly rely on our own work in the future.    As for some people's attempt to turn Hong Kong into an  anti-Communist base, we believe that such a situation has  existed all along and that the only difference is that some  people want to change from operating secretly as in the past  into operating openly or semiopenly by exploiting the current  movement. The intelligence units have discovered in a  preliminary manner that in fleeing the country some of those who  participated in the democracy movement in the hinterland have  depended on the help from AHKASCPPM which has not only provided  money but has also specially assigned people to do the job. Some  of those who have fled the country first stayed at the home of  that "specially assigned person," and then got foreign visas and  left Hong Kong. Those few people are the main targets of  struggle.    The meeting did not further discuss the analysis made by the  CPC Work Committee. The conclusion was that it would be  necessary to take up the matter with the British Government in  an effort "to outlaw AHKASCPPM," and that it was also necessary  to work on others so as to gradually weaken or even eliminate  the organization, thereby eliminating the tool used by some  forces in their effort to use Hong Kong as a base for subverting  the Chinese Government.    The meeting also listened to Li Hou's speech on the  resumption of the activities of drafting the Basic Law. In view  of Hong Kong's performance during the 4 June Incident, Li Hou  suggested that clauses on deterring subversive activities and  imposing marshal law in time of emergency should be added to the  draft Basic Law. As no participant expressed any disagreement,  the suggestion was also passed.    After the meeting the Foreign Ministry and the Hong Kong  Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY took up the matter of outlawing  AHKASCPPM with the British Foreign Ministry and the British Hong  Kong government, respectively. We also carried out supporting  media actions in Hong Kong. The British Government rejected  China's demand on the ground that AHKASCPPM was registered in  Hong Kong and was not in violation of the law of Hong Kong. In  addition we also persuaded some leftist and centrist  organizations which had joined AHKASCPPM to leave AHKASCPPM.  Some centrist organizations left AHKASCPPM for their own  reasons. But all this only "weakened" AHKASCPPM slightly.    On 21 July RENMIN RIBAO published an article by Ai Zhong,  entitled "No Attempts to Disrupt the One Country, Two Systems'  Arrangement Is Allowed." We had had no prior knowledge about it,  and felt surprised. After some inquiry we learned that the  article had been drafted by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office. Hong Kong society reacted strongly to the article. I  felt that the article were flawed in two aspects. First, it  revealed the internal analysis that a small number of people  were attempting to turn Hong Kong into an open or semiopen  anti-Communist base, and the language of the article would lead  people to think that all those people in Hong Kong who had  participated in the activities supporting the student's  patriotic movement were trying to turn Hong Kong into an  anti-Communist base, thereby striking at a very large number of  people and creating many enemies. The article not only failed to  square with the facts but was also very unwise in a tactical  sense.    Second, it almost openly named the names of Martin Lee and  Szeto Wah. I felt that the article constituted openly treating  those two persons as "enemies," and that nevertheless the  article would not only fail to isolate those two persons but  also increase their name recognition in the political arena and  their political capital. On the other hand the article would  create a situation where there would be no way of making contact  with those two persons in the future and where work could not be  carried out. We had already known the stands of those two  persons. In dealing with them who would be our adversaries in  future political struggles, we should conduct both struggle and  cooperation. After the 4 June Incident they misread the  situation in China and adopted a radical strategy. Now struggle  with them was the dominant aspect of the matter. But openly  naming names in this way now would in fact leave no room and was  thus a radical move which was unwise in a tactical sense.    I thought that it was necessary first of all to clarify the  first issue and to make explanation to Hong Kong society so as  to moderate the strong reactions against the RENMIN RIBAO  article, through making a distinction between the majority and a  small minority and making clear that the "anti-Communist base"  had nothing to do with the majority. I immediately arranged for  others to write an article expounding this view in a focused  manner. After it was written I sent it to Beijing, hoping that  it would be published in RENMIN RIBAO. However, later Li Hou  told us that approval was only given to publishing it in the  magazine LIAOWANG. Surely the basic stand of this article was in  support of that RENMIN RIBAO article and therefore its impact  was not large.    After the 4 June Incident I made direct and indirect contact  with Szeto Wah and Martin Lee privately. The purpose then was to  preserve some room for restoring cooperation in the future. But  Beijing did not know the activity. They would not have given  approval, but would probably have tried to stop the activity;  and if they would not criticize the activity immediately, they  would probably have kept "a record" afterward.    The policy and strategy of the Communist Party of China and  the Chinese Government of trying to get AHKASCPPM "outlawed" and  "eliminated" were wrong and would not work. This wrong strategy  not only will not work before 1997 but is also very unlikely to  work after 1997. If they at that time adopt tough "outlawing"  measures, not only will the Communist Party of China and the  Chinese Government continue to pay a political price, but the  government of the special administrative region will also be put  in a very difficult position, resulting in damages to Hong Kong  people's confidence in the government of the special  administrative region. The wise approach would be to show  "tolerance," trying to win over the majority and gradually  changing their attitude toward China. With the continuous reform  and opening up on the mainland itself and with the increasing  closeness in the relations between Hong Kong and the hinterland  as 1997 is drawing near, it is entirely possible that such a  policy and strategy will work.    I participated in the formulating of the erroneous policy  and  strategy and approved of the policy and strategy; therefore I  was responsible in this respect.

On Two Occasions David Wilson Took the Initiative in  Inviting Me To Have "Afternoon Tea" at the Governor's Residence.    After the 4 June Incident China's relations with the entire  Western world deteriorated, and the relations between China and  Britain also deteriorated. Clashes between China and Britain  occurred continually, and the relations between China and  Britain ebbed, thereby ending the short period of cooperation  which had existed after the signing of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration.    Britain and the entire Western world together adopted a  tough  policy of imposing sanctions on China. Britain suspended  diplomatic contact with China and also unilaterally suspended  the meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. All  negotiations between China and Britain on the question of Hong  Kong came to an almost complete halt. The British Government  adopted the strategy of supporting the patriotic mass movement  in society. In this way it could not only make a good impression  on people at large but also make China's image even worse and  weaken people's confidence in China. On the other hand they also  worried that the development of the patriotic mass movement  would affect public safety in Hong Kong, resulting in a loss of  control which could cause China to take up the matter with them  and intervene. After the 4 June Incident their way of handling  workers' strikes, shopkeepers' strikes, and students' strikes  across the city contained contradictory elements but was wise.    The British Hong Kong government took actions to facilitate  people's patriotic activities, such as allowing the masses to  hold rallies at the racecourse, an unprecedented move. On the  other hand they also enhanced protection for the Hong Kong  Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and Chinese-owned institutions.  At that time there were constant mass activities such as  marches, petitioning, round-the-clock sit-ins, hunger strikes,  and demonstrations in front of the Hong Kong Branch of the  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY BUILDING. The walls opposite the Hong Kong  Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY were completely covered with  posters and cartoons. There were many onlookers. The situation  was tense. In addition to increasing police patrol, the British  Hong Kong government also had several dozen additional police  personnel posted at the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY all the time. We vacated the first floor of the building  to give them a place to stay. They set up such things telephones  and monitoring television devices, applying rather elaborate  security measures. In the past, during the Kowloon riots, there  had been attacks on China's institutions in Hong Kong. At that  time the British Hong Kong government had not taken preventive  measures beforehand. This time they took the initiative, and  solicited advice from us beforehand. Only after securing our  consent did they do those things as described. They treated  Chinese-owned banks and newspapers and other institutions  belonging to China in the same way.    After the 4 June Incident the CPC Work Committee also made  preparations for dealing with the most serious situation. We  divided the CPC Work Committee's responsible persons into two  groups. One group stayed at the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY Building, ready to deal with any serious situation;  the other group retreated to the Stanley guest-house, getting  prepared to continue necessary activities in case the Hong Kong  Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY should be unable to make  contact with the outside world. I decided to stay in the Hong  Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY BUILDING, and Zheng Hua  and Qiao Zongzhun went to Stanley.    Before the 4 June Incident, once David Wilson, governor of  Hong Kong, by his own initiative, invited me to have "afternoon  tea" at the governor's residence. After the foreign affairs  department secured approval from the Foreign Ministry, I went  there. David Wilson asked me about my opinion of what had  happened in Beijing. Could I tell him my personnel opinion? I  used the diplomatic approach in a unique way: "Your Excellency,  I have been instructed to inform you that the activities at  Tiananmen in Beijing are an instance of turmoil." David Wilson  expressed his understanding.    When discussing local activities in Hong Kong society in  support of the student movement in Beijing, David Wilson told me  that according to the statistics of the police department of the  British Hong Kong government, approximately 500,000 people  participated in the 21 April march, which had been claimed to be  a million-man march. They had devoted all their resources to  making sure that no accidents would happen during the march. He  also told me that they would do everything possible to safeguard  the security of China's institutions in Hong Kong, and he  expressed his appreciation of the cooperation given by the Hong  Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY in this regard. I also  expressed my appreciation of the measures taken by the British  Hong Kong government to safeguard the security of China's  institutions in Hong Kong.    After the formal talk with David Wilson, I chatted casually  with him as he walked out of the front room to see me out. He  said that it was very difficult to handle things under the  current circumstances, thereby demonstrating that he felt that  he was in a difficult position. I immediately said in a  sympathetic manner: "I understand." He was moved by my words and  said: "You assumed heavy responsibilities when being the leader  of a big province. You are experienced and know what may happen  under such circumstances." I replied in a sympathetic manner: "I  understand your difficulties. We are similar to each other."  David Wilson spoke standard putonghua. We talked to  each other directly in putonghua. (Installment No.127)  <H5>  [9 Sep 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] One "Incident" After Another (Part Two of  Four): The Issue of the Right of Abode in Britain Caused  Disputes Between China and Britain; There Was a Strong Statement  Accusing Britain of Violating the Joint Declaration    My second meeting with David Wilson was similar to the first  in that this time David Wilson again invited me to have  "afternoon tea" by his own initiative. The relations between  China and Britain was then already rather tense. At that time,  in accordance with Beijing's instruction, the foreign affairs  department of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY was  negotiating with the political counsel of the Hong Kong  government on the issue of outlawing AHKASCPPM. Our side  demanded that the British Hong Kong government nullify the  registration of AHKASCPPM. The British side said that the  registration had been handled according to the law of Hong Kong.  We then argued that according to the law of Hong Kong an  organization would not be allowed to try to subvert the British  sovereign, and that therefore the registration of AHKASCPPM  should still be nullified. The British side retorted: that  according to the law of Hong Kong AHKASCPPM should be allowed to  exist and operate. Either side was willing to make concessions,  resulting in a stalemate. However, when I met with David Wilson,  neither of us touched upon this issue. What he was concerned  with seemed to be the situation of the top leadership in  Beijing. I could not satisfy his desire, and, like friends, we  chatted for a while.    I talked to David Wilson about the issue of "the right of  abode in Britain" raised by some people in Hong Kong. This issue  had first been raised by the manager of a conglomerate in Hong  Kong in the name of an organization. The point of departure was  that after the 4 June Incident too many of Hong Kong's elites  had emigrated, thereby affecting the functioning of Hong Kong  enterprises. This was true. As too large a portion of the  managerial personnel of the business world had emigrated, those  who had not emigrated were also unsettled, and were planning to  emigrate, resulting in a serious brain drain. In Hong Kong  society there was a widespread feeling of a lack of enterprise  management personnel. High salaries were used to retain the  management personnel planning to emigrate. There were two salary  increases in one year, or even three increases in some cases.  Under such circumstances some people put forward the idea of  "the right of abode in Britain," the idea that the right of  abode in Britain should be given now while those granted the  right would not emigrate to Britain right away, that after 1997  they would not necessarily emigrate if China's policies should  be enlightened and if Hong Kong should remain in the same  condition as before, and that they would emigrate if they should  consider the situation to be bad. People in Hong Kong said that  under the current immigration procedures, there was a need to  stay in an "immigration prison." That is, they could return to  Hong Kong only after they had lived in the foreign country and  had acquired residence status there. "The right of abode in  Britain" could eliminate the need to stay in the "immigration  prison." As a result there would be no adverse effects on their  service at enterprises. They publicized this idea in newspapers,  and carried out activities privately, applying pressure on the  British Government and demanding that the British Government  grant this right. It seemed that the British Government had  adopted this idea and was using it for resolving the issue of  civil servants in the British Hong Kong government, in an effort  to change their mood characterized by a lack of confidence and a  desire to emigrate.    I told David Wilson my personal opinion as Beijing had not  yet given any instructions on this issue. With regard to the  issue of "the right of abode in Britain," I said to David  Wilson, my personal opinion is that the putting forward of this  idea is understandable, but that some problems will be difficult  to resolve, and may lead to serious consequences. If "the right  of abode in Britain" is applied to civil servants, then there  will be great difficulties in the continued functioning of the  government of the special administrative region after 1997. For  with the departure of a large part of those civil servants  granted "the right of abode in Britain" who have no confidence  in the future special administrative region, there will be a  lack of knowledgeable people in the government of the special  administrative region. If the situation in Hong Kong is good at  that time and if most of the civil servants have confidence,  decide not to emigrate while still having the right of abode in  Britain, and stay here to serve the government of the special  administrative region, then will they be loyal to the British  sovereign or to the government of the special administrative  region? They will experience such conflicts both psychologically  and in real life. I hope you will consider the issue carefully.  In this way, I in fact described in advance the position which  China would find it difficult to accept, despite the fact that  at that time I did not know Beijing's attitude. Because I spoke  in a discussion tone, David Wilson just nodded and did not  indicate his attitude after listening to me.    Shortly afterward, at the Hong Kong and Macao work  conference  gathered by Ji Pengfei, Zhou Nan [0719 0589] presented the  written protest concerning "the right of abode in Britain" that  the Foreign Ministry intended to deliver to the British Foreign  Ministry, and asked the participants to discuss it. The draft  raised the importance of the issue to the level of violating and  damaging the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and stated that the  British Government would be held responsible.    I suggested that such wording might be too strong. According  to my information, I argued, the issue was not raised by Britain  but has been "taken up" by Britain which has then expanded the  issue to encompass the civil servants; at least such has been  the case on the surface. Many upper- and middle-strata people in  Hong Kong are in favor of Britain's adopting this policy and  hope that Britain will adopt this policy. It is necessary to  reconsider whether to raise the importance of the issue to the  level of violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration. If we are  being too harsh, those people's mood will be affected; as a  result the work of winning those people over will be adversely  affected. If there is to be a written public protest, might it  not be advisable to make the wording milder and not to raise the  importance of the issue to such a level? Ji Pengfei approved of  my view, and immediately asked Zhou Nan to make some changes.  Nevertheless the protest which was made public later still  exhibited a harsh attitude, effectively accusing the other side  of violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by J. Jufelschulte and P. Miller: "Wanted: Mole; </F> Intrigues or High Treason? Nerves Are Raw in the Federal  Intelligence Service"]    [Text] The employees of the secret service suspected clever  intrigue, even treason. They needed the evidence to back it up,  though.    Otherwise quite successful at spying and information  gathering, top officials in the Federal Intelligence Service  (BND) were at a loss for a clear answer. Minister of State Bernd  Schmidbauer wanted a concrete answer last Tuesday [25 January]  in the Federal Chancellery; just who is running all over the  BND? Just who is the troublemaker?    In Pullach near Munich, headquarters of the spy agency, with  approximately 7,000 employees deployed domestically and abroad,  morale is currently at a low point. "Our nerves," one BND  insider revealed to FOCUS, "are completely raw."    Worst case ever of double agent activity among Germany's  most  silent officials:    An official from the administrative level, so goes the  gossip  among Pullach subordinates, is supposed to have removed secret  materials from the office over a period of years. The  materials--without his knowledge--traveled over hazardous  routes, eventually ending up in the GDR Ministry for State  Security. A "super GAU" [district] for the BND.    The top official was defended immediately.    "We have no prior knowledge of this," emphasized Secret  Service Coordinator Schmidbauer. Joachim Lampe, attorney for the  Federal Supreme Court in Karlsruhe, who was informed immediately  of the charges, also made a placating statement: "At this time  we have no case against this man."    Nevertheless, the Office of the Federal Attorney is  currently  conducting an investigation in a case of espionage that would  not have been conceivable without direct BND participation.    And just as certain: The unknown remover of highly  confidential analyses and papers has not yet been exposed. The  BND is searching for its mole.    One of those implicated in this espionage affair today sits  embittered in his house in Munich and has, at the age of 81,  only one last wish: "I want to spit in the face of this  blackguard from the Stasi."    Dr. Gerhard B., once editor in chief for the West German  technical journal SOLDAT IM VOLK, still finds it hard to grasp  just how badly the floppy-hat members of GDR State Security  crucified him.    The Background. Dr. B., who always had access to  internal circles of the Bundeswehr and the West German Secret  Services, was recruited under a "foreign flag" during the  fifties. In other words: At that time he began meeting with men  who--although they were Germans--claimed to be working for the  French intelligence service.    Dr. B. experienced no pangs of conscience. The Frenchmen, he  truly believed, were surely loyal allies in the effort to create  a strong Europe.    The alleged agents of the French secret service were in  reality "patrons" of the Leipzig Stasi-district government, who  were passing the information they received immediately to the  espionage headquarters on Normanen Street in East Berlin.    Federal Supreme Court Attorney Lampe is currently examining  whether B. actually was unaware of the true identity of his  handlers, and whether he unknowingly got mixed up with Mielke's  men.    The journalist Dr. Gerhard B., known by the Stasi under the  cover name "Schwarz," was apparently a top source. Until 1988,  over a period of 30 years, he is suspected of having reported  willingly on military policy conferences and training courses  held at Bundeswehr training facilities. The people from Leipzig,  among them agents whose cover names were Tratmann and Veit, also  learned as much as they could about the Bavarian Office for the  Protection of the Constitution and the CSU [Christian Social  Union].    The Leipzig former Stasi Colonel B., according to the legend  "resident of the French office for the German-speaking area,"  was able to get ahead using the achievements of his inofficial  employee from Munich. "Schwarz" is also supposed to have  supplied them with informational reports, situation reports, and  security analyses over the years, which originated from BND  headquarters. A jackpot for the Stasi.    It remains unclear today exactly how this secret procurement  in Pullach could have occurred. Federal Supreme Court Attorney  Lampe is currently not investigating this point, however he sees  a legitimate interest in the "clarification of this issue."    Dr. Gerhard B., interviewed by FOCUS, admitted that he quite  often received "several items" from his "good old friend" Dr.  Kurt W., a former BND director. The Stasi knew this and even  gave the "good friend" Dr. Kurt W. a cover name--"Berater"  [adviser].    "Berater" was once a sparkling figure in the West  German Secret Service. The former head of Department 1, chief of  all BND agents around the world, is supposed to have taken part  in the creation of a secret service within the Secret Service,  out of frustration over the social liberal coalition in  Bonn--the unlawful operation was conducted under the code name  "Operation Eva."    Dr. Kurt W., alias "Berater," also maintained very close  contact with the Pullach circles even after his retirement.  Through one of his former colleagues, according to BND  employees, Kurt W. is supposed to have gotten hold of official  documents. With this action the top BND official would have at  the very least committed betrayal state secrecy laws.    The subsequent stages in the floppy-hat sequence:    Kurt W. is supposed to have passed papers and other  information on by mouth to Gerhard B. alias "Schwarz." He did  this allegedly without suspecting that he would further pass the  information--knowingly or unknowingly--on to the Stasi.    Ex-BND Director Kurt W. can today no longer be questioned on  these events. After suffering a severe stroke he is now  considered in no condition to be questioned.    With their IM [unofficial agent] "Schwarz," the Stasi,  disguised as the French intelligence service, played a crazy  foreign agent game to the very end.    On Gerhard B.'s 75th birthday, 19 September 1987, something  unusual happened to Colonel B. from Leipzig. On the basis of his  great services paid to France, "Schwarz" was supposed to be  dubbed "knight of the Legion of Honor," which is comparable in  Germany to the Federal Service Cross.    The solemn ceremony was held in the "blue room" of the  elegant Schloss Hotel in Igls near Innsbruck.    The Stasi was already thinking ahead. Via Gerhard B. they  attempted to approach a BND employee, to whom, as a precaution,  the cover name "Zange" [tongs] was given.    At this point it remains unclear whether the recruitment was  a success.    Volker Foertsch, who has been left out in the cold in the  wrangling for a position of influence in the BND, may be looking  into this question immediately. Foertsch, head of Department 1  (operative training) since 1989, has been now been assigned to  handle security and counterespionage. Department 5, within the  BND, serves as the traditional stronghold for service intrigues.    Foertsch's successor after February is Dr. Rudolf Werner,  alias Dr. Kempe, up to now BND resident in Washington.    Insiders are wondering whether the American friends from the  Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) will give Werner, who will be  departing his post as BND governor, a small going-away gift. As  is generally known, the filmed data on Stasi foreign espionage,  which up to now have been presented to German protectors of the  Constitution only in abridged form, lie in the CIA archives  (FOCUS 48/1993).    Maybe with a little luck and some good intentions these  could  help to expose IM Zange....</p>

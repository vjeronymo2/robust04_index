			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 12 Jun (PL) -- Haitians reacted today  to the state of emergency announced by provisional President  Emile Jonassaint with the same indifference Washington did.    Life continued as normal in the neighboring nation, whose  inhabitants seem more interested in resolving the issue of  sustenance -- cut off to a great extent by the harsh sanctions  imposed against the military authorities -- than alarmed by the  threat of a foreign invasion.    It was not until early this morning when, in a significant  move, Jonassaint, who is not recognized worldwide, urged fellow  countrymen via radio and television to unite and resist in light  of the possibility of the eventual use of force to restore  ousted Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. Although he did not  specify the measures involved in the imposed state of emergency,  Jonassaint ordered the urgent preparation of troops.    This is taking place shortly after the tightening of  restrictions by U.S. President Bill Clinton, who seeks the  removal of coupist General Raoul Cedras and his supporters  through the suspension of commercial flights and the elimination  of financial operations. Despite this step, Clinton has not  entirely rejected the military option. A cold U.S. reaction  followed the announcement in Port-au- Prince. This reaction  came about when William Gray, Clinton's representative for  Haitian affairs, doubted that Jonassaint's declaration will have  any effect.    In the first official statement by the White House, Gray  refused to refer to the possibility of military intervention in  Haiti, but conceded that it is one of the options available to  the U.S. President.</p>

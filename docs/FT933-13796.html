			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Prospect of renewed fighting overshadows start of summit THE prospect of renewed fighting between Serbs and Croats for the recovery of Croatian territory overshadowed the start of a two-day summit meeting between central European leaders yesterday which is aimed at easing ethnic conflicts and increasing regional co-operation, Anthony Robinson writes from Budapest. Serbia has been excluded from the Central European Initiative (CEI) summit, which provides a forum for meetings between the prime ministers and foreign ministers of Italy and eight central European countries. Today Macedonia is due to join the CEI, which was launched in 1989 as a five-nation group cutting across the divide between Nato and Warsaw Pact countries.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW YEAR'S BIRTH  </P> <P> When I read the article about Dr. Charles Wesley Turner Jr. and his timed  delivery of Myra Palmer, I was compelled to write. The gray areas of obstetrics  I leave to the obstetricians and the lawyers to debate.  </P> <P> I am not an obstetrics nurse.  </P> <P> The part of this story that bothered me had to do with Dr. Turner's belief that  God was working through him, helping him achieve this birth for the television  event. I am certain that he believes this to be true and that he believes he  did the right thing. What I am also certain of is mankind's track record of  committing atrocities in the name of God, all the while believing that they too  were doing the right thing. We all need to be aware of this, no matter what our  religion, or belief system.  </P> <P> When we are swayed by our religious leaders into having a baby for TV, paying  for an air-conditioned dog house, or giving money so that God won't "call our  minister," we are putting our faith in leaders whose actions, at best, are  questionable. May we all wake up and smell the coffee.  </P> <P> KATHRYN J. TAIT  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P> <P>  Kathryn J. Tait is a registered nurse.  </P> <P> </P></p>

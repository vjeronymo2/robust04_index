			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Defense Minister Boyko Noev by </F> Lyubomir Denov; place and date not given: "Boyko Noev: The  Time for Neutrality Has Passed"]    [Text] [Denov] Mr. Noev, is it true that you want to cut  the army from 100,000 to 55,000 soldiers, as the leader of the  Rakovski Legion claims?    [Noev] Many sins have been attributed to me recently. This  has prompted me to overcome my reluctance to participate in  public debates related to national security issues.    I categorically state that my lips never uttered and my pen  never wrote the figure 50,000, or any other figure regarding the  number of army personnel. This is not a part of my direct  duties and I do not claim any qualifications in this sphere.    However, I have every reason to believe that the figure  50,000 has been proposed to the minister of defense by a  highranking officer. He was entrusted with the task of  calculating what army we could maintain within the 13 billion  military budget.    [Denov] Do you mean Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the  General Staff?    [Noev] No comment.    [Denov] You have been accused of insisting on more decisive  cuts in the army. Did you initiate the idea on officers'  compensation in the form of privatization bonds, described by  the military as "pieces of paper?"    [Noev] I have nothing to do with any compensation or "pieces  of paper."    [Denov] Does the army have any alternatives within the  framework of this miserable budget?    [Noev] Generally speaking, there are two alternatives: The  first is the immediate beginning of the reforms. There are  possibilities for this and, in addition, the leadership of the  Defense Ministry is willing to do this. The second alternative  is to leave things as they are, as though we were still at the  time of the broad frontal operations of the time of the blocs'  confrontation. I do not think that anything has radically  changed in our structures since then. I think that the same  applies to certain people's way of thinking. It is my  pessimistic forecast that a further delay of the reforms will  inevitably lead by autumn to an accumulation of problems,  exacerbating the crisis and shortages in the troops. I hope  that my forecast proves wrong. In any event, I will not be a  dumb witness to such tendencies.    My only hope is in those employees in the Defense Ministry  system, the officers and civilians, who are champions of the new  ideas, and who are capable of proposing new solutions and  breaking the old norms. Those people are not afraid to assume  responsibility.    [Denov] Could the army cope with an eventual external threat  to Bulgaria's security within the framework of this budget?    [Noev] Today there is no consensus among the political  forces or experts about the external threat's character and  degree. One should not make a great drama out of it. It is no  secret that there is no consensus among the various units of the  Ministry of Defense, either.    The "threat" is a matter of assessment and no one should  have  a monopoly over determining it. This is the situation in all  the civilized countries throughout the world. The assessment of  the threat must be a product of cooperation between the relevant  state institutions.    [Denov] In your view, what is the goal behind fanning the  military threat against Bulgaria?    [Noev] Fanning the threat of a war in the Balkans could be  in pursuit of many internal political group and individual  goals. It is my opinion that despite the formally existing  tension and military imbalances along a part of our borders, at  present Bulgaria enjoys significant security. What contributes  to this is first of all the unique and stable strategic  circumstances, second, our real association with the European  and Euro-Atlantic structures, and last but not least, the  prudent and balanced policy conducted by our relevant  institutions.    I know that not everyone will be happy if I again repeat my  conviction about the absurd character of the apocalyptic script  that includes aggression against Bulgaria. I also do not accept  the abstract threat that "if our neighbor's house is burning,  our house is next."    The last thing that Bulgaria needs today is maintaining  insecurity and a psychosis of fear in our society. This of  course does not mean that there should not be an army.    What kind of army -- this is a worthy subject that should be  discussed in a responsible manner by the Consultative Council on  National Security at the Presidency.    [Denov] Is it not high time that this body began  functioning?    [Noev] I think that this is the only body that can and must  assume collective responsibility for solutions that have such a  fundamentally social character. This is the only body which  could prompt the beginning of the new stage of the military  reform.    [Denov] Have you been punished for your statement that NATO  should bomb Sarajevo? You said that limited air strikes do not  jeopardize Bulgaria. However, later on the prime minister  declared his opposition to air strikes.    [Noev] I will draw your attention to the consequences of  NATO shooting down the four Serbian aircraft. Have you heard of  anyone expressing concern for our security in this context,  despite the fact that Greece declared a state of increased  combat readiness in its armed forces?    This means that I was right. However, this was not only my  position, but also the position of the president, the defense  minister, and the other state institutions.    [Denov] Nevertheless, was there a dispute between you and  General Brigo Asparukhov at the National Security Commission,  when the possible consequences of eventual air strikes against  Sarajevo were assessed?    [Noev] Yes, there was a dispute, but it revolved around  principles.    [Denov] You are one of the great adherents to the  Partnership for Peace initiative and joining NATO. What are  your reasons?    [Noev] I was first of all motivated by the unanimous  position of parliament, as well as the clear position of the  government and the president on the same matter. Naturally, I  am also led by the deep conviction that cooperation with the  NATO states and with our former allies from the Warsaw Pact  fully corresponds to our national interests. The more this  cooperation strengthens, the more our security strengthens.    [Denov] Why is it necessary to cooperate with NATO? Certain  politicians propose various variants of neutrality, such as the  Finnish type?    [Noev] It is necessary to cooperate with NATO because there  is no real alternative to NATO. This is the only  military-political organization with proven potential and  practical possibilities. In addition, only close cooperation  with NATO and membership could provide us with those additional  security guarantees, such as those that have already controlled  the complex relations between our southern neighbors for decades.    I think that the time of neutrality passed with the  disintegration of the bloc system. It is interesting that the  champions of neutrality do not object to our membership of the  European Union, which also means membership of the Western  European Union. They also keep silent about the fact that this  membership, which we unanimously desire in such a passionate  manner, means that we relinquish to a large degree certain  elements of our national sovereignty!    [Denov] How much will joining Partnership for Peace cost?  Some people say that if we integrate into NATO we will have to  change our weaponry completely, which means billions of dollars.    [Noev] First of all, this is a political issue, and it was  already resolved a long time ago. In the long run we will  profit from the partnership much more compared with the  immediate consumer expenditure related to opening our mission at  NATO headquarters in Belgium.    In this context, I would like to appeal to Bulgarian private  capital, which could contribute very much to the direction of  our integration. The annual expenditure of an optimal mission  and a worthy representation of Bulgaria in NATO will not cost  more than $250,000. If we receive this amount as aid from  someone it will end the speculations that integration into NATO  should be delayed because of the budget.    As far as rearming is concerned, it has already been said  several times that integration does not presuppose total  rearmament. It is NATO's position that standardization is not a  problem that, in the final analysis, influences the political  decision about membership. Thus the billions of dollars  described by certain factors in Bulgaria as "unsurmountable"  obstacles are mere scarecrows.    [Denov] After the so-called officer putsch the defense  minister mentioned army cuts. How will these be effected?    [Noev] A special commission has been founded under the  leadership of one of the deputy ministers of defense. This  commission will optimize the structures and payroll and will  reveal reserves from a more efficient utilization of the scant  budget. I share the assessment that the payroll of the Defense  Ministry and the General Staff is artificially inflated. There  are many duplicating functions. Some warrant officers do  inappropriate work. Many military employees are engaged in  inefficient activities.    The results of this commission's work will be published in  the second part of March; however, I would like to say that  there will be no extensive or unprincipled cuts, or "throwing  people onto the streets."    Furthermore, I have every reason to believe that the  Ministry  of Defense could set an example in taking care of its personnel,  as has been the case in other countries. For me the ideal  example is Great Britain. We are also studying the Russian  experience.    Despite the lack of funds we could provide requalification  programs. If we approach this subject seriously and  responsibly, within six months we could be receiving 120 million  leva from international financial institutions for the  implementation of such programs. I think that the problem of  compensation could also be fully resolved. I refer to the case  when labor contracts are discontinued because of the closure of  inefficient structures. Bulgarian officers, both on active  service and in the reserve forces, must have a worthy place in  Bulgarian society.</p>

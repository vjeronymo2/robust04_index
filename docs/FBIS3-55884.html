What Does Fate Have in Store for  It? What is Best: A Good Council or a Strong Duma?"]    [Text] The State Duma deputies who have reached Moscow  after overcoming every conceivable obstacle in the fight for  seats still do not suspect that the main battle is yet to come.  Each of them will have to fit into the unwieldy structure of  the Duma and satisfy their own personal ambitions at the same  time.    According to a plan existing at the Duma each deputy apart  from the State Duma chairman, the deputy chairmen, and the  chairmen of the factions, must be a member of one of its  committees.    In all it is planned to create 18 committees. However, this  figure changed constantly while the plan was being worked out.  Representatives of the president's side actively promoted the  idea of forming no more than 10 committees within the Duma each  of which would be in charge of several global spheres  simultaneously.    The present plan for the operation of the State Duma  committees exactly reflects the structure of the executive  branch of power (in the form of ministries and departments)  which is designed to make it as easy as possible for parliament  to perform its monitoring functions.    Undoubtedly the authors of the plan for the internal  organization of the Duma copied much from the parliament  disbanded by the president. Let us recall here that in the  bicameral Supreme Soviet there were just over 250 deputies  working on a permanent basis in 19 committees and eight standing  commissions. These committees and commissions performed the  functions of a primary filter carrying out the preliminary  examination of draft laws. Similar functions will be inherited  by the 18 committees of the State Duma. Furthermore, even the  names of the committees have been changed only slightly. The  really striking innovations are not very important: Now, for  example, questions of constitutional legislation and human  rights have been transferred to one committee (and not two as in  the former Supreme Soviet).    On the other hand two new committees have appeared: one on  the budget and taxes, the other on banks, credit, and money  circulation. The new structure does not have a committee on the  mass media but does have a committee on the organization of the  work of the State Duma.    It is still not clear which principles will determine how  deputies will be distributed among the committees. The  factions' opinions vary on this score: Some think that the sole  guiding principle should be the professional training of Duma  members (but what about "Yabloko," for example, which has four  specialists in foreign affairs): Others insist that you should  only take into account the personal preference of the deputy  himself (however, apparatchiks of the former Supreme Soviet  still recall that out of the 1041 deputies in the former  parliament 700 were registered with the committee for  international relations). "Russia's Choice," "Yabloko," and the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord have put forward their own  approaches: Namely, to form committees on the principle of the  proportional representation of the factions and independent  deputies. The points system for evaluating posts in the Duma  has been constructed according to this plan: The post of State  Duma chairman is rated at five points, the deputy chairman at  three points, the chairman of the tellers commission at two  points, a committee chairman at one point, and his deputy at 0.5  points.    According to the author of this plan, each faction and  deputies' group will receive a strictly defined number of points  depending on the percentage of their representatives in the Duma.    The pro-president side is also proposing a voting mechanism  based on that idea -- the State Duma approves a list of  committee chairmen and up to two deputies. Only after that is  the composition of the committees as a whole approved.    It is already obvious now that the struggle for the posts of  the chairmen of two of the 18 Duma committees -- defense and  international relations -- will be the most keenly fought. The  activity of these committees, given that the powers conferred on  them (the defense policy of the Russian Federation and the  ratification and denunciation of Russia's international  treaties) will have the greatest impact including for the  president. Incidentally, the posts of chairmen of those two  committees are being regarded as on a par with the speaker of  the lower chamber of parliament. V. Zhirinovskiy, leader of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], is definitely  competing for the post of chairman of the international  relations committee and with an ulterior motive.    Quite a few lances have been broken over the question of the  Duma's leading organ. There have been different suggestions  both for the actual title (presidium, conference, or council)  and the mechanism for the formation of this organ. (Let me  remind you here that the presidium of the former Supreme Soviet  was formed from the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, his four  deputies, and the chairmen of the two chambers, of the  committees, and of the commissions as ex officio members).    It is planned to form the Duma council from the speaker, the  deputy speakers (ranging in number from two to five), and  representatives of the factions on the principle of  proportionality. However, it is proposed that the chairmen of  the committees will only be given a consultative vote.    Many factions tend to see the Duma council as a powerful  link  in the internal structure of the lower chamber.    Deputies have a legitimate interest in the solution of the  question of the right to freely change factions within the Duma.  The "Russia's Choice" deputies are unambiguously insisting on  "feudal law" although they will surely hardly be able to enforce  such a "political loyalty" -- the resistance of the communists,  agrarians, and the LDPR is too great.    Incidentally, it is quite likely that another faction, the  ninth so far, will soon appear in the Duma under the leadership  of Sergey Baburin, the independent deputy from Omsk. For that  to happen he needs to unite at least 14 like-minded deputies  around himself.    It only remains to be added that all the proposals on the  organization of the Duma must unfailingly be approved by the  deputies.</p>

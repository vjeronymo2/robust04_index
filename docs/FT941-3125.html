			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Merivale Moore Merivale Moore swung back into the black in the half year to end-December as the property company reported signs of a 'fairly significant improvement in the residential and commercial property markets'. On sales and rents down from a restated Pounds 13.4m to Pounds 6.2m, the company returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 133,000 for the period, against a deficit of Pounds 2.68m last time. The outcome was boosted by a fall in interest charges from Pounds 3.64m to Pounds 1.78m and reduced administrative expenses of Pounds 583,000 (Pounds 719,000). After a Pounds 44,000 tax bill (Pounds 247,000 credit) earnings per share worked through at 0.65p (17.83p losses). The board expects to announce a dividend with the full year results.</p>

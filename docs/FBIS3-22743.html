			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Friday [11 March] brushed aside speculation that  Japan will arm itself with nuclear weapons, a Foreign Ministry  official said.    "We wish to contribute to peace and security in the  (Northeast Asian) region while maintaining the set-up under the  Japan-U.S. security arrangements," the official quoted Hosokawa  as saying in an interview with the Korean Broadcasting System  (KBS).    "It is impossible for us to go nuclear in light of the  nuclear allergy of our people," he reportedly said, explaining  Tokyo's strictly defensive national security policy under its  war-renouncing Constitution.    The interview, held at Hosokawa's official residence, will  be  broadcast on the evening of March 22 in a prime-time special KBS  program on the premier ahead of South Korean President Kim Yong-  sam's visit to Japan from March 24 through 26.    Hosokawa, who visited South Korea for a summit with Kim last  November, voiced hope the two leaders will reaffirm the need for  future-oriented Tokyo-Seoul ties, the official said.    Expressing deep concern about North Korea's suspected  nuclear  weapons development program, the premier called for cooperation  among Japan, South Korea and the United States in resolving the  issue, the official said.    On bilateral economic relations, Hosokawa noted that the  transfer of high technology from Japan to South Korea and the  bilateral trade imbalance in favor of Japan will be brought up  in discussion of a soon-to-be-created intergovernmental forum  for new economic partnership, the official said.    Hosokawa was also quoted as saying both Japan and the U.S.  should "take cool and sensible steps" to resolve their brewing  trade spat, the official said.</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SERIES TICKET CALLS JAM PHONES  </P> <P> About 2.1 million callers hoping to buy tickets to the Bay Bridge World Series  disrupted telephone service for two hours in communities throughout Northern  California, officials said.  </P> <P> "The last earthquake we had did not generate this type of calling," said  Pacific Bell spokeswoman Judy Peterson. Dial tones were delayed Tuesday morning  from Sonoma to Santa Clara to Sacramento as baseball fans jammed telephone  lines. The callers were seeking 4,000 tickets that went on sale at 9 a.m. for  the three San Francisco Giants' home games at Candlestick Park.  </P> <P> BASS-Ticketmaster, which handled the sales exclusively by telephone, said all  were sold by 1:15 p.m.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Five Cases of HIV Infection in </F> Pregnant Women"]    [Text] Five cases of infection were found in anonymous HIV  tests at maternal counseling clinics last year. All pregnant  women were tested.    No one knows who the infected women are. The tests were not  provided with identification information. Around 65,000 tests  were performed in all, the Public Health Institute disclosed in  its publication.    Professor Pauli Leinikki of the Public Health Institute's  HIV  laboratory considers the number of cases that were found  surprisingly high. In his opinion it shows how important it is  to have an HIV test when visiting a clinic. However a test where  the mother's identity is disclosed cannot be made against her  will.    The AIDS situation in Finland is still the best in the  western world, in the opinion of people at the Public Health  Institute. According to preliminary reports only 56 new cases of  HIV infection were recorded last year. That is clearly fewer  than the year before.</p>

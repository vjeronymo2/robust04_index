			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (3): Ambitious and sprawling - UK Regulations One of the reliable moments of comedy during environmental conferences is the announcement from the 'chair' that there will be a workshop on 'green industry'. Delegates will promptly begin to move towards the corners of the seminar room allocated to alternative topics: animals, world trade, perhaps global warming. That will leave a small group of chemical industry executives and the newer breed of environmental campaigners eyeing each other nervously before they settle down to talk about whether regulation is really making business greener. Industry is one of the oldest targets of environmental pressure groups. The lobbyists might credit themselves with some success: regulation to curb industrial pollution is now at the heart of the UK's environmental policy. Yet the government is still besieged with complaints from both environmentalists and industrialists that the rules are not working: too loose, says the 'green' side; too bureaucratic, says the 'brown'. Is either chorus right? The core of the regulation is set out in the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, an ambitious and sprawling piece of 'enabling' legislation created by Mr Chris Patten, then environment secretary, when popular green enthusiasm was at its height. The principle underpinning the rules is the cumbersomely named 'Batneec' or 'best available technique not entailing excessive cost'. The task of applying it falls to the pollution inspectorate. Its director, Mr David Slater, has a modern taste for 'long-term dialogue with companies', and for 'cost-benefit' analysis. He argues that 'We're not in the business of putting business out of business'. Instead, he and his inspectors like to spend time discussing with individual companies how they can minimise waste. Industry, at first hostile to much of the new regulation, has recently been making more conciliatory sounds, and companies say they appreciate the flexibility the inspectorate is showing. In the early days of the Act, as all parties were struggling to interpret Batneec, there were many fierce complaints, particularly from the chemical industry, that the rules were unworkable. Mr John Cox, director of the Chemical Industries Association, which represents some 250 UK companies, says 'there are still problems of interpreting Batneec, but it is much better than it was'. In the early months, he says, local inspectors often displayed 'a different understanding of the regulations from the central inspectorate'. But some sticking points have now been ironed out, he says. While environmentalists are increasingly willing to contemplate cooperation with industry rather than confrontation, many have regarded the inspectorate's measures - and industry's mellowing response - with suspicion. They particularly dislike some of the inspectorate's recent decisions - such as allowing two power stations to burn orimulsion as fuel, which campaigners have dubbed 'the world's filthiest fuel'. In particular, they accuse him of having 'gone soft' on polluting industries during the recession. While there are indications in parts of government policy that environmental aims have been sacrificed because of the fragility of economic recovery - environment department officials say privately that they regard the construction industry as out of bounds at present - the inspectorate denies that it has come under such pressure. Some of that suspicion may seem inevitable, given the history of mistrust between the environmental movement and industry. But criticism of the regulation and the inspectorate is justified, some economists say. Mr Dieter Helm, director of Oxera, the forecasting group, says 'the structure that we have now facilitates 'regulatory capture' (an over-sympathetic attitude towards companies by their regulator) because the inspectorate has so much discretion with applying the rules, and so much of the judgment depends on examining individual sites'. A second weakness, he argues, is that the rules are 'technology driven, and not subjected to a proper scrutiny of costs'. In his view, the 'Bat' element of the 'Batneec' rule has been applied more than the 'neec', which entails more difficult analysis. For example, he argues, under present rules, coal burning power stations are urged to fit flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) to cut sulphur emissions, which have been linked to acid rain. It is true that FGD is the best available technique for power stations, he says, but if cost is taken into account, it would be cheaper to build gas-fired stations. Failure to consider costs thoroughly has been a flaw of much environmental regulation, and industrialists and economists - and some 'green' campaigners  -are agreed that closer attention is merited. That will not address, however, the concern of environmentalists and other outside observers that the regulator is too 'soft', if not 'captured' by industry. Because of those concerns, Mr Slater is likely to find that he continues to be the subject of suspicion and intense scrutiny by the environmental movement. He will have a tough job as he continues to iron out the lumps in Britain's well meaning but sometimes ill thought out pollution legislation. As Mr Helm puts it, 'if you started from scratch, you wouldn't design regulation like this'.  ------------------------------------------------------------------         INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION ABATEMENT SPENDING BY SECTOR  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Sector                     Pounds m               Per cent  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture                   77                      2 Energy                       553                     17 Minerals                      24                      1 Manufacturing              2,544                     78 Construction                  65                      2 Services                     n/a                    n/a Total                      3,263                    100  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: ECOTEL Research and Consultancy Review of UK environmental expenditure  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Report to the Department of Health 1993  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

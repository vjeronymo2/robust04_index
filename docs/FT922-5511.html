			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel In the week of Mountleigh and Canary Wharf perhaps nothing can be taken for granted. But if a 5p rise in Eurotunnel shares was the understandable reaction to last night's confirmation that the banks have granted a waiver, the fundamentals for shareholders have barely changed. Eurotunnel calculates that the unspecified sum released by the lenders will be spent come August/September, at which point the uncertainty begins again. Its breach of covenant may be passed off as technical - relating as it does to the margin by which projected cash flows will cover debt repayments to the year 2012 - but the banks nevertheless have the whip hand if negotiations with the contractors do not proceed according to their taste. In this respect Eurotunnel's apparently unilateral decision to make another one-off payment of Pounds 50m to TML could be seen as conciliatory. The trouble for investors, however, is distinguishing bluff from double bluff. One theory has it that Eurotunnel is not really interested in a quick settlement with the contractors and hopes that the current arbitration procedure can be prolonged until the tunnel opening is much closer. That way the company would have a much clearer idea of costs, and could dangle an almost visible income stream alongside the much feared rights issue.</p>

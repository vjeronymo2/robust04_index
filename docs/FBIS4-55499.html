			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Turks Without Representative in </F> Constitutional Court"]    [Text] Referring to the fact that no judge in the  Macedonian Constitutional Court is of Turkish origin, the  Democratic Party of Turks in Macedonian [FYROM -- Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] issued a public protest and  condemn of the politics of double standards. Although the Turks  present a constitutive and constructive element of Macedonia's  statehood, this act is a repeated attempt to leave this minority  at the margins of the political life in the country, the party  announcement says. Such behavior results in distrust for the  government bodies and institutions. The announcement concludes  this kind of democracy leads nowhere.</p>

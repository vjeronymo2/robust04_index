			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollars and Pounds remain strong The dollar and sterling dom-inated currency trading yesterday in a session made quiet by the partial US holiday in honour of Martin Luther King, writes Philip Gawith. The pound took heart from an encouraging batch of UK economic data during London trading and recovered from small early losses caused by profit-taking after last week's strong gains. The dollar moved to its highest level against the D-Mark since August 1991. Investors avoided the D-Mark, largely because of disenchantment about Germany's economic prospects and worries about developments in Russia. The dollar ended around its highest level of the day against the D-Mark after a quiet European session. However, it eased slightly against the yen and was barely changed at the close against sterling. In London, the US currency's close of DM1.7553 was nearly  1/2 pfennig up from Friday's finish. It slipped against the yen to Y111.08 from Friday's Y111.215. Sterling finished at Dollars 1.4918, near to London's Dollars 1.4921 level before the weekend. In New York, the dollar ended at DM1.7525 and Y111.13 and the pound at Dollars 1.4935. Yesterday's quiet trading did not deter some observers from predicting strong further gains for the dollar. Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank AG, was reported as forecasting that the dollar would rise into a corridor between DM1.80 and DM1.85 in the second quarter and remain there until 1995. However, in remarks to a capital markets seminar, he added that he expected the Bundesbank and US Federal Reserve would intervene to sell dollars if the dollar/D-Mark rate topped DM1.85. Sterling put in another robust performance, closing at DM2.6184 compared with DM2,6118 on Friday. It started the day at DM2.605 after a spate of unfavourable stories about the weakness of the government prompted selling in Asia. But it touched DM2.62 in mid-morning in London after the release of favourable industrial production and producer price data. Analysts said the UK output data were bullish for sterling because they reflected good growth and so supported the government's reluctance last week to cut interest rates. Although the output price index for UK manufactured products rose by 0.5 per cent between November and December, and so was above the 0.3 per cent consensus forecast, economists were reassured that inflationary pressures were subdued because prices excluding food, drink, tobacco and petrol increased by only 0.1 per cent. However, according to Mr Brian Martin of Citibank, the market is beginning to wonder about the impact of sterling's strength on UK export prospects. He said recent CBI figures which showed export order books falling suggested that if the pound strengthened much more it would harm exports. He said he felt the government would try to stem the rise were the pound to reach the DM2.65 level. The D-Mark was generally softer in late European trading as investors took precautionary positions ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting. Many analysts do not expect the central bank to alter interest rates this week, but few doubt that monetary policy will be relaxed in the coming weeks. 'There is little enthusiasm for the D-Mark at the moment,' said one US trader in London. 'Although the odds seem stacked against a German rate cut this week, a prevailing air of gloom about the German economy makes it a risky play.' Mr Chris Turner, a currency strategist of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said he doubted that the Bundesbank would cut rates as it was sensitive to the recent rate of decline of the D-Mark. However, Citibank's Mr Martin said he did not feel that the D-Mark would decline much further as other European governments were relying on exports to stimulate economic recovery and would not want their currencies to strengthen too much against it. The resignation of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the chief Russian economic reformer, also weighed on the German currency because of Germany's relative proximity to Russia and in spite of Germany's limited economic links with the former Soviet Union. The rouble fell victim to Russia's deepening political crisis yesterday, tumbling 3.5 per cent in Moscow to a record low of 1,402 to the dollar on fears that economic reforms would grind to a halt. Dealers said the currency, which has already fallen 12 per cent this year, would continue its steep decline. Banks were alarmed by the weekend departure of Mr Gaidar, who refused to join the new government. Some Moscow based bankers forecast that the rouble was likely to fall to 1,500 to the dollar this month. The Australian dollar was a focus of attention in London as it breached a resistance level of 69.25 US cents. BZW's Mr Turner said this reflected the recent increase in commodity prices and a strong flow of funds into Australian equities. The Australian dollar closed yesterday at USDollars 0.6961, up from Friday's USDollars 0.6899. UK money markets were quiet yesterday. The initial shortage of Pounds 450m was revised upwards to Pounds 600m and the Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 615m of assistance. With much liquidity in the market, overnight rates touched 2 per cent at one stage before moving back up towards 5 1/2 per cent.  ------------------------------------------           Pound in New York  ------------------------------------------ Jan 14          Close       Prev. close  ------------------------------------------ Pounds spot    1.4935         1.4935 1 mth          1.4903         1.4905 3 mth          1.4853         1.4855 1 yr           1.4715         1.4700  ------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN       [Text]  <H5>  Auditors Report Critical of ESPRIT </H5>   The EC Court of Auditors has issued a report, highly  critical  of the European Union's information technology programme,  ESPRIT. The Luxembourg-based institution believes that the EU's  flagship research programme has problems with its managerial  approach, could be more innovative technologically and is too  closely wedded to the concept of pre-competitive research. The  report also points to a lack of speed and an insensitivity to  the needs of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).    Whilst recognising the contribution that ESPRIT has made to  the information technology industry in Europe, it feels that  some of the programme's internal procedures are inadequate and  that this must be highlighted.    The auditors' report is critical of the failure to fully  exploit ESPRIT's results, pointing out that this is what, in  essence, funds the programme. Attempts to redress this  fundamental flaw in ESPRIT III, by means of "targeted projects,"  do not go far enough, the report claims.    The EU's financial watchdogs are concerned about the lack of  continuity between the pre-competitive research level and the  point at which results are used. The Court points out that the  Commission is willing to devote significant resources to  market-led activities such as technology transfer, etc, when  they are clearly separate from research, but are unwilling to do  the same when it is a matter of extending a research activity to  a competitive level. The Court of Auditors firmly believes that  the pre-competitive issue has to be looked at to prevent it from  undermining the EU's research efforts.    The auditors also believe that further thought must be given  to the relationship between other aspects of policy, such as  competition and industrial policy and research, as well as  consideration of worldwide developments and the strategies of  Europe's industrial rivals.    Moreover, it is felt that SMEs should be better facilitated  within the ESPRIT programme. Procedures for contractors are  considered to be too slow and complex. Payment periods are also  said to be too slow. It is suggested too that the Commission  should look more closely at the selection of coordinators for  leading research consortia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda: Tutsi Official Denies </F> UNHCR Claims of Massacres"]    [Text] (ANSA) Bari, Italy, May 19 -- Reports by the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) of massacres and  tortures of Rwandan refugees by armed groups belonging to the  Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR) were denied and labeled "totally  unfounded" in a statement released by the Tutsi-led FPR here  Thursday [19 May].    The statement, in the form of a letter of protest to the  UNHCR chief, Sadako Ogata, demands an "immediate and public  retraction" of the reports, made two days ago by a UNHCR  official in Geneva.    The letter was signed by Jacques Bihozagara, deputy prime  minister of the Rwandan transition government, formed by an  agreement in Tanzania but which never took office because of the  outbreak of warfare between the Tutsi and the Hutu tribes.    "Not even our most severe critics," the FPR claims, "have  doubted the (our) commitment to the security and dignity of all  civilians in Rwanda." Bihozagara also called the UN agency's  allegations "irresponsible and incomprehensible."</p>

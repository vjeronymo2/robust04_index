			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Recyclable film with a lens Akira Fukano, a researcher at Fuji Photo Film, is displeased when people talk of the company's 'disposable' cameras. This is a misnomer, he says, since almost all of the camera is reused or recycled. The company insists the device be called a 'film with a lens', although when it was first marketed in 1986 the idea was to throw away the lens and shutter apparatus once the film was used. But in 1990, Fuji launched its recycling centre and today more than 70 per cent of the parts, including the lens, flash and shutter are tested and reused. Other components, such as the outer cardboard box and batteries, are sent to outside recycling companies. Fuji, which has been followed down the recycling path by other photo film companies, including Konica, Kodak, and Agfa, has about 80 per cent of the domestic disposable camera market. It invested Y1bn (Pounds 6.27m) in its first automated line in 1992 and another Y1bn in its fully automated system the following year. Earlier this year, it won an award from the ministry of international trade and industry for its environment-friendly system. Mr Fukano says the key to the high reusage ratio is product development. 'Recycling parts is fine, but it's better for the environment to reuse the component as it is,' he says. This has meant using quality parts, which can be used over and over again, and meticulous quality testing systems which pick out used components that are damaged. To enable easy dismantling by machines, the components, screwed together in the original version, are shaped to allow them to be simply fitted together. To limit the amounts of materials used in a product, miniaturisation has also been important. The company has reduced the camera weight by 20 per cent to 40g. But there are costs for recycling. Fukano admits that a recycled product is more expensive than a completely new one because of the initial development costs and the running costs for collection and storage of used cameras. Fuji, and the other photo film companies, are also facing competition from the large supermarkets selling their own-brand disposable cameras. A further problem is that the recycling process relies on the film processing labs to return used parts to the manufacturers. While this helps to create a link between consumer and processing lab, some labs, including those belonging to the large supermarkets, have used the parts from Fuji cameras, as well as their own, to produce new branded disposable cameras. After Fuji protests the retailers have agreed to stop, but some independent labs are still using used parts. For example, Nihon Jumbo, a fast growing film processing chain, reuses parts from leading manufacturers' products. The company says it has a right to recycle parts from used cameras and is not obliged to return them to the maker since the consumer has 'thrown them away'. Fuji says, however, that sales of recycled products by processing laboratories pose little threat to its market position.</p>

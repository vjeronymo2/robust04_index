			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Islamic party defiant at Algerian banning The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) yesterday described legal steps to ban it as ineffective and called on Algerians to mobilise to defeat the state of emergency decreed by the country's presidency, Reuter reports from Algiers. In its first statement since the Interior Ministry said it was taking legal steps to ban the party, the FIS said: 'The FIS is not an apparatus which can be destroyed in closing its headquarters and arresting its men, the FIS is the conscience rooted in the heart of the people.'

			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: Trade gap grows in Spain Spain's January-September accumulated trade deficit widened by 5.1 per cent to Pta1,860bn (Pounds 9.1bn) against the first nine months of 1993 despite a continuing strong performance by the export sector, which grew by 33 per cent over the period. The volume of imports and exports is expected to increase during the fourth quarter of the year, although year-on-year growth rates will be more moderate because trade already began to increase strongly in the final three months of 1993. The finance ministry said import growth showed that domestic demand was expanding at a higher rate than forecast. Tom Burns, Madrid Greece had a Dollars 23m (Pounds 14m) current account surplus in July, against a July 1993 surplus of Dollars 1.152bn. The January-July current account deficit was Dollars 1.071bn, sharply off a Dollars 205m surplus in the same seven-month 1993 period. Austrian unemployment in October was steady from September at 4.4 per cent of the workforce, but was up from 4.2 per cent in October last year.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal in 11% advance BANK of Montreal recorded an 18 per cent gain in net profit for the first quarter ended January 31 and an 11 per cent rise in total assets due to strong mortgage and commercial loan business, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The bank, the first of Canada's Big Six to report for the first quarter, said earnings advanced to CDollars 164m (USDollars 138m), or CDollars 1.23 a share, against Dollars 138.5m, or Dollars 1.10, a year earlier. The figures also benefited from higher contributions from Harris Bankcorp, the US subsidiary, and Nesbitt Thomson, its securities subsidiary. The fiscal 1991 period, however, was dragged down by a loss in the Brazilian subsidiary, which is now accounted for on a cost basis. Return on common equity was 15.1 per cent, up from 14.5 per cent a year earlier. Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's fourth largest chartered bank, managed a 24 per cent gain in first-quarter profit to CDollars 174.2m or 76 cents a share, from CDollars 140m, or 63 cents, a year earlier. The results were in line with analysts' forecasts that BNS would show a big improvement in the January 31 quarter, with better margins stemming from declining Canadian interest rates. Return on equity was 16.5 per cent against 14.9 per cent, return on average assets 0.77 per cent against 0.62 per cent, and non-interest expense rose 10 per cent due to aggressive efforts to improve service and efficiency.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq resumed direct peace talks, but they  appeared no closer to a permanent truce than when negotiations began eight  months ago. Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz, leaving after 2 1/2 hours of  talks in Geneva with his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, said the  meeting brought only a reiteration of clashing positions. Progress continues to  be stalled over Iran's demand for a full withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Iran  and Iraq's insistence on early dredging of the Shatt al Arab waterway, its only  outlet to the sea. The talks were chaired by U.N. Secretary General Javier  Perez de Cuellar. Another session is planned for today.  </P></p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Schering's earnings climb 6% SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, increased earnings in 1991 by more than 6 per cent to DM274m (Dollars 182.6m). Sales increased by 10 per cent to DM6.3bn. The sales gains were largely due to strong pharmaceuticals, with sales up 15 per cent. Diagnostic aids and oral contraceptives continued to be the mainstays. Schering's diagnostics sector accounted for 40 per cent of the pharmaceuticals business. An 8 per cent rise in agrichemicals was well above the sector's average, Schering said.</p>

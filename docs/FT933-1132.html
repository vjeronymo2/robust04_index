			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Lloyd's upbeat on corporate capital PROPOSALS for the introduction of corporate capital to the Lloyd's of London insurance market have already generated sufficient interest from potential sponsors to meet the market's demands for the coming year, it emerged yesterday. Lloyd's said it was aware that at least 12 groups were considering underwriting in the market in 1994. The total value of the capital on offer if all these proposals were to be implemented is about Pounds 1bn. That compares with Lloyd's calculations of the potential for corporate capital of between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn for next year, which would allow for an underwriting capacity of twice that level. The assumptions are based on total estimated underwriting on the market of Pounds 7.5bn in 1994, compared with Pounds 8.8bn this year. Corporate capital would be able to benefit from the rules of limited liability suggested for the first time under the Lloyd's business plan. Most of the proposals have been in the form of investment trusts. It contrasts with the unlimited liability to which Names - individuals whose assets underwrite the market - are subject. 'We are pleasantly surprised with the level of interest,' Lloyd's said yesterday. 'Now we've got to see whether they will put their money where their mouth is.' Further details of interested groups are expected next week. But none is likely to request formal approval from Lloyd's until after the corporate capital proposals have been approved by Names. Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, wrote to all Names earlier this week seeking their support for the proposals at an extraordinary general meeting on October 20. Many Names - particularly those who have had to cease underwriting because they have become insolvent - are concerned about the implications of corporate capital. But a letter sent out yesterday by Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Names, the biggest Names' group, urges members not to assign proxies to the chairmen of the action groups involved in litigation against the insurance market, who are likely to vote against. It calls on Names to make up their own minds and says it will provide further recommendations based on independent advice before the meeting.</p>

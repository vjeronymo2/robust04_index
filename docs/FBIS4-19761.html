			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" from Athens--ellipses as published] </F>   [Excerpts] Crete will play an important role in the  rearrangement of the armed forces of Greece and Cyprus.    Consequently, Crete is the focus of studies and plans by the  Greek National Defense General Staff and the National Guard  General Staff regarding the doctrine of a unified defense space  of the two countries.    Revelations by President Glavkos Kliridhis to an expatriate  gathering in London concerning the unified defense area have  raised questions in foreign military circles.    I MAKHI today reveals the implementation of Cyprus' "Defense  Shield" (that is, what is allowed...to be revealed), as well as  a statement by a high-ranking military source regarding the role  of the Greek and Cypriot armed forces in the unified defense  area.    The decision by the Athens and Nicosia Governments that  includes Cyprus in Greece's unified defense area is to begin  implementation as soon as possible and to the extent dictated by  Cyprus' special defense needs.    As military circles in the [Greek] Pentagon revealed to I  MAKHI, the decisions made during President Kliridhis' visit to  Athens and during Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos  Arsenis' visit to Nicosia are promoted methodically and quickly.  [passage omitted]    Characteristically, a top-ranking military source told I  MAKHI: "Effectively, a defense umbrella will cover Cyprus. The  success of the defense doctrine will be based on unified  Hellenism, something that means--and it is very clear to the  Greek National Defense Ministry--that an offensive action by the  Turks provides the legal base for our country (Greece) to attack  Turkey from any point, not just from the front that Turkey will  open...."    Greece will assume Cyprus' air cover by making the most  modern equipment available to the Greek Air Force. Crete, which  is at the center of the new defense doctrine's plans, will play  a significant role in the air coverage.    Crete is considered very important for Cyprus (its air  cover), because of its position but mainly because Cyprus is  impregnable and can defend itself against any offensive action  against it.    Greece will cover Cyprus' sea areas with the most modern  naval ships.    Cyprus is determined to contribute decisively to the  implementation of the plan for a common defense space with  Greece. More important is that "the Cypriot Government made the  commitment to participate financially in the armament program."    Cyprus will prepare refueling bases for the Greek military  planes as well as a naval base at a specific area that has been  chosen and is considered ideal for this purpose. [passage  omitted]    These "war preparations" are not offensive. They are  defensive and this has been made clear in every direction,  especially to NATO, which is concerned....    In this way, the fronts the Turkish expansionist army must  face will increase.    The possibilities of a Turkish offensive decrease and at the  same time Turkey is under pressure to revise its intransigence  on both the Aegean and Cyprus.    The goal of every study and plan regarding the unified  defense space is to establish Hellenism firmly and increase the  negotiating capability of Greece and Cyprus.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- Yi In-mo, the incarnation  of faith and will, met chairmen of Primary Organisations of the  General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, basic organisations  of the federation, from different parts of the country.    He recalled with indignation that he was put to all tortures  and maltreatment by South Korean fascist hangmen while spending  34 years in prison after being taken prisoner by the enemy  during the fatherland liberation war. "It is because I fought,  regarding the great general as my mental support that I could  win defending my revolutionary constancy, refusing to recant my  belief in this period," he stressed.    Saying the destiny of the Korean people and the future of  the  socialist homeland lie in trusting and following the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il, he asked the chairmen to do their bit in rearing trade  union members as loyal subjects with a strong faith.</p>

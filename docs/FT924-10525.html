			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / General Motors - The Embattled Giant: Smale poised to head new line-up 'SOMEONE once defined General Motors as a 'mid-western car company', an image that strikes at the heart of the parochialism that has plagued the company since at least the late 1950s.' So wrote Wall Street analyst Maryann Keller in a perceptive 1989 book on GM's woes. The company is so vast, and its insular, bureaucratic culture so entrenched, that some analysts question whether any executives from within can achieve radical change. On the other hand, fresh talent from outside would spend precious time groping to understand the complexity of the beast. The new management line-up expected to be announced after Monday's board meeting goes some way to resolving this dilemma: the two men most likely to occupy the top jobs have long experience of GM, yet each is, in his own way, an outsider. Mr John Smale, 65, the non-executive director who has led GM's boardroom revolt, is expected to become chairman, at least on an interim basis. A 10-year veteran of the GM board, Mr Smale was chairman in the 1980s of Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products group, which he was credited with shaking up. A tough, no-nonsense executive, he led P &amp; G on an acquisitions drive, pushed it into international markets and restructured its systems. One of his greatest strengths - something GM has lacked - is marketing flair. Potential weaknesses include a low-key style when the GM chairman needs to be proclaiming revolution. Mr Jack Smith, 54, currently GM president, is expected to be named chief executive. An unassuming man, he has a reputation for decisiveness and delegation. He made his name in Europe in the 1980s when he turned around GM's loss-making operations there. Much of what he learnt there is being applied to the US, including setting up his own tiny headquarters staff away from the GM bureaucracy in central Detroit. Another executive who may emerge in a more powerful role from any reshuffle is Mr William Hoglund, 58, who was moved up to the post of chief financial officer in April's boardroom coup. Popular with middle managers, he has been trying to break up the centralised financial staff and spread its members to operating divisions. He has a reputation as a maverick and said this year that motor industry executives should be as creative as rock-and-roll musicians.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmytro Lykhovoy: "The Dried-Up Channels Will Be </F> Filled With Water, Won't They?"]    [Text] Not so long ago we celebrated the opening of  the clearing house at the NBU [National Bank of Ukraine], after  which the directors of the NBU stated (as they continue to state  nowadays) that the Ukrainian system of making electronic  payments is deserving of important attention and that it has no  peers among other similar systems. After a short time, however,  it started to snow, and here and there the negative aspects of  the electronic transfer system began to be noticed. Therefore,  in order to shed some light on interbank electronic accounting  and accounting in general, let's profit from the commentary on  this matter by the NBU's deputy chairman of the board, Oleksandr  Kyreyev.    The Ukrainian system of electronic payments comprises a  system of channels which need to be filled with water--that is  to say, with money--in order for movement to be observed there.  Money is not lacking--and the channels have dried up. How is  money to be made? As of now, the conditions are not favorable  for economic entities to trade: The longer that items can be  kept in storage warehouses, the more favorable it will be to  sell. Other factors ruining the payment system include an  essential barrier in accounting operations between  enterprises--payment in kind (this occurs particularly in rural  areas and may be seen when you drive through Ukraine: Bila  Tserkva is surrounded by tires, Novomoskovsk--by pans, the  Vinnytsa and Cherkassk regions--by sacks of sugar, which people  have received in lieu of payment and which they want to sell).  And until monetary operations have been normalized at the  enterprise level, until we succeed in raising money for unsold  products, and until we turn around the postponed "grain"  credits, there can be no talk of the normal operation of a  system of electronic payments. The disease of "dried-up  channels" cannot be overcome by purely banking measures.    The National Bank was hardly able to stand up under the  storm  of criticism that was evoked by the prohibition of a debit  balance. But: in the first ten days of February five banks went  bankrupt (Blagobank, Ekomedbank, Universalbank, Niva, and  Olevskyy); at present there is another bank which is on the  brink of closing down. Information about the above-mentioned  bankruptcies spread at the speed of sound, and many banks having  free access to the debit wire began to throw their own debts  onto the bankrupt banks. The latter, thereby, closed down with  very large debts. On one occasion we managed to trace the path  taken by a certain sum of money: In the space of a single day  this money turned up in five different banks and was shifted  across two oblasts. And so, taking into consideration the fact  that electronic payments are extremely fast, the NBU decreed the  following: A commercial bank must first recognize a demand made  by another commercial ban, and then pay whatever is necessary.  Other payments must be put on hold.    At present the commercial banks are complaining particularly  about correspondence-type accounts introduced by the National  Bank. They say that they cannot conduct accounts this way. But  we have already been living for a long time under the conditions  of a nonmonolithic banking system. Indeed, five or six years ago  there was in effect a system of interbranch turnover or  circulation whereby money was only calculated on the accounts of  the enterprises involved, but the actual payment would take  place in the bank accounts themselves. Nowadays, when numerous  commercial banks have begun to handle their own accounts and  clear their own money, the National Bank--as the sole  currency-emission center--is insisting that the commercial banks  pay for its account, for the state's account, as--in the final  analysis the taxpayer. Why can commercial banks carry out  currency emissions in their own names when they do not agree  upon the volume of such emissions? And if a commercial bank  complains that a debit or negative balance does not allow it to  make payments or pay from clearing accounts, that means that  such a bank is finished as a bank: The money received from  customers has gone into credits, and the customer-depositors  cannot conduct transactions or even obtain ready cash. That is  to say, if a bank is capable of performing only the third of its  three basic functions (servicing cash-type savings accounts,  clearing services, and handling credits), can it be called a  complete bank? Or is it not a bank at all? There are quite  enough such institutions among our banks.    However, many bankers have justifications for their  behavior.  To be sure, how can they support the liquidation of they own  banks if--during the hectic period of this year--they have  approved credits to the state, and the latter was subsequently  unable to settle their accounts? The problem of paying back the  credits could bring about the next banking crisis inasmuch as  the "grain" and "sugar" money already deposited at the new  prices for these goods to be purchased by the rural areas has  not yet been paid back. No matter what measures may be taken  within the framework of the new payments system--Oleksandr  Kyreyev emphasizes--they will not yield a positive result  without a complex of state actions regarding the stabilization  of the economy.    According to Mr. Kyreyev, the National Bank has not rescued  any type of account; it has merely designated certain  technological changes. All types of accounts are operative. But  of those that we have happily mastered, the most effective forms  of handing accounts are the systems of payment deliveries via  electronic mail (which includes checks, letters of credit, and  everything else), and the most handy and recommended form of  handling accounts at present is payment delivery.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: Japanese passion and commitment - Max Loppert attends a remarkable music festival at the foot of the Japanese Alps A TRULY festive music festival offers a special, unrepeatable combination of place and artistic purpose. The 'Saito Kinen Festival Matsumoto' is founded on one of the world's most remarkable orchestral enterprises, the Saito Kinen Orchestra of Japan, and located in a provincial city nestling in beautiful countryside at the foot of the Japanese alps. The orchestra is remarkable for the quality of its ensemble and character of its players, who come together only occasionally from around the globe in homage to a visionary Japanese musician who schooled most of them in western music. Hideo Saito (1902-74), a cellist and conductor trained in Germany, was largely responsible for the post-war flourishing of music in Tokyo. In 1948 he founded there the small Music School for Children; 13 years later, after many struggles, this was expanded into the city's now-celebrated Toho Gakuen music school. An extraordinarily rich crop of fine musicians has been germinated by this institution - Ozawa, Japan's international conductor superstar, was one of the initial intake. The orchestra gathers its former Toho Gakuen students - at some cost to themselves - from European or North American symphony orchestras or from the ranks of internationally established soloists (such as the viola player Nobuko Imai). The former pupils first performed together in Tokyo, under Ozawa and the conductor Kazuyoshi Akiyama (co-director of the orchestra), in their master's memory in 1984. (Saito Kinen translates as 'memorial to Saito'.) The success of that memorial concert sowed a seed. Tours abroad were mooted, and then brought about. London audiences will not easily forget the three Saito Kinen visits here (Barbican 1987, Proms 1990, South Bank Japan Festival 1991). Two years ago Philips started to record the orchestra; and last year the Saito Kinen Festival was launched with Ozawa as artistic director. According to report, the entire 1992 ticket allocation was gone within an hour of first being offered for sale; this year's box office returns told a similar story. The 1993 festival programme included chamber music (this year a marvellous Juilliard Quartet concert of Haydn, Janacek and - with Nobuko Imai - the Mozart G minor Quintet) and other imaginative programmes (notably a confrontation of western 19th-century melodrama - poetic recitation with piano - and Japanese traditions of speech-and-music). But its core, inevitably, was the three Saito Kinen orchestral concerts and the two concert-hall staged performances of Honegger's Joan of Arc at the Stake, in which the orchestra was joined by an international cast. (Last year the staging had been of Stravinsky's Oedipus rex, with Philip Langridge, Jessye Norman and Bryn Terfel.) All three concerts - I attended the latter two - had the Beethoven Seventh as second half; Schoenberg's Verklarte Nacht in its string-orchestra arrangement formed the first half of the first and last, the Schubert Unfinished Symphony that of the middle. The final-afternoon account of the Schoenberg produced some of the most astonishingly pure, radiant, fine-grained string-playing I have ever heard. One expects well-trained Japanese string players to work together precisely in ensemble; but here the unanimity, controlled intensity and tonal lustre of the Saito Kinen strings created the illusion that the work was being returned, in some flawless enlargement, to its original (and preferable) sextet form. This was a festival experience to set alongside the most memorable of a lifetime. Ozawa, whose restless high-octane musical intelligence enables him to master difficult late-Romantic and 20th-century scores with consummate skill, has in the past shown himself an unidiomatic conductor of the great classical symphonies. At first this seemed still true of his Schubert and Beethoven: the muscle-power of the strings seemed used only for athletic display, not invigorating argument. (Philips were recording the performances live, which may have added to the tension.) But on the final afternoon, with the recording apparatus now removed, the Beethoven danced and sang with a new and often exquisitely good-humoured lightness of touch. The Honegger Joan of Arc, a 1930s 'dramatic oratorio' on a text by Paul Claudel, was termed a 'vast popular fresco' by its composer. When Ozawa's DG recording, made with Paris forces, was issued two years ago, I was particularly troubled by its queasy blending of fulsome mysticism, banal folksiness and arch infusions of jazz. But this boldly simple staging by the Paris actor-director Georges Wilson (who also played Brother Dominic, as he does on the records) made all the elements click into the right dramatic place. Marthe Keller, the Swiss actress, was an involving, personable Joan lacking only a certain French grandeur in her command of rhetoric. The stirring brilliance and flashing rhythmic articulation of Ozawa and his orchestra were equalled by a magnificent large combined choir from Tokyo, who in tonal firmness and eloquence easily surpassed their Radio France opposite numbers on the DG recording. To hear Japanese choral singers' impeccable delivery of the French text provided a noble token of all the passion and commitment that had gone into the performance - and, indeed, into the Saito Kinen Festival as a whole.</p>

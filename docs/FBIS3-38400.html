The multipurpose  plants they exported were not especially constructed for the  production of chemical weapons, it was stated. In its opinion,  the court referred to unfit penal provisions. The proceedings  led to the "bitter finding" that the FRG had made the export of  weapons-grade chemical plants possible for 30 years. Four other  employees of the firm will be sentenced today. With three  managers of the former firm WET in Hamburg, one of the acquitted  persons still has to answer for the export of an alleged bomb  production line.</p>

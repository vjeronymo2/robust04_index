			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUZZLE PRAISE  </P> <P> This is a long overdue expression of appreciation for your Puzzler page and  those wonderful puzzlers, Barry Tunick and Sylvia Bursztyn.  </P> <P> Their feel for language, their clever humor, their avoidance of a dull,  lumbering vocabulary of crossword-dictionary words and the precision of their  definitions are superb.  </P> <P> During a period of exile deep in the heart of a large Southwestern city, which  shall be nameless (I believe it was named after a long-running TV series), I  was unable to find puzzles even approaching the caliber of T &amp; B's little  gems, just one more reason for falling prostrate and kissing the ground on my  return to Los Angeles Times country.  </P> <P> Please don't ever let them go.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH WILSON  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

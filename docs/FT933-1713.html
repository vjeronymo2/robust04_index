			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC to cut 'inefficient' school milk subsidy EUROPEAN COMMUNITY agriculture ministers yesterday decided to cut back from next year an expensive subsidy on school milk for 31m schol children across the community. The controversy, which looked set to surround the decision has been offset by limiting the cut to half what the European Commission had originally planned, and by a belated attempt by Brussels to explain the bizarre economics of the subsidy. Last year, the EC paid out Ecu232m (Pounds 180m) on the subsidy, according to figures from the commission, which originally proposed to cut outlays back to Ecu109m by next year - a reduction that British and German officials said would jeopardise the scheme. Officials now say that yesterday's decision means the cut will be significantly less, to Ecu176m. Across the EC, 143,000 schools get the subsidy for 31m children; in the UK, 31,000 schools with some 8m children receive it, in France 10m, and in Germany over 6m. The subsidy was originally financed through the revenue from penalties levied on milk producers for exceeding the production quotas fixed by the EC. These levies were abolished in last year's reform of the common agricultural policy, under which Ecu4.4bn was spent on the dairy sector in 1992. But with the CAP budget now strained to its near Ecu36bn limit, the commission and the EC are casting around for cuts, especially as bills mount to buy off producer interests unhappy with the production, export and price cuts required by the CAP reform and as part of the Uruguay Round trade negotiations. But Commission officials said yesterday that the way the subsidy is distributed was of little benefit to school children. In Belgium, for instance, the subsidy is worth BFr16.3 (31p) a litre - or 125 per cent of the normal EC target price for milk - of which the farmer gets BFr12. But the school child, the commission says, pays an average of BFr34 a litre, higher than the average supermarket price of BFr30. This is allegedly because of higher distribution and packaging costs; each litre, for example, requires four quarter litre packages rather than one. 'The profit is for the distributor and packager,' one commission official said, adding that 'it is up to the industry to take responsibility for that sort of thing, not us.' 'It is the most expensive and inefficient system we have for encouraging the consumption of milk,' he said, a view endorsed by member state agriculture officials in Brussels. This is a high ranking in comparison with other milk schemes the EC runs, which are also likely to come into the spotlight as a result of the school milk controversy. The 'calf milk replacement' scheme - whereby milk from the cow's udder enters the calf's mouth only after first having been turned into powder, then protein enriched, and then turned back into milk - costs about Ecu1.5bn a year, according to one official.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (9): Heavy demand for shares - Stock markets / Two exchanges, in Shenzhen and Shanghai, have been permitted to operate while a third, in Haikou, was shut down because it failed to gain official permission to open The development of a system of stock exchanges has been hampered by ideological disputes and regulatory and administrative problems. In spite of intense pressure from Chinese cities and provinces for the central government to allow the opening of more stock markets, so far only two exchanges, in Shenzhen, bordering Hong Kong, and in Shanghai, have been permitted to operate. A third one in Haikou, capital of Hainan province, was shut down after opening without official permission. The government is adopting a cautious approach, but may authorise two more exchanges in the north. 'The stock exchanges will continue to expand and be a tremendous source of funds for Chinese enterprises,' said a US lawyer involved in the securities business. 'But it's going to be fraught with potential complications unless the fundamental problems - structure of the system, the regulatory network, and disclosure - are dealt with.' With economic reformers in the ascendancy, China's enthusiasm to set up stock exchanges is understandable. Enterprises are driven by the desire to tap into the large private savings deposits of ordinary Chinese, estimated to be worth about Yn900bn. This is in addition to several hundred billion yuan in cash 'under the pillow' and in bonds and certificates of deposits. With many state enterprises operating in the red, obtaining access to this enormous pool of deposits was the rationale for opening the prosperous markets in Shenzhen and Shanghai. Demand has been so acute that some issues in both cities were initially offered by lottery, with Chinese buyers having only a small possibility of getting any shares at all and unable to select the shares of the companies they wanted. In the ensuing mayhem, the authorities have cracked down on gangster violence surrounding places in queues outside brokers' offices, and a Shanghai investor committed suicide over a relatively small loss. Intense demand has driven up share prices, in some cases to unrealistic levels, and is not a reflection of improving company performance. The stock of Shanghai-based Yu Yuan Department Store, which has a reputation as well managed, jumped from Yn494.3 (Dollars 91.53) in 1990 to Yn5,037.4 (Dollars 932.85) in late April this year. To help shift the burden of financial support Beijing gives to state enterprises, the government is planning to allow companies located elsewhere in China to apply for listings. When the markets were opened to foreign participation, foreigners snapped up all the shares they were eligible to purchase. Several investment funds are being launched to invest in Chinese shares. In spite of the enthusiasm, the markets are still small. In Shenzhen, 15 companies have floated A shares, available only to Chinese citizens. Of that figure, six have issued B shares, which can only be purchased by foreigners in dollars and are denominated in renminbi. In Shanghai, 14 companies have listings, only one of which has floated B shares. The Shanghai bourse tends to be the more tightly controlled, because its employees were formerly bankers with the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank which acts as the markets' regulatory authority. However, prices doubled in a single day in May when limits on daily price movements were lifted, and then fell as the authorities sought to bar investment syndicates from ramping shares. Nine other cities, including Tianjin, Dalian, and Shenyang in the north are all vying to open stock exchanges, but the central government is thought unlikely to approve a third until Shenzhen and Shanghai acquire more experience. In spite of the wave of enthusiasm, further progress is being hampered by a fundamental ideological question - how to have such quintessentially capitalist institutions as stock markets in a socialist country with many state-owned companies. The Chinese are deadlocked over the question of ownership in state-owned enterprises. When companies issue shares to the public, under current regulations, their worth cannot exceed 50 per cent of the value of the enterprises' assets, according to Chinese sources. As the shareholding changes, it becomes more difficult to define the nature of a company, which is then partly owned by the state and partly by the public. 'Eventually, shares might be owned by state-owned companies, collectives, and individuals,' a Chinese analyst said. 'This possibility has given rise to great concern by central authorities who are afraid of losing control of enterprises and some state assets.' However, after Deng Xiaoping's visit to southern China this winter, the analyst said rules on ownership were relaxed slightly and that enterprises in non-priority sectors were allowed to sell more of their shares to the public. Another problem hindering the development of China's stock markets is the lack of a strong regulatory agency. Although the People's Bank regulates the securities business in China, Chinese and foreign critics said it did the job inadequately. 'The People's Bank has too strong a self interest,' a Chinese legal expert said. 'They don't want a securities market - they are worried it would siphon funds away from the banks.' The government appears to be more concerned with formulating regulations, but the many layers of bureaucracy cannot agree about a Chinese version of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, the different agencies - the People's Bank, the Ministry of Finance, the State-Owned Assets Bureau, State Economic Reform Commission, and the Stock Exchange Executive Council - are competing for control of an independent authority if set up. The lack of a company law describing how to create, operate and dissolve a company, no unified accounting principles, no strong disclosure system, and no detailed requirements for evaluating a company's assets mean the infant markets will have a series of crises during their development. Analysts have expressed concern about the lack of insider trading regulations and potential conflicts of interest. Lawyers said the People's Bank wanted to control and regulate the securities market, but also wanted to profit from it by trading in it. 'If the government acts prudently, within the next few years, things will get better and it will set up a regulatory scheme, the necessary laws and regulations, and an enforcement team,' said a Chinese observer. 'Otherwise, stock markets will go rampant, people will get hurt and the government will be forced to close them, and they will be dormant or half-dead,' he predicted.</p>

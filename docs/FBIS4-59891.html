			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 18 May (MENA)--Al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim,  Palestinian ambassador in Jordan and member of Fatah's Central  Committee, stated that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will complete  the formation of the Palestinian National Authority's council  following the 'Id al-Adha holidays [21-24 May].    In exclusive remarks to MENA correspondent in Tunis,  'Abd-al-Rahim noted that the council will hold its first meeting  in Cairo following the 'Id al-Adha to distribute the portfolios  and responsibilities among its members. After that, all the  council members will return to the homeland following the  withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho.  'Abd-al-Rahim said that during its meeting in Tunis last night  the Fatah Movement's Revolutionary Council decided to form  several committees to work out a plan for the Fatah cadres to  return to the homeland with specific assignments and  instructions. Under this plan, each cadre could work in his  area of specialization within the National Authority's  institutions.    'Abd-al-Rahim added that the Fatah Movement's Revolutionary  Council stressed the need for the movement to actively and  effectively participate in the Palestinian National Authority to  strengthen the Palestinian newborn authority. The Revolutionary  Council, he added, backed the Central Committee's decision on  the need for Fatah's effective participation in the National  Authority's council and institutions in a way that reflects the  movement's magnitude and role in the Palestinian struggle and to  guarantee success for these institutions. 'Abd-al-Rahim added  that this will ensure that the beginning in Gaza and Jericho  will be the first step toward the liberation of the homeland and  the restoration of the Palestinian people's national rights. He  noted that the Revolutionary Council also made a decision  securing the return of most of the movement's cadres to Gaza and  Jericho so they could assume their responsibility and  consolidate the newborn authority, which is the fruit of many  long years of struggle by Fatah.    Concerning the reasons for the delay in signing the  executive  program of the Palestinian-Jordanian economic agreement,  'Abd-al-Rahim said it was due to two points related to banking  coordination and supervision in the self-rule area. He pointed  out that in light of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and the  gains made by the Palestinians under the agreement, sound  operational mechanisms had to be found to put the  Palestinian-Jordanian agreement into effect and establish  excellent ties between the two sides as well as between the  Palestinians and other Arab countries.</p>

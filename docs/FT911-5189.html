			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Management: In brief .. A training programme designed to develop entrepreneurs in eastern Europe is being carried out by Andersen Consulting, a business consultancy. The programme, part of a United Nations initiative, aims to select, train and support entrepreneurial businessmen in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Contact Mark Aston, Andersen Consulting, 2 Arundel Street, London WC2R 3LT. Tel 071-438 3824. A leaflet* intended to help small business owners counter the impact of changes in the Statutory Sick Pay legislation has been produced by the National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses. The changes, which came into effect on April 6, reduced the employer's sick pay rebate from 100 to 80 per cent. The guide, called Employers - do you know the true cost?, suggests that companies which have no fixed agreement to top up sick pay and where no precedent has been set should substitute a cash amount for a period of weeks when devising new sick pay schemes. This would set a limit on payments if in the future the government decides to make further changes to the rules. Employers should also consider a closer medical screening of new employees, it urges. The guide includes a model draft letter to employees explaining the recent changes. *Available from NFSE, 140 Lower Marsh, Westminster Bridge, London SE1 7AE. Tel 071 928 9272. 2 pages. Free.</p>

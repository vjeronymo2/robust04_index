Armed clashes run  counter to regional stability and economic development as well,  he added.    Qian expressed his satisfaction over the smooth development  of bilateral relations since China and cameroon established  diplomatic ties, saying that the visit to China by President  Biya last year further strengthened such relations, and that the  Chinese Government is willing to work with the Cameroon  Government to promote such ties in a wider range.    Abanda said that Cameroon and China enjoy good relations,  hoping that such relations will be further enhanced.    During the meeting, Qian asked Abanda to convey greetings  from Chinese President Jiang Zemin to President Biya. Abanda  asked Qian to convey a letter from President Biya to President  Jiang.    Yesterday, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei held  working talks with Abanda, who arrived here on April 2.</p>

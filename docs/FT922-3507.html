			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Electrocomponents declines to Pounds 49.9m SHARES IN Electrocomponents rose 17p to 284p after the distributor of electronic, mechanical and electrical components reported a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 55.2m to Pounds 49.9m in the year to March 31. Mr Robert Lawson, chief executive since April 1991, ascribed the share price rise to three factors: increased operating profits from the core RS Components business; 'demonstrable' cash management across the group, which has cut gearing from 28 per cent to nil; and a higher-than-expected final dividend of 5.1p (4.8p) for a total of 7p (6.6p). RS, which in November added mechanical products and tools to its electronic and electrical products catalogue business, achieved a Pounds 400,000 rise in operating profits to Pounds 56.9m on sales 9.6 per cent ahead at Pounds 275.2m. Mr Lawson said this was in spite of the recessionary conditions in a 'difficult year', the payment of rates for 10 months as a result of the termination of the Corby Enterprise Zone, and the Pounds 3m budgeted start-up losses from the fledgling RS Germany. RS's 'encouraging performance' was offset by an operating decline from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 600,000 at Pact International, which distributes components to the retail market. Misco Group, the computer supplies catalogue business, also had 'an extremely difficult year', said Sir Keith Bright, chairman. It tumbled to operating losses of Pounds 3m (profits Pounds 2m) on sales down at Pounds 71.7m (Pounds 74.2m). Group turnover fell 5 per cent to Pounds 395.1m and there were exceptional costs of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 600,000). Below the line there were extraordinary charges of Pounds 31m (Pounds 27.6m) - Pounds 24.4m of this relates to the restructure of Misco and the balance to the sale of Mesa Distribution of the US. Earnings were 15.3p (17.4p) per share. COMMENT Having realised the recovery would not be short and sharp, the slow, steady progress at RS is increasingly valued. And the new management's clear strategy to refocus the group, cut out peripherals, and expand beneath the umbrella of RS's solid distribution network is welcomed. A one-concept, rather than a one-business, company is not a worry as catalogue-selling has proven to be sturdy enough through the recession. Adding part two (mechanical products and tools) to the catalogue has been well received and goes to show that the same concept could be applicable across different technologies. Finally the success of RS's overseas expansion bodes well for the future, though it may be next year before the benefits are apparent. Full-year pre-tax estimates were upgraded from Pounds 54m-Pounds 57m to Pounds 56m-Pounds 60m, giving a prospective multiple of about 17, which seems reasonable.</p>

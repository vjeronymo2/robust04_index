			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- The government convened  an emergency meeting Friday to discuss preventing a nationwide  strike by railroad and subway workers.    Vice ministers of the Labor and Transportation Ministries  and  the Economic Planning Board decided to announce government  measures to provide better working conditions, under which  locomotive engineers and ticket inspectors would receive similar  treatment as general clerical workers at the Korean National  Railroad.    The government, however, made clear it would not negotiate  with "Chonkihyop," [The National Council of Locomotive  Engineers] a nationwide organization of locomotive and train  engineers, as it is an unauthorized body separate from the  Railroad Labor Union.    At the same time, the government decided to take strong  action, including the prosecution of those involved, if the  workers go ahead with the strike despite measures to improve  labor conditions such as a wage hike.    Chonkihyop members have sided with the labor unions of the  Seoul and Pusan subways in resolving to walk out.    Earlier, the Labor Ministry warned in a statement the  government would not tolerate a joint strike by railroad and  subway workers as it would foster social unrest.    Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui said Friday the government has  completed preparations for judicial action against leaders of  Chonkihyop and Chonodae [National Conference of Representatives  of the Workers' Cooperatives], a private organization of labor  union representatives nationwide.    Minister Nam stressed the two organizations are voluntary  and  private organizations which are not recognized legally, saying  their resolution on a walk-out is an apparent violation of the  law. He said the government is preparing a wage increase and  better labor conditions for locomotive engineers and railroad  workers through negotiations with the authorized labor union of  the Korean National Railroad.</p>

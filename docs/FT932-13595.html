			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Parmalat exercises its appetite for acquisition - How an Italian dairy products company is expanding PARMALAT, the dairy products group burdened by heavy debts and troublesome diversification in the 1980s, could become Italy's biggest listed foods concern of the 1990s. No Italian foods operation offers the same ingredients. Barilla, the big pasta and biscuits maker, is privately-owned; SME, the state-controlled foods, caterer and retailer, is being dismembered; Eridania, the Ferruzzi-controlled sugar group, has been merged with Ferruzzi's Paris-based Beghin Say; while Buitoni is owned by Nestle of Switzerland. Swelled by acquisitions, group sales surged 23 per cent to L1,636bn (Dollars 1.07bn) last year and should reach about L2,800bn in 1993. Net profits for Parmalat Finanziaria, the listed holding company, rose by almost 24 per cent to L52bn and are forecast to rise again. The results complete a remarkable recovery. Three years ago, Parmalat seemed in danger of foundering under excessive borrowing, the effects of costly diversification into television by the controlling Tanzi family and the after-effects of an aborted takeover by Kraft Foods of the US. However, enough banks were willing to gamble on a restructuring. After a complex transaction, debt was reduced by a substantial cash injection, the Tanzi's shareholding in Parmalat declined, and a number of merchant banks, notably Milan-based Akros, became more closely involved with the management of the company. Since then, Parmalat, run by Mr Domenico Barili, director-general, has not looked back. Growth in Italy has come through buying regional diaries to build up market share. This month, it took control of Giglio, the biggest dairy group in the Emilia Romagna region. The deal will raise Parmalat's big share of the Italian long-life milk market above 34 per cent, from 30 per cent. Giglio is the largest of a string of dairy industry purchases Parmalat is targeting this year. Its list includes a number of municipally-owned milk companies. Bovisio, a small town near Milan, is already in the bag and the group is in talks for others in Verona and Brindisi. Parmalat would like more. The milk business is municipally-owned in 10 of the biggest cities, and a number are due to be privatised. Last year, Parmalat purchased businesses in Genova and Como, the two main privatisations so far. Parmalat is also is also interested in the privatisation of the big SME foods group, which has put its Cirio, Bertolli, De Rica subsidiaries up for sale. Despite the opportunities in Italy, most of Parmalat's growth will come from abroad. Sales in Europe, excluding Italy, jumped by 164 per cent to L66bn last year. In South America - mainly Brazil and Argentina - turnover climbed almost 29 per cent to L260bn, while US sales reached L13bn. Turnover in Latin America should double due partly to the purchase of Lacesa, a dairy products group in southern Brazil, and its associated Sodilac company, which have sales of about Dollars 80m. Together, the 10 planned takeovers in the region should push up Parmalat's Latin America revenues to about L650bn from L260bn last year. The US marks Parmalat's latest attempt at expansion. This year, it has already bought an Atlanta diary, with sales of about L100bn. Mr Tanzi believes the US, Latin America and eastern Europe are the main areas for expansion. Is Parmalat over-extending itself? 'It is a risk', admits Mr Tanzi. Though its acquisitions are often accompanied by tough restructuring, he hopes the best staff in the companies acquired can be encouraged to stay on.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata today denied that he has the intention of  succeeding Morihiro Hosokawa to become prime minister, KYODO  NEWS SERVICE reported.    Hata, also deputy prime minister, told a hastily arranged  press conference at the Foreign Ministry that he considers it is  more important to make adjustments within the ruling coalition  government than to become the next prime minister, KYODO said.    He also said the next cabinet must be a stable and  full-fledged one, according to the news agency.    However, a senior member of Shinseito, a powerful party in  the coalition government, said it would push for its leader Hata  as the next premier, TV reports said.    But Hajime Funada, former state minister for economic  planning, had this to add, "there is the question of how we  should address this within the current coalition framework. It  is a delicate thing to find a balance."</p>

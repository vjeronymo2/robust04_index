			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter announces two disposals as profits hit Pounds 1.17m JUPITER TYNDALL, the financial services group, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.17m for the 10 months to December 31 and announced the sale of two trust companies to Westpac Banking Corporation (Jersey). Consideration for St Helier Trust, which was engaged in trust and fund administration in Jersey, was Pounds 5.55m, plus repayment of Pounds 115,000 of inter-company debt. Tyndall Bank and Trust (Bahamas) will be sold for just over Pounds 1m, if the Central Bank of the Bahamas approves the deal. Jupiter Tyndall was assembled in the course of 1991. First, Jupiter Tarbutt Merlin, the privately-owned fund management group, reversed into Vantage Securities, an investment trust. Then Jupiter Tarbutt took over Tyndall Holdings, and the combined company was renamed Jupiter Tyndall. As a consequence of these changes, the company has not produced comparable figures for 1990. The 10 month results consolidate the results of Jupiter Tarbutt for nine months and those of Tyndall for the last three months of the year. Net turnover for the 10 months was Pounds 5.01m. The pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.17m consisted of operating profits of Pounds 1.02m and other income of Pounds 150,000. Earnings per share were 4.4p. The final dividend is 3p, giving a total of 5p. The company said the figures did not reflect the underlying trading performance. Profits were 'significantly lower' than they would have been if Jupiter Tarbutt's profits had been consolidated for the full 12 months and if the expenses of the merger had not occurred. The profits of the trust companies (about Pounds 115,000 for the eight months to December 31) were excluded. Mr John Duffield, chairman, said that 'the full effects of cost savings and the increased business flow which will accrue to the combined group are now starting to show through in improved operating performance and the enlarged group is trading in line with the board's expectations.'</p>

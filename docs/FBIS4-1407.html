			<p>CSO     [Text] Cape Town -- The African National Congress (ANC) is  clutching--in the form of the South African Communist Party  (SACP)--a "Soviet tiger cub" to its bosom and is raising it so  that it can later do its destructive work, warns DIE KERKBODE,  official publication of the [South African] Dutch Reformed  Church in its most recent edition.    "Communism, just like racism, is a very serious threat to  our  country. If the ANC, for its own reasons, offers a safe harbor  to the SACP, it should not expect that the church will look the  other way for the sake of peace. Excusing and accepting  atheistic communism is entirely too great a price to pay for  `unity in South Africa.' The church dares not agree to that. Is  the church engaging in `partisan politics' when it advises its  members against voting for an anti-Christian party with a  history of persecuting the church? If this is so, then it  becomes the church's mission in this case to engage in `partisan  politics,'" the lead article contends.    The argument that the ANC's alliance with communists is  comparable to the coalition between the Allies and the Soviet  Union in World War II to bring Germany to its knees, is  rejected. "The sad truth is that after World War II the Soviet  Union left an even more terrible trail of blood in its wake than  did Nazi Germany prior to and during the war."    According to the article, the Reverend Kobus Van Der  Westhuyzen, moderator of the Western Cape's most recently held  synod, has said that the church cannot do otherwise than to tell  the faithful that they cannot vote for communism. "Throughout  the years the church has spoken out against communism, which  advocates a form of atheism, and this is still the case. It is a  pity that the ANC has not distanced itself from the SACP. It  would have made its message easier."    Dr. Pieter Bingle, minister of the Cape Town Reformed  Congregation, told the newspaper that believers cannot support  an ideology such as communism whose values are alien to the  values of the Bible. "The communists are known for the fact that  they will try anything--at any price and regardless of the path  they pursue--to achieve their Marxist ideals." Prof. Pieter  Potgieter, moderator of the most recent General Synod of the  Dutch Reformed Church, denies that the church's discouraging  people to vote for the SACP can be regarded as interfering in  the political arena. He said that the SACP is not participating  in the election as a separate party. Professor Potgieter said  that a specific ideology is at issue here to which the church is  opposed and the church believes that its members should take  this into consideration when they go to vote.</p>

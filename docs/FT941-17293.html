			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Taxpayers' money is squandered Sir, Your leader, 'Another fudge from Tokyo' (December 29), argues that the Japanese government should do to its taxpayers what the US government did to its own in bailing out the savings and loans associations. 'Enabling the commercial banks to recapitalise' is another term used from time to time for the same dodge. Taxpayers' money is taxpayers' money. It does not matter whether it is handed out in the form of 'state assistance' or 'cheap credit at the official discount rate'. It still remains money extorted from tax-payers and squandered by politicians. If, in writing about such things, the term 'taxpayers' money' was invariably used, it is conceivable that, over time, it might dawn upon taxpayers what was happening, namely that their money was being misappropriated on a mind-boggling scale to bail out private institutions. As things stand, shareholders make money when banks declare profits, and taxpayers foot the bill when, every six years or so, banks lose their shareholders' shirts. The press does the public a disservice in failing to point out that 'cheap credit at the official discount rate' is just one of the subterfuges resorted to by governments to conceal what they are up to. Thomas Welsh, 21 Bede House, Manorfields, London SW15 3LT</p>

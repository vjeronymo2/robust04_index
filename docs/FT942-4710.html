			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Nestle may buy Volvo food unit Nestle, the Swiss food group yesterday confirmed its interest in buying Branded Consumer Products, the food, drink and tobacco company which Volvo wants to sell as part of a programme to focus on its vehicle businesses. 'We are interested in buying BCP. In fact we have started negotiations with a view to a possible acquisition,' Mr Helmut Maucher, Nestle chairman said in an interview with La Gaceta de los Negocios the Spanish business daily. Volvo said Nestle was one of several groups which had shown an interest in BCP, but it declined to identify the others. BCP, which includes Swedish Match and some of Sweden's best-known food and drinks brands, is the biggest single unit on Volvo's sale list and is expected to raise more than SKr20bn (Dollars 2.5bn). The consumer products group achieved first-quarter profits after financial items of SKr296m on sales of SKr4.85bn. Volvo holds 74 per cent of BCP and has launched a bid for the outstanding shares. Its offer expires on Friday. The vehicle group wants to gain 100 per cent control of BCP before it enters detailed disposal talks. BCP was formed in late 1993 after the break-up of Procordia, a drugs-to-food group jointly controlled by the Swedish state and Volvo.</p>

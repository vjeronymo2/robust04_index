			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Jewish settlers stage their own intifada: A peace initiative has coincided with an outbreak of unrest THIS week, a small number of prominent Jewish settlers in the occupied territories got together to form a new group. Called Settlers for Peace, they marked their formation by issuing a brief statement. Claiming to represent the overwhelming majority of settlers, they called on their fellow 130,000 Jewish residents of the territories 'to exercise restraint,' despite the latest spate of Palestinian attacks. Jewish settlements, said their chairman, Eli Cohen, could serve as 'bridges to peace between Jews and Arabs.' The world should know, he added, that most settlers genuinely sought peace and reconciliation. Unfortunately for the Settlers for Peace, their initiative coincided with settler unrest in the centre of the West Bank town of Hebron. Two Palestinians had attacked father-of-ten Avraham Zarbiv as he made his way to morning prayers at the Cave of the Patriarchs, leaving him wounded in the head but still able to fire a shot from his pistol that killed one of his attackers. Led by Rabbi Moshe Levinger, one of the founders of the West Bank settlement movement, a group of settlers burst into Hebron's main market area, overturning piles of vegetables, throwing stones - even ordering Arab traders to line up against a wall while they demolished piles of their produce. Car windows were smashed. Some traders claimed later to have been beaten. The Israeli army maintains a sizeable deployment in the area. Military sources do not dispute that there were soldiers on hand. Palestinian witnesses insist that the soldiers made no effort to intervene, but simply watched and waited until the settler rioting was over. Amnon Shahak, the army's deputy chief of staff, who is also heading the Israeli delegation to autonomy negotiations with the PLO, admitted yesterday that the army has a problem combating the increasingly militant settlers. 'It's hard for 18-year-old Israeli soldiers to deal with the settler riots,' he said. 'But we will find an effective answer." General Shahak is not the only man looking for a solution. Israel's Justice Minister David Libai has said that the government must not allow the settler riots to go on, but has offered no specific means of countering them. The Attorney-General, Michael Ben-Yair, has been holding meetings with various security officials with a view to banning some of the most extreme settler organisations, including factions loyal to the anti-Arab views of the assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane. But the Israeli authorities are anxious not to force the most dangerous activists underground. The police and army insist that they have been making arrests, but although several dozen settlers have been taken into custody following violent protests in the territories and outside government offices and residences inside Jerusalem, few spend more than a night in jail. The Palestinians, however, have an obvious solution. When the Israeli army begins its phased pullout from the Gaza and Jericho areas early next year, they should take the settlers with them. In an interview last month, Nabil Sha'ath, head of the PLO team at the autonomy talks, spoke of the need for Gaza's 4,000 settlers to be gone within two years. But while Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin may well have long-term plans to give up sovereignty over all the settlements in Gaza and many in heavily-populated Palestinian areas of the West Bank, he is telling his negotiators that, in the short term at least, not a single settlement will be uprooted, that settlers must be protected, and that the army will have to find the means to minimise settler-Palestinian friction. The problem for Mr Rabin, however, is that the settlers' fight against the whole Palestinian autonomy programme appears to be winning support among the rest of the Israeli public. Shortly after the Israel-PLO accords were signed in Washington two months ago, opinion polls showed two thirds of Israelis backing the peace deal. Latest surveys indicate that figure has slipped below 40 per cent, and it seems to be falling with every new Palestinian attack on a Jewish target. The Settlers for Peace initiative seems destined to fail: Militant settlers are not exercising restraint, the army has found no way to stop them, and the Israeli public seems increasingly sympathetic to their cause.</p>

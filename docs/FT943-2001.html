			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Jardine Strategic rises 33% Jardine Strategic Holdings, the holding company of the Jardine Matheson group, yesterday reported a 33 per cent increase in net profits to USDollars 161.3m from Dollars 121.3m last year. These are likely to be JSH's last set of results reported out of Hong Kong, as it is withdrawing its secondary listing from the colony's exchange on December 31. The figures are after preference dividends, which came to Dollars 19.2m, but exclude an extraordinary item of Dollars 68.3m accrued in first half 1993 from the sale of an investment property by Hongkong Land. Stripping out an exceptional gain from a property sale made by Dairy Farm in the first half of this year, the year-on-year earnings rise shrinks to 19 per cent. Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, said: 'The businesses in which we hold our strategic stakes are financially strong and, with their operations based mainly in the expanding markets of the Asia-Pacific region, the outlook is for many years of further development. The full year should see higher earnings than in 1993, and the longer term perspective remains encouraging.' Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis rose 28 per cent to 20.40 cents from 15.97 cents, while directors are recommending a dividend of 4.60 cents, up 15 per cent from last year's 4.00 cents payout. Mr Keswick said JSH was ready to acquire smaller stakes in companies with promising prospects and links, whether geographical or business, to the group.</p>

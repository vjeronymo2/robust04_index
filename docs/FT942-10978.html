			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Civil war intensifies in Yemen: Port city targeted as Arab League calls emergency meeting Heavy ground fighting erupted throughout Yemen yesterday, with air attacks launched against several cities, as the country entered its third day of an intensifying civil war. Military leaders in Sanaa, the capital, appear to have given up hope of a negotiated end to the hostilities, and declared their aim was to capture the southern port city of Aden and take control of the entire country. The French navy evacuated some 400 Westerners yesterday from Aden. The defence ministry in Paris said boats ferried the evacuees to the warship Jules Verne, just outside Yemen's territorial waters. A spokesman said about 2,000 westerners lived in Yemen, and some 5,000 of dual nationality, mainly American-Yemenis. Fears about the escalating conflict in Yemen, a relatively small exporter of oil, has coincided with increasing concerns about tight oil supplies, pushing oil prices higher. The North Sea Brent crude oil price rose by 50 cents to Dollars 16.05 a barrel yesterday. The north Yemeni leadership, headed by General Ali Abdullah Saleh, dismissed the southern leader, Mr Ali Salem al-Biedh, from the government and ordered its troops to capture him and other high-ranking officials, branding them 'war criminals'. Yemen became a single country in 1990 when the north and south agreed to merge after more than three years of negotiation. During the past year political differences have deepened despite attempts by other Arab countries to negotiate a solution. An emergency meeting of the Arab League has been called by Egypt for today, and President Hafez al-Assad, of Syria, appealed to Yemeni leaders for restraint. North Yemeni military commanders said yesterday that the south had launched a missile attack on Sanaa at 2.45am, hitting close to the presidential palace. Western diplomats confirmed the report and identified the missile as a Scud. Northern defenders met attacking aircraft with anti-aircraft fire and sent up two further barrages at 4.30am and 6am. Sanaa radio reported further air raids on the northern region at Hodeida, a main port city on the Red Sea; at Mareb, a key oil-producing region east of Sanaa; and at Taiz, a major city some 250km south of Sanaa. There were no immediate assessments of damage or casualties. Ground fighting was reported in the border region between the former north and south Yemen. Northern republican guards are said to have routed the southern Basuhaib brigade in a tank battle on Wednesday night at Dhamar, about 100km south of Sanaa. Northern units were reported to be driving towards Mukayras, about 120km north-east of Aden, in an effort to link with other units based at nearby Laudar and at Shuqra, on the Gulf of Aden. Their aim is to isolate Aden, which is already cut off from communications. A northern officer, dismissing the old border, said: 'Our only frontier now is the sea.' The northern leadership also cut most communication links with the outside world. Airports in Sanaa and Aden have been closed indefinitely. Civil war engulfs divided Yemen, Page 2</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report By UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Simferopol 7 April, TASS -- "Kiev continues to  prevent us from tackling the economy in earnest and pushes for  confrontation," Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov told a news  conference in Simferopol on Thursday.    Speaking about his attitude towards Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk's decision to appoint his representative in the  Crimea, Meshkov said "this happened at the most difficult stage  of the establishment of the Crimea's statehood, on the eve of  the elections to the parliament."    "But we will do everything possible in order that elections  go off successfully on 10 April," he added. He said that the  Crimea has lost Valeriy Gorbatov, who has been appointed  Kravchuk's representative in the Crimea, as its citizen.    Meshkov also spoke about the results of his trip to Cyprus  where he had reached an agreement to open a Cypriot trade office  in the Crimea. Documents to this effect will be signed during  Cypriot leaders' visit to the Crimea.</p>

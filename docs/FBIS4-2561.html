			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese  Vice-President Rong Yiren has said that China wishes to work  hard together with the Portuguese Government to give an impetus  to bilateral ties and cooperation in every field between the two  countries.    Rong made the remarks at a meeting with visiting Portuguese  Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva here today.    Developing a closer Sino-Portuguese relationship conforms to  the aspirations and interests of the two peoples, Rong said.    "It is our hope that the two countries will make concerted  efforts to open up new areas for cooperation," he added.    Rong noted that at present China enjoys political stability  and fast economic growth while the legal system and the  investment environment are being further improved. More  Portuguese entrepreneurs are welcome to China to do business or  invest, he said.    Silva said that as soon as he arrived in China he was  accorded a warm reception by the Chinese Government and people.    He described his talks with Chinese Premier Li Peng as  "fruitful", which he said had boosted his confidence in  expanding trade and bilateral economic ties.    Silva expressed the belief that the two sides will continue  their good cooperation in implementing the Sino-Portuguese joint  declaration on the question of Macao.    He said Portuguese entrepreneurs have shown great interest  in  China's market, hoping that bilateral economic ties and trade  will be as good as the political ties.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CUBA;  </P> <P> LEADERSHIP SLASHES PARTY BUREAUCRACY  </P> <P> Cuba's ruling Communist Party moved to streamline its bloated party  bureaucracy, slashing national and provincial party posts by 50% and  reorganizing the powerful Central Committee. In reforms aimed at revitalizing  the island's one-party political system, the Communist leadership said it will  also introduce direct, secret voting and multiple candidates in coming  elections for municipal and provincial party committees. Despite the moves,  President Fidel Castro has made it clear that he does not intend to join the  Soviet Union and its former allies in Eastern Europe in embracing multi-party  politics and a market economy.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Niurka Franco] </F>   [Text] The financial crisis Venezuela is experiencing,  which has worsened with the recent government intervention of  Banco Latino, has resulted from various factors, among the most  noteworthy of which are commercial banks' unproductive assets,  which are somewhere on the order of 251 billion bolivares and  represent 180 percent of commercial banks' net worth of 136  billion bolivares.    Judging by a careful analysis by Senator Alberto Lizardi,  former president of the Federation of Venezuelan Public  Accountant Associations [Federacion de Colegios de Contadores  Publicos de Venezuela] and president of the Iberoamerican  Confederation of Public Accountants, 66 percent of the country's  commercial banks are facing serious financial and economic  problems. It is a situation that, in his opinion, merits an  exhaustive government study by Congress, depositors, and even  the General Bank Superintendency, which, in his opinion, is  overlooking its real duties.    "The General Bank Superintendency has become a conceptual  organization that does not supervise, make recommendations, or  intervene in any institution until it collapses."    Lizardi has said the 251 billion bolivares of unproductive  assets are costing the financial sector 150 billion bolivares,  and they have become a decisive factor in preventing commercial  banks from providing benefits. After reading a bulletin issued  by the General Bank Superintendency in September 1993, I am  convinced, Lizardi has said, neither the government, state,  General Bank Superintendency nor Central Bank of Venezuela are  aware of the scope of the crisis, because a parallel banking  system is in operation and the Venezuelan authorities are  looking the other way. This parallel system has between 500 and  800 billion bolivares at its receiving offices [mesas de  dinero], and no one knows where those resources from the general  public, industrial organizations, merchants and small depositors  are invested.    The bank superintendent confirmed this fact when he said he  will begin to receive information on this in May.    Lizardi has said it is incredible banks do not publish their  consolidated balances and the financial statements that reflect  the operations of their main headquarters and branches, thereby  keeping the public abreast of the operations conducted by the  entire economic group and its real situation, including its  offices abroad.    In the specific case of receiving office operations, Lizardi  says a failure to enter such operations as well as "offshore"  [previous word in English] deals has led to the evasion of  income taxes on an interest differential of approximately six  points for funds invested and funds received.    Invested funds amounted to 68.83 percent and received funds  to 62.31 percent on 31 December 1993.    According to the Lizardi report, the state loses  approximately 6.492 billion bolivares in income taxes yearly.  It lost this much from receiving office operations last year  alone." [no opening quotation mark as published]    Asked about the emergency law undergoing debate in Congress,  Lizardi has said even though it is an important tool it will not  resolve the crisis of the financial sector, which can only be  resolved by applying true regulatory mechanisms.    "We must begin regulating banks; there must be an effective  superintendency, and independent bank auditors must be replaced  every two (?years) [periodos], not every 14 as in the Banco  Latino case. Regulations such as these were implemented in the  United States when several savings and loan institutions  collectively went bankrupt; it is a means of conducting a purge."    Lizardi takes a positive view of a joint effort in which the  executive and legislative branches, General Bank Superintendency  and all the sectors involved will work together to achieve  permanent and not temporary solutions.</p>

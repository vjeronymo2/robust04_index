			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dariusz Szymczycha under the "100 Words" </F> rubric]    [Text] Influence in the municipal self-governments has been  distributed among the Union of Freedom [UW], Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD], and the right wing. However, none of these  groupings can afford to wield self-governmental power on their  own. All of them must hold talks on the formation of a coalition.    In democratic states, local policy does not have much to do  with policies conducted in a given country's capital. In gminas  [smallest administrative units], even municipal gminas, there is  more that links people together than there are differences on  Wiejska Street [location of the Sejm].    I am afraid, however, that typical Polish scenarios may  emerge. Thus, UW may set up self-governmental coalitions with  the right wing only because this fits the image of an opposition  (on Wiejska Street) party. Then municipal authorities may be in  programmatic opposition to parliament and the government, based  on the coalition of the Polish Peasant Party and the SLD. It  will be a political game. The issue of indispensable  self-governmental reforms will become politicized; UW will lose  its virtue of freedom because it will become involved in  compromises and activities pushing it to the right.    As can be seen, the selection of partners for municipal  self-governmental coalitions will contribute to changes in both  the character and the programs of parliamentary parties.</p>

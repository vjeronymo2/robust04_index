			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Silvio Buzzanca: "Bertinotti, Consultation Pact </F> on the Left"]    [Text] Rome -- On the day after the major defeat of the  Left, Communist Renewal has the serene face of [Secretary]  Fausto Bertinotti and the calm eloquence of [Chairman] Armando  Cossutta. The two leaders are satisfied with the result and are  stating openly that they will form an autonomous group in  parliament with the task of providing "an effective opposition."  To Achille Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the  Left, PDS] and the other allies they are proposing solely a  consultation pact.    When all is said and done they have won their battle, and  are  now ready to gather in fruits aimed at "visibility" and  "diversity," setting them apart from the progressive chorus  defending Prime Minister Ciampi. In order to mark this  diversity, the neo-communists in parliament and in the Senate  will be acting as a separate group. Because, Bertinotti  explains, pouring everyone into one melting pot would represent  a diminution of the plurality and the richness of the political  scene to the Left. And then because unity must be constructed  from the bottom up, paying attention to and building on the  concerns and sensitivities of progressive voters. If not, it  would be like trying to build a house starting with the roof and  not the foundation.    For this reason Bertinotti and Cossutta are proposing the  consultation pact between all elected progressives as a way of  "reaching agreement on the battles which must be fought jointly  inside and outside parliament," and of "remedying the deficit of  unity during the election campaign" and of recovering the  collegial spirit which has not worked in recent months. A pact  which, they continue to underline, should start with the needs  of people and with real problems, and which therefore requires a  clear opposition, the renewal of social conflict as the only way  of regaining the consensus of the popular masses.    Also because the Right, Bertinotti says, "is a Right which  constitutes a very serious threat to the country's social  model," a threat which also manifests itself "as a new form of  dorotheism [former Christian Democratic faction]." Hence the  need to prepare for opposition, also because Cossutta does not  believe in the breaking up of the pole of the Right. Even if  there were the possibility of creating a left-center government,  with a [Northern League Secretary] Bossi landing in the opposing  camp, Communist Renewal would be opposed.    Bertinotti does not wish to talk of rumors which say that  Occhetto's future is in question within the PDS. And to those  who remind him that, ultimately, Occhetto is the progressives'  leader, he replies that "Renewal has never recognized  leadership" within the grouping. Cossuta, on the other hand,  opened the question of the forthcoming institutional  appointments, pointing out that, since 1976, there has been "the  practice of entrusting these delicate tasks" to persons who are  not necessarily members of the majority but who enjoy "prestige  and recognized competence." But, for Renewal's chairman, this  too is open to discussion.    The serious political problem, on the other hand, is the  chairmanship of the committees, in particular the bicameral ones  entrusted with investigation and oversight. And here Cossuta  proposes that "following the practice in many Western countries"  the chairmanship be entrusted to the opposition. In this way  the Renewal's leader has excluded the possibility of examining  at this point in time the topic of the presidency of the  Republic. "The legitimacy of President Scalfaro should not be  questioned," Cossuta said, even if he recalled that in his party  "considerable criticism has been expressed recently of certain  choices made by the head of state."</p>

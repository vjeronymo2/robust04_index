			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Warsaw rejects subsidies THE Polish government, under pressure from organised labour to ease tough free market policies, rejects subsidies for struggling state factories, Mr Zdobyslaw Milewski, the government spokesman, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Warsaw. 'The government will not bring back subsidies for state enterprises,' he said. The former communist trade union OPZZ decided last weekend to support pay demands at a copper combine where workers have been on strike for three weeks. It threatened a general stoppage if the government refused to open negotiations with the strikers. The union called for a 15-minute cross-country warning action yesterday to build up pressure on the goverment but according to radio reports the response among workers was weak. Mr Milewski said the government had presented a plan to speed up changes of state enterprises to help them adapt to market-oriented policies but that it could not decide about pay issues.</p>

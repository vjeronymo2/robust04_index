			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAID OFF AEROSPACE WORKERS TO GET AID;  </P> <P> JOBS: A WAR CHEST OF $10 MILLION IS BEING ASSEMBLED TO RETRAIN THEM. STATE  GRANT FUNDS WILL FINANCE THE PROGRAM.  </P> <P> A war chest of nearly $10 million in state grant funds is being assembled to  retrain hundreds of workers hit by aerospace industry layoffs locally, a Los  Angeles City Council panel was told Wednesday.  </P> <P> Councilman Robert Farrell, chairman of the Community and Economic Development  Committee and a lawmaker who has been prodding the city to gird itself for a  defense spending wind-down, called the grants a "very encouraging sign of our  increased capacity to meet the needs of displaced aerospace workers."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles area grant money, apparently the first of its kind to target  the aerospace layoff situation, would be used to retrain people for work at  McDonnell Douglas' Long Beach assembly plant and at other unspecified  companies.  </P> <P> The $10 million in retraining money -- which may be supplemented by another  $3-million grant to retool the skills of 1,000 defense industry workers for  jobs at PacTel Cellular, the nation's second largest car phone company -- comes  from the state's unemployment insurance fund.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago the council adopted a preliminary plan to cope with aerospace  industry layoffs, including a commitment to seek $28 million in U.S. Department  of Labor grants for job retraining and a move to clear away a thicket of  cumbersome rules that slow the city's ability to apply for federal funds to  help retrain, counsel and possibly relocate displaced workers.  </P> <P> The move to build a regional safety net for aerospace workers comes as some  labor analysts have predicted that up to 20,000 Southland defense industry  employees will be laid off by the end of the year. About 60% of the state's  huge aerospace industry work force is located in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The $10 million is in two grants, each for $5 million, from the state  Employment Training Panel. Only 75% of one of the grant's, or $3.75 million,  must be spent to help aerospace industry layoff victims.  </P> <P> The panel is a seven-member body created in 1983 to administer grant funds  disbursed from a 0.1% annual allocation from the state's unemployment insurance  fund. The so-called ETP grants are to be used to retrain workers who are about  to be laid off, or who have been laid off, said Ada Carrillo, the panel's  manager for planning and information.  </P> <P> The grants only pay retraining costs, not for any stipends or wages to  trainee-workers, Carrillo said. The retraining agencies, which in many cases  are companies who are tapping the jobless market for new employees, do not get  reimbursed for their training costs unless they hire the workers for at least  90 days.  </P> <P> The first of the new Southland grants will go to the United Auto Workers-Labor  Employment and Training Corp., a organization established to retrain displaced  workers. Bob Nelson, a vice president at UAW-LETC, said the nonprofit affiliate  of the auto workers union will begin classes at its South Gate facility Oct. 1  to retrain up to 1,200 laid off aerospace industry workers for jobs as  structural mechanics and electronic assemblers at McDonnell Douglas.  </P> <P> McDonnell makes its MD-80 and MD-11 commercial jets at its Long Beach site.  </P> <P> The classes will be offered for 18 months. Individual classes will run for six  or nine weeks, Nelson said.  </P> <P> The other grant is set aside exclusively for use in retraining Lockheed workers  laid off at the company's Burbank plant and is being administered locally by  the Verdugo Private Industry Council, a private nonprofit corporation serving  Glendale and Burbank.  </P> <P> Details have not been worked out about which companies or community colleges  would operate the retraining programs, said Madalyn Blake, the Verdugo PIC's  executive director.  </P> <P> But Blake said the idea is to market the training program to production and  some high-tech companies working between Burbank and Palmdale, a corridor where  a majority of Lockheed employees live.  </P> <P> BOEING UPROAR: City and state officials said they were outraged by Boeing  importing workers from Seattle for B-2 jobs in Palmdale.

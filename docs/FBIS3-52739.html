			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Randah Habib dispatch from Amman] </F>   [Text] The Jordanian and Palestinian negotiators are trying  to come up with a joint formula after it has been confirmed that  the PLO will not sign the Jordanian-Palestinian economic  agreement.    A declaration is expected to be issued at the conclusion of  the talks in Amman tonight on the establishment of a joint  cooperation committee to implement the financial, monetary, and  banking policies until the central Palestinian monetary body has  been established.    This declaration is an alternative to the PLO's refusal to  sign a joint economic agreement, which has been awaiting its  approval for over two months. This declaration gives Jordan the  green light to reopen branches of its banks in the West Bank.  However, the kingdom is more eager to reach a comprehensive  economic agreement without isolating the issue of the banks, as  an authoritative Jordanian source said.    The joint declaration will include broad outlines on the use  of the Jordanian dinar in the occupied territory and the  establishment of banks specialized in development in the fields  of housing, industry, and agriculture, and will encourage  investments without discussing details as was the case in the  joint economic agreement.    The Palestinian side has also committed itself to  participation in the six joint committees as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS SIGN EX-RANGER CORREA, WHO HASN'T PITCHED IN 2 1/2 YEARS  </P> <P> The Dodgers added another comeback player to their spring training picture  Monday when they signed Edwin Correa, a former Texas Ranger top rookie pitcher,  to a minor-league contract.  </P> <P> Because of problems resulting from a stress fracture in his right shoulder,  Correa has not pitched in more than two years, and, as a Seventh Day Adventist,  does not pitch from sundown Friday until sundown Saturday, the period his  church regards as the Sabbath.  </P> <P> Correa is a right-hander who struck out 189 in 202 1/3 innings as a Ranger  rookie in 1986, when he went 12-14 with a 4.23 earned-run average. But he has  not thrown a big-league pitch since July 8, 1987, when he suffered the shoulder  injury.  </P> <P> After trying and failing to rehabilitate the shoulder, he underwent  arthroscopic surgery on June 23, 1988, and finally returned to pitch for the  Rangers' rookie league team in Port Charlotte, Fla., last summer. He was  released this winter, but he impressed Dodger minor league officials in a  workout.  </P> <P> When camp opens, Correa, 23, will join two other new Dodger pitchers recovering  from surgery. Jim Gott is rehabilitating an injured elbow, and Pat Perry is  recovering from a sore shoulder. BILL PLASCHKE  </P></p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow loses steam after nudging record high Wall Street An overnight rally in Tokyo, more favourable news on the US economy and a resilient bond market lifted Wall Street out of the doldrums yesterday, writes Frank McGurty in New York. But an early surge in share prices petered out in the final hours of trading, leaving only the secondary markets with big rises on the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 13.13 up at 3,697.08, after flirting with a record high level of 3,710.77 during mid-morning. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained just 0.10 at 461.89, but the American SE composite added 2.74 at 462.77 and the Nasdaq composite climbed 9.42 to 763.81. NYSE volume was a heavy 294m shares. The US Treasury market once again set the tone. After a much stronger than expected reading of business activity in Chicago on Tuesday, bond traders were braced for more unfavourable news when the US purchasing managers' monthly index was released yesterday. In the event, the index showed a moderate gain to 55.7 per cent, from 53.8 per cent in October, bringing a measure of relief to traders fearing a strong signal of inflationary pressure. In late trading, the 30-year benchmark government bond was  1/2 higher at 99 13/16 , yielding 6.258 per cent. With concern over tighter credit temporarily put aside, equity investors took encouragement from a 4.4 per cent jump in Tokyo shares overnight and impressive showings by European exchanges. Sentiment was also buoyed by the Commerce Department's announcement of a 2.5 per cent increase in October construction spending, the largest rise since March 1992. Amid the fresh signs of steady economic growth, cyclical stocks were among the session's best performers. Deere, the farm equipment maker, advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 72, Chrysler Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 and Ford Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 62 1/2 . Paccar, the truck manufacturer, was up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 68 1/4 , but rival Navistar International fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 22 3/8 . Whirlpool added Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 62 1/8 after Merrill Lynch said a recent price decline left the stock undervalued. Boeing shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 38 1/8 on news that the aerospace concern would further cut production and employment. Walt Disney rallied Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 3/4 after an upbeat assessment of attendance prospects for the Euro Disney theme park, in which the US company has a 49 per cent stake. On the Nasdaq, America Online rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 67 1/4 after announcing plans to develop interactive television services with Intel and General Instrument. Intel put on Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 62 3/4 . On the NYSE, GI edged ahead Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 53 1/2 . Canada Toronto rose sharply in active trading, in line with other major world markets. The TSE 300 index closed 40.2 ahead at 4,220.4 and advances led falls by 459 to 291 after volume of 75.7m shares.</p>

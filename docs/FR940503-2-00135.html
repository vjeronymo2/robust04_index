Dykeman, Assistant Executive Director for Noise Certification, Deputy Director, Office of Environment and Energy (AEE&hyph;2), 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, Telephone: (202)267&hyph;3577; FAX: (202)267&hyph;5594. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) establishment an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56 FR 2190, January 22, 1991; and 58 FR 9230, February 19, 1993). One area of the ARAC deals with noise certification issues. These issues involve the harmonization of part 36 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 36) with Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) part 36, their associated guidance material including equivalent procedures, and the interpretation of the regulations. The FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters will forward recommendations to the ARAC, which will determine whether to forward them to the FAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, the FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters is charged with reviewing the applicable provisions of subparts A and H, and appendices H and J of the 14 CFR part 36 and harmonizing them with the corresponding applicable provisions of JAR 36. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ARAC should consider the current international standards and recommended practices, as issued under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Annex 16, Volume 1, and its associated Technical Manual, as the basis for development of these harmonization proposals. ARAC should also consider recommending a process whereby subsequent ICAO Annex 16 changes are properly incorporated into JAR and FAR 36. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the ARAC determines that a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), an Advisory Circular (AC), or both would be appropriated, those documents are to be submitted, in the format prescribed, to the FAA. The Working Group should make recommendations to the ARAC in the following manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Reports <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Recommend a work plan for completion of the task and subtasks, including the rationale supporting the plan, for consideration at the meeting of the ARAC to consider noise certification issues held following publication of this notice; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Giver a detailed conceptual presentation on the proposed recommendation to the ARAC before proceeding with the work stated in item (c) below; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If considered appropriate, develop NPRM(s) proposing the revised rules for aircraft noise certification, a supporting economic and other required analysis, advisory and guidance material, and any other collateral documents the Working Group determines to be needed. Present these recommendations to the ARAC for further consideration and disposition; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Give a status report on the task at each meeting of the ARAC held to consider noise certification issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters will be comprised of experts from those organizations having an interest in the tasks assigned. A working Group member need not necessarily be a respective of one of the organizations of the ARAC. Individuals who have expertise in the subject matter and wish to become a member of the Working Group should write the person listed under the caption,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , expressing that desire, describing their interest in the task, and the expertise they would bring to the working group. The request will be reviewed by the ARAC Assistant Chair for Noise Certification and the Chair of the Working Group, and the individual will be advised if the request can be granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the formation and use of the ARAC are necessary and in the public interest, in connection with the performance of duties of the FAA. Meetings of the ARAC to consider noise certification issues will be open to the public, except as authorized by section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Meetings of the FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters will not be open to the public, except to the extent that individuals with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No public announcement of Working Group meetings will be made. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on April 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Paul R.

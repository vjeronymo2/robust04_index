			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITED GERMANY MUST CONFRONT CHAOS ONCE LOCKED SAFELY BEHIND IRON CURTAIN;  </P> <P> EUROPE: A UNIFIED GERMANY IS PART OF CENTRAL EUROPE, NOT OF THE WEST. ITS  POLICIES WILL REFLECT A GROWING PREOCCUPATION WITH NEIGHBORS TO THE EAST.  </P> <P> Publicly, the West has been calling for it for 40 years, but the prayers for  German unity were like St. Augustine's youthful prayers for chastity: "Make  Germany one, Lord -- but not yet."  </P> <P> God heard the first half of that prayer. One year ago, German unity was a  remote contingency, not expected for decades. On Oct. 3, the church bells will  ring and the banners will wave from the Rhine to the Oder -- the Fourth Reich  will be open for business.  </P> <P> The good news first. German fascism is dead and there are no prospects for its  revival. Nobody in German history has been as thoroughly discredited as the Man  with the Mustache. He ruined Germany in 12 short years. In 1945, the German  people were starving, occupied, hated and covered in a shame that, half a  century later, has still not departed. Some lessons people learn. Fringe groups  are with us always, but the overwhelming majority of Germans are sincere in  saying they don't want to go this route again.  </P> <P> Now for the news that may not be bad, but is a little less comfortable. A  reunified Germany will be far more powerful than the old West German state, and  it will use its power in ways that will sometimes make its old partners  unhappy.  </P> <P> Some commentators argue that reunification doesn't mean much. Germany, they say  hopefully, is not a great power. For years to come it will be too absorbed in  the expensive and divisive process of integrating its communist East and  capitalist West to throw its weight around.  </P> <P> Wrong answer. The new German state is already a superpower. The Soviet Union  and the United States are both trying to sponge off the Germans -- the Soviet  Union, to avoid disintegration; the United States, to prop up its shaky Middle  Eastern position today, to prop up a shakier dollar tomorrow. The deutsche mark  is the world's second-most-important reserve currency, and it continues to gain  on the dollar. If reunification goes badly, taking longer and costing more than  even the latest set of escalating estimates, Germany will be restless and  unhappy, but it will still be the richest and most influential country in  Europe.  </P> <P> Germany's new weight in the world doesn't come from the addition of the five  polluted and flea-bitten states of the old East Germany. It comes from the  astonishing collapse of Soviet power, and the less rapid and complete, but no  less real, decline in the U.S. position in Europe. The Soviet collapse has left  a vacuum in Eastern Europe that German money and influence will fill. For  countries like Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary, Germany will become their  most important trading partner and most important source of investment capital.  The Soviet Union is daily becoming more dependent on German credit. Germany's  diplomats and businessmen will loom large in the old Soviet Bloc -- and that  influence, in turn, will strengthen their hands in the rest of the world.  </P> <P> Washington hopes that the new Federal Republic of Germany will be just like the  old Federal Republic of Germany -- only bigger. West Germany was a stuffy, rich  country firmly tied to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with the United  States and to a European partnership with France -- a kind of Greater Holland.  The new Germany, says official U.S. opinion, will be more of the same.  </P> <P> Wrong again. The old Federal Republic, West Germany, was part of Western  Europe. The new Federal Republic is part of Central Europe. There's a  difference.  </P> <P> While Western Europe was busy celebrating the "end of history" in 1990, Eastern  Europe was descending into the maelstrom of chaos, depression and possibly war.  Germany, as so often before in its history, is caught in the middle.  </P> <P> The Iron Curtain was, in its way, convenient for the West. Josef Stalin took  the poor and quarrelsome half of Europe and imposed rigid discipline on it.  That left Western Europe, composed of largely peaceful countries with subtle  boundaries, an opportunity to develop new kinds of international cooperation  without having to worry about neighbors to the East.  </P> <P> The end of the Iron Curtain means the end of Western Europe's isolation from  the messy and dangerous part of the Continent -- and Germany feels this more  keenly than anyone else. This situation in Eastern Europe deteriorates day to  day. The Bulgarian government warns of famine and bloodshed; Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's own top economic advisers use words like catastrophic and  cataclysmic to describe the state of their country. At market exchange rates,  Soviet workers earn about $10-a-month. Bulgarians and Romanians are in much the  same state. Even the Yugoslavs, the Swiss of the East, earn less in a month  than Italians make in a week. Nobody talks about the magic of the market any  more; nobody now predicts anything but further erosion of these standards of  living.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, polls show up to 30% of the Soviet people would emigrate. In  one of the most ominous signs of the postwar period, Soviet Jews are banging at  the doors of German consulates, seeking asylum. The Dutch minister of labor  predicts between one and three million Soviets a year will come West looking  for work in the early 1990s. Poles, Gypsies, Romanians, Bulgars and Serbs are  also knocking at the West's back door -- which happens to be Germany's eastern  frontier.  </P> <P> In the age of the Iron Curtain, West Germany could believe that its major  interests and concerns were with Western Europe and the United States. The new  Germany still has important links with the West -- but these aren't its only  major interests anymore. Trying to maintain good relations with its newly  restless Eastern neighbors, and trying to bring some kind of stability to this  region is rapidly becoming the No. 1 priority of the all-German government.  </P> <P> The first sign of the new German policy -- and the first cause of trouble  between the new Germany and its old Western partners -- is the German drive to  "totalize" the institutional network in Western Europe: To pull the blankets of  NATO and the European Community over its neighbors to the East. This has led to  some grumbling and blanket-snatching by its bed mates to the West; not everyone  is convinced the new arrangements will keep them as warm as the old ones.  </P> <P> The United States worries mostly about NATO. Germany wants to replace the old  Atlantic Alliance with the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a  "Pan-European" security system that stretches from Vancouver to Vladivostok.  Maybe, says Washington. The European menagerie could certainly use a Pan-Animal  Protective Society; but there were lions and leopards as well as rabbits and  sheep in the zoo. The leopards say they are changing their spots, and the lions  say they have sworn off red meat; the rabbits and sheep have heard this before.  NATO worked as well as it did because it had a small number of members who  shared a large number of common interests. Washington worries the 35-member  CSCE will have more members who share fewer interests, and so be less  effective.  </P> <P> France worries about the European Community for similar reasons. The EC works  because it has a manageably short membership list -- 12 -- and because its  members are at basically the same level of development. The EC has trouble even  now with its less-developed members. Adding the poor and chaotic Eastern  European countries will complicate -- possibly derail -- the whole process of  European integration. The EC is now dividing between the "deepeners" who want  to continue the process of integration among the 12, and the "wideners" who  want to embrace the new democracies of the East. Not surprisingly, Germany is  leading the wideners.  </P> <P> Germany doesn't want to cause all this trouble, but it hasn't got much choice.  France, Britain and the United States don't have borders with Eastern Europe.  The Soviet collapse and the resulting situation there don't hold the same  opportunities and dangers for the Western countries they do for the Germans.  </P> <P> Reunification doesn't happen until Wednesday, and already German policy is  moving away from its postwar moorings. It won't -- can't -- follow the U.S.  lead in security policy anymore, and it won't -- can't -- work as closely as it  used to on economic policy with the French. Rich, talented and troubled, the  new Germany is an important new player on the international scene. Like it or  not, the other great powers must learn to move over.  </P></p>

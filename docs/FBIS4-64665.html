			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League ideologue Gianfranco </F> Miglio by Gianluigi Da Rold in Como; date not given: "Miglio  Tells Bossi: Either Federalism or a Nasty Death"]    [Text] Como -- Professor Gianfranco Miglio is a bit  disappointed with the political situation, with [League  Secretary] Umberto Bossi's actions, and with the League. Living  like a commuter between his splendid Como and Domaso homes, he  observes political developments with an academic's eye.    [Da Rold] What is all this disappointment about, Professor  Miglio?    [Miglio] My friend Bossi is not being forceful enough in  demanding reforms. He is wavering. The Northern League's  raison d'etre was basically that of demanding federal reform.  Otherwise, the League has no justification for existence, and  this may lead to decline, which is what [Prime  Minister-designate] Berlusconi is hoping for.    [Da Rold] There seems to be no leadership problem within the  League.    [Miglio] I am not saying anything of the sort. The problem  lies in the fact that there are few men in the League who have  the stature to govern a country. There is not a very wide  spectrum. There are no personalities. All this negotiating to  obtain the Interior Ministry for Roberto Maroni is not very  convincing either. Above all, Bossi is not coming up with a  strategy for the necessary political growth, and at the same  time he is facing fierce competition from Berlusconi among his  voters. In fact, the League is an attack and protest structure,  rather than one for governing.    [Da Rold] However, you too, professor, were not opposed to  taking part in the government.    [Miglio] Except that we should have played in two different  fields at once. We should have launched a great campaign for a  constituent government. In such a situation, I agreed with a  double negotiating table, including both a constituent assembly  and the government. Such a separate table worked well at the  time of the 1946 constituent assembly. As regards reform, the  League would have had the opportunity to establish some form of  cooperation with the Left, with the opposition. Now it is  essentially folding back on the basic need to govern.    [Da Rold] It sounds like a rather crucial step.    [Miglio] If we do not change the rules of the game, if we do  not establish a federal Constitution, within two or three years  everything will revert to the previous situation. It is not  enough, it is pointless to change the men alone. I believe that  the new government is being formed around major economic  interests. This amounts to restoring the First Republic.    [Da Rold] On what do you base this pessimistic analysis?    [Miglio] In the first place, a formidable group of economic  tycoons is being reconstituted. This group will gain the  ascendancy as economic recovery gets under way, as soon as  Berlusconi has formed his new government. There are men waiting  for opportunities to invest and speculate. This will be the  driving force behind recovery, which will last six months or a  year perhaps.    Second, it will be mainly the bourgeoisie linked to the  great  economic and financial interests who will benefit from recovery.  The other bourgeoisie, that of small and medium businessmen,  will still have to bear the tax burden of the services to be  paid. In the end, there will be a clash, as Piero Ostellino has  lucidly written. Only as far as the final scenario is concerned  do I disagree with Ostellino: If big business wins, there will  be an authoritarian government; if small business wins, we will  finally have a federal republic and democracy.    [Da Rold] A clash?    [Miglio] A revolutionary stage, which will not be morbid in  nature like the one we witnessed over the last few years.    [Da Rold] Do you believe that Berlusconi is linked to the  great economic tycoons? Do you not agree that the Knight  [Berlusconi nickname] may be able to reconcile the interests of  the two sections of the bourgeoisie?    [Miglio] I think that it is impossible. Not because I wish  Berlusconi to fail, as some people believe, nor because I myself  believe that the Knight has personally chosen those tycoons.  Only, Berlusconi is objectively a prisoner. In order to  govern, he will have to, on the one hand, concede something to  the south; and, on the other, he will come up against men like  [Mediobanca President] Enrico Cuccia, who have ready answers:  We must concentrate this country's wealth, we cannot place our  trust in the small and medium businesses' international  vitality. When I listen to this kind of reasoning, I feel very  disheartened.    [Da Rold] Is there no way a revolutionary upheaval can be  avoided?    [Miglio] Only by establishing a federal Constitution. When  Bossi said "federalism within 90 days," I answered "I am ready."  But now we are getting lost in the petty details of government.  Bossi is wavering, and he is no longer asking for a major  change. Bossi's lieutenants are ready to give up a major change  in favor of taking part in the government. As regards  Berlusconi, he ought to perform an act of courage...    [Da Rold] You do not seem to trust that he is capable of  such  an act of courage.    [Miglio] How can he be? I have already suggested that  Berlusconi is a prisoner of the game. In addition, there is his  movement, abounding in former Christian democrats, who do not  want a liberal democratic party and still believe in going along  with the current. They want a new version of the First Republic.    [Da Rold] What would be needed, then?    [Miglio] A sweeping force. In short: either revolution or a  nasty death -- among other things, in a Europe which would no  longer be federal, but in which the national states would be  reconstituted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jos Klaassen: "European Union's Defense Task: A </F> Little Work on the Side"]    [Text] Does the "European defense identity" remain a  stepchild of NATO, even if at present Washington is ready to  take this "identity" a little seriously? This question is the  only point on the agenda of the NATO summit in Brussels which  was not thought up by the United States.    The main feature of the allies' summit is a new U.S. plan  for  Europe: Partnership for Peace [last three words in English],  together with the Combined Joint Task Forces [last four words in  English]. In addition the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  will be discussed.    At NATO people are not being hard with Europe. "Of course  the European Union and its own security and defense policies  will be applauded in the final communique. A small sentence or  so," a NATO official says.    European security remains primarily a NATO matter. In this  field the European Union and its "military arm," the Western  European Union (WEU), can do a bit of work on the side. The  United States -- them again! -- have even thought up a term to  express this: separable, but not separate [four last words in  English]. Which means that of course Europe can undertake the  odd peace operation without the Americans, but not without their  permission.    At present Manfred Woerner, NATO secretary-general, is  maintaining excellent contacts with Wim van Eekelen, the  secretary-general of the WEU. Woerner values the cooperation,  but he never neglects any opportunity to emphasize that without  NATO, Europe can kiss goodbye to its security.    "NATO is irreplaceable," Woerner says. "It must be clear  that the alliance is the central body where the decisions on the  security of the NATO member states are taken." Van Eekelen is  certainly not in a position to say something along the same  lines. The WEU, the alliance's European pillar, is still in its  infancy.    Nothing has changed since the Cold War. Now, as in the past,  the United States continues to set the tone in Europe when  European security is involved -- in the past with glittering  brochures about the dangers of Soviet Military Power [last three  words in English], nowadays with ideas calling for not entering  into conflict with the Russians, please.    Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia as members  of NATO? Rather not. The Russians are against that. As the  West acknowledges in reality, they have a veto on this question,  although some hesitations can be heard in NATO circles since the  electoral triumph of the Russian right-wing radical Vladimir  Zhirinovsky.    At the NATO summit at the start of next week, to be chaired  by President Clinton, Europe will not shine with ideas  emphasizing the alliance's European pillar. "NATO is and  remains the foundation of our security. It is the only alliance  with functioning command and military structures. It is the  guarantee of peace and stability in Europe," Volker Ruehe, the  German defense minister, writes in the latest issue of NATO  REVIEW. He says that the Americans have the key role in  Europe's future.    In the U.S. plan for Europe, the `European defense identity'  is best expressed in the Combined Joint Task Forces. France is  also showing a great interest in this plan. At stake is the new  task which NATO set itself in Rome in 1991: a peace task,  including activities outside the alliance's treaty area.    On 14 December 1993 Manfred Woerner used it to tempt the  French back into NATO's consultative structure, which is  something very different from the integrated, U.S.-controlled  command structure which France left in 1964. These joint  military actions, Woerner explained, could best be carried out  under the WEU's banner.    "This concept," Woerner said, "greatly facilitates France's  participation in military actions carried out by the alliance."  And, according to Woerner, the `joint action' is the proof that  the United States accepts a European defense identity. His  words did not fall on deaf ears -- in Paris.    The wishes of the WEU are not to be discussed at the NATO  summit. Ideas on the WEU's role are developed in the European  Union, rather than in NATO's Brussels headquarters. Internally  the WEU is busy developing European security policies, but it is  unclear how they will fit in with the policies of the top boss,  NATO. WEU Secretary-General Van Eekelen says that three areas  deserve attention.    In the first place the WEU has formed a Forum for  Consultation for political dialogue between the WEU states and  the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The aim is to  develop mechanisms for consultations on crisis situations.  Conflicts could be prevented this way. The WEU also wants  joint exercises with the East Europeans. The French proposal to  associate Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and perhaps  Slovakia with the WEU is well received by Van Eekelen.    Secondly, in reality the WEU is already involved in peace  operations: The sea blockade of Serbia and Montenegro in the  Adriatic Sea and monitoring the embargo against Serbia on the  Danube. In these cases the WEU is helping NATO. The WEU still  does not have the resources and structures necessary for an  independent intervention.    Finally the WEU wants to strengthen European defense  cooperation. The French-German-Belgian Eurocorps is providing  the first troops. But in military and technological respects,  the WEU is far behind the United States. A European Armament  Agency announced in the Maastricht Treaty is intended to be the  start of a catching-up operation. But it is doubtful whether  the firm political will necessary is present in Europe.    It looks as if the WEU does not have the strength to play a  real role in the new U.S. plan for Europe, which the Western  allies will accept in the coming days under the leadership of  Bill Clinton. For the time being, the European defense identity  will remain a pious footnote.</p>

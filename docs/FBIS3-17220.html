The article printed on Thursday says that materials connected  with the crash were handed over by Azerbaijan to the Iranian  side.    Commenting on this allegation at TRUD's request, the head of  the Armenian mission in Moscow said that the Azeri statement  "can be explained only by political aims". Iranian, Russian and  Armenian commissions are working at the place of the crash, and  they have not drawn any conclusion concerning reasons for the  crash.</p>

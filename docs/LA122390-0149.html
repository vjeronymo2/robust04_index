			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE FRESHNESS OF FIRST IMPRESSIONS;  </P> <P> LANDSCAPE: MEMORY BY MATTHEW STADLER (CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS: $19.95; 301 PP.)  </P> <P> Sometimes life seems to unfold like a prearranged story whose plot we've heard  before we've experienced it. Other times, experience seems to elude or  overwhelm any attempt to pin it down in story or theory, pictures or words.  </P> <P> A writer's first novel often is an attempt to strike a balance between evoking  the freshness of undigested experience and finding a pattern or meaning to give  form to inchoate feeling.  </P> <P> Maxwell Kosegarten, the hero/narrator of Matthew Stadler's first novel, is a  16-year-old boy adrift in a sea of feelings, memories and sensations, who is  attempting to paint a landscape of a scene he remembers and at the same time is  keeping a diary. Max also is facing the break-up of his parents' marriage,  memories of a disastrous earthquake, the threat of a distant war, and the  blossoming of erotic love between himself and a half-Persian boy called Duncan  Taqdir, who has been his closest friend since both boys were 7.  </P> <P> This, then, is a novel about adolescence, a diary of a young man on the verge  of forging his erotic and artistic identity. Indeed, Max seems less concerned  with how to cope with experience than with finding a way to preserve his  perceptions in words or in paint. Entries from Max's diary are interspersed  with sketches of the landscape he is trying to draw from memory.  </P> <P> Apart from the illustrations, however, what distinguishes this first novel from  others treating similar themes is Stadler's decision to set it in the early  years of this century. Thus, Max is keeping his diary between 1914 and 1916, as  echoes of World War I reverberate across an ocean and a continent in the form  of letters from Max's Uncle Maury (an American who joins up as a medic with the  British forces) and in the fascination Max feels for the erotic undercurrents  of war as embodied in the poems of Rupert Brooke.  </P> <P> Looming in the background are Max's memories of the great San Francisco  earthquake, which happened when he was 7. Around him in the present, the city  is staging its mammoth World's Fair, the Panama Pacific International  Exhibition. Max's mother, a charming suffragist who is introducing Max to  Ruskin's technique of landscape drawing, is herself posing for the fair's  statue of Winged Victory. Mr. Taqdir, the father of Max's best friend, is  sculpting her. Max's father, an ornithologist whose interest in nature's freaks  and disasters has been passed on to his son, disapproves of the fair and  everything about it.  </P> <P> One feels somehow that by setting his story in the San Francisco of 1914-1916,  Stadler is trying to provide added context and resonance. But his re-creation  of that time seems inauthentic, the characters and their attitudes as modern as  today. The scene in which the parents announce their impending separation, for  example, has a sound that is distinctly post-1960s:  </P> <P> " 'Your father and I, dearest,' she began again. 'Your father and I have agreed  that it would be healthy for me to explore my feelings for Mr. Taqdir in a less  encumbered atmosphere.' She smiled, as if this were a gift she'd given me.  </P> <P> "I still didn't understand, but couldn't find the words to say so. I looked at  my father and he shrugged a little shrug, nodding his head from side to side  and brushing the crumbs from off his hands.  </P> <P> " 'They're sleeping together, Max,' he said. 'They're lovers. I'd rather not  stick around for it.' Mother wrinkled her brow at him. 'Anyway, it's a  beautiful time of year to be in Bolinas. I can get a lot done up there.' "  </P> <P> Later, when Max and Duncan embark on their love affair, no one, including the  boys themselves, raises an eyebrow. True, the story is set in bohemian San  Francisco among people who consider themselves modern. And in some sense, it  may be fair to say that the suffragists and other "moderns" of that era were  more truly avant-garde than those who followed in their wake.  </P> <P> However, one feels a lack of historical texture in this book; it's not so much  that the author has got things wrong as it is that he seems to lack any sense  of historicity whatsoever. This is a prevalent lack in American fiction (as  Henry James complained long ago), but it's all the more surprising in a novel  that makes such a point of being set in a historical period that is meant (one  suspects) to form a not-too-distant mirror of our own era.  </P> <P> This lack of historicity finds a parallel, surely more than coincidental, in  the shadow of the novel's characters. They are not portrayed as particular  persons shaped by -- and responding to -- particular circumstances, but rather  as figures at the edge of the youthful narrator's consciousness. All of which  is simply to say that "Landscape: Memory" is less a traditional social novel  than a Romantic lyrical novel, a kind of meditation on memory, art and the  nature of subjectivity itself. Stadler's use of the historical setting is an  understandable attempt to impose a kind of form on the hazy vicissitudes of  adolescent emotion, but it is a form that doesn't quite fit.  </P> <P> The strengths of "Landscape: Memory," however, are finally more basic than its  flaws. It's a novel that tries to recover a sense of the freshness of first  impressions and the primal innocence of sexuality (in this case, homosexuality)  by portraying feeling itself, removed from historical, social or psychological  conditioning. The only contingencies in this book are disaster, war and death.  And as depicted here, they are less contingencies than eternal verities.  </P> <P> There's something rather breathtaking, as well as uneasy-making, about the  ambition and naivete of a novel like this one.  </P></p>

This shows that the authorities intend to turn  into legal measures all the decisions concerning the property  rights reform of state-owned enterprises, so as to enable  state-owned enterprises to develop according to the rules of the  market economy, and to incorporate themselves (relying mainly on  the legal person property rights of the board of directors)  together with collective enterprises, joint ventures, and solely  owned enterprises.    It has been learned that this "Company Law" was first  drafted  as early as 1983. However, the draft gave rise to many  controversies and thus was difficult to fulfill. It was only  after the CPC adopted a resolution on the property rights reform  of state-owned enterprises and on shifting the country's economy  into the orbit of the market economy at the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee last year that this  "Company Law," which had remained a draft for as long as 10  years, finally could make a public appearance and be put into  effect.    Although there is a total of more than 1.8 million  state-owned enterprises on the mainland, they are all under one  "boss," that is, the central government. All state-owned  enterprises, large or small, are subject to the jurisdiction of  different government departments or of different governments at  the provincial and city levels. Despite previous efforts to  delegate greater autonomy to the lower levels, make concessions  of profit, and enliven enterprises, no fundamental improvements  have been made to the essence of the mandatory planned economy.  Only by dividing "large-scale state-owned enterprises" into  thousands and thousands of economic units that rely mainly on  independent legal person status and act according to the rules  of the market economy can there be any possibility to set up a  modern enterprise system. The "Company Law" is meant to suit  the needs of such property rights reform.    Under the modern enterprise system, enterprises are clear  about property rights relations and can adopt the system of  registered capital, separate themselves from administrative  organs, and be independent and responsible for their own profits  and losses. By so doing, these enterprises can enjoy the  property rights of a legal person, and can divide, transfer, and  reorganize an enterprise's property rights. Explicit  stipulations have been set out in the "Company Law" on many  issues, including the establishment and organizational structure  of limited-liability companies and joint-stock limited  companies, corporate financial and accounting systems, merger or  division of companies, and the acquisition of bankrupt companies.    According to the stipulations of the "Company Law," a  registered company should have its own shareholders board, a  Board of Directors, and a supervisory committee. All decisions  on major issues should go through collective discussions. For  example, a joint-stock enterprise needs its Board of Directors  to act as a guarantee if it wants to obtain a loan by placing  its total assets in mortgage. At times when controversies  arise, the chairman of the Board of Directors has the power to  rule on the matter and so avoid endless disputes. Candidates  for senior managers will no longer be recommended by enterprise  leaders and appointed by personnel departments; instead, open  placement tests will be given and only the best will be  recruited, thus ensuring that senior posts will not be offered  or accepted privately, and that able personnel will not be left  out in the cold.    The "Company Law" also stipulates that evaluations must be  made on the investment in kind of a registered company, and that  the ownership and operational rights of the company should be  separate. In addition, penalties also have been set out on  law-breakers which will help check the growth of speculative and  renamed companies. As a matter of fact, a large number of  privately run speculative companies have emerged in recent years  which are engaged in falsifying registered capital, investment,  and investment acceptance; in reselling at a profit; as well as  speculation in real estates and stocks through illegal means.  Property rights relations in many renamed companies, which  originally belonged to state-owned enterprises, are unclear, and  their ownership and operational rights are mixed up. As a  result, such companies "use official power when carrying out  commercial activities," and thus can monopolize certain trades  and industries. Some companies collect funds and issue stocks  and bonds in an arbitrary manner, and their organizational  structure and management system are so confused that they need  to undergo a thorough rectification. The stipulations set out  in the "Company Law" regarding the amount paid in by registered  companies and on the evaluation of the assets, debts, and risks  of registered companies will play a significant role in  preventing the emergence of all the above-mentioned malpractices.    According to expert analysis, unlike Russia's corporate  legal  system, which takes to the road of privatization, the corporate  legal system being established on the mainland is aimed at  turning state-owned enterprises into popularly run ones. This  is because after enterprises are incorporated, more than 50  percent of the shares will remain in the hands of the "Share  Holding Committee for State-Owned Assets," and the government  still will be the biggest shareholder. At present, Mainland  China is exploring the "marketization of the socialist economy"  along the road of incorporating state-owned enterprises, and has  avoided the road taken by Russia, which is based on the narrow  sense of privatization. Without doubt, the mainland's practice  of the "Company Law" inevitably will lead to a series of changes  in both the personnel and management systems, and probably will  encounter the obstruction of those with vested interests. This  is because people are used to enjoying authority, and they will  be at a loss or will act defiantly once they foresee the loss of  their authority. Therefore, contradictions are unavoidable.</p>

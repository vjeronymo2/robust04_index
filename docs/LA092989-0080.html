			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA  </P> <P> Theophilus Brown, a Bay Area figurative painter who emerged in the 1950s, has  not been shown in Los Angeles since 1968. In recent untitled paintings his  subjects are idealized industrial scenes and figures in interiors.  </P> <P> In "Untitled (Elevated Freeway)," a startled dog pauses precisely in the middle  of the lower edge of the painting. Behind it is a lavender street with a yellow  divider, the reassuring, salmon-colored bulk of a dumpster and buildings whose  sides are punctuated by the rhythmic repetition of window frames. The title  object in "Untitled (Yellow Boxcar)" is just a small swatch of bright paint in  the middle distance, a place for the eye to travel after hooking up with the  green tanks and buildings casting colored shadows and the pink and turquoise  cement laid out so cleanly in the brilliant, even light.  </P> <P> The small figurative paintings on panel are of studio situations: "Model  Holding Coffee Cup," "Beth Drawing Model." The figures themselves remain  ciphers, forms carefully positioned to stabilize other elements in the  composition, to interrupt the transit of rays of light. The compositions exude  a certain dryness and cautiousness, as if a casual sketch of friends at work  was reworked too many times. An academic pall also hangs over acrylic-on-paper  images of seated figures and charcoal drawings of male and female nudes whose  tight, heavy outlines betray an unmistakable tension. (Koplin Gallery, 8225  Santa Monica Blvd., to Oct. 7.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

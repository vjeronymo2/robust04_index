Ms. Albright was accompanied by  high ranking officials of the National Security Council of the  State and Defence Departments. [passage omitted]    President Berisha stressed that Albania is grateful to the  U.S. for the support that the U.S. Government, institutions and  citizens have given to Albania during this period of time. "We  consider the cooperation with the U.S.A. as very important not  only for the historic relations and the fact that this country  is a main pillar of the freedom and democracy in the world, but  also because we consider the U.S. presence as vital for peace  and stability in our continent, that is not only for the  Albanians but for all the others."    President Berisha expressed his approval to sign the  Partnership For Peace, stressing that he considered it as a  stage of active integration of Albania into the Atlantic  Alliance. "But we shall insist on becoming a NATO member," he  said.    "The creation of the enterprise fund in Albania is a very  good news for the Albanians and it will be a powerful support  for the reform in our country," Mr. Berisha said. He called for  acceleration of procedures for the approval of the bilateral  investments treaty. Mr. Berisha expressed Albanian's resolution  to observe sanctions against Serbia despite the damage it causes  to the Albanian economy. "Any toleration in the embargo would  be a support for the militarist policy of Milosevic," he said.  Mr. Berisha demanded on the basis of the UN Charter  compensation for the losses caused to the Albanian economy by  the embargo regime.    President Berisha pointed out as of great importance for  peace the definition by President Bush and President Clinton in  regard to Kosova, as a red line for the Serbian aggression. A  special role in this direction has been played by the U.S.  troops in Macedonia and the U.S. insistence in the observation  of the UN sanctions against Serbia. Expressing his thanks to  Ms. Albright for her role in the Security Council, for the  resolution which imposed the embargo against Serbia and the call  for the return of the CSCE observers to Kosova, President  Berisha stressed that acceptance of the UN observers in Kosova  is indispensable. He asked that the lifting of the embargo  should be also conditioned with the resolution of the question  of Kosova. "The question of the Albanians in the Balkans is a  key to stability of the peninsula," he said. "The embargo is at  present the only means to force such solutions." President  Berisha discussed with U.S. officials cooperation in the  military field, expressing his will for further promotion in  this aspect. He also called for the support of the U.S.  Government in regard to solution of the problem of Albania's  foreign debt and other projects.    President Berisha conveyed his cordial wishes for President  Clinton and the Deputy President Gore and expressed his desire  to welcome them to Albania.    During the talks, they also dwelt on other bilateral  questions and the situation in the region.</p>

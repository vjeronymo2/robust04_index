			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Economics maestro must now tackle social troubles MR Pierre Beregovoy, France's new prime minister, has until the March 1993 general election to transform the fortunes of the embattled Socialist government. He will have to get to grips with sensitive social problems, requiring the prime minister to extend his skills well beyond the efficient economic management on which he has built his reputation. The main issues include: Unemployment. This has crept up, during the past two years, to 2.88m, or 9.9 per cent of the workforce and well above the European average. It will soon pass the psychologically and politically important 3m level. Some blame Mr Beregovoy's economic polices for this. He said cutting unemployment would be 'the priority' for his government, though he added: 'I will not promise a miracle or a magic solution.' Immigration. This is seen as a factor in the sporadic outbursts of urban violence which fuel demands from the extreme right-wing National Front for a clampdown on disorder. Mr Beregovoy needs to show that the government has an answer, while not upsetting Socialist supporters' conscience over human rights. Environment. Mr Beregovoy will have to woo the two green parties, the Greens and Generation Ecologie, which emerged as potential partners for the government last month when they won a combined 14 per cent of the vote. Yet both waver over whether or not, and at what price, they will support the Socialists. The Greens said yesterday they would not support them. Among the two parties' demands are an end to France's experimental fast-breeder nuclear power programme, a ban on nuclear tests in the south Pacific, a freeze on some motorway projects, and proportional representation in the general election. Any deal with the environmentalists will need to respect Socialist loyalty to France's nuclear energy programme. Corruption. Mr Beregovoy will need to clean up the Socialists' image, tarnished by a police inquiry into corrupt methods of raising party funds and by a misjudged attempt to give an amnesty to some of those involved. Also at stake is the independence of the judiciary, jeopardised by government interference in its investigations of corrupt political funding. Economy. This is the least of Mr Beregovoy's worries. With inflation at 3 per cent and a growth forecast of 2 per cent this year, France is better off than most of its European partners. The slight worry is that Mr Beregovoy appears to be losing some of his old budgetary rigour. Due to lower than expected tax revenues, the budget deficit last year overshot its target by 63 per cent to come out at FFr131.7bn (Pounds 13.6bn). This year, it could exceed FFr150bn, unless the government takes corrective action. Mr Beregovoy will want to curb the deficit to defend the franc, but this might not be politically feasible. Industrial policy. He is unlikely to follow the habit of his predecessor, Mrs Edith Cresson, of interfering whenever a state-owned company seeks a foreign partner, as she did with computer group Bull's links with NEC of Japan and IBM of the US. Also, this market liberal is expected to continue the programme of partial privatisations. France's public deficits must be brought under control and domestic savings encouraged in order to avoid tensions arising from the mounting debt service burden, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, has told President Francois Mitterrand, AP-DJ reports from Paris. In a letter accompanying the Bank of France's annual report, Mr de Larosiere said monetary policy should remain directed at reducing inflation and stabilising the franc inside the European Monetary System. Interest rates should aim to encourage savings 'in an economy that continues to be marked by an excessive dependence on foreign capital'. This was needed to cover the current account deficit and to finance foreign investment.</p>

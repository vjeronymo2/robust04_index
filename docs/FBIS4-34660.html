			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Daniel Victor Sosa] </F>   [Text] Sources close to the negotiations have told  PAGINA/12 that the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] economy  vice ministers have achieved "spectacular" progress in defining  the common external tariff that will become effective for the  four regional partners as of 1995. According to an official,  the six-month deadlock was broken after an agreement was reached  on the discussion of the capital goods issue, the most sensitive  point of the negotiations, and after Brazil raised a "very  flexible" proposal on informatics. Nevertheless, these  optimistic prospects were partially shadowed by an announcement  made by former Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti, the  candidate with the best chances of winning the upcoming  elections in his country. Sanguinetti announced that, if he  regains power, he would ask that the common tariff system be  postponed for four years.    The Economy Ministry hopes that an agreement can be  announced  during the presidential summit slated for 14 and 15 July in  Buenos Aires. The current differences concerning capital goods  are extremely pronounced, as Argentina has scrapped tariffs on  all equipment, irrespective of origin, while Brazil protects its  manufacturers by levying customs duties going as high as 35  percent. During the negotiations, Economy Minister Domingo  Cavallo's team proposed a 12-percent compromise, but the  Brazilians are intent on 16 percent. One negotiator reported  that "a good settlement might be to establish a 14 percent  tariff as a goal to be achieved within a longer period of time,  let us say 2006." The countries would then later have to work  out an agreement on informatics and telecommunications.    Applying the criterion of compensation between the two  leading partners did the trick in reconciling their differences.  A diplomat recalled that "when Argentina reduced the tariff on  the import of equipment to zero, the Brazilians lost the  advantage they had with the preferential tariff. Cavallo then  promised to `indemnify' the injured party. Brazil has now  liberalized the purchase of meat, and the Argentine producers  are now the injured party."    Argentine Commerce and Investment Secretary Carlos Sanchez  discussed the future incorporation of Chile into Mercosur with  his colleagues from Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay: Economic  Policy Secretary Winston Fritsch; Finance Under Secretary Juan  Ignacio Garcia Peluffo; and Integration Vice Minister Ruben  Fadlala respectively. Some 30 officials from the four countries  also participated in this meeting.    An Argentine official said: "If next month, the presidents  announce the coming into force of a free trade zone (trade  liberalization between the four partners) and a customs union  (including a common external tariff) as of 1 January 1995, we  will then have the rest of the year to negotiate with the other  Latin American Integration Association member countries.    Another two key subjects discussed at the meeting included  the system of origin of goods (the way to prevent smuggling due  to the difference in tariffs, which will persist in several  sectors for more than a decade), and the duty-free zones.    Commenting on his position on Mercosur, which is supported  by  the Chamber of Industry of Uruguay, Sanguinetti said "we have to  be realistic and postpone this transition stage for another four  years," as the four member countries "are not in a position to  reach agreement on a common external tariff at present."</p>

			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Electric vehicles 'to boost copper demand' COPPER DEMAND will be boosted by increasing numbers of electrically-powered, non-polluting vehicles being developed at present in North America, Europe and Japan, according to a new study by Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell natural resources group. 'Not only will such vehicles require considerably more wiring than the equivalent vehicle driven by an internal combustion engine (reports suggest they will need nearly twice as much copper) but such a development would also require a substantial increase in the load-carrying capacity of urban distribution systems,' the authors, Ms Karen Norton and Mr Angus MacMillan, point out. They dismiss the idea that copper is a metal in the mature phase of its many applications and, compared with an annual demand rate growth in the world outside the former east European countries of 1.4 per cent in the years between 1973 and 1990, they suggest demand will increase by 2 per cent or even 2.5 per cent a year during the present decade. Growth will be underpinned by the non-mature economies where demand grew at an annual 7 per cent between 1979 and 1991. By then they accounted for 20.7 per cent of western copper consumption compared with 10.9 per cent at the end of the 1970s. The study also points out that copper is price inelastic and says 'the high prices which have prevailed since 1987 have done little to discourage the metal's use. In many end-uses substitution is simply not practicable, while in others the price of copper is a minor consideration in the total cost of production'. On the production side of the equation, Billiton does not support the idea that refined copper output will be constrained by lack of smelting capacity. The study suggests low-cost, solvent-extraction, electrowinning (SX-EW) capacity, which does away with the need for a smelter, will account for 18 per cent of copper supply by the year 2000 compared with 10 per cent in 1990. Looking at the short-term prospects for the metal, Ms Norton and Mr MacMillan suggest that there will be a copper supply surplus this year of about 125,000 tonnes compared with a deficit of 132,000 tonnes last year. The surplus will increase to 350,000 tonnes in 1993 before the market returns to a deficit - of 100,000 tonnes - in 1994. They suggest copper is the most 'overvalued' metal but they do not expect the price to fall anywhere near the 70 cents a lb level that would force production cuts. Copper's price is forecast to average 90 cents a lb next year compared with about Dollars 1.04 so far in 1992.

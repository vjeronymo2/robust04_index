Police Commissioner Rafi Peled told Qol  Yisra'el that when the holiday ends, the security forces will  reassess the situation. But in the meantime, he said, the  closure has calmed things down in the territories. He said that  when it is lifted, the security situation is expected to get  worse, particularly in Jerusalem.</p>

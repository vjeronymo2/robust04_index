			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Sali Berisha by unidentified Radio </F> Deutsche Welle correspondent on 23 April; place not given: "Is  Greece a Compass for Serbian Policy?"]    [Text] [Correspondent] What is your attitude toward the  proposal by the Serbian President Milosevic in Romania about the  creation of a confederation of Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania,  Albania, and so on?    [Berisha] The Serbian president would have done much better,  I think, if he had given peace and stability to the Bosnian  people and had given orders to the Karadzic-type criminals to  stop bombarding Gorazde and obey the will of the EC and the  norms regulating peace and good relations among countries. That  would have been a valuable contribution by him to the solution  of the conflict that was started by Belgrade and is still being  ferociously backed by it. There can be no way of establishing  any federation or confederation as long as Serbian aggression is  creating thousands of victims. It is a mere farce, a phoney  proposal reflecting Serbia's integrationist plans tantamount to  the Greater Serbia idea, aggression, and conflict in the Balkans.    [Correspondent] Neither Montenegro, Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], or Kosova were  mentioned at all in Milosevic's draft constitutions. What does  this augur for the Albanian territories?    [Berisha] It shows that President Milosevic, in accordance  with the Memorandum of the (Serbian) Academy of Sciences [on the  formation of a Greater Serbia], is going out of his way to draw  all these territories into a Greater Serbia. There is no doubt  that he has come up with this proposal just to be able to make  Serbia the dominant factor and ensure its hegemony over the  Balkans. However, I must stress here that the idea of a Greater  Serbia and its domination over the Balkans can never bring  stability to the region and, historically speaking, it is an  erroneous and totally groundless idea. The Balkans can never be  given stability by those who set it on fire. It would be absurd  to claim that the Balkans could be dominated by a population  that accounts for no more than 10 percent of the entire  population of the region. I am of the opinion that Serbia must  once and for all renounce its policy of aggression and war, and  naturally after this there must be a policy of cooperation  throughout the Balkan peninsula.    [Correspondent] What would you say about President Clinton's  proposal, and what would be your comment on NATO's steps and  military intervention against Serbia?    [Berisha] I have stressed in the past, and I would like to  stress again, that the restoration of NATO's credibility is of  tremendous importance to the solution of this conflict that has  swept over the region and to the prevention of other conflicts  in the Balkans. I have welcomed all President Clinton's  proposals and I hope that the Atlantic union and NATO will put  them into practice. It is impermissible that a gang of bandits  and criminals with 30 or 50 tanks should humiliate universal  principles and the international community, thus causing the  greatest human slaughter that Europe has witnessed since World  War II.    [Correspondent] What is your opinion on Milosevic's proposal  for dialogue...    [Berisha] Albania has already expressed its view on this  matter: It is and always will be in favor of dialogue and  negotiations. The only way to resolve problems is to recognize  realities and evaluate them, not ignore them. I am certain that  a dialogue of this kind between Milosevic and Rugova, under the  auspices of a third party, would lead to the solution of the  Kosova issue.    [Correspondent] What are the prospects for Albania's  relations with Greece in the wake of the border incident?    [Berisha] It is rather difficult to define the prospects for  our relations with Greece, because unfortunately Greece through  its actions has turned into a compass, as it were, for the  aggressive Serbian policy in the Balkans. So, while there is  war going on in the north and a policy in the south that favours  aggression and creates tensions in the Balkans, our relations  with Greece remain tense. However, I would like to express  Albania's determination to overcome, through dialogue with  Greece, the great problems created in the Peshkopia area. There  are many plans under way proportionately to expand the number of  our two countries' diplomats, and these plans will be discussed  as early as 3 May, when our two foreign ministers will meet in  Geneva. We intend to make our contribution to the success of  this meeting and the reduction of tensions in the southern  Balkans, but the truth is that Greece is deeply affected by  chauvinism.</p>

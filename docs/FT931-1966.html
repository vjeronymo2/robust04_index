			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Anheuser-Busch buys into Mexico ANHEUSER-BUSCH, the giant American brewer has agreed to buy 18 per cent of Grupo Modelo, Mexico's largest brewer, for about Dollars 477m. The deal would be one of the largest foreign equity investments in Mexico and the first in the tightly-controlled beer market. Mr Juan Sanchez Navarro, vice-president of Modelo, said the joint venture 'is an example of strategic associations that will be increasingly seen in other sectors' as Mexican businesses gear up for the implications of free trade in North America. Modelo's only rival in Mexico, Femsa, is also looking for a foreign partner in its soft drink and beer businesses. The terms are that Anheuser-Busch will buy a 10 per cent stake in Grupo Modelo and 10 per cent in its fully-owned subsidiary Diblo, giving it an effective 17.7 per cent of the Modelo Group. After Anheuser acquires its stake, the Grupo Modelo will seek a listing on the Mexican stock market. It plans to issue 13 per cent of its capital, split equally between Mexican and international markets, for which it hopes to get around Dollars 270m. Modelo controls 51 per cent of Mexico's beer market and makes Mexico's best-selling international beer, Corona. It has sales of around Dollars 1.5bn and is the tenth biggest brewer in the world. Exports - to 56 countries - are worth Dollars 150m. Anheuser has an option to increase its stake to 35 per cent. It will take three seats on Modelo's board of directors.</p>

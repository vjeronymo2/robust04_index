It was stated that the committee had reliable  information that Dzakula had been brought before the district  court in Glina [republic of Serbian Krajina] only yesterday and  that criminal proceedings had been instituted against him.  According to the same information, signs of torture were visible  on Dzakula, and he had not been provided with medical or legal  aid. The committee believes that this news should be confirmed  officially and that the Government of Serbia should explain why  Dzakula has been deprived of freedom, on whose orders he was  arrested, and to which ministry in Serbia he was handed over.    In the continuation of the news conference, it was stated  that the committee had also turned to the official bodies and  institutions of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia, but that there had been no response. Also, it was  proposed that the case be handed over to the authorities of the  civilian sector of the United Nations in charge of the republic  of Serbian Krajina zones.    It is important, as regards the Dzakula case, to hear from  the service that several days ago issued a communique stating  that Dzakula had been brought to Glina, because, as the  committee claims, this was not true, since Dzakula was brought  before the district court in Glina only the day before  yesterday. The committee believes that there is a pressing need  to provide legal protection to all citizens at this moment. The  country has entered a phase of unrestrained terror, it was  concluded at yesterday's news conference on the Dzakula case.</p>

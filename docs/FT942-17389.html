			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / NUT conference paves way for strike action The National Union of Teachers, the UK's largest teachers' union, yesterday opened the way for strikes against a string of government education policies. Mr Doug McAvoy, the NUT's general secretary, attempted to play down prospects of the votes at the union's annual conference leading to widespread classroom disruption. He was responding to strong criticism of the conference decisions from ministers and rival trade unions. The NUT on Sunday isolated itself from the other unions by pressing ahead with plans for an indefinite boycott of the government's national curriculum tests. During the conference, which started in Scarborough on Saturday and ends today, leftwing delegates committed the union to strike plans over rising class sizes, cuts in grants to schools with a high number of ethnic minority children and new contracts for teachers in sixth-form colleges. The NUT conference is traditionally militant, but this year's decisions mark a significant shift in power towards the left. Members have also reserved the right to strike over pupil tests, which will be boycotted indefinitely, and to refuse to co-operate with 'anti-trade union legislation'. However, a motion calling for strike plans in support of a flat-rate Pounds 3,000 pay increase was defeated in a rare success for the moderate executive. The leaders of the rival teachers' unions have distanced themselves from the NUT. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general-secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said: 'What's going on at the NUT conference doesn't represent the majority view of the profession.' Mr McAvoy claimed there would be no widespread disruption. Any school wishing to take industrial action would need to obtain a two-thirds majority of its members in a ballot and then seek approval, both from the union's local division and the action committee of the national executive which is dominated by moderates. Many delegates had voted in line with factions at the conference, but he predicted they would not persuade teachers to take prolonged strike action, which would be needed to force concessions from the government. Mr John Patten, education secretary, said he was 'really very saddened'. 'I think parents will be frankly bewildered that just when standards are beginning to improve in this country we suddenly seem to be back in the 1960s, with threats of one-day strikes right in the middle of the A-level period,' he added. Mr Tony Lloyd, shadow education minister, said Mr Patten should resolve the crisis by calling in all the teachers' unions to hammer things out. 'These tests still have very little value for the pupils involved. They are all about saving John Patten's face,' Mr Lloyd told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: 'It would have been very much more sensible for the NUT to co-operate with the five other teacher unions.'

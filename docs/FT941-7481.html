			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Jyske Bank plans to resume payouts Jyske Bank, Denmark's fourth largest bank, is planning to pay a dividend of DKr8 per share for 1993 after reporting a net profit of DKr443m (Dollars 65.73m) compared with a 1992 loss of DKr913m. No dividend was paid for 1992. Financial income increased strongly to DKr2.95bn from DKr1.82bn, boosted by last year's increase in the value of bonds and shares. Costs were stable at DKr1.46bn, while bad loss provisions were cut to DKr844m from DKr1.26bn. Operating profit, before extraordinary costs of DKr131m, was DKr584m, a return of 15.6 per cent on equity, against a 1992 loss of DKr916m. The bank broke new ground for disclosure by Danish banks by publishing the accumulated sum of its provisions. This amounted to DKr1.7bn, or 4.56 per cent of loans and guarantees, while non-performing credits were DKr1.53bn, or 4.10 per cent of loans and guarantees. The balance sheet total was DKr56bn at the end of last year and capital adequacy ratio 10.9 per cent, including an 8.1 per cent tier 1 ratio.</p>

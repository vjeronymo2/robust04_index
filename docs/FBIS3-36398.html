			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko at the Supreme </F> Council session in Kiev -- live]    [Excerpts] Esteemed deputies, esteemed president, esteemed  Ivan Stepanovych. You understand that the question or the whole  problem of nuclear weapons that are located in Ukraine remains,  for the moment, the most important problem. I would like to  begin by saying that after the Supreme Council's ratification of  START I, neither Russia nor the United States recognized the act  of ratification as though it had taken place. Obviously, this  is why we were forced to deal with an extraordinary situation  and forced to resolve, in a short period of time, exceptionally  complex issues. I would like to say that the situation  developed in a very complicated way. Since the first days of  Ukraine's independence we had never felt such intense  international pressure, the main aim of which was to isolate us  as quickly and as broadly as possible internationally. The main  thing that is almost completely unacceptable and was  unacceptable and which provoked the toughest reaction was the  refusal by Ukraine to accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty [NPT]. On this issue I would like to assure you that  there is an absolute consensus by CSCE member countries. The  treaty should be universal and undoubtedly extended for an  unspecified period. We have been given to understand that by  refusing to accede to the NPT, Ukraine is joining a group of  states that do not have a very high rating in the world and many  of the world's democratic countries are talking about this. The  second thing is that doubt was cast on the very fact that  Ukraine would ratify the START treaty and a rumor was spread  that Ukraine was reviewing its policy of attaining nonnuclear  status as set out in its basic foreign policy documents.  Obviously great harm was inflicted on Ukraine's international  image. I will be frank. To achieve glory as an unreliable  international partner that fails to abide by its promises --  moreover a country that is only two years old -- is a very  disadvantageous and I would even say almost hopeless situation.  To remain without support in the world community, even if one  thinks one is right, is a losing game. You do not have to go  far for examples.    I would like to note separately that President Leonid  Makarovych Kravchuk's position on this, which he announced in a  speech soon after the ratification of the START treaty, is  exceptionally important. It was really an important political  and diplomatic step. Thanks to it we managed to avoid, without  any exaggeration, serious complications. Such a position left  the doors open for us for contacts and for future work. How did  our foreign policy department act under these conditions? I  would like to tell you, esteemed people's deputies, that  practically in the first hours following the ratification of the  START treaty, the ministry began work on explaining the content  of the Supreme Council's resolutions and the motives that caused  it to raise the reservations at the time of ratification.  [passage omitted]    You recall the phrase spoken by our president, Leonid  Makarovych: It is the first time that I experienced the  difficult situation that Ukraine was fated to endure at the  beginning of December 1993. We did not broadcast this widely.  We could not do this because we understood that the nation  might not be able to withstand all this. We dealt with this and  worked on it calmly and took it to its conclusion. Esteemed  deputies, international isolation -- and I would like to place  particular emphasize on this -- creates such an attitude in the  world toward an isolated country that any kind of forced methods  against it are received as a naturally forced reaction to its  behavior. As an example, I would like to remind you of the  course of events on the eve of the war in the Persian Gulf.  Then the United States and its allies made use of the full  isolation of Iraq almost six months before the military  operation to find support for actions throughout the entire  world community. It was a great mistake not to take into  account Russia's reactions on the possible transformation of  Ukraine into a nuclear state. You are aware that such an option  is not only unacceptable to the political and military  leadership of that country but also plays the role of a popular  slogan for those like one of the winners in the recent elections  who support the transformation of Ukraine into a new Russian  province [huberniya]. In this connection I would like to return  to the key issues for our security and future as an independent  state, the value of nuclear weapons as a restraining factor.  Foreign experts and the overwhelming majority of those who  understand these things tell us that the only weapon capable of  halting aggression is the one that can be put to real use by  inflicting unacceptable harm on the aggressor. Not only us, but  all nuclear states know that Ukraine does not have operational  control over the nuclear weapons located on our territory.  [passage omitted]    I would also like to dwell on safeguarding Ukraine's  interests and above all the national security of our state. It  seems that the state of our economy clearly underlines an  obvious and undeniable truth or thesis that is only too obvious  today: that the main component of any state's security is a  healthy economy and sociopolitical stability in society. If  this does not exist, no kind of nuclear weapon, even if it is  controlled and reliable, will help. The example of the former  USSR serves as an example, and Leonid Makarovych spoke about  this. We must consider whether we can preserve independence  achieved at this price if, having found ourselves in isolation  and without friends in the world, we encounter a situation where  supplies of energy sources and in particular of nuclear fuel,  are completely cut off and every kind of economic cooperation is  frozen. Could we survive for long? [passage omitted]    We will be frank, esteemed deputies. It is a serious and  difficult political decision but I am certain that it is the  only one possible under the present conditions. It is about  preserving not only Ukraine's positive image in international  relations but about the very survival of our state. Thank you  for your attention.</p>

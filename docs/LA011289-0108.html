			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRITER SADLER OBJECT OF FAMILY'S SEARCH  </P> <P> Singer-author Barry Sadler, who wrote the No. 1 hit "Ballad of the Green  Berets," left a hospital where he was being treated for brain damage and is  believed to be staying with friends, a lawyer said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Sadler's wife, Lavona Ruth Sadler, and mother claim he is incompetent and  should be place under guardianship. His 24-year-old son on Tuesday was named  temporary guardian.  </P> <P> Sadler, 48, was shot in the head during a robbery attempt at his home in  Guatemala City in September and lost 30% of his brain, said Hal Hardin, an  attorney for Sadler's wife.  </P> <P> "Sometimes he's lucid, sometimes he's not. Sometimes he's conversant, sometimes  he's no," Hardin said, adding that Sadler is partially paralyzed.  </P> <P> Sadler was discharged Sunday night from a Veterans Administration Hospital in  Cleveland and was reported missing by his family.  </P></p>

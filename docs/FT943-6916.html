			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / British Gas takes wraps off Morecambe terminal British Gas yesterday unveiled one of the main pieces of the costly infrastructure needed to bring Britain's new west coast energy reserves to market. The Pounds 600m North Morecambe project, the UK's newest natural gas terminal, will supply 4 per cent of the country's peak winter demand for natural gas. The terminal, outside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, will be Europe's most complex gas processing centre. It will be opened officially in October but is already receiving gas from a single production platform about 25 miles off the Lancashire coast. The facility was built for the North Morecambe field but could be expanded to take gas from other fields which may be discovered. The North Morecambe field is seen by many oil companies as increasingly attractive for exploration. At the peak of activity up to 2,000 workers were employed to build the terminal, one of the country's largest onshore energy projects. Hundreds were still on site yesterday, although the permanent workforce will total just 60. The small size of the workforce reflects the success of UK oil and gas companies in cutting the cost of large-scale energy projects. British Gas's initial plan in 1980 envisaged an offshore platform two-thirds the size of that on the nearby South Morecambe gas field, which has a crew of 176. But the final development plan, approved in 1990, called for the installation of what company officials say is the world's largest fully automated platform. It will not normally be manned, and will require only a weekly maintenance visit from a 10-man team. Officials say the design change was only partly due to technical advances. As the company's UK gas monopoly was eroded competitive pressures forced engineers to produce more cost-effective ideas. The platform has no facilities for processing the raw gas. Nor does it have its own power supply. Electricity is sent from shore via an undersea cable. Mr David Lane, project manager, said the emphasis on cost reductions meant that although the facilities were 'at the edge of technology, it is all known and proven technology'.</p>

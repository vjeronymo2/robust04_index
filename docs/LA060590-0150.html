			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: GENATRON ACQUIRES 60% OF START-UP IN STOCK SWAP  </P> <P> Fullerton-based Genatron Inc., a start-up company that is developing a line of  pollution-free motors and generators, has acquired 60% of another fledgling  company, Clean Air Resins Inc. of Santa Ana, in a stock swap. The value of the  deal, which gives Genatron a two-year option on the remaining 40% of Clean Air  Resins shares, was not disclosed.  </P> <P> Clean Air Resins has developed a line of water-based resins for use in paints,  gels, synthetic foam, coatings and other products. New clean-air rules,  especially in Southern California, are expected to stimulate the development of  a market for such products as a replacement for smog-causing oil-based resins.  </P> <P> Rick Marzicola, vice president of Genatron, said the deal is expected to close  within 30 days. He said that Clean Air Resins is currently negotiating an  agreement with a subcontractor to manufacture the products and that Genatron  needs additional financing to begin building its engines.  </P></p>

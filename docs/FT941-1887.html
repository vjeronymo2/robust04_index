			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: France allocates 10% of UAP to core shareholders The French government plans within the next few days to launch a tender offer for noyaux durs, or hard core shareholders, to invest in Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurance group that is due to be privatised later this year. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, yesterday said that 10 per cent of UAP, which is France's biggest insurer, was to be allocated to long-term investors. The announcement of the tender offer will mark the first step towards the sale of the government's 50 per cent stake in UAP. The holding is valued at between FFr25bn and FFr28bn (Dollars 4.2bn-Dollars 4.7bn). The appointment of noyaux durs, or long-term investors that are intended to forge strategic links with a company and to protect it against hostile takeover bids, is a standard part of the French privatisation process. UAP is the largest noyau dur in France, as the country's leading institutional investor with a warren of shareholdings across the corporate sector. Some of these companies are now expected to volunteer to become noyaux durs in UAP. However, Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the recently privatised French bank that has been UAP's main financial partner, will reduce its stake to 15 per cent from 19 per cent following the privatisation. Suez, the French holding company, and Winterthur, the Swiss insurer with which UAP has a cross-shareholding, will retain their existing investments. Mr Alphandery yesterday confirmed that UAP would be allowed to raise capital as part of the privatisation. Mr Jacques Friedmann, UAP's chairman, has made no secret of his hopes of staging a capital increase to finance the group's international expansion. However, the size of the increase has not been decided. The economy minister described UAP as 'a business in sound financial shape'. UAP on Monday announced an increase in net profits of 31.8 per cent to FFr1.42bn in 1993 from FFr1.08bn in 1992. The group, which reported peak profits of FFr4.2bn in 1990, hopes to continue its recovery. See Observer</p>

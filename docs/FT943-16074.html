			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Alcatel chief hits at probe into use of company funds Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecoms and engineering group, yesterday described as unfounded an investigation into alleged payment irregularities and called for a stock exchange inquiry into how the news of his detention on Monday was released. The Alcatel chairman, who was freed from police custody early yesterday morning on bail of FFr1m (Pounds 120,000), has been formally placed under investigation for alleged irregularities in payments for work at his private residence. But he received support from senior officials, including Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister. 'I find it distressing that the image of a company with tens of thousands of employees can be tarnished in this way,' Mr Longuet told French radio. He said the reputation of the company and other French exporters could be damaged by the investigation and expressed confidence in the Alcatel chief, who, he said, had put France among the leaders in the international energy, telecommunications and railway industries. The investigation into Mr Suard is the latest blow to the French business establishment in the past few months. In May, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of Groupe Schneider, the electrical engineering group, was arrested in Belgium and detained for 12 days in connection with a fraud investigation. Allegations of corruption at several French companies by Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a prosecutor-turned-politician, have exacerbated business concerns of an increase in judicial investigations into French companies. According to Mr Guy Danet, Mr Suard's lawyer, the investigations into the Alcatel chairman are focusing on some FFr700,000 of work done at his private properties. About FFr400,000 relates to personal work, including the refitting of bathrooms and a kitchen. The investigating judge claims that Mr Suard had underpaid for the work, performed by suppliers of the group, a claim rejected by the Alcatel chairman. The investigation is also examining payments for FFr300,000 relating to security work at Mr Suard's properties, which was paid for by Alcatel. The company says all the work, which totalled FFr3.2m, was justified by professional considerations and in line with government guidelines on security measures following the assassination in 1986 of Mr Georges Besse, the former head of Renault. Mr Suard dismissed the probe as 'banal', but expressed fears that it could hurt the reputation of Alcatel on international markets. He was also concerned about how news of his detention on Monday had spread to the financial markets and called for an inquiry by the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French stock exchange watchdog. Mr Suard's detention prompted a fall in Alcatel's shares, which lost more than 8.3 per cent on Monday. Yesterday the shares regained much of the loss, closing up 5.7 per cent at FFr572.

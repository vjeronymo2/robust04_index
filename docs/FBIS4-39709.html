			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolai Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Former chairman of the Belarusian parliament  Stanislav Shushkevich promised that if he were elected  president, the country would overcome the crisis in early 1995  and an economic recovery would start in 1996.    His electoral platform says that he would initiate reforms,  which should cut the monthly inflation rate to 7 to 10 percent  against the present over 40 percent.    Under a plan his team have developed, within six months the  average citizen would earn $100 to $150 a month against the  present $3.    Shushkevich and his supporters want to create as soon as  possible a private sector and to improve the management of the  state sector. The platform says that the private sector would  put the economy on its feet, create competition, lead to a  restructuring and modernization, make the economy work for the  people and create jobs.    Shushkevich promised he would use to the maximal advantage  of  the Republic's geographical position of a bridge between Russia  and Western Europe, Ukraine, and the Baltic countries. He  thinks that it is necessary to carry out a national program of  encouraging the export that would facilitate transformation of  the traditional markets in CIS member nation into those where  international competition is welcome.    Once he became president, Shushkevich would reduce the  import  of fuels and grain and use customs tariffs to encourage the  import of technologies and equipment.    The platform offers free choice between the kinds of land  ownership such as collective farms, state farms, individual  farms, cooperatives and farm product processing society. It  says that mechanisms had to be developed under which state-owned  land would be rented and efficiently operating collectives or  citizens could take it over from bankrupts. Only a land tax  would be levied, eventually. The platform calls for  demonopolization and privatization of the agrarian service and  the processing industry with the participation of agricultural  producers in the process.    Shushkevich also intends to change radically the budgetary  and taxation policy. He is convinced that heavy taxes are the  outcome of government overspending. He would have the state  expenses cut by one third but would maintain if not increase the  expenses for education, science, culture, public health, and  elimination of the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.    Shushkevich would also increase the real estate tax, transit  tariffs and duties on import of luxury goods and resolve the  payment crisis by introduction of promissory notes which would  become securities.    The reforms would enable the private owner to become the  engine of the economic growth and stability. Thousands of  small- and medium-size companies engaged in production of  foodstuffs and consumer goods would spring to existence within a  year, the platform argues. It expects the economic freedom to  trigger an investment and construction boom in the manufacturing  industries. New roads and communication lines as well as  cottages would be built. As a result, the building material  industry would flourish. The investment policy and the  possibility to use the privatization money locally would step up  business activities in every part of Belarus. The tax and  subsidy reduction would enable redistribution of the cash in  favor of the consumers with a significant increase of grants,  pensions and wages concurrently with production increase.    Shushkevich promised he would immediately stop inflation and  set up a working financing system using a convertible currency.  If Russia did not agree to an equitable merger of the monetary  system, Belarus would introduce its own currency. A strong  currency would put a stop on the price rises, provide stability  and confidence in the future.</p>

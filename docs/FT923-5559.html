			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Wine: Auction prices fall / Consider a year in the wine auction rooms ALTHOUGH the 1991-92 season was a difficult one in the London wine auction rooms, Christie's total net turnover, without buyer's premium, of Pounds 8.16m was just a little down on the previous year's Pounds 8.24m. Sotheby's Pounds 2.3m marked some recovery from its all-time low of Pounds 1.7m. Christie's benefited from its long-established overseas auction programme. The wine always most prominent in the catalogues is claret, and the classed growths attract the most attention. Their prices peaked in 1990, and the average highest successful bids this year, listed in the adjoining tables (taken from Christie's King St sales, with a few higher results from Sotheby's) show that the first growths have all fallen since then. Petrus has been excluded. Although its prices have mostly dropped, they are on such a special level as to distort the general picture. Some unusually high classed-growth figures in Christie's sale in March of Robert Maxwell's cellar have also been omitted as a personality factor played a part in the results. The most sought-after other classed growths have generally declined also, save occasionally for the '82s, '83s, and '85s that normally would be expected to rise much more as their development and drinkability increases. Moreover, comparisons on all the tables here must take into account inflation of 10 per cent since the beginning of 1990. These falls are reflected in Christie's drop in their claret auction turnover. With only seven sales compared with nine in the previous year, their receipts without premium totalled Pounds 1.35m as against Pounds 1.76m. A 15 per cent fall in the number of lots offered was accompanied by a decline in the average price per sold lot: from Pounds 435 to Pounds 398 - and from Pounds 465 in 1989/90. The reduction in the number of lots demonstrated potential vendors' reluctance to sell because of the market's depressed state. The other vintage wine commonly bought on opening offer for long keeping or investment is vintage port, and the table shows their weakness in price now, particularly for the celebrated '63s. Much less vintage port was offered for sale than normally. Is this because in the present economic climate post-prandial port is a luxury that can be dispensed with, or is it a longer-term factor that less than ever is being drunk outside corporate bodies? Certainly the US market for mature vintages has been cut, as for older leading clarets and rarities for which in good times there is an important market. Both auctioneers are reasonably confident for the coming season, but prices are unlikely to rise, as the best results are usually obtained in the first half of the year, and this year's best prices were mostly paid in earlier sales. What is certain is that those consumers prepared to take advantage of existing price levels should secure some excellent bargains.  ---------------------------------------         AVERAGE HIGHEST AUCTION      PRICE IN POUNDS S PER DOZEN           IN 1990 AND 1992         FIRST-GROWTH CLARETS  --------------------------------------- Vintage         1990      *1992  --------------------------------------- 1961           3,567      2,750 1970             865        803 1975             622        562 1978             623        540 1982             908        707 1983             385        335 1985             402        388 1986           **443        425  --------------------------------------- Cheval-Blanc; Haut-Brion; Lafite; Latour; Margaux; Mouton-Rothschild  ---------------------------------------           SECOND AND OTHER        CLASSED-GROWTH CLARETS  --------------------------------------- Vintage         1990      *1992  --------------------------------------- 1961           1,560      1,460 1970             497        435 1975             284        249 1978             297        259 1982             342        360 1983             192        194 1985             187        193 1986           **226        210  --------------------------------------- Beychevelle; Cos d'Estournel; Ducru-Beaucaillou; Grand Larose; Leoville-Las-Cases; Lynch-Bages; La Mission-Haut-Brion; Palmer; Pichon-Lalande  ---------------------------------------              VINTAGE PORT  --------------------------------------- Vintage         1990      *1992 1963             493        391 1970             256        254 1977             244        261 1983             143        129 1985             157        141  --------------------------------------- *Jan-July 1992 ** 1991.

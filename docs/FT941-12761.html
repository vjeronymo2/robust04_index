			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Directors of Independent to consider rival bids The battle for the future of The Independent gets under way in earnest today as directors meet to consider two rival bids. Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers group of Ireland yesterday formally proposed investing up to Pounds 32m in Newspaper Publishing, the company that owns The Independent and The Independent on Sunday. Under the proposed deal, the Irish group would provide Pounds 21m in new money for the loss-making British newspaper group in the form of convertible loan stock. This stock would convert into ordinary shares in Newspaper Publishing at Pounds 3 a share which would give Mr O'Reilly's company a maximum of 24.99 per cent of Newspaper Publishing. In addition, the Irish group would make a separate offer for up to 20 per cent of the existing shares at Pounds 2.50 a share. An offer was also submitted yesterday from the consortium put together by the two main existing shareholders, the continental European newspaper groups El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica. The consortium includes Mirror Group Newspapers and Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of The Independent. It proposes to buy out the 52 per cent of Newspaper Publishing it does not already own. El Pais and La Repubblica would hold 50.2 per cent, MGN 40 per cent, and the founders the rest. The offer was in the range of Pounds 2.40 and Pounds 2.80 a share. To make any headway, the Irish proposal will need the support of at least some of the members of the consortium. The Daily Telegraph reported today that its publisher, The Telegraph, was still interested in The Independent. Mr Dan Colson, Telegraph vice-chairman, said the Newspaper Publishing board was 'aware of our proposal'.</p>

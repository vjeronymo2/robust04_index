			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Telegraph to hold on to Canadian stake The directors of The Telegraph group, publishers of the Daily Telegraph have decided to hold on to a 9.3 per cent stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper group. Hollinger, Mr Conrad Black's main corporate vehicle, which owns 68 per cent of The Telegraph, has a direct 9.3 per cent share of Southam as well as the Telegraph's matching stake. The independent directors of The Telegraph had the right to require Hollinger to buy back its Southam stake at the original purchase price of CDollars 18.10 (Pounds 9.20) a share. The closing price of Southam on March 8 was CDollars 18.75. The two-week repurchase option following the announcement of Southam's 1993 results has now lapsed. Last month, the Telegraph lifted profits by 36 per cent to Pounds 60.2m helped by overseas earnings and the sale of a stake in Trinity International. Nearly 20 per cent of The Telegraph's pre-tax profits come from outside the UK.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- Taiwan's inflation rate  reached 3.4 percent (annual rate) in the first quarter of this  year, approaching the government-set 3.5 percent ceiling, a  cabinet-level agency reported Wednesday.    The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics  (DGBAS) said the relatively high inflation during the  January-March period mainly resulted from substantial price  hikes in February fueled by a pre-lunar new year buying spree.    Consumer prices declined slightly in March, the directorate  said. The consumer price index (CPI), which measures price  changes from 1991 when the index was 100, stood at 110.02 last  month, down 0.2 percent from February, the agency noted.    It attributed the decline mainly to drops in clothing and  floral prices as well as service fees following the end of the  lunar new year holidays.    Compared with March 1993, the annual inflation rate was 3.39  percent, DGBAS officials said. The rise was attributed to a  6.23 percent hike in education and entertainment bills, a 4.92  percent surge in housing rents and baby-sitting charges, a 3.03  percent increase in food prices and a 2.12 percent advance in  medical bills, the officials said.    Meanwhile, wholesale prices and import prices also rose in  March, up 0.37 percent and 2.19 percent from the year-earlier  levels because of a slight depreciation of the new taiwan dollar  against the U.S. greenback.    The export price index, however, declined 0.37 percent in  March when compared with the year before, according to DGBAS  tallies.    For the January-March period, wholesale and import prices  edged up 1.11 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively, from  year-earlier levels, while export prices dropped by an average  of 1.54 percent.</p>

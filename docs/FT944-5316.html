			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Arts: On your own rollercoaster - Video Crash in an aeroplane. Be chased by dinosaurs. Escape from a computer laboratory with a deadly virus in your brain. Spend seven hours with Adolf Hitler. It is wonderful the things you can now do in your own living room. In the age of video you can also do them at your own whim and in your own time, not at the dictates of TV schedulers. I listened to a radio discussion recently about the mental passivity of screen viewing versus the relative act-ivity of reading. But can we accept this argument any longer? Because of the outrageous spectacles unfolding daily in our own homes, and our own role as accomplices with remote controls and interactive touchpads, are we bidding farewell to the age of the couch potato? Jurassic Park (CIC) has now growled onto video, and every child who has seen it on the large screen will be seeing it again on the small. Why? Because those children can make now their own movie out of Spielberg's. Aggressive youngsters will skip the more Disneyish dinosaurs and go straight for the T. Rexes. Peaceable children will prefer the former, and will linger over the cuddly whiskers of the Ricardus Attenburgosaurus. And evolution experts will savour, with sardonic smile, the chaos theory pronouncements of the boffin character (Jeff Goldblum). In short: whole new rhythms will be cut by everyone from Master Steven's original print. Meanwhile adults watching Peter Weir's absorbing Fearless (Warner), the tale of a plane crash survivor (Jeff Bridges) wandering a nether world of memory and hallucination, may put the emphasis on the rewind button. This story needs much working out. Is Bridges actually alive or dead? If fetching Isabella Rossellini is Bridges' wife, why does he spend so much time with fellow crash victim Rosie Perez? Is this the real world - or the next? Unravel the film at home, with a freedom you never had in the cinema. Contrarily, Hans-Jurgen Syberberg's Hitler (Academy) is a multi-technique pageant lasting seven hours: so we forgive you if you create your own 'time-lapse' special edition. Whizz along if you wish, at least on second viewing, with the FF button. Re-form the German director's rich kaleidoscope of devices and references - puppetry, newsreels, theatre sets, back projection, opera - into your own, even quirkier rollercoaster ride. From video as recreation we are moving to video as re-creation. Indeed, children are already turning from the mild participatory challenge of the reissued movie into the terrifying combat zone - at least to my generation - of the interactive video game. Burn: Cycle is the latest Digital Video mind-scrambler to dive into my CDi machine. Game scenario: I am Sol Cutter, computer data thief, and I have a virus in my brain. Using my joystick-equipped touchpad, I must escape Softech Labs, shooting armed guards on the way, in order to get help. I have two hours. Can I make it? Speaking for myself, I can barely make it out of the first room. Confused, shot to pieces and still at square one, I finally left the game in the hands of a friend, a major software troubleshooter at a UK computer firm. He is still trying to work it out. Fine production values, though: the images are Blade Runner out of 2001. It is a brave new world, and it has stranger creatures in it still. For Christmas, if you feel you cannot inflict Burn: Cycle on family or friends, why not try Human Aquarium Productions? These moving-wallpaper videos allow you to watch naked human 'fish' (Girlfish, Boyfish, Allfish) swimming for hour after hour in the corner of your living room. I am not sure, or hesitate to guess, what interactive idea there is behind this. Finally, two films for pure, innocent enjoyment. Cool Runnings (Buena Vista) puts a comedy spin on the true story of the Jamaican bobsled team at the 1988 Olympics. And The Paper (CIC), starring Michael Keaton and Glenn Close, is a high-energy comedy-melodrama about the newspaper business. Both are perfect for Christmas. Stop Press. I have just broken through to the second phase in Burn: Cycle. Weird things are happening. Watch this space.</p>

The most important outcome  of his visit was the signing of a defense agreement between  Turkey and Azerbaijan.    Aliyev said that an agreement will also be signed on the  laying of a pipeline between the two countries to transport  Azerbaijan's oil to the Mediterranean Sea. President Suleyman  Demirel responded by saying that Turkey will support Azerbaijan  in its war with Armenia. However, he stressed that Turkey is  not obliged to give direct military support to Azerbaijan within  the framework of the defense agreement between the two countries.    It seems that the officials of the two sides are making an  effort to reactivate relations between Baku and Ankara, which  have been damaged by a chilled atmosphere for some time. It  will be recalled that the ousting of former President Ebulfaz  Elchibey, who was known to have close relations with Ankara,  caused a significant setback in relations between the two  countries. Meanwhile, Turkey's approach to the war between  Azerbaijan and Armenia and its failure to give the necessary  financial support to Baku at the time weakened relations between  the two sides and caused dissatisfaction in Azerbaijan.    Undoubtedly, similar developments weakened diplomatic  contacts between Baku and Ankara in 1993. Considering Ankara's  long-standing Pan-Turkic approach and the strategic importance  of the Caucasus, that state of affairs caused anxiety in the  Western countries, which planned to influence the republics in  the region through Turkey and the Turkish Government.  Meanwhile, Moscow's disclosure that it regards Central Asia and  the Caucasus as a security zone for Russia worried the Turkish  Government. In view of that, Turkey made several initiatives to  improve its relations with the Baku Government and dispel the  dark clouds between the two countries. In fact, it made an  effort to persuade Baku to maintain a policy in Ankara's favor  by promising political and economic aid to Azerbaijan.    Several news agencies have reported that Ankara informed  Baku  a few hours before Aliyev arrived in Turkey that it will give a  credit of $15 billion to the Azerbaijani Government, construct a  center for foreign diplomats in Baku, and help Azerbaijan open  diplomatic missions in foreign countries.    Meanwhile, Baku has planned to improve its relations with  Ankara and use its close links to the Western countries to  create a favorable atmosphere for the resolution of the dispute  between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Nevertheless, several observers  are convinced that Moscow can condone the improvement of  relations between Ankara and Baku as long as they do not pose a  threat to Russia's interests.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Fletcher wins 43% of Methanex METHANEX, of Vancouver, will emerge as the world's biggest methanol producer and distributor under a deal to buy the methanol interests of Fletcher Challenge, of New Zealand. Methanex, whose biggest shareholder is Metalgesellschaft, the German metals and chemicals group, will pay Fletcher Challenge USDollars 250m in cash plus 74m Methanex shares. As a result, Fletcher will end up with a 43 per cent stake in Methanex, while Metalgesellschaft's interest will drop from 32 per cent to 10 per cent. But the German group will have an option to acquire some of Fletcher's shares, and each group will have a right of first refusal on the other's shares. The deal is conditional on shareholder and regulatory approvals as well as the completion of financing for the cash payment. Methanex also announced it was raising CDollars 346m (USDollars 272m) by selling 42m shares to an underwriting group of Canadian securities dealers. Its purchase of the Fletcher assets, together with other expansion projects under way, will boost its annual production and marketing capacity to over 5m tonnes of methanol, or almost a quarter of world output. Its leading facilities will be in North America, New Zealand, Chile and Trinidad. The company said the plants being bought from Fletcher were among the lowest-cost facilities in the world and would 'considerably' reduce Methanex's average production costs. Methanol is a key feedstock for production of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), used as an octane enhancer and oxygenate to cut emissions from motor vehicle engines. Demand for MTBE is rising in the US following passage of the Clear Air Act in 1990, which requires the use of oxygenates in petrol.</p>

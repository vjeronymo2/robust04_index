			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Private briefings come under the public eye: Peter Montagnon writes on legal and illegal company communications to analysts Mr Tony Butterworth, chief executive of London International Group, barely smiles when asked about the reprimand his company received from the stock exchange in April. The company, best known for its 35 per cent share of the world branded condom market, agreed with the exchange that neither would comment further on the revelations that LIG had selectively briefed 13 analysts and four institutions about its falling profits. According to Mr Butterworth, there is nothing more to be said. The City investment community, however, thinks otherwise. It has begun an anxious debate about how companies should communicate with the outside world. In the background is a sense that private briefings of analysts and investors have been getting out of hand. Companies naturally want to prepare the ground for news about a change in their fortunes. The LIG affair shows this becomes too much of a good thing when it leads to some investors receiving favoured treatment. The situation is made more acute by institutional pressure on companies to be more forthcoming. LIG maintains it was singled out for something that others also do. One risk is that those with something to hide now have an excuse to clam up. The price of continued openness may be a proliferation of official statements, deluging investors with trivial information. A further complication is the insider trading legislation currently before parliament. The draconian approach of the original draft has been softened, but companies and brokers remain worried about whether they can safely continue the informal briefings on which they have relied for years. The conviction earlier this year of a Scottish analyst, Mr Thorold Mackie, for insider dealing strikes fear into many stockbrokers. Some two weeks before Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, issued a profit warning last September, Mr Mackie met its chairman. While the market as a whole was still in the dark, he advised his clients to sell the shares. The case shows how blurred, even under the existing rules, the distinction is between legality and illegality in the way the information flows. Analysts rightly say they need regular contact with companies if they are to make sensible judgments. The obvious solution is to ensure that price-sensitive information is communicated to the market through a formal an-nouncement. But it is not easy to know in advance what material is price sensitive or how the market will react to the simple news that a briefing has taken place. Within two days of a briefing last month for eight analysts on the organisation of its UK division, Standard Chartered's share price rose 6 per cent. The bank says it gave no financial information at the meeting. Some of the upward pressure on its shares may have come from brokers not at the meeting, who simply thought that positive news must have been imparted. The problem is exacerbated if, as in this case, brokers use innocuous briefings as a peg to publicise adjustments to their forecasts that were in train anyway. Lucas Industries is trying a different approach. On the morning after a dinner for analysts at this year's Paris air show, the company issued a detailed statement of what had been said, though not before its share price had fallen sharply. Subsequently it announced in advance that it was taking analysts to visit one of its plants and released a statement while the visit was taking place. Lucas says it is especially alert to the stricter climate because of the bid rumours swirling round it this year. But some say its approach smacks of overkill. 'You cannot put out a statement every time an analyst rings up,' says one investor relations professional. So what should companies do to ensure that they maintain an adequate, digestible flow of information to investors, while staying within the rules? Most expect the answer will inevitably involve more formal statements. The more information is in the public domain, the more companies will feel comfortable explaining detail and context to analysts and institutions. The stock exchange has been reviewing its guidelines, but so far has found no reason to change them. Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, has, however, come up with some suggestions. It believes companies should make more use of regular events such as annual meetings to talk about current trading and strategy. There would then be less risk of the market's expectation departing from reality. When it does, companies should promptly issue a statement. Regular corporate announcements tend, though, to be bunched into the earlier part of the financial year. There is a long gap between the interim figures and full-year results. One possibility would be a routine trading statement towards the end of the year, when many companies are anyway briefing analysts. Last year the Rank Organisation began briefing groups of analysts twice a year before going into closed season on its interim and final results. It used to call them in individually, but found this gave an advantage to the broker lucky enough to be invited first. To be extra sure of fair treatment, it puts out the main details of its message in a formal statement. Some might see this as a step towards quarterly reporting, already practised by many companies with a listing in the US. BAT Industries has even accelerated the reporting of its quarterly results, which come out soon after the period has ended. Its closed season begins before the quarter is over, which helps avoid embarrassing requests from analysts for help with forecasts. Also, it creates a regular opportunity for statements on matters of interest such as the US cigarette price war. This is not, however, to everyone's taste. According to one large institutional investor the introduction of a quarterly reporting requirement would be like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It would be expensive for small companies and encourage a short-term approach. There is no evidence that it makes share prices less volatile. ICI reports quarterly, but its new offshoot Zeneca does not intend to follow suit. 'The issue is reporting of exceptional developments,' says Mr John Mayo, finance director, 'and the way people are trying to deal with it is regular reporting. What we need is for people to loosen up a bit about exceptional reporting.' That begs the question of how such statements should be published. The formal requirement is to go through the stock exchange, but its procedures are slow and its screen is scanned only by professional investors. Perhaps its monopoly should be removed to promote the widest possible circulation of announcements. Mr Terry Venables came under fire for warning about Tottenham Hotspur's profits during BBC Grandstand's cup final coverage. It is hard to be more public than that.</p>

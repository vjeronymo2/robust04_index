			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: NORA DUNN TAKES A STAND BUT LOSES 'SNL' JOB  </P> <P> FOR FIVE seasons on "Saturday Night Live," comic actress Nora Dunn was best  known for her characterizations on that long-running NBC institution: vapid  talk show hostess Pat Stevens . . . one half of the singing Sweeney Sisters.  But then came Andrew Dice Clay, chosen to host the May 12 edition of "SNL."  </P> <P> Dunn publicly repudiated Clay and absented herself from the show, as did the  scheduled musical performer Sinead O'Connor. The firestorm of publicity brought  both praise for her stand and skepticism of her motives. And many felt that  Dunn had, no doubt inadvertently, helped Clay's career. Now Nora Dunn is out of  "Saturday Night Live," her contract not renewed. Producers insist this is not  some sort of punishment for bucking the male-dominated environment of "SNL."  They say it's just show biz, you know?  </P> <P> Nora Dunn sat for an interview with Mother Jones magazine, conducted by Davis  Beers, shortly before NBC announced her services would no longer be required.  In the September/October issue, she speaks out on the Andrew Dice Clay debacle  and its aftermath.  </P> <P> "I was ostracized by most of the people I work with, including most of the  cast," she said, "and I was never given any reason for that other than what I  read in the paper." Dunn said, months later, very few cast members or  co-workers have spoken to her.  </P> <P> Her stance on Clay is unwavering: "He has the right to say whatever he wants;  you then have the responsibility to stand up against it. You can't disconnect  yourself from reality -- the kind of rapes that are happening, people beating  up gay men. This kind of stuff Clay does fuels that kind of thought. It's too  easy to slip into that fascist way of thinking."  </P> <P> And yet for all this, Dunn has not joined the National Organization for Women  in its condemnation of Esquire's June issue, to which she contributed a  four-page photo parody: "I think when you start condemning things you need to  focus on what's important. I would not compare Esquire with Andrew Dice Clay. .  . . I don't take it seriously. It's not about rape."  </P> <P> IVANA TRUMP is in Paris, viewing, oohing and aahing the fall collections. But  she's not buying a thing. That's the fun part of her Parisian jaunt. Ivana is  always the busy working woman, however she is also meeting with tapestry, wall  covering and china experts in preparation for the licensing of her Plaza  Collections line of accessories and toiletries and what have you.  </P> <P> Marla Maples is still looking for an acting job.  </P></p>

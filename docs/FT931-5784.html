			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Letter: Reviving UK manufacturing by consensus Sir, It is significant that Mark Radcliffe of the CBI's National Manufacturing Council, in writing about the decline of manufacturing in the UK (Letters, March 1), has little to say about those who work in industry. Yes, the government must play its part. Yes, the 'best people' must be attracted into industry by spreading best practice. But nothing is said about those at the sharp end of the decline - the millions who still work in manufacturing and the millions who have lost their jobs in the last two recessions. It is becoming widely acknowledged that we will not solve Britain's underlying economic problems without a reconstruction of our manufacturing base. But this will not be achieved by the sort of methods which became the accepted norm in the last decade. We need a consensus to grow and it needs to be based on frank and open discussion between the government and all who work in industry. To quote Dr Carl Hahn, former chairman of Volkswagen, who spoke at the Royal Society of Arts in London last week: 'Industry needs informed and knowledgeable input from those working on the assembly line and shop floor - and that requires a new approach entirely to attitude, communication, to education, training and management.' Those are sentiments which MSF, as a union representing a quarter of a million skilled and professional employees in manufacturing industry, heartily applauds. But how can that new attitude be fostered? Certainly not by management diktat or by ministerial disdain. In our industrial strategy document, Manufacturing Matters, to be launched next week, we call for the Department of Trade and Industry to establish a manufacturing forum to start the dialogue. It would allow Britain's social partners to forge a consensus on the causes of decline in manufacturing, the nature of the remedies and responsibilities for future success. Can we expect the CBI's National Manufacturing Council to join us in pressing this proposal? Roger Lyons, general secretary, MSF, 64/66 Wandsworth Common, Northside, London SW18 2SH</p>

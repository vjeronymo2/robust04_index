			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: The railway in the Kent countryside ' . . . The route crosses Ashenbank Wood in a cutting about 100 metres deep and up to 60 metres wide. One property would have to be demolished . . . 'Running in a deep cutting beside the Old Chatham Road, the new railway crosses the North Downs Way, running under the Pilgrims' Way and passing about 300 metres from The Bluebells Estate. The route turns east, away from the A229 road . . . it then runs through copse and ancient woodland . . . Passing along the north side of the M20, the route clips the northern boundary of Chilston Park, but avoids the historic ice pond . . . Near Sellinge, it runs between the M20 and the existing railway before crossing the A20 at Grove Road. This would require dismantling of the listed Talbot House, which could be rebuilt on another site. The Mucky Duck public house would have to be demolished . . .'</p>

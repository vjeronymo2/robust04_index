			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Thrown off the scent  -Alice Rawsthorn examines the dilemma facing Yves Saint-Laurent In 1986 Givenchy, the French fashion house, was hurriedly forced to paste Xeryus labels over the first batch of its new men's fragrance after rival Yves Saint-Laurent claimed the original name, Keryus, could be confused with its own Kouros cologne. The tables have now turned. YSL was last week ordered by a French court to change the name of Champagne, its new women's perfume, after three champagne companies, including a subsidiary of LVMH, the French luxury goods group that owns Givenchy, claimed YSL had no right to use it. YSL is appealing. If it loses, it will at the very least have to drop the name Champagne in France - writing off the estimated FFr15m (Pounds 1.7m) it has already spent on advertising there. Yet the French court ruling also presents YSL with an unenviable marketing dilemma. The Dollars 13bn (Pounds 9.2bn) perfume industry operates on a global basis. The launch of a significant new fragrance, such as Champagne, is carefully co-ordinated so that the product is presented to consumers in the same way in every country. YSL in September introduced Champagne throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East. It plans to launch it next year in North America and Asia. An enforced name change in France would torpedo its hopes of establishing Champagne as a global product. YSL would then have to decide whether it would be in its best interests to adopt the new name everywhere, even though that would mean losing the FFr100m it has invested so far in the European launch. 'Global branding is the name of the game in the fragrance market,' says Jack Saltzman, an industry analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York. 'It wouldn't be impossible to launch a perfume using a different name for different markets. But it wouldn't be easy.' The problem facing YSL and Elf-Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals company that acquired it earlier this year, is aggravated by the sheer expense of developing a new perfume. It costs roughly Dollars 50m to publicise the worldwide launch of a new fragrance. The risk of failure is frighteningly high. The Fragrance Foundation in New York estimates that 75 new scents have been introduced in the US this year and industry statistics suggest that only 15 will recover their launch costs within three years. Yet a classic perfume can be vastly profitable. The best-sellers, Chanel No5 and L'Oreal's Tresor, make annual sales of Dollars 120m. After the expensive launch period, the cost of manufacturing and marketing falls to 35 per cent of sales, leaving the perfumer with the potential of big profits. YSL already owns two of the top 10 women's scents, Opium and Paris. But Opium came out in 1977 and Paris in 1983. YSL has not had an important new launch since 1988 when it introduced Jazz, its men's fragrance. The success of Champagne is critical to its chances of maintaining its place among the leading players. It also represents an opportunity for Elf-Sanofi to recoup part of the cost of the controversial FFr3.6bn acquisition of YSL, which has already sparked a stock market investigation into insider dealing. YSL went to great lengths to ensure that Champagne's launch was as smooth as possible. It started preparing for the launch in 1991. The choice of name was always regarded as an important part of the process given that naming, like every other aspect of fragrance marketing, has become increasingly complex in recent years. YSL in the late 1970s bought the rights to the Opium name for Dollars 200 from another perfumer. Chanel 10 years later paid more than Dollars 500,000 to an astute Paris magazine editor who had registered the worldwide rights to Egoiste. Yves Saint-Laurent personally selected the name Champagne in 1991. His choice did not appear to be problematic. Champagne had in 1943 been registered as a fragrance trademark by Parfums Caron, a perfume group. YSL spent an estimated FFr3m to buy the trademark and to register it worldwide. These preparations were wrecked when the champagne industry this summer initiated legal proceedings against YSL, claiming the existence of a perfume called Champagne could confuse consumers and imperil the prestige of its product. When YSL sued Givenchy over Keryus in 1986, the case was resolved before the product went on sale, allowing Givenchy to introduce it everywhere under the new name. But the timing of the Champagne case could scarcely have been worse for YSL. The earliest possible date for its appeal against last week's ruling is January. In the meantime it must comply with the court's instruction that it drops the name Champagne in France within 30 days. This means that even if YSL wins on appeal it will have had to use a new name or withdraw Champagne from the French market during the pre-Christmas season. This usually accounts for half the year's perfume sales. In the meantime YSL faces the threat of two other lawsuits from champagne producers: one in Germany which should start in March, and another in the UK that may not come to court until next summer. It must also decide whether to risk implementing its plan to launch Champagne next year in North America and Asia. If YSL wins the French appeal and all the other cases, the damage to Champagne will be limited to an unhappy first Christmas in France. But if YSL loses the case in a single country, Champagne can never be a global product. YSL would then have to decide whether it was worth selling a fragrance under different names in different countries. Guerlain did so in the 1950s when Shalimar became a bestseller despite using the name No90 in the UK, because another 'Shalimar' was already on sale. But the perfume market has changed dramatically since the 1950s. YSL operates in a world of globe-trotting customers. The rationale for global marketing in fragrances is that when a Manhattan businesswoman visits Paris, she can spot the new scent she saw advertised in American Vogue as soon as she walks into the duty-free shop at Charles de Gaulle airport. YSL and Elf-Sanofi have not yet decided what to do. 'We're going ahead with the appeal and we hope we'll win,' said Elf-Sanofi. 'But if we lose we're going to have to address some very difficult decisions.'  ----------------------------------------------       The best selling women's scents  ----------------------------------------------  1  Chanel No5 Chanel  2  Tresor L'Oreal  3  Vanderbilt L'Oreal  4  Opium YSL/Elf-Sanofi  5  Anais Anais L'Oreal  6  L'Air du Temps Elf-Sanofi  7  Beautiful Estee Lauder  8  Georgio Giorgio  9  Paris YSL/Elf/Sanofi 10  Poison LVMH  ---------------------------------------------- Source: Industry estimates  ----------------------------------------------</p>

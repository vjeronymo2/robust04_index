			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Risk and Reward: Franco-German futures link raises fears of exclusivity Last week's announcement of the terms of the planned linkage between Germany's Deutsche Terminborse and France's Matif did little more than fill in the details sketched out in the memorandum of understanding signed by the two futures exchanges last December. However, the move has broader implications, both for the exchanges themselves and for the futures industry as a whole. The announcement silenced persistent rumours that the exchanges had run into substantial difficulties in fleshing out the terms of their memorandum. Futures market participants tend to be sceptical about talk of alliances between exchanges, and not without reason, since most previous attempts have failed. The DTB/Matif effort, however, not only seems to have a brighter future than most, but also has an unusually broad scope. Both exchanges reject the use of the word 'merger', and insist that each exchange will remain independent. The agreement 'is an evolutionary process', according to a DTB official. However, the possibility that both will one day allow each other's members to have access to all products suggests the creation of a self-contained unit for trading French and German products, which could pose a serious competitive threat to other exchanges. But both exchanges say they may admit other exchanges. In addition to the first phase of the link - DTB screens will be available in France for trading selected products and Matif members will be able to trade DTB products via DTB clearing members by mid-1994  - which was already broadly known, the details of the second phase have also now been thrashed out. The Matif has agreed to pay on an undisclosed sum for the DTB's software, and two Matif products will be listed on the system and will cease to be traded on open outcry by the end of 1995. The Matif's key product, the 10-year French government bond contract, will continue to be traded in the pit, so the change will also prove an important test for screen-trading. Mr Roger Barton, head of business development at the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) said the fact that two Matif products would cease to be traded on the exchange floor could 'present a business opportunity' for Liffe to trade the products on its floor instead. It remains to be seen which users would prefer, although many still say they favour pit-trading. What is certain is that the Matif/DTB link will do nothing to ease the tensions which have sprung up in the increasingly competitive derivatives market. In the past decade, 18 derivatives exchanges have started up in Europe, winning market share from the once all-powerful US exchanges. However, many observers believe that, despite the explosion of derivatives activity, expected to continue for several years as more over-the-counter business underpins futures trading, a mature market will not be large enough to support this number of exchanges. In particular, if some sort of European monetary union ever goes ahead, the current number of 98 different futures and options contracts traded on Europe's exchanges, excluding options on individual shares, will shrink dramatically. The new focus on forging links with other exchanges to ensure survival may have a knock-on effect on the prospects for Globex, the after-hours futures trading system developed by the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters. The ardour of Europe's futures exchanges for joining the system appears to have dimmed since the launch of Globex just over a year ago. Mr Gary Ginter has resigned his position as managing director of Globex. Mr Ginter was responsible for developing a business plan focusing on marketing CME and CBoT products listed on Globex outside the US. He has left Globex to take a position as president of the board of directors and director of strategic planning for Oster Communications, the Iowa-based derivatives information group.</p>

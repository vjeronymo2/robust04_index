			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Cory Environmental: Correction Our use of a photograph of the Cory Environmental Pollution Services site at Mucking, Essex, to illustrate last Saturday's report on the introduction of new rules for the waste disposal industry does not imply that Cory is deficient, and it continues to operate under its existing licence as it meets the new rules. We apologise for any embarrassment caused by the use of the picture.</p>

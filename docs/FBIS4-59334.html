			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Sanaa Rejects 'Arafat's Mediation"] </F>   [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Sanaa has rejected an  offer of mediation made two days ago by the Palestinian  leadership in an endeavor to stop the war in Yemen. Vice  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid welcomed the Palestinian offer of  mediation, which would have been carried out by Fatah Central  Committee Member 'Abbas Zaki, who enjoys excellent relations  with the Yemenis, especially in south Yemen where he worked as  representative of the Palestinian revolution in Aden several  years ago.    That is what Zaki himself said. He told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  that he would have left for Yemen had President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih accepted the mediation, but the Yemeni president's  announcement three days ago rejecting any Arab or foreign  mediation, on the grounds that what was happening in Yemen was  an internal affair, prevented him from carrying out the mission  entrusted to him by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat.</p>

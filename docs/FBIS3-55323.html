According to the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, these  words of Ardzinba "testify not only to his skepticism but also  to his intention to poison the atmosphere around the forthcoming  talks and even to disrupt them as far as possible".    This assumption is borne out by Ardzinba's reiterated  statement that "Abkhazia is no longer part of Georgia" and that  "the question now is about signing an agreement between Abkhazia  and Georgia as two equal parties".    A second round of consultations between Georgia and Abkhazia  is scheduled to begin in Geneva on January 11. "The delegation  from Georgia has been instructed to draw up, jointly with the  Abkhaz delegation, a framework for the full-scale settlement in  Abkhazia, which can be used as the basis of a resolution to be  adopted by the United Nations Security Council," the Georgian  statement said.    "Only a document recognised and guaranteed by the  international community can ensure the restoration of peace in  Abkhazia," the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.</p>

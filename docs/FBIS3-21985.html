Sanchez de Lozada today arrived in Argentina on an official  48-hour visit with the objective of signing an agreement on  plant and animal sanitary controls and an agreement on  investment promotion and guarantees.    President Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella received  the Bolivian president at 1020 today in Metropolitan Airport's  military section.    After the welcoming protocol, City Council President Juan  Trilla, from the Radical Civic Union, gave the Bolivian chief of  state the keys to the city.    During a brief news conference after the ceremony, Sanchez  de  Lozada said one of the subjects he would discuss with Menem is  the situation of some of his fellow countrymen living illegally  in Argentina.    He added: "The control of drug trafficking is very  important,  and with the aid of Argentina and the international community we  will be able to stop this problem." [passage omitted]    Regarding drug trafficking control, Sanchez de Lozada said:  "It is a very important subject, and we will speak about the  Bolivian criteria to ask Argentina and the international  community for help to put an end to this phenomenon, which is  something we cannot stop."    He added that the future of Bolivia "depends a lot on what  is  going on in Argentina, on the possibility of increasing  exchange, and on a rapprochement" between the two countries.</p>

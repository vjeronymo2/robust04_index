			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Buyers losing taste for expensive natural vanilla - Overpricing is costing market share for Madagascar's high quality product that was how one local newspaper headlined the recent destruction of 1,700 tonnes of vanilla stocks in the north-east of Madagascar. Madagascar's vanilla, the country's number one export by value, fetches top prices of more than USDollars 70 a kilogram. But the grower sees precious little of that - the official farmgate price last year was MgFr2,000 (Dollars 1.04) for 1kg of pods. In the 1960s a vanilla price stabilisation fund was established with the intention of channelling investment into the industry. But it receives only a small proportion of the 80 per cent levy on the export price. A growing amount has been spent on keeping stocks, and much of the stockpile is thought to be of either poor quality or 'phantom' pods. The cost of keeping stocks increased from MgFr10m in 1980 to MgFr9bn in 1990, and the bulk of what is left of the levy has been disappearing into the national treasury. While the government has sought to control every aspect of vanilla production, illicit exports of vanilla have been growing, a reflection of declining morale, particularly among farmers. This year, unauthorised shipments turned up in Singapore, Holland and France. This has been mostly inferior quality vanilla, picked too early and offered at low prices, undermining confidence among the major holders of vanilla stocks in industrialised countries. Vanilla was first introduced to Madagascar in the 1840s. Annual rainfall on the north-east coast where the growing and processing are concentrated is 2,000mm, evenly spread over the year. Temperatures range from 18' C to 32' C. There are now about 55,000 farmers growing vanilla in Madagascar. The cultivation and processing of the crop is skilled and labour intensive. A skilled worker can pollinate between 1,000 and 1,500 flowers in a day, but if over-pollinated a vine will yield small and low quality pods. Curing takes many months of sorting, 'killing', sweating, drying, conditioning and meticulous inspection to induce the development of the full aroma and flavour. Madagascar has built its reputation on its knowhow. It also has the labour and production costs are low, estimated at less than Dollars 15 a kilogram, compared with Dollars 35 for Indonesian vanilla and over Dollars 40 in the Comores. Vanilla production is so labour intensive, that rapidly industrialising countries, with increasing labour costs such as Mexico have had to reassess their involvement with the crop. But Madagascar has been rapidly losing its market share. In the early 1970s, it supplied 70 per cent of the vanilla consumed worldwide. By the early 1990s, its share was down to 50 per cent. High prices and now illicit shipments of poor quality vanilla are prompting consumers to look for cheaper alternative sources. The Indonesian government has been encouraging farmers to start growing vanilla. It is also seeking to improve the quality of its pods, in particular, to increase the aroma flavour, strength and character. For instance, it is trying to educate farmers not to pick pods early. The curers and Indonesian research institutes are working with the British Natural Resources Institute to improve curing techniques, and in particular the measuring of moisture content. Vanilla production in Uganda, which ceased during the political upheavals of the 1970s, is rising again. There are already more than 10,000 farmers growing the crop and the price they receive is almost three times that paid to growers in Madagascar. One of Uganda's processors, which produces two thirds of the country's vanilla, uses a method of rapid curing, introduced by the US spice company McCormicks. This cuts the curing time from six months to four days. And the vanillin content is twice that of pods cured by the traditional Bourbon method as used in Madagascar. The high price of Madagascar's vanilla has been largely to blame also for the increasing partial substitution of other natural aromas for vanilla and the switch to cheaper synthetic vanillin flavourings. The cheapest, Chinese vanillin has been selling at Dollars 11 a kilogram. In the US, which consumes 60 per cent of the world's natural vanilla, vanillin now takes more than 90 per cent of the market for that aroma and in France it supplies about 50 per cent of the market. 'We've been selling a product which every year has been getting worse and worse,' says the director of one of the largest vanilla exporters in Madagascar. 'A lot of the experienced planters have been giving up vanilla, so the basic structure from which new farmers could learn has been collapsing.' This year, the government agreed to improve incentives to growers, processors and exporters, doubling the proportion of the export levy they receive over the next three years. But it has yet to agree to a liberalisation of the sector, and in particular of pricing. According to a World Bank report in 1991, Madagascar's vanilla would be more realistically priced at about Dollars 50 a kilogram, the price of Indonesia's best quality pods. Liberalisation is being resisted, particularly by the large exporters. 'For the past 30 years, Madagascar has managed to secure pretty much the price it wanted. The effect of telling the country to liberalise has been to destabilise the whole situation,' says the director of one vanilla exporting company. 'In the short term freeing of prices might benefit the consumers, but sooner or later the quality would be bound to suffer.' Judging by market reports from the US, there is now a trend towards natural vanilla in an increasingly health and environment conscious food industry, especially in premium brand ice creams and drinks. Vanilla is the only flavour specifically defined by the Food and Drug Administration. According to FDA guidelines a product labelled natural vanilla should use pure vanilla extract. But according to the World Bank, Madagascar risks becoming a residual supplier of the flavouring, supplying the market only when crops in other countries fail. Unless it takes drastic action, says the bank, Madagascar could cease being a vanilla exporter altogether by the end of the 1990s.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The talks between Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic, Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's  special envoy, and Serbian Republic President Radovan Karadzic  that were held in Belgrade for several hours ended around noon  today. These talks, which were held at the initiative of Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic, began yesterday afternoon.  Following the talks, President Milosevic made a brief statement:    [Begin recording] [Milosevic] I am very glad that the talks  between representatives of the United Nations and the Serbian  Republic were successful. I think that a major step toward  peace has been made. In the future as well, Serbia will  continue to support a peaceful solution of the Yugoslav crisis  through negotiations, because we think that there is no  alternative and that this is the only way to achieve such a  solution. Thank you very much.    [Correspondent Jelena Radovanov] Yasushi Akashi also  addressed the correspondents.    [Akashi, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian report] I  think that through cooperation among all participants in these  long talks, we managed to avoid an even bigger crisis, said UN  Yasushi Akashi. I am very satisfied with the results. I am  grateful to President Milosevic for his initiative to hold such  a meeting. I am also very pleased by the cooperativeness that  representatives of the Bosnian Serbs, beginning with Radovan  Karadzic, have shown, Yasushi Akashi said, and added that it was  agreed that the Serbs would withdraw 3 km away from Gorazde by  midnight and for heavy weaponry to be withdrawn by Tuesday [26  April] at midnight.    It is our intention, Yasushi Akashi went on to say, that the  first United Nations Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] units be  deployed this afternoon. I have received assurances that full  cooperation will be ensured regarding the peace forces' free  passage to Gorazde as soon as possible, but before the end of  the day. Yasushi Akashi added that other protected zones were  also discussed. However, being confronted with the crisis  around Gorazde, we have done all that was in our power to solve  it. The result should be satisfactory to all interested sides,  special envoy Yasushi Akashi concluded after the talks with  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Republic of Srpska  president Radovan Karadzic held this morning.    [Radovanov] Here is what republic of Srpska president  Radovan Karadzic told the correspondents:    [Karadzic] Today's round was in fact held only to establish  more precisely the things that we achieved yesterday. I am  pleased that we and Akashi are on the road to success again. I  hope that we are going to continue along that road until we  completely conclude a cessation of hostilities. In this  respect, Akashi is very spirited and very capable, and I think  we are going to achieve good....[pauses] We set certain  stipulations today regarding this 3-km zone in Gorazde.    [Unidentified correspondent] Can you tell us some things  [words indistinct]?    [Karadzic] I beg your pardon?    [Unidentified correspondent] Will relations with UNPROFOR be  (?resumed)?    [Karadzic] Yes, relations with UNPROFOR have been normalized  as we need them if we want to establish peace, especially since  both sides have realized that it is impossible to do anything  with interrupted relations.    [Correspondent] Could you tell us something about the  modalities of yesterday's agreement?    [Karadzic] Yesterday's agreement envisages something that we  discussed on several occasions within the past 10 days, and that  is how to establish a criterion for the 3-km zone. In the  center of Gorazde, since there are both Serbs and Muslims there,  UNPROFOR will be responsible for taking care of the Serbs. It  will take care of the Muslims as well, and according to the  Security Council resolution, they must not provoke or shoot at  the Serbian side.    If peace and the United Nations will be there -- if this is  a  model that is not identical to the Sarajevo one but similar to  it -- we may hope for a complete peace in the Gorazde zone.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] that model be applied to  other protected zones. What do you think?    [Karadzic] If the zones are demilitarized -- that is, if any  possibility of provocations and offensives from protected zones  is prevented -- then we are then ready to accept this. Had  Gorazde been demilitarized, there would have been no Muslim  offensive and there would have been no Serbian counteroffensive.  Why did we not attack Srebrenica? Because, from Srebrenica, we  are exposed to provocations alone and not an offensive. If the  Muslims launched an offensive from Srebrenica, then naturally a  Serbian offensive would result. We have to ensure that it is  established who is to be blamed for the war -- that is, who  started the offensives. Counteroffensives are a legitimate  reply to offensives.    [Radovanov] Yesterday's first round of marathon talks, which  lasted almost 10 hours, ended with a complete agreement of the  representatives of the United Nations and the republic of Srpska  on the most important points that were proposed by Slobodan  Milosevic, the host of the meeting. What is involved is above  all an agreement on the momentary and complete cease-fire in and  around Gorazde, which comes into force at noon today. One  UNPROFOR battalion will be deployed in the region 3 km away from  the center of Gorazde on both banks of the Drina River. It has  also been agreed that heavy weaponry be withdrawn from that area  or be placed under UNPROFOR's control. A very important segment  of yesterday's agreement is the complete normalization of  relations between UNPROFOR and the republic of Srpska. [end  recording]</p>

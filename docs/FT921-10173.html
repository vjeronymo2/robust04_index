			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Finns swing in favour of joining EC FINLAND'S President Mauno Koivisto is expected today to add his support to the growing momentum for an early application to join the European Community, writes Robert Taylor in Helsinki This month Prime Minister Esko Aho and his cabinet will decide on an EC application, and parliament will vote on the issue. The formal application will be made by mid-March, ensuring that Finland can join Sweden and Austria in parallel entry negotiations. These could begin late this year. The only remaining doubts lie in the attitude of Mr Aho's ruling Centre Party, which is divided. Many rural supporters fear EC membership will devastate Finland's highly-protected agriculture. Negotiations on entry terms on farming may prove difficult. The swing towards EC entry follows the realisation that a 19-nation European Economic Area would only be a transitional arrangement, particularly after Sweden opted in 1990 to seek EC entry.</p>

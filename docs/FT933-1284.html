			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Losses at Ciga deepen to L110bn LOSSES at Ciga, the troubled luxury hotels group controlled by the Aga Khan, virtually doubled to L110.1bn (Dollars 69m) in the first half of this year from L58.9bn. Interest charges soared to L85.1bn from L46.2bn, partly reflecting the impact of last year's lira devaluation on borrowings, some of which are in foreign currencies. Total group debts rose to L1,011bn at the end of June from L971bn last December. The deeper losses cast further doubts over the future of the group, which is still waiting for the release of a rescue plan by Mediobanca, the Milanese merchant bank. Ciga has stopped paying interest on most of its loans, while the Aga Khan earlier this year said he was unlikely to devote more of his personal resources. Group turnover fell 10 per cent to L209.2bn, in spite of a 10 per cent rise in occupancy levels at Ciga's Italian hotels, which form the bulk of its chain. The company attributed much of the decline to last year's sale of a Sardinian supermarkets chain and lower occupancy levels at its non-Italian hotels.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Hong Kong hotel development GAMMON CONSTRUCTION, the Hong Kong-based company jointly owned by Trafalgar House Construction and Jardine Matheson, has won a Pounds 48m (HKDollars 655m) contract to build a multi-storey tower extension (pictured left) to The Peninsula Hotel, located in the heart of Tsim Sha Tsui. Scheduled for completion within two years, the project consists of a 32-storey 116 metre tower above a five level 21 metre deep basement. It will be built using the time-saving 'top-down' method. Consisting of a concrete frame clad with a panelised curtain wall system, the new tower will be joined at its lower floors to the existing building. The contract also includes all the services and internal finishes. Gammon Construction has undertaken a series of projects at The Peninsula Hotel over the past few years. They include some additions and alterations completed last year as well as foundation work for the new extension. Although access to the site will be difficult, the hotel will remain open throughout the construction period.</p>

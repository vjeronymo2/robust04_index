			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases as long-term bond yields rise sharply Wall Street US share prices ended only slightly higher after investor sentiment had been unsettled by a sharp rise in bond yields following a surprisingly bullish purchasing managers' report, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.60 at 3,275.27, the index having spent all day within a few points of Friday's close. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished slightly weaker, down 0.29 at 412.41, while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks climbed 2.00 to 635.47. Turnover on the NYSE was light at 181m shares, while rises marginally outpaced declines by 882 to 830. The announcement from the National Association of Purchasing Management that its index of economic activity for February had risen from 47.4 per cent to 52.4 per cent was a welcome piece of economic news. But it was outweighed by the rise in long-term bond yields, which approached 8 per cent as dealers sold bonds in the belief that the NAPM report reduced the likelihood for further interest rate cuts. Equity market sentiment was affected because higher bond yields raise the cost of borrowing, especially in the housing sector. Paramount Communications jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 3/8 after PaineWebber upgraded its rating on the stock from 'neutral' to 'buy' and predicted that the entertainment group's first-quarter earnings should underscore a big improvement in operating margins. Digital Equipment rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 62 1/8 after the company announced that it is offering early retirement to 7,000 staff. Other big computer stocks were also firmer, with Hewlett-Packard up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 74 3/8 , IBM Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars 87 3/8 and Compaq Dollars  1/8 higher at Dollars 30 1/4 . Travelers dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 20 as investors reacted badly to reports that a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission reveals that the insurance group is seeking capital to cover losses from its property portfolio. Grace Energy jumped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 17 1/8 on the news that W R Grace (down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 43 3/4 ) will buy 4m shares of its energy affiliate for Dollars 16.50 a share. On the over-the-counter market, Scitex climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 42 1/4 in turnover of 1.3m shares in response to Friday's late news that International Paper had agreed to buy 11 per cent of Scitex. International Paper rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 74 7/8 . Canada TORONTO prices ended little changed in subdued dealings. Based on preliminary data, the composite index shed 2.47 points, or 0.07 per cent, to 3,579.4, with declining issues leading advances 281 to 252. Volume fell to 18.4m shares worth CDollars 201.4m against 26.8m shares worth CDollars 285.5m on Friday. Eight of 14 sub-groups were lower, with no major swings in the individual groups.</p>

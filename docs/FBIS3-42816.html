Gelman:  "Rabkrin Is Returning . . . : Consumer Protection Is a Matter  for Consumers Themselves"]    [Text] The law is the law. For it to work, the  appropriate means for its implementation are required. For  example, the vitality of the Criminal Code is supported by the  police, the prosecutor's office, and the courts. But who is  going to ensure the implementation of the Russian Federation's  law "On Consumer Rights Protection," and how? Violations of  those laws frequently bear the nature of criminally punishable  acts. In practice, however, oversight over those rights falls  out of the field of vision of the lawkeeping organs for some  reason. And of the executive authorities as well. Therefore  public organizations are compelled to be involved in oversight  as well.    This may just be right. State organs alone could scarcely  manage here. There is similar experience in the country at hand:  at the dawn of Soviet power, a worker-peasant inspectorate for  oversight over anything and everything was created--Rabkrin. In  the recent past, a people's control committee functioned, for  better or ill.    On the problems of consumer rights protection, which affects  the country's entire population, DELOVOY MIR correspondent  Moisey Gelman interviews the general director of the recently  organized National Consumer Protection Fund, Aleksandr  Kalinin.    [DELOVOY MIR] Aleksandr Yakovlevich, with what purpose was  your fund created, and what are its functions and legal base?    [Kalinin] The Consumer Rights Fund is an extrabudgetary,  independent, noncommercial, charitable organization with a  social orientation. Its chief task is to unify the financial and  intellectual potential of organizations and enterprises of all  forms of property in order to implement the Russian Federation  [RF] law "On Consumer Rights Protection."    The fund was created at the initiative of the RF State  Committee on Antimonopoly Policy and the Support of New Economic  Structures. It functions under the good offices of Russia's  leading ministries and departments, which are under instructions  to ensure state protection for the rights of consumers of goods,  jobs, and services. The fund is financed out of institutional,  membership, and sponsor contributions, as well as investment  funds from its members.    The fund's founders and members include the RF Committee on  Standardization, Measurement, and Certification [Gosstandart],  the State Inspectorate for Trade, Goods Quality, and Consumer  Rights Protection of the RF Committee on Trade, the RF Chamber  of Commerce and Industry, the Russian Goods and Raw Materials  Exchange, the Moscow Goods Exchange, the Dialog-Bank, the Estra  Financial-Industrial Company AO (joint-stock company), the  Energogarant insurance joint-stock company, the Norilskiy Nikel  concern, the Germes-Tsentr bank, the Soyuz-Germes AO, the  Certification VNII (all-Russian scientific research institute),  and others.    At present, the fund is implementing three programs:  financial-economic, informational-propaganda, and  organizational-methodological. It is trying to attract monetary  funds and financing for its protection activities for the rights  and legal interests of consumers and the support of the consumer  movement, while taking into account the multiplicity of its  forms and structures. It is also creating in Russia centers and  laboratories for the independent consumer expert analysis and  certification of goods, jobs, and services, the compilation of a  list of goods that do not meet mandatory safety requirements,  the organization of counter-advertising for the producers of  those goods, the organization of consumers' legal defense, and  the financing and implementation of programs for the training  and retraining of specialists and expert auditors working in the  organized consumer movement.    Moreover, the fund is participating in international  programs, preparing proposals for Russia's government and goods  producers on common state and regional programs for the  development of the production of goods, jobs, and services, as  well as facilitating the development of entrepreneurship and the  formation of a competitive environment in the consumer market.    In order to carry out the tasks identified by the fund,  centers have been organized for the assortment and quality of  goods and services, technical expertise, and certification of  items of automotive and tractor machine-building, as well as the  training and retraining of personnel. An independent  international center for the certification of goods and services  for radiation safety and an information rights center for the  protection of consumers are being created, as are centers for  the independent consumer expert analysis of foods and the raw  materials used in them, technical expertise, and certification  of flammable fabrics, and others.    Departments and branches of the fund are also being created  in various regions of Russia. Over the next couple of years,  more than 80 are slated for creation; as of now there are 9.  Their appearance has been facilitated by local organs of power  and commercial structures. Contacts are being established with  partners from the countries of the CIS and elsewhere abroad.  After all, such funds abroad are actively defending the rights  of consumers.    [DELOVOY MIR] What guides those wishing to join your fund or  to help it? Are they moved by altruism or economic interest?    [Kalinin] There has always been some tension with  "altruism."  The market is forcing people to strive for checks and balances  of mutual interests. Their motivations differ, however. For  example, it is profitable for banks to support financial  relations with us. The Norilskiy Nikel concern has an interest  in social protection for its 170,000-person collective working  under difficult conditions above the Arctic Circle. The  difference between our fund and the various other consumer  associations is that only juridical persons can be members of  the fund; however, we render assistance, above all legal, to all  consumers. With our small staff of nine, we are helped in this  by more than 300 experts free of charge, among them scientists,  economists, and jurists.    The main reason behind the fund, however, was to facilitate  the implementation of consumer rights laws, above all through  financing various programs (and in this it differs from other  consumer associations), for which we attract funds from various  sources. Right now we are conducting negotiations about this  with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the  Commission on the European Communities, and several other  organizations.    Since our fund is charitable, our sponsors and investors are  accorded the benefits envisioned by legislation if they invest  their funds in charitable projects, which is what the programs  carried out by the fund for certifying children's toys and  children's food are, as are the separate funds for protection  and safety (there are more than a thousand types, and their  production employs about 800 enterprises in the country).  Whereas the certification of items of automotive and tractor  machine-building is not considered a charitable act.    [DELOVOY MIR] What part of the spectrum of consumer rights  covers the activities of your fund? Do you defend the rights of  enterprises as consumers of various output?    [Kalinin] We protect the rights of consumers--physical  persons. As defined by the corresponding law. The rights of  consumers--juridical persons--are safeguarded by state organs,  as well as courts of arbitration. The spectrum of their rights  is extremely broad, from political to economic. The sphere of  our interests comprises primarily the economic rights of the  individual as a consumer of goods and services.    [DELOVOY MIR] Despite the diversity of violations of the  rights of our country's consumers, the main cause is the  monopolization of markets, which engenders the decreeing of  prices and the low quality of goods and services. What measures  should be undertaken to minimize the negative consequences of  the economy's monopolization?    [Kalinin] Price decrees were engendered by the poorly  thought  out state policy of price liberalization. This policy must  undergo cardinal change. As for the quality of output, given the  monopoly nature of production, it must be constantly monitored  from the outside. It has worked out that the quality of output,  its certification, and the reliability of the funds for  measurement are controlled basically by a single department, the  RF Gosstandart. True, one other organization is involved in  matters concerning expert analysis of consumer goods, the  all-Russian association Soyuzekspertiza, under the Chamber of  Commerce and Industry. This is obviously insufficient. Life  demands the creation of an extensive system of consumer expert  analysis and certification, including nonstate, in order to  eliminate the monopolism that exists in this sphere. Today  foodstuffs and the raw materials used in their production are  the most dangerous items on the consumer market. If foods are at  least somewhat monitored for safety for the individual, then the  initial raw materials remain outside the attention of the organs  of certification and oversight. It is important to obtain  certification and oversight for the technologies of production  of all foods, beginning with the places of cultivation and the  receipt of the initial components. A poisoned field cannot yield  a good product. Therefore, we must achieve the introduction of  complex systems of certification and oversight. Not only for  foods but for all consumer goods and services within the  framework of a system of state and independent consumer expert  analysis.    [DELOVOY MIR] The solution to this problem is connected with  the need to conduct a state policy of ensuring a uniformity of  certification and oversight, similar to the old policy of  ensuring the uniformity of measurements. Uniformity of  certification and oversight allows us to obtain identical and  reproducible results anywhere in the country. However, this  requires us to solve several problems of a methodological,  measurement, organizational, legislative, and technical nature.  In particular, it is essential to obtain uniformity of  standardization of measurement profiles and an evaluation of the  accuracy of the means of oversight. As it is done for the means  of measurement. For instance, scales and weights are the same  throughout the world. This allows us to weigh a kilo of potatoes  identically in Moscow and Nyu-Vasyuki.    [Kalinin] We have already run into these problems. Questions  arise, for example, about how to certify banking services.  Therefore we support the idea of creating both a common  methodological center for certification and technical expert  analysis and also specialized methodological centers, in  particular, a center for the monitoring and certification of the  radiation safety of consumer output. Several specialized centers  mentioned above have already been created with our support.    [DELOVOY MIR] Isn't it obviously just as important to  monitor  safety in the operation of machines and mechanisms utilized in  rendering various services? Especially the means of transport,  for which it makes sense to have built in a permanently  functioning system of oversight, and possibly certification as  well, with sensors at all danger points. Such systems make it  possible to avert catastrophes at the early stages of their  conception, when deviations of parameters from norms arise only  at discrete points and their number does not exceed a certain  level of danger. Apart from safety, this makes it possible to  increase significantly the intervals between capital repairs of  technical means and, consequently, the resource of their work  will grow, which will also create a significant economic effect.    [Kalinin] The creation at one site or another of permanent  systems of oversight and certification also must become the  concern of the corresponding independent methodological centers.  These are new commercial structures in which the fund is  actively investing its funds.    Right now we are working on the draft for a national  joint-stock insurance company, Kachestvo. We are talking about  insuring risks connected with the quality of goods and services.  On the basis of preliminary assessments of their quality, the  company will insure primarily trade enterprises against possible  losses due to poor-quality goods acquired for sale. This kind of  prophylactic insurance will make it possible to move our own  country's high-quality output into the market actively and with  guarantees, which undoubtedly will be in the interests of  consumers. At the same time such insurance will make it possible  to decrease the price decrees of monopolists. This insurance is  going to be implemented in our country for the first time.    [DELOVOY MIR] Here you are going to run into the  above-mentioned problem of assessing accuracy, that is,  guaranteeing the insurance risk for the company and, connected  with this, the margin of error in quality oversight, and  therefore the accuracy of the testing of output. That is, its  certification.    [Kalinin] In order to supply information for the work of the  fund and the centers being created, we are planning to organize  an electronic data bank, which will include all certified  output. This means it can become a part of the international  system, which will allow us, in conjunction with foreign  consumer rights protection funds, to disclose unconscientious  suppliers and importers and exports of poor-quality items not  only in Russia but in other countries as well.    The ordinary consumer needs a supply of information, too, so  we are planning to publish a series of brochures, hold a TV  marathon, and organize several newspaper hotlines in which our  experts and associates of the Certification VNII will  participate. I hope that DELOVOY MIR will not refuse our offer  to be a part of these efforts.    [DELOVOY MIR] With the release of prices and the beginning  of  the devastating devaluation of money, the state has for all  intents and purposes confiscated savings kept in the Sberbank  belonging to tens of millions of people. In doing so they  violated, mildly speaking, the rights of depositors who utilized  Sberbank's services. How does the fund intend to protect this  category of consumers?    [Kalinin] In a decent society, debts (and confiscated  savings  are a state debt) are repaid. Therefore we support all proposals  for the speedy compensation to depositors for losses and the  prevention henceforth of any similar disrespectful--boorish  even--treatment of consumers. People encountered the Sberbank's  loutishness in July of last year, too, during the exchange of  old banknotes for new, when they were forced to be crushed in  lines.    Generally speaking, in the sphere of consumer services, not  only is the dignity of citizens being trampled on as before, but  their material interests are suffering as well. Prices for  services have risen thousands of times. The sphere of consumer  services is contracting since many can no longer afford  services. Moreover, the quality of those services, due to the  increased monopolism, is declining. Recently we conducted a  check of several dozen Moscow photo studios. Long since  privatized, naturally. In several of them control photographs  were made from our sample negatives, and the pictures differed  substantially from the originals. Moreover, the studios lacked  proper calculation, and prices were set arbitrarily. This is not  even talking about how rude some photographers were.    [DELOVOY MIR] How can you protect consumers from price  tyranny in our pseudo-market environment?    [Kalinin] We can't, for all practical purposes. However, we  are determined to undertake several steps. After all, given  monopolism, many prices are born from the desire to rip as much  as possible out of the consumer's pocket for personal  consumption. Therefore these people have to be regulated and  restricted somehow. Today the state is allowing anarchy in price  formation.    [DELOVOY MIR] I think that the uncontrolled growth of prices  under monopolism is born out of a desire for uncompensated  borrowing at the expense of the consumer. After all, bank loans  today entail 220 percent annual interest. The monopolist has  raised prices in order to replenish his own circulating funds  without burdening himself with debts, so he has obtained the  necessary loan. Free of charge and forever. I think that the  Metropolitan and telephone communications are expanding today by  extorting money in this manner. The simplest calculation shows  that if the Moscow Metro is used daily by 10 million passengers,  daily receipts come to 500 million rubles. Given this kind of  income, is the systematic increase in the cost of travel  justified?    [Kalinin] I have attempted to familiarize myself with the  expenses and bookkeeping balance sheets of the Metropolitan. I  did not succeed, however. Everything is cloaked in secret. After  all, though, the Metropolitan is a a state enterprise. What then  is there to say about private, especially trade enterprises?  There the buyer is deceived as before: they misweigh and  miscount.    [DELOVOY MIR] But what if all buyers are transformed into  non-staff monitors? With payment to them of a specific portion  of the fine exacted from the violator if the violation has been  revealed by the buyer. Moreover, the fine must be quite  substantial.    [Kalinin] That suggestion is worth considering.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of  Liberia], Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, says there appears to be  some wavering among some members of the NPFL representation on  the Liberian National Transitional Government [LNTG]. He said  he does not know what is responsible for some of these  individuals' behaving like weaklings who have become bought over.    Mr. Taylor said some members of his delegation are behaving  like defectors and said it will not be surprising to the NPFL,  because it has had a similar experience in Monrovia involving  Mr. Togba Mackintosh Gewieh. The NPFL leader disclosed that he  has received information from Monrovia that some NPFL ministers  are wavering and planning to participate in confirmation hearing  contrary to the earlier position of the NPFL that it will not  partially sit on the transitional government.    Mr. Taylor said the NPFL will not tolerate any halfway  seating of the transitional government. Mr. Taylor, however,  said the NPFL has no intention to withdraw from the peace  process and will do everything to ensure lasting peace in  Liberia. Although Mr. Taylor (?did not agree with) officials of  the NPFL who are wavering, some nominated ministers from the  NPFL to the LNTG have been confirmed by the Transitional  Legislative Assembly.    Those who have assumed offices are Justice Minister Laveli  Supuwood, Labor Minister Tom Woewiyu, Internal Affairs Minister  Samuel Dhokie, and the minister of lands, mines and energy, Z.  Dehkie.</p>

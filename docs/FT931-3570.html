			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Delors to meet Clinton on trade row - The meeting may offer an opportunity to defuse escalating US-EC tensions MR Jacques Delors, European Commission President, will hold talks with President Bill Clinton in Washington on Thursday, a long-planned meeting which will offer a chance to defuse the escalation in EC-US trade tensions. A senior EC official said Mr Delors would urge Mr Clinton to resist the temptation to act unilaterally to resolve trade disputes and to co-operate with the EC on a growth initiative to revive the world economy. 'This is an important meeting for them to start a good working relationship,' the official said. The Clinton administration's focus on rebuilding US competitiveness has unnerved Brussels, where fears of a resurgent America taking advantage of a politically and economically weakened EC are rife. Mr Delors himself has occasionally raised the threat of US hegemony, rather than the balanced partnership of equals. The EC was taken aback last Friday after the Clinton administration unexpectedly withdrew from talks aimed at settling a dispute over 'Buy European' and 'Buy American' clauses covering rules for government procurement. The move escalated tensions already inflamed by EC-US disagreements on commercial aircraft subsidies, steel subsidies and the stalled Gatt Round. Last Friday, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said the US would 'most probably' bar European companies from winning certain federal contracts in telecommunications and power generation, starting from March 22. A spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external affairs, said the Commission was considering all options, including retaliation. EC officials described the US trade representative as 'unpredictable.' His abrupt decision to call off negotiations embarrassed Sir Leon who claimed a recent trip to Washington had cemented relations with him. Mr Kantor broke off negotiations after learning the EC would not waive Article 29 in the EC utilities directive which gives EC companies a 3 per cent price preference over foreigners and favoured treatment to EC bidders offering more than 50 per cent local content.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Paris resists 'strong-arm' UK tactics in Orly row Britain's confrontation with France over access to Orly airport in Paris heated up yesterday. The British government gave 'full support' to UK carriers planning to start services from London to Orly on Monday while the French government said it would not bow to 'strong-arm tactics'. The row threatens to undermine European efforts to liberalise air transport and to provoke fresh strains within the European Union. Britain's Department of Transport said it was reviewing its position and taking legal advice over possible retaliation should France carry out its threat to ban UK airlines from landing at Orly on Monday. 'We are quite convinced that under European Union rules UK carriers have the right to fly to Orly,' a British government official said, adding: 'What we do ultimately depends on what happens on Monday.' Mr Bernard Bosson, French transport minister, said Paris rejected the 'strong-arm tactics' being used by British Airways and Air UK, confirming Wednesday's declaration that flights between London and Orly could not start on Monday. The French minister reaffirmed his willingness to open the route, but said it was necessary to overcome a number of problems, including congestion at Orly and environmental issues. He said it would take 'a maximum of a few weeks' to resolve these difficulties. 'I'm absolutely flabbergasted that they are trying to force our hand,' he added. Both BA and Air UK confirmed they would go ahead with their flights to Orly on Monday. British Midland, second largest UK scheduled carrier after BA, said it also felt 'particularly aggrieved' by the French stance but planned to start services to Orly in September when it hoped 'the mud had settled'. Mr Bosson also raised the issue of landing slots at London's Heathrow airport which he claimed was 'hardly open to French carriers'. Mr David Holmes, BA's head of government affairs, said Air France had more flights than BA from Charles de Gaulle, the main Paris airport, to Heathrow. There were no restrictions on Air France flights to London. Orly was less crowded than Heathrow and not as congested as London's Gatwick airport and the French authorities 'had no right to prevent our flights', he said. BA's French affiliate, TAT, also planned to start Orly-London services on Monday, Mr Holmes said. UK carriers regard the French move as an effort by Paris to delay the introduction of more competition at Orly at the expense of Air Inter, Air France's domestic subsidiary.</p>

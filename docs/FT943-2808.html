			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Spain may ease bond curbs The Bank of Spain said yesterday it was studying a relaxation of its strict accounting regulations on bond portfolio provisioning by domestic financial institutions, in a move that should sharply increase home demand for government paper. Pressure for easier rulings has come from both the domestic banks, which have suffered losses in their trading operations this year, and from the treasury, which is becoming concerned over net medium- and long-term bond sales by non-residents. Government paper held by Spanish banks in active trading portfolios currently has to be marked to market on a monthly basis and losses must be fully provided. The regulations are less aggressive for bonds held in investment portfolios but are also considered to be more stringent than those imposed by other central banks.</p>

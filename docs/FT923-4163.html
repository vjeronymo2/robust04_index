			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The TUC At Blackpool: Plans for sweeping reform win support THE Trades Union Congress yesterday agreed a radical structural and operational shake-up in the wake of the Conservative party's fourth successive election victory and its proposals for further employment legislation. Delegates to the TUC's annual congress in Blackpool agreed to consider six priority tasks. These include a campaign for full employment and lobbying against planned trade union legislation. The reforms follow a 20 per cent cut in the TUC's staff earlier this year. Some union leaders yesterday indicated that they believed further changes were overdue. Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering workers' and electricians union, said Congress House - the TUC's headquarters - had become an overburdened packhorse for every social change that crossed its threshold. 'The TUC's strength is the world of work and we should play to it.' There was no criticism of Mr Norman Willis, the TUC's general secretary, who has been under pressure recently and expected by some to resign. He received warm applause after his opening speech arguing the case for full employment. 'We have to assert that unemployment is not the price we must pay for getting the economy right, it is the price we pay for having got it wrong.' Mr Alan Johnson, general-secretary-elect of the UCW postal workers' union, said there were millions of workers who would join unions if given an opportunity. The TUC had to tackle declining membership and its own abysmal public profile, Mr Johnson said. It could provide a focal point for attracting membership, particularly for people working in small organisations. The TUC could assist in removing bureaucratic barriers to union membership by publicising national helplines and assisting respondents in joining the appropriate union. Mr Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary of the CPSA Civil Service union, said the unions did not have a 'scintilla of influence' over government policy. 'In fact we have less influence than some pressure groups one hundredth our size. He added: 'Instead of constantly attacking other people's ideas, we must produce our own.' Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said that because the political climate had not changed last April, it was the TUC that had to. It should concentrate on co-ordinating activities, building strong European links and maintaining good relations between affiliates, he said.</p>

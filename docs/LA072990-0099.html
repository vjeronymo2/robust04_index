			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ERROR ON ART  </P> <P> In David Nelson's review of La Jolla Seas restaurant ("A Downscale House in an  Upscale Neighborhood, La Jolla Seas Takes Middle Road," July 13) an error was  made in the description of the artwork.  </P> <P> Rather than being lithographs, the art, commissioned by Art Consultants-West  and painted by La Jolla artist Mirto Golino, is original. Each piece was  created specifically for the La Jolla Seas project. Windansea Beach and La  Jolla Cove are two local sites depicted in Mirto's original works on paper.  </P> <P> VICTORIA TEAGUE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

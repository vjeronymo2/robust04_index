			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NASH PHOTOGRAPHY SALE WILL BENEFIT MUSEUM  </P> <P> Pop musician Graham Nash has decided to auction his widely acclaimed collection  of photography, but he won't take all the money and run. A generous portion of  the proceeds will go to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for the  acquisition of non-traditional photographs.  </P> <P> A sale of more than 450 works from Nash's collection, scheduled for April 25 at  Sotheby's New York, is expected to bring more than $2 million. Nash intends to  recoup his investment -- an amount that has yet to be determined by his  accountants. Once he has recovered his costs, he will split his profit with the  museum. In addition, Nash will donate about 140 of the most up-to-date  photographs to the museum.  </P> <P> Why is he selling?  </P> <P> "I love the thrill of the chase and the energy of new fields. In the '60s, that  energy was in rock 'n' roll. In the '70s, it was in collecting photography,"  said Nash, who rose to fame in the '60s with the rock group Crosby, Stills  &amp; Nash.  </P> <P> During the '80s, Nash said, his interests turned from photography's historical  spectrum to contemporary works done with experimental techniques including  computers. He has collected up-to-the-minute photographs, but now he will turn  that job over to an institution that can handle the job professionally.  </P> <P> Nash's gift of about 140 works from the '80s will give a considerable boost to  the museum's small collection. The auction proceeds should put the County  Museum of Art on the map as a collector of contemporary photography. While  photography prices have risen dramatically along with the rest of the art  market, photographs are still relatively affordable. Nash's money gift -- which  could total several hundred thousand dollars -- will be significant.  </P> <P> "We are delighted and very grateful, particularly at a time when gifts to  museums are very hard to develop. Graham Nash's generosity will go a long, long  way to help us build a mature department of photography," said museum director  Earl A. Powell.  </P> <P> The Nash auction will be "the most important single-owner sale of photographs  ever to come to auction," according to Beth Gates-Warren, director of Sotheby's  department of photographs.  </P> <P> The most expensive piece, expected to bring at least $60,000, is Paul  Outerbridge's 1927 photograph depicting himself in a mask and top hat.  </P> <P> A complete report on Nash's collection will be in the Tuesday Calendar section.  </P></p>

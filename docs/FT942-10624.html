			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Back benches warm to referendum The prime minister yesterday came under pressure from senior Conservative backbenchers to promise a referendum on the next stage of European integration as a means of uniting the party. There were strong signs at Westminster yesterday that the majority of the party would be behind Mr John Major - albeit unenthusiastically in some cases - if he decided to adopt such a course. Significantly, some MPs who had previously opposed a referendum said privately yesterday that they were now inclined to support one. One MP with more than 20 years' experience said he was coming around to the idea, and added: 'That is a definite shift in my position. There is a democratic deficit since all three major parties were in favour of Maastricht.' Where there was dissent, it came mainly from representatives of the two extremes of opinion on Europe. The most ardently pro-European Tory MPs believe that far from uniting the party, a referendum pledge would make the split on Europe still more apparent. 'The Tory party would be so clearly ranged upon either side of a referendum campaign that we would have to wait for years before it took place,' said one. 'I'm frantically trying to tell the whips: 'Don't be so bloody stupid.' ' The hardline Euro-sceptics generally want a referendum much sooner than any prime ministerial pledge is likely to envisage, and certainly before 1996 when the next EU inter-governmental conference is due to be held. The advice from members of the executive of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, however, was that Mr Major should quickly throw his weight behind the idea of a referendum if the 1996 inter-governmental conference paved the way for increased European integration through measures such as a single European currency. 'A commitment to the principle of a referendum would be therapeutic,' said one member of the executive. Another said that while he would oppose staging a referendum immediately, he would certainly support holding one in 1996. These views coincided with the opinion of Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who said: 'The proper point to hold a referendum would be if there were any move towards a single currency.' The Euro-sceptic position was put forward by Mr Bill Cash, the MP for Stafford, who said a referendum should take place as soon as possible after next month's elections for the European parliament. 'This issue is about the whole question of the government of the UK in the future,' he said. 'It is about the new landscape of Europe for the next century and therefore it is absolutely essential the people of this country are consulted before these decisions are taken.' Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former minister, said the party should 'immediately come out for a referendum before any more powers are given to Europe and are removed from this country'. A referendum would unite the Conservatives on European policies in the vital run-up to the European elections, he added. Several MPs compared the position to the situation at the time of Labour's 1975 referendum on Europe when, they said, Lord Wilson, then prime minister, needed to unite his party.</p>

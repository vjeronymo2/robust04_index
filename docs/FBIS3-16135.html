			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Excerpts] Tokyo, 12 Mar -- Aleksandr Rodin, first deputy  head of the Russian Federation fisheries committee, who headed  the Russian delegation at the two-week-long Russian-Japanese  talks on salmon fishing which ended in Tokyo today, said the  results of the talks met Russia's national interests. He told  an ITAR-TASS correspondent that an agreement had been reached to  cut the catch of salmon by Japan in Russia's economic zone by  1,000 tons as against last year's catch and to keep the size of  the catch in Japanese waters of salmon from Russia at the same  level as last year's.    This means that this year Japanese fishermen have the right  to catch no more than 14,000 tons of Russian river salmon inside  the Russian economic zone and no more that 4,800 tons in  Japanese waters. [passage omitted]    The head of the Russian delegation said that the decision  was  also made at the talks that Japan, as before, would compensate  Russia for some of its expenditure on scientific research on  salmon, on breeding and protecting them. [passage omitted]    The first deputy head of the fisheries committee noted that  the results of the talks in Tokyo would in no way have a  negative influence upon Russia's salmon supply.

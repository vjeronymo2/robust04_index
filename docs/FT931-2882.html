			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News in Brief: Effjohn INTENSE competition on its key Baltic sailing routes sent Effjohn, the Helsinki-based shipping group, plunging to a FM261m (Dollars 43.21m) loss after financial items in 1992, writes Christopher Brown-Humes The result was also blighted by floating exchange rates, a Finnish travel tax, and heavy interest payments following extensive investments in new tonnage. The group is scrapping its dividend, after paying FM1.20 a share in 1991 when it made FM4m profit after financial items.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Arts: Heavyweight 'Moose' - Mime but when a lot of my friends say 'I hate mime,' I reply 'I know what you mean.' To them, 'mime' means butch and bright-eyed eager beavers, with a mental age of about 14, hamming away like crazy, nudging the audience to understand the gist of their every point, making every point not once but repeatedly, and labouring to 'say' things in movement that could be said far quicker in words. Alas, The Right Size, a group of three men, fits right bang into that category in its current show, Moose. This production tells the farcical-tragico-sentimental-comic tale of two ballooning brothers who manage to maroon themselves in the wintriest areas of the Arctic. The sweetest thing about the show is in fact the story it tells - a story that also involves an Anglophone loner into whose one-room hut these brothers arrive; the ludicrous efforts they make to communicate with him until they realise that he speaks their language anyway; the stupid games they play with him (over a dreadfully meagre meal and a stupendously lethal drink); the barriers he puts up to keep them out of his inner life; and his real need for company. All of which is often touching, and could have made a vintage silent movie. The best joke is a repeated joke about mime: whenever these guys try sign language, they misunderstand each other totally. What stops Moose from becoming wonderful, or even good, is the heavyweight cuteness with which it is performed. As so often with (second-rate) mime, the performers do too little to make their onstage world real, and keep on selling everything oh] so keenly to their audience. The quota of violence is high, the degree of virtuoso physical skill moderate, the quota of revealing human detail low, the quota of coherent subtlety nearly non-existent. The story, I repeat, is endearing. Yet anyone can imagine how some of the great actor-clowns of the silent-movie era could have turned Moose into a work of art, whereas here it is merely a heavy-handed romp. The Right Size performs Moose at the Purcell Room tonight. The London Mime Festival continues, in various venues, until Monday January 31</p>

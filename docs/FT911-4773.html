			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Iraq urges UN to relax oil ban IRAQ is asking the UN Security Council to relax the ban on the sale of its oil so that Baghdad may obtain a total of Dollars 942.5m (Pounds 526.5m) to buy food and to meet 'basic humanitarian needs'. UN officials said last night they expect the Council's sanctions committee to meet tomorrow to consider the request. Easing the ban would require the assent of all 15 committee members. The responses of the US, Britain and France will be guided by Iraqi action following a decision of the three powers to set up secure camps in northern Iraq in an expanded relief programme for Kurdish refugees fleeing brutal repression by Iraqi troops. Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, the Iraqi delegate, discussed the situation yesterday with Mr Thomas Pickering, the US representative. He told reporters later: 'We believe there is no need for foreign forces to protect the Kurds because they are really protected by our own people.' Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN secretary-general, who discussed the Kurdish crisis in Paris with French officials, again emphasised a need to respect Iraqi sovereignty. If refugee camps were to be maintained under UN auspices the entire operation must be approved by the Iraqi government and the Security Council, he said. The western permanent members' attitude towards Baghdad's request to resume oil shipments is expected to be influenced also by how far Iraq goes towards complying with the Security Council's order for the destruction of its chemical, biological and ballistic weapons and nuclear weapon-usable material. Under the Council's terms for a permanent ceasefire, which Iraq accepted unconditionally last Friday, details of the amounts and locations must be given today to the secretary-general. The International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna has to be informed by the same deadline about any nuclear weapons material that Iraq possesses. An international commission is to be set up to supervise the destruction of all of Iraq's most dangerous weapons.</p>

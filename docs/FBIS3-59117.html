			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/43: "Nuclear Security and </F> Efficiency in East Europe"; as released by Brussels RAPID  database]    [Text] Commission Vice President Henning Christophersen  welcomed the adoption by the European Parliament yesterday of a  project which will contribute to financing the improvement of  the safety and efficiency of nuclear sites in the countries of  Central and East Europe as well as in the Republics of the  former USSR.    The Commission proposal will allow a total of ECU1.1 billion  in EURATOM loans to be earmarked for this project.    The vice president stressed that the text adopted by the  (European) Parliament confirms that the Parliament as well as  the Commission deem improving nuclear safety a priority.  According to Mr. Christophersen, a political consensus has  already been reached within the Council. Quick approval of the  decision, which will make the program operational, is expected,  and the efforts already made within the framework of the PHARE  [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] and TACIS  [CIS Technical Assistance] programs thus will be enhanced.    The proposal is in line with the conclusions of the European  Council of Lisbon in June 1992.    The decision will be implemented in cooperation with the  European Bank for Investment, which will assess the projects in  economic and financial terms.    According to the vice president, this decision will make it  possible for the Commission to initiate an important program in  line with its priorities in the field of security, environmental  protection, and foreign relations.</p>

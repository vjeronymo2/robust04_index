			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Poland's PM lets finance minister go Poland faces a shift away from tight budget policies following the acceptance by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, prime minister, of his finance minister's resignation. Mr Marek Borowski, a member of the Social Democratic party (SLD), offered to quit last week after failing to win assurances from Mr Pawlak, who heads the Peasant party (PSL), that co-ordination of economic policy would be improved within the two-party governing coalition. Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader, who had been urging Mr Pawlak to keep Mr Borowski, said yesterday he was 'inclined to look for a compromise', suggesting that he would not put the four-month-old coalition at risk over the resignation. Mr Borowski departs as parliamentary committees debate this year's draft budget before a final vote later this month. The budget, which assumes a 4.2 per cent deficit in gross domestic product, has already been agreed with the International Monetary Fund, whose approval is crucial to a decision on reducing Poland's Dollars 30bn Paris Club debt by 20 per cent at the end of March. The present draft budget differs little from that planned by the previous government led by Ms Hanna Suchocka, whose election defeat last autumn paved the way for the present coalition. Mr Pawlak said on television last night that the draft would be modified, but the changes would 'respect the needs of the economy', implying awareness of the inflationary dangers of too great a change. The shift in tone comes as opinion polls are telling the government that its support is waning, and precedes a large street demonstration planned for tomorrow by the Solidarity trade union in Warsaw.</p>

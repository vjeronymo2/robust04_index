			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Swiss Bank Corporation dips 7.7% SWISS Bank Corporation (SBC), Switzerland's second largest bank, said consolidated pre-tax profit before exceptional items and provisions fell 7.7 per cent in the first half to SFr1.24bn (Dollars 944m), mainly due to the costs connected with integrating recent acquisitions. SBC also signalled a weaker result and higher provisions in the full year than it had hoped for. 'Although no end to the current phase of high interest rates is yet in sight, the bank believes it may be possible to achieve a cash flow figure close to the previous year's good result,' the company said. In March, Mr Walter Frehner, chief executive, said the bank had ambitious goals and the directors were confident they would generate 'good results' during the year. The group's personnel costs soared 18.3 per cent in the first half to SFr1.3bn, with two thirds of the rise coming from the newly consolidated companies, BSI and the Dominguez Barry group. Business and office overheads jumped 27 per cent to SFr755m, in part because of exceptional costs in connection with the integration of the O'Connor derivatives business. Consolidated commission income jumped 30 per cent to SFr1.01bn with brokerage and revenues from portfolio management and investment funds both rising substantially. A 5.9 per cent fall in income from financial operations and trading to SFr635m came mainly from securities, while the 5.5 per cent rise in net interest earnings to SFr1.6bn was due to the consolidation of Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI) and higher interest bearing assets abroad. Total consolidated assets at the end of June at SFr201bn were 2.9 per cent lower than at the end of last year. Customer lending was flat at SFr118bn.</p>

The soldiers  returned fire, wounding 'Adil Abu-al-'Abduh. Our correspondent  Shlomi Eldar reports that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]  has claimed responsibility for the gunfire at an IDF observation  post near the Ganey Tal settlement yesterday which slightly  wounded a soldier.    Yesterday Hamas organized a large-scale mourning rally in  commemoration of Ibrahim Salama, a Hamas fugitive shot dead by  soldiers at the Eretz checkpoint last week. About 8,000 people  participated in the rally. Ibrahim Salama had been involved in  a series of violent attacks in which soldiers were killed.  Addressing the rally were Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders, as  well as a Fatah representative. Fugitives affiliated with the  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad fired in the air and pledged  revenge. Yesterday the Islamic Jihad marked Jerusalem Day,  which is celebrated on the instructions of Iranian leader  Ayatollah Khomeyni. Israeli and U.S. flags were burned at the  rally.    A Border Police unit captured three Palestinians armed with  Kalashnikov rifles in Gaza's al-Shaja'iyah neighborhood tonight.  Our correspondent Shlomi Eldar reports that the troops  identified the men in a moving car and detained them without  encountering resistance. One of the detained Palestinians,  'Imad Muhammad Mashrawi, is a Fatah Hawks fugitive.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Names allowed limited liability Lloyd's of London yesterday gave the go-ahead for individual members of the market to make a switch away from underwriting insurance policies on the basis of unlimited liability. Formal approval has been given for Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market, to transfer their investments in Lloyd's to limited liability companies in time for the 1995 underwriting year. Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said it had overcome 'many technical complexities' and the move marked 'another step forward' for Lloyd's, which has been plagued by heavy losses in recent years. Citibank, the subsidiary of US group Citicorp, has already announced a scheme which would allow Names to take advantage of the arrangements. Lloyd's has failed so far however, to agree arrangements that would permit the so-called 'inter-availability' of funds - by which Names could underwrite via a limited liability company and continue underwriting as an individual. This may make it difficult for many existing Names to take advantage of the latest rule changes. If they face the possibility of heavy losses from previous years' underwriting, the cost of transfering those obligations into a new company may prove prohibitive. The timetable is also tight for significant numbers of Names to convert by next year. The new schemes would work by, in effect, 'reinsuring' liabilities on outstanding policies that they have underwritten into an individual 'NameCo'. Lloyd's has agreed that NameCos should hold a minimum of Pounds 100,000 at the insurance market, compared with the Pounds 1.5m required from companies set up in the past two years to inject corporate capital into the market.</p>

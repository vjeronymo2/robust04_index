			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Sterling convertible bonds return to favour THE POUND'S reversal of fortune in recent months has provided a welcome boost for sterling-denominated convertible bonds. As last week's successful Pounds 91m convertible bond issue from SG Warburg Group demonstrated, continental European investors are avid buyers of Eurosterling equity-linked paper: they are keen on the currency, feel they have protection on the downside, and they expect to see a recovery in the stock market performance in a few months' time. How things have changed. Less than a year ago, sterling was branded the black sheep of the European exchange rate mechanism as repeated attempts to support the pound failed, leading to sterling's ignominious departure from the ERM last September. That left the Bank of England free to cut interest rates quite dramatically with the result that the yield curve shifted from inverted to positive. Since then, sterling has enjoyed a revival from overseas investors either looking for the currency to appreciate or, in more recent times, regarding it as a safe haven while other ERM currencies take a buffeting. The fall in interest rates has meant that UK companies have been able to issue convertible bonds with much lower coupons than circumstances would have dictated a year ago - hence the flood of equity-linked offerings from names such as Inchcape (the UK-based motor and business-services group), Sedgwick (the insurance broker), P&amp;O (the transport group), and Yorkshire Water. 'From the investors' point of view, they may be dropping a bit in bond yield when they buy a convertible bond (as opposed to a straight bond), but they expect in six or 12-months' time to be riding on the back of a very strong equity market as the recovery in the UK economy takes off,' says one convertible bond specialist. A fund manager at a French bank says: 'We've been very positive on these convertible bond issues: we like the quality of the paper, the pricings were in line with the market, we're positive on the pound and we're positive on the stock market.' The string of successes was interrupted by Allied-Lyons, the drinks, food and retailing group, which launched a Pounds 200m, 15-year convertible bond issue in May. The deal was deemed a flop at the time, with many claiming it had been mispriced, although the price has since recovered. Some felt at the time that that failure might dent demand for further issues although that has not proved the case. Indeed, one of the market's talking points is who might come next. There are rumours that one of the power or electricity companies might launch a convertible bond shortly. Equity-linked experts point out that some of the banks would be suitable candidates given that they are seen as 'recovery plays', like the insurance companies which have already tapped the sterling convertible bond sector. 'There are some deals in the pipeline, but perhaps they are looking for that extra interest rate cut before they go ahead,' says one analyst. There is also plenty of discussion about the trend in coupons, which have been in the range of 6.25 per cent (for Inchcape) to say 7.25 per cent (for Sedgwick). For Swiss and other continental investors, these coupons are still seen as attractive. Recent issues have tended to come at the lower end of the indicated coupon range, and the higher end of the indicated conversion premium range. Some convertible bond experts wonder whether the next issuer will be able to breach the 6 per cent coupon level. 'I think to break through 6 per cent you would need to have a really good, top ten name, and it would be difficult, especially since short-term interest rates have edged up a touch,' argues one equity-linked specialist while conceding that 'the temptation for the borrower to push through 6 per cent must be overwhelming'. Another expert argues: 'You certainly could get a coupon of below 6 per cent, but investors are generally yield-hungry so in terms of the market we know that deals go better with a higher coupon.'</p>

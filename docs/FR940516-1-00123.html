			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's cost estimate assumes that catalytic converters will not be needed to comply with proposed standards. However, as discussed previously, engine manufacturers may voluntarily decide to use catalysts on a percentage of engines at risk of only marginally complying. Should catalysts actually be used, EPA estimates that the additional variable hardware costs for nonhandheld engines will be $1.09 per engine and for handheld engine will be $0.10 per engine, with an additional $0.24 per engine for equipment modifications and $0.20 per potential heat shielding. The Agency requests additional comment on these cost estimates for application of catalyst technology and equipment impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Economic Effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The total national average annual cost of this rule is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to be $55 million. If catalysts become necessary, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average annual cost estimate becomes $73 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's economic analysis of the proposed rule's likely impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on consumers and industry indicates that reducing pollution from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these engines will result in offsetting costs to consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consumers will find small increases in retail prices for most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment powered by these engines. The initial purchase price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the consumer will, however, be partially offset by savings in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel and maintenance costs. Thus, over time, environmentally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> friendly, alternatively powered equipment such as electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> powered trimmers, chain saws, and lawnmowers will become less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costly to consumers. Industry will bear pollution control costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are moderate (roughly six percent for handheld and two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent for nonhandheld equipment) relative to current production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs. (The level of pollution control costs is largely due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the high levels of pollution emitted by these engines, especially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2-stroke engines, and the relatively outdated state of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology compared to on-highway engines.) However, the costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are small in absolute terms, and it is anticipated that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs will be passed through to consumers in higher product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices. The complete economic analysis can be found in Chapter 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the draft RSD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Consumer Cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA estimated the increase in consumer cost of the equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> powered by these engines. In assessing consumer cost, three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas were analyzed: change to the retail cost of the engine,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of fuel, and cost of maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Retail Cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The increase in retail price of the equipment to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer is estimated using a percentage increase over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average amortized and discounted per engine manufacturers' cost,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weighted by the sales mix. As such, the estimated sales-weighted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average increase in retail cost to the consumer due to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule in 1996 is $4.04 for handheld equipment and $2.35  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for nonhandheld equipment. If catalysts are necessary, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated sales-weighted average increase in retail cost to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer due to the proposed rule in 1996 is $4.30 for handheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment and $3.68 for nonhandheld equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

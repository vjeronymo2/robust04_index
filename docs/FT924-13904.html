			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 3.65m sale by Medeva of non-core products MEDEVA, one of the newest arrivals on the pharmaceuticals scene, is raising Pounds 3.65m from the sale of some of the products which it bought as part of a package from Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham earlier in the year. 'We have achieved the acquisition of the jewels without having to hang on to the others,' said Mr David Lees, finance director. The 'core' products being kept include Pregaday, Fefol and Feospan, which are iron supplement products for pregnant women. The products being sold to Goldshield Pharmaceuticals and Forley have annual sales of Pounds 2.5m. The consideration represents a slightly lower multiple of sales to that obtained by Glaxo and SB when Medeva paid Pounds 18.4m for the original package.</p>

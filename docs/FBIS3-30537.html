He hopes that the current  changes in Russia will not translate into a freeze or halt the  reforms. "If they (the reforms) were to stop halfway, it could  be worse than if they were not implemented at all," he  emphasized.    Havel, who assumed the post of president of the Czech  Republic just a year ago, was also asked what developments he  would wish for. "Regarding our Republic, I would like the  economic transformation to be successfully completed, our  country to be politically stable and quickly integrated into the  European structures. I would like a civic society to flourish  here, and decency, gentlemanliness, and political culture be  enhanced here," Havel answered.</p>

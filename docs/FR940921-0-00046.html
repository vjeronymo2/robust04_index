			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the requirements for natural gas refueling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stations, EPA is also requiring in today's rule natural gas-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks be equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refueling receptacles which comply with the recently adopted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/AGA NGV1 standard. This requirement will be implemented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the timing of the ORVR provisions for other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles (three year phase-in beginning with the 1998 model year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for light-duty vehicles and the 2001 model year for light-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trucks). The Agency expects, however, that all new natural gas-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fueled vehicles will have ANSI/AGA NGV1 nozzles long before this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to the desire for standardized refueling coupling geometry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA does not believe that the cost of the refueling station  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls is prohibitive and believes that today's requirement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both feasible and reasonable. Consistent with this view, most new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stations being installed would meet this requirement. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agrees that in certain cases, such as those where additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compression equipment is needed, the cost of retrofitting may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be reasonable. Thus, for in-use refueling stations which must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retrofitted to meet this requirement, the Agency will waive the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in situations where the station operator can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with this provision would require the use of additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compression equipment, or other similar costs. The impact of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waivers should be minimal given the small number of stations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently operating, and the small percentage of those stations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would not currently meet these requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As was discussed earlier, the lack of exhaust THC standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in today's rule is a function of cost and legal constraints, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency believes that control of methane is appropriate where it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is feasible and economically reasonable. Thus, EPA does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that the desire to control refueling emissions from natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas vehicles is inconsistent with the adoption of exhaust NMHC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. LPG Vehicle/Pump Interface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the proposal:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since LPG is transferred in a sealed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system there is little concern about refueling emissions at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle/pump interface during the actual fuel transfer. Of concern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Agency, however, are emissions released when the nozzle is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disconnected from the vehicle. At this point any fuel which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trapped in the dead space between the nozzle and the vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receptacle is released. In the NPRM the Agency proposed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refueling equipment be designed so as to prevent this escape of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel, such as through the use of low-loss, no-bleed couplings,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although no specific numerical standards were included. As with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the natural gas provisions in the NPRM, the timing of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement was not explicit in the NPRM preamble. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory text stated that the provisions would take effect with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1994 model year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency received few comments on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular aspect of the proposed refueling provisions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments that addressed this issue tended to agree with the need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for control. However, the comments otherwise differed. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that any hardware requirement be performance-based, rather than prescriptive, so as to be consistent with EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous consideration of refueling controls for gasoline vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the lack of a numerical standard was interpreted as being a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zero-emission standard, which one commenter suggested is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infeasible. Another commenter stated that just requiring new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refueling nozzles at all current LPG fueling facilities would cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about $30 million, but provided no supporting documentation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response to comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency believes that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to minimize the amount of LPG fuel which is vented from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the dead space between the refueling nozzle check valve and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle refueling receptacle check valve but also agrees that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zero-emission standard is unreasonable. Both the nozzle and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle receptacle geometries play an integral role in the size of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this dead space. Thus, any performance specification for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle/pump interface refueling emissions would have to address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nozzle and receptacle as a single system. In the case of LPG,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is not a standardized geometry for refueling nozzles, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least in terms of the parameters which would affect this dead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> space. Thus, it is difficult for the Agency to define a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance specification such as that which has been considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for gasoline vehicles based upon an industry standard nozzle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geometry. The Agency is aware that the LPG industry is developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nozzles which dramatically reduce the dead space, especially when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in conjunction with low-bleed inserts in the vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receptacle.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

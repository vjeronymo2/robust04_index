			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALERS PUT PRICE ON ACTIVIST'S LIFE  </P> <P> Drug dealers placed a $10,000 price on the head of feisty anti-drug crusader  C.W. Roddy, who has waged a high-profile war against pushers in her  crime-ridden neighborhood, the FBI said Friday.  </P> <P> An underworld "contract" was put out on the life of Roddy after she received  national publicity for her one-woman war against dealers, FBI Agent William  Smith said at a news conference at City Hall.  </P> <P> Roddy, 60, a retired telephone company worker, said she would not be  intimidated by threats.  </P> <P> Roddy narrowly escaped injury New Year's Eve when two suspected dealers stood  across the street from her stucco house and opened fire with semiautomatic  weapons. Bullets grazed Roddy's abdomen and punched holes in walls, windows and  furniture.  </P></p>

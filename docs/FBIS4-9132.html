			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Stanislav Devaty, security and information </F> service director, by Jiri Stastny; place and date not given:  "The Security and Information Service Is Satisfied With  Control"]    [Text] The parliamentary Defense and Security Committee  debated the government bill on the Security and Information  Service [BIS] on 13 April. This bill should regulate the status  of BIS members, the utilization of intelligence-gathering  devices, and the BIS status and its control. After the debate,  we asked interim BID Director Stanislav Devaty:    [Stastny] The majority of the amendments provide you with  more powers than the draft bill you have presented. Why were  you so restricted when drafting your bill?    [Devaty] When we worked on our draft, we based our  considerations strictly on the Principles for the Law on  Intelligence Services. Our draft has undergone a very rigorous  vetting procedure. BIS welcomes the changes, of course, because  they allow us to work better.    [Stastny] Are you satisfied with the fact that BIS is under  the control of parliament?    [Devaty] I welcome any kind of control. This protects me as  well. For instance, when I am attacked in the press, I can  address this control body and demand that this problem be sorted  out. In my opinion, the parliamentary committee should control  all BIS activities because it is responsible for them. A  separate law will define what will be in parliament's  jurisdiction.    [Stastny] How do you view volunteers for cooperation with  BIS, and what is their role in the fight against organized crime?    [Devaty] The basic requirement is the will to cooperate.  There is no other alternative. Cooperation with those people is  one of the methods being used by all of the secret services all  over the world. In some instances, if we want to penetrate into  the structures of organized crime, this cooperation becomes  indispensable.    [Stastny] The Interior Ministry has initiated tougher  procedures against various extremist groups. Is BIS also  preparing a similar step?    [Devaty] Of course, our service also deals with such  problems and closely cooperates with the police. Unlike the  police, however, we do not have executive powers; therefore, we  pass all of our information on these groups to them. I believe  we have done enough in this sphere; therefore, we are not  planning further steps.    [Stastny] In what spheres do you cooperate with the police,  specifically?    [Devaty] We cooperate with them when working on specific  cases. Important information--about organized crime, for  instance--is passed on to police departments that deal with  them. Then, we can take steps like we did in the Buontempo  case. Our service can ask the police for cooperation, and vice  versa.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNDERTAXING THE WEALTHY  </P> <P> Why don't we adopt Kuttner's call to increase taxes on the "small minority of  (wealthiest) Americans" to balance the federal budget and to pay "for some of  the (unspecified) public needs that have been shortchanged during the past  decade." By exercising majority rule, we can enrich ourselves. There is no  limit to what we can buy! But whether this will please or upset the  "opinion-leader class" is not as clear.  </P> <P> BILL MOSELEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

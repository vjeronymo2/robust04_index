Beginning today, RENMIN RIBAO will open a column entitled  "Talks on Building a Modern Enterprise System," which is aimed  at answering new questions as the are raised in practice. We  hope that the readers will join us in thinking, exploring, and  triumphantly fulfilling this major task entrusted by history.  [end editor's note]    As enterprise reform has entered the stage of the  establishment of a modern enterprise system, does it mean that  we are introducing something new with enterprise reform? The  managers of some enterprises have even asked with doubt: Do we  have to stop the ongoing enterprise reform and start over with  the establishment of a modern enterprise system?    This question shows that our publicity and explanation of  the  reform, specifically, the establishment of a modern enterprise  system, is not sufficient.    Thanks to the vigorous explorations in various fields over  the past decade or so, enterprise reform has undergone the  different stages of the delegation of power and the sharing of  benefits, the two-step reform of substituting taxes for the  delivery of profits, the enterprise contract responsibility  system, and the transformation of the enterprise operational  mechanism. A review of the course that has been taken clearly  shows that it has developed from outside to inside, from shallow  to deep, and from easy to difficult. The next stage of reform  never negates the former. Conversely, the former reform is  always the basis and prerequisite of the one that follows, which  is introduced on the basis of the priorities and difficult  points raised by the former. The relationship between the two  is between inheritance and development. The four aspects of a  modern enterprise system constitute the highest objective of  enterprise reform. Now this objective has been clearly set  forth before us. It is the result of constant explorations over  the past decade or so. This objective is not the result of one  individual's sudden inspiration. Instead, it lay latent in  every stage of enterprise reform. The "Decision of the CPC  Central Committee on Economic Structural Reform" adopted by the  Third Plenary Session of the 12th CPC Central Committee clearly  stated that the purpose of enterprise reform is that "the  enterprise should truly be made a relatively independent  economic entity and should become a producer and operator in  socialist commodity production which is independent and  responsible for its own profits and losses, which is capable of  transforming and developing itself, and which acts as a legal  person with certain rights and duties." When the "regulations"  were promulgated, the objective of enterprise reform were  expressed in more explicit terms: "The enterprise should meet  market demand and become a producer and operational unit of  commodity production which is independent and responsible for  its own profits and losses, which is capable of developing  itself and exercising self restraint, and acts which as a legal  person enjoying independent civil rights and undertaking civil  duties." The different expressions may inevitably indicate the  characteristics of the specific stage, but the theme of pushing  enterprises to the market and changing their status of being  attached to the government is the same.    There are successful experiences as well as setbacks and  lessons to be drawn from the past decade of enterprise reform.  The formulation of establishing a modern enterprise system  derives from summing up both experience and lessons. Separating  government administration from enterprise management and  ownership from operation has been the clear guiding ideology of  enterprise reform. With the further deepening of reform, we are  making more explorations in this field. As both the contract  system and the "regulations" have not touched on the central  question of enterprise property rights, there will be numerous  difficulties in implementing the guiding ideology. Proceeding  from the analysis of these circumstances, we have come to the  following conclusion: When property rights are not clearly  defined, it will be impossible to separate government  administration from enterprise management and ownership from  operation.    Therefore, we say that the establishment of a modern  enterprise system, which clearly defines property rights, is  being proposed to meet the needs of deepened enterprise reform.  It is aimed at developing and improving rather than negating  the measures of enterprise reform, which include the contracted  responsibility system and the "regulations." When the  establishment of a modern enterprise system is still being tried  out, the enterprises that have not been selected for undergoing  the experiment should continue the effective reform methods,  which have been implemented or are being implemented and which  conform to enterprise reality. In the course of practice, they  should try to move closer to the standard of a modern enterprise  system.</p>

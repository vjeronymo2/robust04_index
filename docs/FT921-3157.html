			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / US delay over patents talks pleases Bangkok THE outgoing Thai government has reacted with satisfaction to the US announcement it was deferring a decision on trade retaliation against Thailand until a new government is installed. Mrs Carla Hills, trade representative, described a new Thai pharmaceutical and agro-industrial patents law as 'deficient in several critical respects' but praised the government for pushing through the legislation, and said the US would seek the discuss the matter with the new administration after Thailand's general elections on March 22. Washington is critical of the new law because it does not protect 'pipeline' products already invented but not yet distributed in Thailand, and because of the way it allows the Thai government to force a patent-holder to issue manufacturing licences to competitors if its prices are deemed too high. Thai debate focuses partly on whether Bangkok should bow to US pressure on matters likely to affect the cost of medicines. Mr Amaret Sila-on, commerce minister, favours negotiating such matters under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Councils and unions back N-plant plan AFTER 10 weeks of public consultation, two-thirds of responses received to British Nuclear Fuels' controversial Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria are opposed to the plan. There has been strong support for the plant from local councils and unions, however. They are concerned that abandoning the plant and its 1,200 jobs would worsen unemployment in Cumbria. The public consultation, which ends today, is being conducted by HMIP, the pollution inspectorate. It must assess whether the plant would threaten health or the environment, and it needs to decide within weeks whether to hold a wider public inquiry, which could take months or even years. The complex questions raised over Thorp, which has agreed contracts worth about Pounds 6bn with overseas customers, mean that its future will also depend on an interdepartmental government debate which has been taking place since November. BNFL has said there is no health or environmental reason why the plant should not start operating, and there is a sound economic case that it should do so soon. However, environmentalists have repeatedly challenged this. By Friday night the pollution inspectorate had received 20,000 responses from the public, local authorities and industry in addition to 38,000 written responses in the months before the 10-week period of formal consultation started. Of the 20,000 letters, 13,400 were against the start of the plant and 6,600 in favour. Many of the rest are standard letters organised by environmental groups. The main support for the plant has come from local councils and unions. Copeland Borough Council, whose region includes Sellafield, has written to the inspectorate saying that authorisation should be granted, but that BNFL should continue to try to reduce radioactive discharges. Cumbria County Council, which held a special meeting on Friday to agree its submission to the pollution inspectorate, has argued that there are no radiological grounds for holding back from commissioning Thorp. The Sellafield unions, campaigning under the slogan 'Trust Thorp', expect today to deliver about 14,000 letters from members of the public supporting Thorp to the inspectorate.</p>

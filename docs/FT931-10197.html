			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Keating woos women and business MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, yesterday launched an election campaign package, promising to cut the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. He also offered a 10 per cent investment allowance for purchases of plant and equipment by small and medium businesses. And for working women, Mr Keating proposed a 30 per cent cash rebate, claimable every week, for work-related child care. Mr Keating hopes the business incentives will encourage private investment and help cut unemployment. But he is also targeting his weakest electoral spots: business and women voters. The company tax cuts will put a further strain on the government budget. Mr Keating's 95-page package includes a revised forecast for the 1992-1993 budget deficit, which is now expected to rise to ADollars 15.9bn (Pounds 7bn) from the previous forecast of ADollars 13.5bn. The expected rate of economic growth has also been scaled down from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Mr Keating said the package would add ADollars 692m to the 1993-1994 budget and ADollars 387m in 1996-1997. He proposes to fund the package by selling a further 19 per cent of the government's stake in Commonwealth Bank. This would earn the government ADollars 1bn but its total holding would fall from 70 per cent to 51 per cent. He also proposes to bring forward the collection of company taxes. With a new set of incentives, Mr Keating hopes to woo a large section of the business community who openly support the tax and industrial relations policies proposed by the coalition of the conservative Liberal and National parties. The conservative opposition, led by Mr John Hewson, is campaigning on a new goods and services tax and the abolition of seven business taxes, including the payroll tax. Mr Hewson said he did not believe the ruling Labor party could deliver the promised package. He said the government would not be able to raise the money, in the same way that it found it difficult to meet the personal tax cuts promised last year. Mr Hewson is expected to launch his own election campaign platform in a few days. The business community has not been impressed by Mr Keating's bait. Mr Ian Spicer, head of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the tax breaks alone would not cure unemployment. He said the package overlooked the problem of industrial relations. 'I don't believe we'll see any marked improvement in employment in the short term if these are the only initiatives presented by the government,' he added. Mr Rob Bastian of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia said he was aghast at the government's plan to 'claw forward' its collection of the bulk of business taxes.</p>

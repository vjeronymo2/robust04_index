			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Overseas sales lift Watts Blake STRONG OVERSEAS sales and currency benefits helped Watts Blake Bearne lift interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.74m to Pounds 4.26m, leaving the world's largest supplier of ball clay on track for meeting its forecast of Pounds 8.6m before the costs of fending off an unsuccessful takeover bid. Profits for the six months to June 30 were struck after a charge of Pounds 475,000, about half the cost of defending the bid by Sibelco, a privately-owned Belgian-based company. The balance of costs will be booked in the second half. Sibelco, which has boardroom representation, holds 46.8 per cent of WBB after it bought out its two partners in a 45.2 per cent concert party and gained 1.6 per cent during the mandatory bid which lapsed in September. Under Takeover Panel rules, Sibelco may now buy 1 per cent of WBB's equity every 12 months: 'Discussions with Sibelco continue but have not reached a conclusion,' said Mr John Pike, the managing director. 'We are quietly confident of meeting the forecast we made during the bid,' he said. The company, which serves the sanitaryware and tile industries, had been helped in the first half by an Pounds 550,000 increase in operating profits from overseas operations and a currency benefit this time of Pounds 250,000. The company was 'seeing the faintest signs of an upturn in the UK and are looking forward to a recovery in the housing market which is traditionally important to us'. Traditionally strong first half cash flow reduced net debt from Pounds 10.9m at the year end to Pounds 7.44m and interest charges fell to Pounds 432,000 (Pounds 457,000). Gearing fell to 10 per cent (20 per cent) helped by a Pounds 16m addition to assets, reflecting a surplus on the book value of mineral reserves which were revalued at the end of last year. The board declared an interim dividend of 3.5p (2.7p) and said it would pay the 12p total forecast at the time of the bid. Earnings per share rose to 12.6p (12p). COMMENT With 25 per cent of its sales outside Europe, WBB has some protection from the difficult European market. Orders to the Far East continue strong and the Far Eastern joint ventures and US operations are profitable. The company should comfortably meet its full-year forecast, giving earnings of 26.5p and a rating of 16 times. This looks somewhat undervalued for a company which has generally traded at a premium because of the quality of its clay deposits and its management.</p>

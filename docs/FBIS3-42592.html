Tupolev, who are taking  part in the work of the governmental commission on investigating  the causes of the air crash in the area of the airport of the  city of Irkutsk. They arrived from the site of the tragedy and  gave us reliable information on what happened.    Present at the meeting were: Viktor Gorlov, deputy  director of the department of air transport of the Ministry of  Transport of Russia; Aleksandr Yemtsov, the chief of a section  of the same department; Yuliy Kashtanov, first deputy general  director and technical director of the Aviation  Scientific-Technical Complex imeni A.N. Tupolev; and Valentin  Shubin, chief of a section in the complex. Gennadiy Matyushov,  deputy minister of transport of the Russian Federation, took  part in the discussion.    We will elaborate the circumstances of the crash. On 3  January 1994, passenger flight No. 130 on the Irkutsk-Moscow  route was taking off from the Irkutsk city airport. The Tu-154  aircraft, which belonged to the aviation company Baykal, took  off at 0657 hours. It climbed to an altitude of 4,000 meters.  When the liner was at a distance of 31 kilometers from the  airport, the crew reported a fire in the second engine. This  happened at 0702 hours. A decision was made to return.    Fire extinguishers were employed immediately to localize the  fire. However, the pressure fell in all hydraulic systems. The  aircraft went virtually out of control, which the crew reported.  Afterward, contact was cut off, and the image of the aircraft on  the radar scope disappeared. A total of six minutes passed from  the moment of the report of the emergency.    The aircraft fell in the area of the village of Mamon, 15  kilometers from the airport. When it hit the ground, it broke up  and burned. According to established data, the aircraft was  carrying five flight crew members, four air stewards, and 115  passengers, including 16 citizens of foreign states  (Germany--eight, PRC--four, India--one, Japan--one,  Austria--one, France--one). Everyone was killed. During the  crash, livestock farm buildings were damaged. There were three  workers in them. One of them died, and two sustained burns.    As is known, by a directive of the Government of the Russian  Federation of 3 January 1994, a government commission headed by  Vitaliy Yefimov, the minister of transportation of Russia, was  established to investigate the cause of the crash.    Specialists were attached to its work from civil aviation,  the aviation industry, organs of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Procuracy  General of the Russian Federation, and ministries of the Russian  Federation on matters of civil defense, emergency situations and  the elimination of the consequences of natural disasters, and  also experts of other departments. The search and accident  services have been working at the site of the tragedy.    Work is continuing at the present time on the evacuation of  aircraft wreckage, and on cleaning up and tidying the area. The  engines and a number of units were submitted for analysis.  Experts of commissions and subcommissions are continuing the  study of flight and technical documentation; they are analyzing  data on systems for the objective monitoring of the condition  and operation of aircraft systems and the actions of the crew  during flight. Analysis is being conducted on the technical  condition of the aircraft and its systems, and the nature of the  destruction of the aircraft and its power plants is being  investigated. A check is being made on the status of the  organization of flight operations and the engineering and  technical support of flights in the aviation company Baykal and  in the Irkutsk airport. In a word, everything is being done that  is necessary to establish the real cause of the crash.    As the discussion participants noted, a number of articles  that have appeared in the mass media are puzzling. In  particular, the press reported that allegedly the service life  of the engines and the Tu-154M aircraft No. 85656 had expired  long ago, and that the liner was produced in the 1970's and was  obsolete. Moreover, it is being claimed that in the summer of  last year during the termination of a passenger flight to China,  it was on this aircraft that the second engine failed on the  approach to Hangzhou. In addition to other things, journalists  are already giving an evaluation of the crew's behavior;  accusations are coming from newspaper pages that are directed at  various departments and individuals, and working versions are  being promulgated even though the investigation has not been  completed. Frequently, outright disinformation is given.    These are the indubitable facts in this regard. The Tu-154M  aircraft No. 85656 was produced by the Samara aviation plant on  5 May 1989. Since the start of operation, it logged 10,358  hours--this is only half the time that is prescribed for the  operation of an aircraft of this kind. The liner could have  flown 12,000 hours before overhaul.    The D-30KU-154 second-series engines produced by the Rybinsk  enginebuilding association were mounted on the aircraft. Engine  No. 2 had logged 4,835 hours. But the service life permitted it  to be operated up to 5,600 hours. A check showed that both the  aircraft and the engines were operated according to technical  documentation within the limits of the prescribed service life.  Aircraft overload was not established. Tu-154M No. 85656 did not  perform the aforementioned flight to China.    To date, the onboard flight recorder--it records all crew  conversations inside the cockpit and also all outside talk--has  been found and decoded. At the present time, this so-called  black box is in a special laboratory, where voice identification  is being conducted. Also found was the magnetic recorder-memory  device that measures aircraft movement parameters and system  operations. Its case and magnetic tape were damaged; therefore,  specialists are conducting a restoration of the recording. A  third black box was also delivered to the laboratory.    Aircraft parts are being laid out in accordance with their  onboard designation. A large part of them are undergoing  analysis, and some have yet to be sent to special scientific  analysis institutes in Moscow. There also are plans to ferry the  engine. It is necessary to determine exactly why the fire  occurred.    A program has already been developed to model the flight in  special computer complexes. That is, the flight of the perished  aircraft will be reproduced in accordance with the real  conditions.    As for the actions of the crew in the situation that  developed, nothing can be said unequivocally at the present  time. G. Padukov, the aircraft commander and a pilot first  class, graduated from the Civil Aviation Academy in 1973; he  worked as the commander of An-2, Il-14, and Tu-104 aircraft. His  flying time totals 13,600 hours, including 5,600 hours as a  Tu-154 commander. A. Zhavoronkov, the copilot, also a pilot  first class, graduated from the same educational institution,  but 10 years later than the commander. But he also went through  the same kind of practical schooling. Navigator V. Mollar has a  total flying time of 14,900 hours, and of these 8,500 are on a  Tu-154. Flight engineer I. Karpov, like his colleagues, is an  experienced pilot. O. Likhodiyevskiy, chief navigator of the  East Siberian Regional Administration of Air Transport, was a  member of the crew on a planned inspection check. In general,  all crew members had adequate training and a lot of experience.    The press is making complaints about the Tu-154 aircraft.  They say that it is unreliable. At the present time, 397 Tu-154  aircraft are in operation. Two hundred aircraft of this type are  being used in the CIS [as published]. More than 50 percent of  the passenger air traffic is being conducted on Tu-154's. In 22  years of operation, 12 crashes were registered, and only one of  them occurred because of aviation equipment failure. This was in  1984 in the area of the city of Krasnodar.    It must be said that aircraft whose service life has expired  are not operated. Today there is a large number of aviation  companies with various forms of ownership. However, not one of  them has the right to conduct flights without special  authorization and special documents issued by the appropriate  departments. Therefore, discussions that commercial structures  are using old and irreparable aviation equipment are incompetent.    According to the assurances of Vitaliy Yefimov, the chairman  of the government commission, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will be able to  acquire full information concerning the air crash at Irkutsk  after completion of the investigation.</p>

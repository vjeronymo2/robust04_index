			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, 1 April (TANJUG) -- Josip Manolic, chairman  of the Croatian parliament's Chamber of Counties and recently  ousted from all positions he held in the leadership of the  ruling Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ], has said that  Croatia is currently going through a parliamentary crisis.    In an interview for the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS, Manolic said  that the crisis could be solved only through elections.  However, he added, the state and the HDZ leadership did not  want early elections "because it is clear to them that they  would lose because of accumulated problems."    Speaking about his plans, Manolic said that he would move  toward a differentiation in the HDZ. This means that a group of  his supporters together with him will leave the party, which  will "finally bring about a formal split in the HDZ," Manolic  said.    According to Manolic, "The final show-down has begun and the  casualty list could possibly include Chamber of Deputies  Chairman Stipe Mesic, Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, and former  Prime Minister Franjo Greguric." It seems that Tudjman "has  moved against me first, regarding me as the toughest nut to  crack" and that from time to time he will replace "one by one  the members of the liberal wing of the HDZ."    According to Manolic, the vital difference between him and  Tudjman lies in the strategic policy regarding  Bosnia-Herzegovina. As far as the Washington agreement is  concerned, I believe that my option for Bosnia prevailed: It is  based on cooperation between Croats and Muslims and on respect  for the integrity [celovitost] of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    It is a fact, said Manolic, that there is a group of  politicians in Herzegovina who find the Washington agreement  with the Muslims unsuitable. "A war can break out again over 10  square km and whether they would be part of the Croat or the  Muslim cantons, or about different posts in the federation and  whether they should be occupied by Croats or by Muslims,"  stressed Manolic.    Manolic said he also came into conflict with Tudjman because  of the functioning of a law-governed state. "We should halt  forcible expulsions, the blowing up of houses, and  discrimination along national criteria, which is still  happening," he warned and said that "the present set-up has not  proven capable of protecting the rights of all Croatian  citizens."    He wanted to know who stood behind the political decisions  to  establish concentration camps in Herzeg-Bosna, to hold the  eastern part of Mostar under siege for six months, to blow up  the Old Bridge, and finally, to wage a war against Muslims. In  his interview for GLOBUS, Manolic said that Croatian Defense  Minister Gojko Susak "was the one most involved in the  implementation of the Croatian policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina."</p>

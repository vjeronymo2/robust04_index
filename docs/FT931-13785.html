			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Subsidy cut highlights the ups and downs of hill sheep farming - How the phasing out of the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowance will affect the Lake District BRITAIN'S HILL sheep farmers are up in arms over the Ministry of Agriculture's decision to cut one of the mainstays of their income - the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowance. The National Farmers' Union has described the Pounds 2.25 reduction in HLCAs for breeding ewes to Pounds 6.50 as an arbitrary step that will inflict a crippling blow on a hard-pressed sector of the agricultural industry. The ministry has strongly defended the move, which is part of the switch towards a uniform system of subsidies within the European Community's single market. UK hill farm incomes were up 66 per cent in 1991-92, and were expected to rise further this year, said one official. The ministry is forecasting an average cash income of Pounds 18,600 for hill sheep farmers in 1992-93, compared with Pounds 10,900 in 1990-91. At an angry meeting at the Newfield Inn, Seathwaite, in the Duddon Valley earlier this month, Lake District hill farmers argued that while incomes were up, they had risen from a very low base. 'What's 66 per cent of nothing? 1991 was about the worst year - we have certainly not got back to 1984 figures,' one said. Hill sheep farms rely heavily on subsidies, and the HLCA system - funded 25 per cent by the EC and 75 per cent by the UK government - was designed specifically to keep people farming on the hills. Government statistics show that fewer people are leaving the hills than are leaving agriculture in other parts of the country - but hill farmers question whether this will remain the case. Farmers are notoriously tight-lipped about their accounts. But Mr Maurice Hall, who runs nearly 1,300 sheep at Stowgill Farm, near Kaber in Cumbria, was willing to open his books to show the effect of the cut. His total income per ewe in 1992 was Pounds 41.24, made up as follows: HLCA Pounds 8.75, sheep annual premium (the EC support) Pounds 18.79, sale of lambs Pounds 10 and sale of ewes Pounds 3.70. Both the last two payments are averaged out per ewe. He does not include wool sales in the accounts, as the amount received merely covers the cost of shearing. Variable costs per ewe, including feed, veterinary charges and over-wintering costs came to Pounds 14.90, leaving a gross margin of Pounds 26.35 per ewe. He has set the farm up as a company with a partner, and last year paid himself a wage of Pounds 6,000. Total fixed costs are roughly Pounds 20 a ewe, leaving Pounds 6.50. . . 'out of which I have to pay the mortgage'. The cut in this year's HLCA will take nearly Pounds 3,000 off the budgeted income that he presented to his bank last September. He admitted that some of this would be made up by increases in the sheep annual premium, but he felt that the Government action suggested that if the hill farmers reached profitability, the money would be cut. 'I have made no money for reinvestment in the last three years,' he said. 'I have not bought anything - not even second hand.' The ministry believes the hill farmers have not yet fully grasped the increased benefits that will be coming their way through the EC sheep annual premium, which one official said would give a gross margin of Pounds 30 per ewe. The increases follow sterling's depreciation after its withdrawal from the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September. Before last September the sheep annual premium was Pounds 14.61, plus a Pounds 4.37 supplement for less favoured areas (LFAs) - a category which covers most of the upland farming land in the UK. Since then the payments have risen to Pounds 17.25 and Pounds 5.78 respectively, a total increase of Pounds 4.05 - which more than offsets the cut in HLCAs. Premium payments are limited to the number of sheep being kept on each farm in 1991. Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, told Devon NFU earlier this month, that the higher annual premiums and increased LFA supplement, together with the rise in hill farm incomes last year, were worth an estimated Pounds 80m to Pounds 90m while the cut in HLCAs would take back only Pounds 20m. The increase in sheep annual premium has failed to impress the Lake District hill farmers, however. In the Penrith area a petition protesting against the HLCA cuts has been signed by nearly 800 local people and 30 farmers will be bringing it to the Houses of Parliament next week to join other NFU farmers from all over the country who want MPs to reverse the decision. Mr David Ellwood, a National Trust tenant with 1,000 ewes in the Duddon valley, was one of 12 who tendered in 1988 for Baskell Farm, built in 1885, the type of farm a tourist would expect to find on National Trust property. He moved there with his wife and children from his father's farm Eskdale, where he was born and brought up but which could no longer provide them with a living. He is puzzled that the government income statistics show hill farm incomes rising, pointing out that his lambs were selling for Pounds 13 to Pounds 14 apiece in his first year, but made only Pounds 11 in 1992. 'Even before the cuts it was hard enough to make a living here,' he said. 'Gummer should come up and see how we actually live in the hills.' In the Newfield Inn the farmers said it was their work that kept the Lake District attractive to tourists, who bring Pounds 290m a year into the local economy. The boost from tourists also kept the village shops going. They feared that any reduction in their income would start a vicious circle of decline, with land reverting to scrub, dry stone walls going unrepaired, shops closing and villages becoming depopulated. 'What would be the cost of maintaining the countryside if the sheep were not there?' asked one.</p>

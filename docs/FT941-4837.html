			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: McDonnell Information joins market worth Pounds 260m McDonnell Information Systems is coming to the market through a placing and public offering at 260p a share, valuing the Hemel Hempstead-based computing services company at Pounds 260m. Some 73.1 shares are being issued, of which 42.5m are new shares with the balance being sold by existing shareholders. Some 35 per cent of the offer, which closes on March 17, is available to the public. Dealings commence on March 24. The flotation will raise Pounds 110m of new equity and Pounds 80m for existing shareholders. The net proceeds, Pounds 107.4m, will be used to repay debt and redeem preference shares. MDIS management bought the company from McDonnell Douglas of the US for Pounds 121m last year. Mr Jeremy Causley, chief executive, said he would not be selling his shares. After the flotation management will hold 7.6 per cent of the equity. On a post-flotation pro forma basis, the company had pre-tax profits of Pounds 21.3m in the year to December 1993. Out of earnings per share, it would have paid a notional net dividend of 6.25p a share. The placing and offer, one of the largest flotations this year and the biggest in the information technology field, has been fully underwritten by Baring Brothers, which is to sponsor the issue. COMMENT MDIS is a mature company with revenues of almost Pounds 150m and a record of management competence. Operating profits as a percentage of turnover have risen from 10 per cent to 15 per cent in the past three years in spite of the recession. The company specialises in areas such as central and local government, the emergency services and the health sector, which will show sound, if not outstanding, growth. As a public company, it could reasonably hope for more success in bidding for larger contracts. The offer price suggests a p/e of 18.2 that is fractionally higher than the sectoral average. Notional gross dividend yield at the offer price is 3 per cent. The shares seem fairly priced and should prove a core holding for computing services aficionados.</p>

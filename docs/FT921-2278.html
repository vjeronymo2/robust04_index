			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares fall as election concern grows WHATEVER may be the oppo-site of election fever, the London stock market suffered a severe bout yesterday. Opinion polls favouring the opposition Labour party set the tone for the day, and the FT-SE 100 Index was left to languish by disinterested investors. Not even a firm overnight close on Wall Street, encouraging UK retail sales figures for February, well-received company results or new appointments to the FT-SE 100 Index could revive jaded spirits. Marketmakers noted at the opening that two opinion polls had shown Labour five points ahead of the governing Conservatives and, perhaps predictably, marked down their prices. Shortly after business commenced, the index showed a drop of more than 20 points. This depressed mood was made worse by the lack of enthusiasm in the Financial Futures market, where the FT-SE contract for March delivery traded at a discount to its estimated fair value premium, and even at a discount to the cash market, for most of the day. Dealers in the derivatives markets said that few houses were prepared to take advantage of the relatively cheap March contract and buy it. Buying of the futures contract would normally prompt selling of underlying stocks and the lack of it yesterday meant that, if the futures were not dragging the index down, they were preventing a rally. Activity in the futures was prompted mainly by spasmodic buying in the traded options market of FT-SE puts, giving the right, but not the obligation, to sell at a fixed price; this was seen as a hedge against a Labour victory. Wall Street failed to provide impetus in the new session and turnover in London remained poor in spite of a placing by securities house Hoare Govett of 34.4m Cadbury Schweppes shares, sold to raise cash for investment in Mexico. Sterling and long-dated gilts also drifted down in reaction to the opinion polls. In the last half-hour of trading, the Footsie fell to its low of the day. Shares were depressed by gloomy expectations for two significant opinion polls due today. UK stocks were also influenced by a rumour that German workers might be about to receive a higher than expected pay settlement. Stock features included Rank Organisation and Unitech, both of which fell sharply on worries over the profits for their Japanese subsidiaries, and Glaxo and Reuters, which suffered from selling in New York. Cable and Wireless was easier on management changes. Midland Bank remained the most heavily traded stock following the announcement on Tuesday that it is to merge with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. BAT Industries and Marley rose on well-received results and Courtaulds was strong around presentations to institutions. The FT-SE Index closed at 2,464.7, down 26.5 and just above its intraday low. Turnover of 446.5m shares was slightly lower than on the previous day, when retail business was worth Pounds 932m. After the market closed, the FT-SE 100 Steering Committee announced quarterly changes to the FT-SE 100 Index. Lonrho, Trafalgar House, Royal Insurance and Tarmac have been removed from the index and have been replaced by ECC Group, Bowater, Siebe and Coats Viyella.</p>

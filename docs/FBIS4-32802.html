			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 25 May (PL) -- Santiago de Cuba will play  host to solar and aeolian energy enthusiasts, who will attend an  international workshop from 20 to 22 June. The meeting is  sponsored by the Eurosolar organization, UNESCO, and other  organizations.    The workshop was organized by the Cuban Ministry of Science,  Technology, and the Environment [as received]. Almost 100  foreign specialists -- mostly Argentines, Mexicans, and Italians  -- will attend the workshop. The same number of Cuban  specialists will also attend.    Jose M. Oriol, an engineer and president of the organizing  committee, told PRENSA LATINA that the meeting will include  conferences and seminars by renowned personalities, such as  Enrico Turrini, the vice president of the Eurosolar group.  Turrini will speak about the environment, independence, and  democracy.    Besides the investigative presentations, there will be  several symposiums and round tables on photo voltage power,  converting solar energy into heat, solar energy, the  environment, and solar and aeolian energy architecture; there  will also be a technological exhibit.    Cuba is looking at alternate energy sources to address the  acute energy crisis it is currently experiencing, after the  disappearance of the USSR, which was once its main supplier of  fuel oil.    A world conference on biomass energy generation,  development,  and the environment will be held in Havana in January of 1995.  Eurosolar, UNESCO, and the Latin American Energy Organization  (OLADE), among other organizations interested in promoting  sustainable energy generation, will sponsor this gathering as  well.</p>

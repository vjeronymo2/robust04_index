			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Duo from France strike similar chords with Kohl FRANCE'S leading 'odd couple' - Socialist president, Mr Francois Mitterrand, and Conservative prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur - yesterday made their international debut by singing broadly the same tune in separate talks with Mr Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor. At the 61st half-yearly Franco-German summit in Beaune, which will end today with a press conference by all three men, the priorities are expected to be the Uruguay Round of world trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the situation in Bosnia. France is seeking to win German approval for a tougher European negotiating stance in Gatt. On Bosnia, Bonn has expressed worry that the Moslems might never be able to reclaim their land from the 'safe havens' proposed by France and Britain. French officials say this is a misunderstanding and are privately dismissive of German concerns about Bosnia, where Bonn has no troops nor intention of sending any. Earlier yesterday, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary was in Paris to discuss Bosnia with Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart. Mr Kohl has already navigated the tricky diplomatic waters of a French 'cohabitation' when the conservatives were last in power in Paris in 1986-1988. In subsequent years spent negotiating the Maastricht treaty he has forged a close relationship with Mr Mitterrand, but the German leader cannot ignore the weight that Mr Balladur derives from his enormous parliamentary majority. According to a Sofres poll published yesterday, 67 per cent of French believe that Mr Balladur is the country's real chief executive.</p>

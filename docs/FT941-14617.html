			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Omani minister to press on with non-Opec tour Efforts to prop up weak oil prices by co-ordinating a worldwide cut in output by major producing countries are to resume in the next few days despite few signs of any significant progress. Traders yesterday reacted sceptically to news that Mr Said bin Ahmad, the Omani oil minister, would resume his tour of producers outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In late London trading the benchmark Brent Blend fell briefly below Dollars 13.75 a barrel, compared with Monday's closing price of Dollars 14.09. Mr Shanfari met his Saudi counterpart, Mr Hisham Nazir, in Riyadh yesterday to review the results of his recent visits to a number of independent oil producers. A statement said the two men discussed the 'ways and means that lead to safeguarding the balance in the market'. Mr Shanfari said that 'within days' he would visit those producers not included in his original tour. It included stops in the UK and Norway, the two independent producers whose rising North Sea output over the past year has been singled out by some Opec members as undermining their attempts to steady oil markets. Both governments have said they would not participate in any co-ordinated cuts. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, has steadfastly rejected any production cuts from its present Opec quota of 8m barrels a day unless non-Opec producers also participate.</p>

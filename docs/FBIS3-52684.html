The meeting  was arranged in the wake of Egyptian-Iranian contacts held at  the level of charge d'affaires in the past few weeks to reach an  agreement on the basics principles for a return to normality in  Egyptian-Iranian relations.    According to the sources, the Iranian officials agreed to a  proposed agenda of the meetings within a framework that would  bring the views closer.    During recent meetings, Iranian officials submitted  memoranda  in reaction to accusations leveled at some Iranian elements by  the Egyptian authorities that they harbor, train, and finance  violent groups in Egypt. This issue will have priority in the  upcoming talks. The second item on the agenda will focus on  regional security issues, particularly Gulf security and  relevant issues. One of the principles established during  previous contacts was that there is no conflict between the  Egyptian and Iranian concepts of regional security.    The sources affirm that Egypt and Iran have agreed to  maintain secrecy on their communications and the topics under  discussion until results are actually achieved.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / New EC car legislation helps drive Johnson Matthey profits JOHNSON MATTHEY, the precious metals and specialised materials group, yesterday announced higher than expected profits, helped by strong growth in its catalytic systems division. EC legislation, in force since January, means all new cars must be fitted with catalytic converters. JM's catalytic systems division, with about 35 per cent of the EC market, increased operating profits 20 per cent to Pounds 27.1m. Mr David Davies, chairman, said further growth was expected this year, helped by a recovery in the US car market. Pre-tax profits increased nearly 10 per cent to Pounds 73.8m in the year to March 31 on sales of Pounds 1.85bn, up 6 per cent. After three years of cutting costs, ongoing operating profits advanced 16 per cent to Pounds 70.7m. JM's materials technology division increased profits 18 per cent to Pounds 20.8m. Precious metals profits were flat at Pounds 20.5m, affected by falling platinum and rhodium prices. Year-end net borrowings almost tripled to Pounds 116m, pushing up gearing from 12 to 35 per cent. This reflected exchange rate movements, rationalisation costs and a change in the credit terms of the company's exclusive marketing contract with Rustenburg of South Africa, the world's biggest platinum producer. Interest costs were Pounds 1.5m, compared with income of Pounds 1.9m. After a slightly higher tax charge, earnings increased 4 per cent to 27.1p. The company recommended a final dividend of 7.1p to make a total 10.3p, a 6.7 per cent rise. There is also an enhanced scrip alternative with a value of 10.65p, a 50 per cent increase. BZW will offer cash of 10.437p under the scheme, equal to 98 per cent of the enhanced scrip's value. In February the UK industrial group Charter Consolidated disposed of its 38.3 per cent stake. JM's biggest shareholder is now Garrick, a joint venture between Minorco and Johannesbburg Consolidated Investment Company of South Africa, with 20 per cent. Lex, Page 20</p>

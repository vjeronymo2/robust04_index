			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Astra in tie-up with Japanese company Astra, the Swedish drugs group, has signed a long-term co-operation pact with Mitsubishi Kasei Corp (MKC), a leading Japanese chemicals group which is looking to strengthen its pharmaceuticals business. The move is designed to bolster Astra's position in its key markets of Europe, Australia and New Zealand from the turn of the century, when the Japanese group's projects are expected to reach the clinical trial phase. It will also enable Mitsubishi Kasei to build up its pharmaceutical businesses outside Japan. MKC's pharmaceutical research and development has been concentrated on the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and central nervous system areas. Although these are also Astra's specialities, the Swedish group stresses there has been little overlap in research areas. It is therefore expecting the collaboration to complement its own efforts. Under the accord, Astra has acquired the right to develop and market selected MKC pharmaceuticals in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, either exclusively or jointly with the Japanese company. 'The agreement covers all of Mitsubishi Kasei's current research projects as well as future projects which reach the clinical trial phase by the turn of the century,' the Swedish company said.</p>

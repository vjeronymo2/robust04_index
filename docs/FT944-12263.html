			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Stock markets face younger rivals Sullen indifference from the stock markets has greeted a largely unpredicted recovery in the economies of continental Europe this year. At the beginning of 1994 the German economy, for instance, was widely expected to grow by less than 1 per cent - by 0.8 per cent, according to the OECD last December - but recently the main economic institutes have raised their consensus GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent and the out-turn is likely to be higher still. But the German stock market has fallen 11 per cent in 1994 so far, dominated by sharply rising bond yields and the fear that short-term interest rates will bottom out sooner than expected. There are similar patterns in France, where the index is down 15 per cent, and election uncertainties still lie ahead. In the UK, which is perhaps 18 months ahead in the economic cycle, and where the GDP growth rate has accelerated closer to 4 per cent, the caution in the equity market has been rather more predictable. Short-term interest rates, after all, have passed the cyclical trough. These cyclical influences on European share prices are the subject of an intriguing analysis by Merrill Lynch's European strategy director Mike Young. The headline warning is that price-earnings ratios will collapse, to 10 or less. Given that average earnings per share in Germany and France may well double in 1994 and 1995, taken together, and may not peak until 1998, this will not be the disaster it might sound like. But it implies a long, sideways-to-downwards struggle against cyclically adverse pressures. According to Merrill Lynch, p/e ratios in the main European markets will fall from a present range of 13 to 28 to a range of 6 to 12. The long trend towards rising p/es that lasted from about 1980 to 1993 is to be reversed. But the forecasts focus on the long-term trend and do not, says Mike Young, looking on the bright side, rule out the possibility that volatility could send share prices to new highs in passing. The arguments are set out in terms of the theoretical relationships between the debt and equity markets. The expected risk-adjusted return on equities is equal to the expected fixed income return. But heroic judgments must be made about variables such as the real bond yield and dividend growth and the question of the equity risk premium. This study manages to be bearish on all three counts. It cites evidence that the equity risk premium is sensitive to rising inflation, which is probably passing through a cyclical trough. Certainly the risk premium has recently dropped, in historical terms, to an unusually and perhaps unsustainably low level in European markets; and in the UK in particular it is likely to widen if pension funds raise their fixed income exposures to match the forthcoming minimum solvency standard. Real bond yields have already risen sharply this year, and have certainly damaged share prices. Increasing demands for capital from developing countries will help keep real yields high (the figure is now 4.9 per cent in Germany, for instance) and maybe push them up a further 50 basis points, says the study. As for dividend growth, it is assumed that as the cycle matures, expectations here will decline during the next three to four years. Merrill's analysis fits into a broad global framework: the drift of capital from sluggish Europe to more dynamic regions, a consequent rise in real interest rates (especially if European governments continue to borrow heavily) and a rising equity risk premium as risk capital, in particular, is drawn away by high returns in emerging economies. But are the conclusions too gloomy? There are some more positive possibilities, including the growth of institutions in continental Europe such as mutual funds and pension funds that might increase the domestic demand for equities and hold the risk premium down. Moreover, the routine contrarianism of global investors (buy in a recession, is their rule of thumb, and sell on a recovery) may leave some mid-cycle opportunities unexploited. Economic growth, investors may rediscover, can actually be a good thing, especially when it is unexpected.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Arts: How elegance has been Fostered in Japan - Architecture / Colin Amery admires Century Tower in Tokyo Two things stand out from a recent visit to Japan. One is the quality, range and sheer style of much of the newest architecture. The other is the advanced and forward thinking nature of the higher echelons of the Japanese building and contracting industry. I was impressed by the willingness on the part of corporate clients to build large, expensive, often experimental, buildings - something that is relatively rarely done in the UK. The very high price of land in the capital, Tokyo, makes the actual cost of a building relatively cheap, which may explain the willingness to commission bold designs. High site values can , of course, also mean that buildings of a low standard are erected quickly and cheaply, their quality only controlled by official regulations. I suspect that the strong, almost fierce, corporate competitiveness is mainly responsible for the need to impress by architectural innovation as well as, the now expected Japanese technological ingenuity. One of the most interesting and important new office towers in Tokyo is the Century Tower, the result of a three-way cooperation between client, architect and contractor. Kazuo Akao, who runs the Obunsha Publishing Group, acted as developer; his choice of designer was the British architect Sir Norman Foster; and the contractor was the Obayashi Corporation. Mr Akao is an aficionado of contemporary art and a collector of the work of artists like Carl Andre and Richard Long (he also has a remarkable collection of traditional Japanese art). His admiration of Norman Foster's work stems from his enthusiasm for the headquarters of the Hongkong Shanghai Bank in Hong Kong which he visited and studied in detail before commissioning him to build in Tokyo. Century Tower has been open for about ten months and is already seen as an exemplar of advanced office design. Situated in the central Bunkyo-ku district of Tokyo, it is first seen from the south, rising above the canal. The most striking feature is the dominant entrance facade, an eccentrically braced steel frame rising up the front of the building like a vertical line of Shinto-like arches. Because of the possibility of earthquakes in Japan, seismic shock resistance plays an important role in the design of any new building. Main structural floors are known as stability floors and they are double height. Century Tower is in fact two towers - a south tower of 21 floors and a north tower of 19 - linked by an atrium. A giant red and white mast stands on top of the taller tower, adding both height and colour. The visitor enters the block from the street underneath one of the giant structural arches. The first impression of the huge entrance is of calm elegance. You walk on a black granite floor, drawn towards the sombre black water table, two enormous blocks of Zimbabwe granite covered by a sheet of moving water. This mirrors the whole space while making a gentle, soothing sound as the water overflows down the sides of the granite blocks alongside the stairs that lead to the basement. These mesmerising water sculptures were designed by the American water artist, Richard Chaix, from Carmel, California. They are beautiful - almost ritualistic - in their strong presence. The ancient symbolism of the purifying effect of water at the temple's entrance is interpreted here in a modern form. A glance upwards from the grey, granite elegance of the entrance hall reveals the height of the atrium and the visible office floors. Another glance to the rear of the hall and you observe the spectacular glass roof that shelters the swimming pool, health club and restaurant on the lower floors. This is a superb sweep of glass that follows a perfect catenary curve (the curve that you would get from a chain or rope hanging freely from two fixed points that are not in the same vertical line). This sweeping shape also has visual associations with traditional curved roofs of Japanese shrines of the Nagare, Hie and Kasuga periods. Lured by the gentle flow of the water slipping over the black granite, most visitors with no business appointment would descend to the Century Museum on the lower floor. Foster likens this to a journey into a cave and certainly you move from the dripping black walls into a dark, rich room. This is lined with simple glazed show cases displaying some of Mr Akao's collection of Oriental art and sculpture, quite magnificently lit by lighting designer Claud Engel. The Health Club and Thai restaurant beneath the sweeping curved glass roof are both incredibly elegant. Although it was hard to see the pool, so exclusive is the club, I did glimpse a row of fountains beneath palm trees and sense the simplicity of the dark, empty pool. The contractor, Obayashi, had a daunting task making the innovative Foster design operate within the tight Tokyo building and safety regulations. That it has succeeded by ingenious interpretations of the fire codes within the open nature of the plan is impressive. With any Norman Foster creation one has come to expect only the highest quality of finish and detail. In Tokyo this is certainly the case. There is also the Foster absence of colour, even a relentless greyness about the environment. However, I saw the building on a grey, snowy day and so did not experience the play of brightness and light that is the main reason behind the great top lit atrium that brings natural light to every floor in a way that seems simple but is, in fact, very hard to achieve effectively. Two questions are promted by the Century Tower. Why do we not have a comparable large commercial office tower by Foster in the UK, and why has Foster's elegant design for an hotel in Knightsbridge, London, recently been refused planning permission? Tokyo sees the point of elegance. Has the City of Westminster planning committee no vision at all?</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: ABN Amro to lead PTT issue THE DUTCH government has appointed ABN Amro, the country's largest bank, as global co-ordinator and lead manager of next year's flotation of a first tranche of shares in Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the telecommunications and postal company. Two other Dutch banks, ING Bank and Rabobank, will be co-lead managers of the underwriting syndicate in the Netherlands. The government has not yet released the names of regional lead managers in other parts of the world but expects to do so shortly. The role of lead manager had been widely expected to go to a Dutch bank, with ABN Amro and ING the main contenders. Earlier, NM Rothschild was appointed as the state's adviser in the flotation  -the biggest in Dutch corporate history - while KPN is being advised by Goldman Sachs.</p>

The shares the 11 firms put in circulation will have a total  face value of 169.85 million yuan ($19.523 million).    Seven of the new companies are from Shanghai. They are:  Shanghai Shangling Electric Appliance, Shanghai Jielong  Industry, Shanghai Lingqiao Water Plant, Shanghai Commercial  Real Estate Development, Shanghai Oriental Pearl, Shanghai No. 9  Department Store, and Shanghai SAIC [expansion unknown] Multiple  Trading. The other four are Huanghe Machinery and Electrical  from Xian, Shaanxi Province; the Chengdu People's Shopping  Centre from Sichuan; the Harbin Tianer Industry from  Heilongjiang; and Ningbo Chenghuangmiao from Zhejiang.    Officials expect the value of new shares listed on the  exchange in the first quarter of this year to be 1.48 billion  yuan ($170.1 million).    Meanwhile, the exchange has approved membership of four  securities companies to its clearing system to make it more  efficient.    They are the Hunan and Dalian securities trading centres and  the Guangdong Maoming and Gansu securities registering companies.    So far, the clearing system has developed 103 member  companies, 51 of which are Chinese.    Meanwhile, Shenzhen Securities Exchange has decided to  suspend the listing of new firms to reverse the bearish trend in  the stock market.    Many investors and analysts believe the problem is caused by  the continued listing of new shares, which absorbs large amounts  of capital, which causes share prices to slip.    In another development, five securities companies from the  provinces of Hubei, Guangdong, Shaanxi, and Sichuan have  recently gained membership of the Shenzhen Securities Exchange.</p>

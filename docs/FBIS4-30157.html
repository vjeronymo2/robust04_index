			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Adventurous Arms Buildup"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- Some time ago, the U.S.  Senate adopted a resolution urging the reinforcement of the U.S.  forces and fighter planes present in South Korea and the  dispatch of an aircraft carrier combat unit around it. Earlier,  the U.S. Defense Department declared that it would send  reinforcements of mobile strike force to South Korea and its  surroundings.    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says: The attempt of  the hardline conservative forces in the United States to put  military pressure on us, while hastening arms buildup, shows  that they are not interested in a peaceful solution to the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but intend to stifle the  DPRK with "strength".    They are persistently working to carry the situation of the  Korean peninsula to an extreme phase and putting pressure on  those calling for a solution to the nuclear issue on the  peninsula through dialogue and negotiation.    It is a unanimous demand of the world people to solve this  issue through dialogue and negotiation. A military option  cannot be a way of solving it.    If the way of solving the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula through dialogue and negotiation is blocked by the  reckless military pressure campaign, the consequences will be  unpredictable.    The U.S. hardline conservative forces must act with  discretion, coolly looking into the reality.</p>

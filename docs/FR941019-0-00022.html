			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (18) Consistent with existing RTC policy, a new subsection 1609.9(b) has been added which provides that, with respect to eligible multifamily property, the RTC will offer such property, initially, for direct sale exclusively to public agencies and nonprofit organizations for a period of 45 days. If the RTC receives no notice of serious interest, the property will be marketed pursuant to section 1609.7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other stylistic changes to the regulations have also been made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the length of the interim final rule and the number of changes from the May 6, 1992 Interim Rule, this interim final rule is published in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative Procedure Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The RTC is adopting this regulation as an interim final regulation. It will be effective immediately upon publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , without the usual notice-and-comment period or delayed effective date as provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. These requirements may be waived for ``good cause''. The RTC believes that good cause exists because the amendments made to the affordable housing provisions of FIRREA by the Refinancing Act, the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992 Housing Act and the Completion Act took effect immediately upon their enactment. Moreover, immediate clarification of existing policies is necessary in order to avoid undue delays in the disposition of affordable housing properties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By implementing these changes immediately, the RTC is complying with the mandate from Congress to dispose of single family, multifamily and condominium properties expeditiously and to the benefit of low and moderate income households. The immediate effective date of the regulation is also desirable in order to avoid public confusion regarding the RTC's policies and procedures in this area. Such confusion could impede the sales of affordable housing properties and result in deterioration of existing inventory and increased holding costs associated with these properties. Such costs ultimately would be borne by the taxpayer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, the RTC finds that the benefits to the public in adopting an interim final rule outweigh any harm from the delay in seeking public comment. The RTC solicits comments and will consider those comments in the adoption of the rule as final, which will take place within 90 days after the close of the public period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis is hereby provided: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Reasons, objectives, and legal bases underlying the interim final regulations. These elements have been discussed elsewhere in the preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Impact of the interim final regulations on small businesses: This interim final rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The RTC expects, rather, that the interim final regulation will result in a benefit to small business entities whose service will be utilized in fulfilling the mandates of the legislation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Overlapping or conflicting federal rules. There are no known federal rules which overlap, duplicate, or conflict with the interim final regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 1609 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Low and moderate income housing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Savings associations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, title 12 chapter XVI of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended by revising part 1609 to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1609_AFFORDABLE HOUSING DISPOSITION PROGRAM <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Sec. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 1609.1&blank;Authority, purpose, and scope. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1609.2&blank;Definitions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1609.3&blank;Clearinghouses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1609.4&blank;Technical assistance advisors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1609.5&blank;Brokers and other marketing specialists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1609.6&blank;RTC staff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1609.7&blank;Marketing period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1609.8&blank;Recapture of profits from resale. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1609.9&blank;Suspension of marketing period for sales to nonprofit organizations and public agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1609.10&blank;Reporting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1609.11&blank;Transfer of eligible properties to State housing finance agencies, State housing agencies and local housing agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1609.12&blank;RTC notice and sale of ineligible residential properties and non-AHDP properties. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  12 U.S.C. 1441a. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / DPP defends decision on W Midlands police MRS Barbara Mills QC, the director of public prosecutions, has replied to critics over her decision not to prosecute West Midlands Serious Crime Squad officers. In letters in today's issues of the Independent and The Guardian newspapers, she acknowledges the public disquiet about criminal justice but defends her decision that there was insufficient evidence for officers to be prosecuted. In the Independent she says: 'There is an enormous difference between poor supervision and sloppy management practice, and criminality. This point appears not to have been appreciated in much of the reporting of the matter.' The Crown Prosecution Service could only support criminal proceedings when there was 'sufficient, substantial, admissible and reliable evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction'. Mrs Mills' decision not to prosecute any officers of the former West Midlands Serious Crime Squad followed an investigation by West Yorkshire Police into allegations of corruption, fraud, perjury and faked evidence and several successful appeals against convictions on its evidence, including that of the Birmingham Six.</p>

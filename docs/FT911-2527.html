			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Nigel Judah: former Reuters executive - Obituary NIGEL JUDAH, who died on April 26, aged 60, was responsible for Reuters' finances during the news agency's spectacular growth over the past three decades. He was born in Calcutta, where his father was a jute merchant. The family moved to the UK in 1934. Mr Judah went to Charterhouse, the English public school, and spent a year at Lausanne University. He joined Reuters as an accountant in 1955. When he became secretaryand chief accountant in 1960 at the early age of 29, Reuters' revenues were Pounds 2.4m, and it was making a loss of Pounds 18,000. When he handed over his financial responsibilities in 1990, revenues were nearly Pounds 1.4bn and company profits Pounds 320m. His resignation as company secretary, and retirement, took effect at Reuters' annual meeting one day before he died. One of Mr Judah's early contributions to Reuters' success was to negotiate in 1967 with Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, the first bank loan of the post-war news agency - its miserable profits record and its then unattractive balance sheet notwithstanding. That enabled Reuters to expand into computerised financial information, in whichit quickly established a dominant position. Mr Judah's signal achievement during the past 10 years, since becoming finance director in 1981, was to direct the administration of the 1984 flotation of Reuters - the first initial public offering to take place simultaneously in London and New York. Mr Judah enjoyed opera as much as he enjoyed his fine collection of modern English paintings. His death robs the business community of a public-spirited man of cultivated tastes and distinctive style.</p>

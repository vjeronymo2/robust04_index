			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 26 (ATA) -- In early hours of April  25, Serbian forces that control the border between Kosova and  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  killed the Albanian Naim Bajrami from Llashtice of Gjilan.  Still no reports have arrived about the conditions in which  Bajrami, father of two children, was killed. He was killed near  the Miratovc village, the commune of Presheve.    The sub Council for the Defence of the Human Rights and  Freedoms in Gjilan reports that Naim was searched by Serbian  police while during the last week police searched his home in  Llashtice, under the pretext of looking for arms. He was killed  while he was leaving Kosova because of the pressures and threats  by the Serbian police.    Bajrami is the second Albanian victim of the Serbian terror  killed on the Kosova-Macedonia border since the beginning of  this year.</p>

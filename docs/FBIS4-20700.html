More than 30 years have passed since we started  developing nuclear power, and software has supported the smooth  progress that has been made in nuclear power development work.  Advances made in computer technology in recent years have been  accompanied by demands for more complex, higher-level nuclear  power-related software, as well as higher quality information on  a much more timely basis.    This trend has been accompanied by remarkable advances in  computer networking, which is creating an advanced information  society, which in turn has further accelerated the growth of  computer networks to the point where now all sorts of  information can be obtained online.    We here at the Nuclear Data Center have been working since  our establishment to develop software and disseminate  information related to nuclear power, and have contributed  toward the development of the nuclear power industry here in  Japan by collecting and disseminating nuclear codes in our role  as the point of contact (POC) for Japan's Nuclear Code Center.  And in keeping pace with the above-described advances, we have  constructed a nuclear code information database, linked it up to  the Fujitsu Enhanced Information and Communication Service  (FENICS) network provided by Fujitsu Corporation and are  providing Nuclear Code Information Services (NUCIS) online via  personal computer-based telecommunications. This article is  designed to introduce you to NUCIS, explain its special  characteristics and tell you how to retrieve information from it.  <H5>  1. Overview of NUCIS Database </H5>   As stated above, NUCIS was constructed to provide online the  latest nuclear code information to researchers and engineers  involved in nuclear research and development. The special  features of this system are:    (1) NUCIS contains roughly 1,500 items of nuclear code  information covering all nuclear power fields. These nuclear  codes are classified into a total of 24 categories, including  cross section information processing using nuclear code  functions (A), and energy spectral calculations (B). A total of  1,500 nuclear code abstracts that belong to these various  categories are registered in NUCIS. Table 1 gives the number of  codes registered in NUCIS by category.    (2) NUCIS acquires and registers nuclear code information  developed and made public by countries the world over, and which  is stored and managed by the Nuclear Energy Agency of the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD/NEA). This information is periodically furnished to the  Japan Nuclear Code Center, where it is used to update NUCIS data.    (3) NUCIS online services are provided via the FENICS  network, which has access points located in 110 cities  nationwide. This makes access to the NUCIS database inexpensive  since communication charges can be kept low.    (4) NUCIS is equipped with detailed retrieval functions  which  enable retrieval by category, code and code ID. Specific  examples of retrieval operations are provided in the following  section.    (5) The database stores 18 code items, to include  descriptions of code functions, methods of solution, special  features and material available. The 18 code items stored in  NUCIS are listed in Table 2. By referring to these code items --  the types of computers and operating systems designed to run the  code information, the functions possessed by the codes, the  methods of solution, authors' names and special features of the  codes -- users can determine whether the codes they retrieve  will meet their requirements.    (6) The system has also been equipped with an electronic  mail  function that links NUCIS users together with the Code Center,  making it possible for the Center to field various requests from  users.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Retrieval System </H5>   The NUCIS retrieval system was designed with user  requirements in mind, i.e. what form user requirements for  nuclear code information would take. That is, it was felt that  user requirements for nuclear code information would take one of  the following three forms:    (1) Users would already know the specific code or abstract  number for that code, and would want to know the special  features of that code, its methods of solution, programming  language(s), author's name, etc.    (2) The user would not know the code, and would want to find  out if there is a code for the field he would like to do  calculations in, for example, structural analysis,  transportation calculations, combustion computations, etc.    (3) The user would want to know which code is most  applicable  to the problem he is working on.    Figure 1 expresses these various requirements in flowchart  form. When a user tries to obtain information related to nuclear  codes, he more than likely already has an objective in mind. For  instance, he wants to carry out calculations regarding the  transport of nuclear fuel, or he wants to do structural analysis  work. Then, if he already knows the specific code that will  enable him to achieve his objective, he can retrieve information  from NUCIS by inputting that code directly.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-16A>      Figure 1. NUCIS Utilization Flowchart </FIG>     Figure 2 provides an example of a retrieval operation where  the user input the code ``SAFE-3D'' to obtain structural  analysis data. By inputting the input command (e) shown in  Figure 2, the user specified   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-16B>      FORMULA </FIG>     [Text]The numeral ``1'' following the code specifies the  output level. Inputting ``1'' specifies the output of code items  1-4, ``2'' specifies the output of code items 1-4, 10 and 15-18,  and ``3'' specifies the output of all code items.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-16C>      Figure 2. Example of Code Retrieval Operation </FIG>     [Text]If the user doesn't know the specific code he needs,  he can  specify the category that applies to the work he wants to do,  for instance Category ``I'' for structural analysis. Specifying  ``I'' will display a list of codes belonging to that category,  together with a Kwick Index.    Figure 3 (showing a brief explanation of code functions) is  an example of a retrieval operation in which the user specified  Category ``I'' (indicated in the figure by (e)). The terms ``I,  NESC'' are shown in Figure 3. ``I'' is the code for Category I,  and ``NESC'' stands for the codes made public by the National  Energy Software Center (NESC) of America's Argonne (phonetic)  National Laboratories (ANL). In this same manner, the user can  specify a total of four centers that make nuclear code  information available to the public. These are the Nuclear  Energy Agency (NEA) affiliated with OECD headquartered in  France, NESC, ORNL's Radiation Shielding Information Center  (RSIC) in the United States and the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) of Austria.

For example, to the right of code ``SAFE-3D'' you can  read the explanation ``Stress analysis of 3-dimensional  composite structure by finite element method.'' After reading  these explanations, the user selects that code which best meets  his requirements, then goes back to step (1) outlined above,  inputs the code and retrieves more detailed information.    If the user doesn't know the specific code or category, he  can do a keyword search. To accomplish this, the user must  characterize or specify the problem he wishes to solve using a  number of keywords. With NUCIS, it is possible to string these  keywords together with AND/OR operators to enable sum of sets  and common class searches, and thus more detailed retrieval  operations.    Figure 4 provides an example of a keyword retrieval  operation  which produced the code for a ``three-dimensional structural  analysis using a finite element method.''     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-18A>      Figure 4. Example of Keyword Retrieval Operation </FIG>     [Text] As shown in Figure 4, input command (e) specifies  ``stress  analysis'' (but ``stress  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;     [Text]'' signifies a forward agreement search--the same  holds  true for the other keywords). Next, input command (ro) specifies  ``finite element method'' and (ha) specifies ``three  dimensional,'' thereby completing a common class search. The  results of this keyword search produce two data elements. (ni)  is the command that outputs these data elements, with the output  level being specified by the terms ``OUT1-OUT3.'' OUT1-OUT3  correspond to the output level numerals 1-3 described earlier.  That is, OUT 1 is the lowest level output command, and outputs  only stored code items 1-4 shown in Table 2. Figure 4 specifies  that lowest level of output. As indicated in Figure 4, this  keyword search retrieved the two codes SAFE-3D and NIKE-3D, plus  the functions, solution methods and other information related to  these codes. By reading this information, the user can learn  what functions, solution methods, etc. each of these codes  possesses. And to learn whether or not this code information is  registered with the Code Center, the user must have the system  output item 18, ``Status in Japan'' as well. As explained in the  beginning of this article, the Nuclear Data Center is the POC  for Japan's Nuclear Code Center, and as such, users wishing to  obtain information and/or documents pertaining to the codes they  retrieve must contact us here at NDC.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   Four years have passed since NDC first started providing  NUCIS services online. As of July 1993, these services were  being provided to a total of 75 organizational users.    In line with progress in nuclear power research and  development, increasingly higher level demands are being placed  on nuclear power-related software. The human and  financial-resources required to develop that software are  therefore growing larger with each passing year.    For some time now, the development of nuclear-power-related  software has been based on the premise of international  cooperation. By each country sharing the software that it  develops and uses with all other countries, the international  community has endeavored to reduce the human and financial  resources expended on the development of similar software  programs. In order to do this, however, it is imperative that  all nuclear power-capable countries provide and have access to  information on nuclear power-related software developed by  counterpart countries.    The NUCIS database was constructed with this in mind, and we  at NPDC will undertake to improve our management and updating of  this database, the promotion of its utilization and the  retrieval system used to access it to even better meet users'  needs in future.    For inquiries concerning application forms for utilizing  NUCIS, please contact Fujitsu's F.I.P. Database Business  Department at Tel: 03-3433-2251 or Fax: 03-3436-5254, and direct  any inquiries you might have about the contents of this database  to the Development Operations Department, NDC at Tel:  0292-82-8309 or Fax: 0292-82-4282.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PILOT MAY HAVE PICKED A CANYON TOO TIGHT  </P> <P> Rescue experts speculated Sunday that a Marine reconnaissance aircraft found  wrecked on a rugged slope near San Gorgonio Mountain may have flown into a  treacherous canyon that was too narrow for the plane.  </P> <P> Military investigators Sunday combed through the wreckage of the olive-colored  OV-10A Bronco to determine the cause of the Aug. 24 crash near the highest peak  in the San Bernardino Mountains, about 25 miles east of San Bernardino. Rescue  workers late Sunday were trying to retrieve the bodies of the two crewmen  killed.  </P> <P> The wreckage was discovered Saturday. The plane had been missing 16 days since  failing to return from a flight from Camp Pendleton in northern San Diego  County. About 150 military and civilian aircraft spent days scouring 324,000  square miles of Southern California desert and mountains between the Mexican  border and Nevada before giving up the search 10 days ago.  </P> <P> Those who first spotted the crash site said the crew of the twin-engine plane  may have tried to turn the craft around quickly when they realized that the  plane was heading toward a wall in Whitewater Canyon, but did not have enough  room to maneuver.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Trapped Like a Fly in a Web'  </P> <P> "They were trapped like a fly in a web," said Air Force Auxiliary Lt. Col.  Keith Kelley of the Civil Air Patrol, who first spotted what appeared to be the  wreckage and later notified a San Bernardino Sheriff's Department helicopter  crew of its location.  </P> <P> The victims were pilot Sergio R. Vivaldi, 29, of Port Chester, N.Y., and  observer 1st Lt. Joel H. Piehl, 31, of Bismarck, N.D. They left Camp Pendleton  on Aug. 24 for a three-hour training flight, said 1st Lt. Gene C. Browne, a  spokesman for El Toro Marine Corps Air Station.  </P> <P> Piehl's father, Howard Piehl, said he was somewhat relieved when Marine  officials called to tell him that the plane had been found.  </P> <P> "It's a piece of mind we've been waiting for," Piehl said Sunday from Bismarck.  "It was a long time to wait."  </P> <P> Coincidentally, the wreckage was identified by a helicopter crew that was  ferrying the body of Banning City Manager Thomas Huebner, who died of an  apparent heart attack while hiking Friday in San Bernardino National Forest  just two miles from the crash site.  </P> <P> Huebner, credited with restoring confidence to his city's troubled Police  Department, suffered the attack on the Vivian Creek Trail near Forest Falls,  authorities said. He was 53.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trying to Figure It Out  </P> <P> A helicopter was sent to retrieve the body Saturday morning, San Bernardino  Sheriff's Department Sgt. Jim Singley said.  </P> <P> Forty-five minutes later, the crew came across the plane wreckage.  </P> <P> Kelley of the Civil Air Patrol said that although the Marines had suspended the  search for the plane, the CAP continued to fly over the area daily.  </P> <P> "I must have spent 20 hours in air and another 20 on the phone to figure this  thing out," said Kelley, 70, a Van Nuys resident who who started mountain  search rescues in 1943. "After a while, you begin to piece together what had  happened."  </P> <P> Because the plane's route was not known, and radar was unable to track it,  Marine officials relied upon civilian reports in the search.  </P> <P> Kelley was tipped off by a report of a boom and smoke in the area about 12:10  p.m. on Aug. 24.  </P> <P> Blue-gray smoke was spotted at about 8,000 feet by forestry workers on San  Gorgonio Mountain. They immediately dispatched a helicopter to the area because  of the threat of fire, said Lt. Col Frank Burnham, a Civil Air Patrol  intelligence officer.  </P> <P> But when the helicopter got to the area, there was no smoke or fire, and the  wreckage was never seen, because the plane actually crashed at 6,100 feet in  "the most vicious aircraft trap," Kelley said.  </P> <P> High winds, steep terrain and poor visibility make flying in the area a hazard,  he said.  </P> <P> Kelley, a retired Air Force search-and-rescue squadron commander, spotted what  he thought was the wreckage Friday while making a pass in a fixed-wing aircraft  in a quarter-mile-wide gorge about two miles southeast of the mountain.  </P> <P> He alerted Singley and Sheriff's Deputy Rich Miller, who were in their  helicopter returning Huebner's body to their station. They hovered 50 feet  above the spot and saw the wreckage wedged into a crevice.  </P> <P> The Marine craft, the same color as surrounding vegetation, was not easy to  spot, Singley said, but then he saw the crew's colorful parachutes.  </P> <P> "I saw what looked like an orange sleeping bag laying on the side of a very  steep ravine," he said. "As we got closer, I noticed it was a parachute that  was also white and green. Then I said, 'Hey, there's the wreckage.' "  </P> <P> The plane was found 50 feet below the parachute, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Piece the Size of a Desk  </P> <P> "It was an extensive wreckage," Singley said. "The biggest piece was the size  of a desk."  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear how the Marines were killed, but judging from  scattered wreckage and steep terrain, Singley said, they were probably killed  on impact. The bodies were found 10 hours after the wreckage was first spotted.  </P> <P> The crew belonged to Marine Observation Squadron 2, Marine Aircraft Group 39,  at Camp Pendleton. The group is part of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, with  headquarters at El Toro.  </P></p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Book Review: More than a trifle pleased with himself TELL THEM I'M ON MY WAY By Arnold Goodman Chapmans, Pounds 20, 464 pages There is plainly much to be said for Lord Goodman, even if he says a lot of it himself. At the age of 80, he has chosen to tell all, or at least part, of his remarkable life story. 'Remarkable' is his word, not mine. He had a 'remarkable' mother and a 'remarkable' grandfather and the adjective is spread liberally throughout the book. The slightly conceited title, Tell Them I'm On My Way, reads like an advance warning to the spirits that he is looking forward to even higher things in another place. Wherever he goes, he is sure to meet a pile of close friends, most of them described as the best practitioner of this, that or the other of their generation. Not that Goodman has done badly on earth. As he states early on: 'I have gravitated to almost every unpaid chairmanship in England at one time or another.' Arts Council, Newspaper Publishers' Association, the Housing Corporation and the Royal Opera House - Goodman had a hand in them all, usually at the top. Note the use of the word 'unpaid'. The author says that he realised as a young man the conflict between 'those activities which one enjoyed, either for themselves or because of a sense of virtue, and other activities which one needed to do to keep alive: ie, to earn money from them'. Goodman drew a sharp distinction between them. As a solicitor he made enough money to enable him to be employed in public life for nothing. 'I have always pursued the no doubt slightly sanctimonious attitude,' he writes, 'of refusing to be paid for public service.' Yet there must have been more to Goodman than that. Why was it that so many people in public positions turned to him for advice? Partly he was lucky in his early contacts. Everywhere he went he seemed to meet somebody who could help him. Lloyd George enters on page 3. Unfortunately Goodman was too young to be introduced, but he did know Edward Heath's father long before most people had heard of the young Teddy. He was put off economics at University College London, but by no less a person than Hugh Gaitskell, who taught him for a term. In the war he met George Wigg who urged him to be a Labour candidate in the 1945 general election. The seat in mind was Tory-held and, Goodman thought, likely to remain so. In the event it went Labour. Goodman reflects that history might have been changed if he had stood. One contact led to another. Although he never joined the Labour party, and sometimes did not even vote for it, Goodman notes that almost all his political connections were on the left. When Harold Wilson became prime minister in 1964, it crossed Goodman's mind that he might be offered a job. It came slightly later when he was made chairman of the Arts Council, but he was also an unofficial adviser to Wilson, summoned whenever the prime minister wanted. Other tasks followed, notably sounding out Ian Smith on a Rhodesian settlement. Goodman thinks that if he had accompanied Wilson to the Fearless talks in 1968, a settlement might have been reached. By then, he was sometimes known as the Blessed Arnold. His role in government continued in the Heath period when he still sought a Rhodesian deal. Wilson had made him a peer; Heath made him a Companion of Honour. He met the Queen alone, 'a tremendous privilege', writes Goodman, 'compared with lining up with hundreds of others to receive some trivial award like a knighthood'. Still, it is with the early Wilson years that he will be most associated. His contacts were useful, he was discreet and he was undoubtedly a clever lawyer. Although it may seem an inappropriate metaphor for a man so physically large, he worked like a rugby centre three-quarter, spotting a gap and going for it fast. He was a lawyer who preferred to settle out of court. The newspaper world, development of commercial television and showbusiness helped, since all involved legal work. Goodman says he never looked back after advising Associated Newspapers in 1954 how to mount the Ideal Home Exhibition with a lower tax bill. Good fortune and good contacts dogged him for the rest of his life. In the mid-1970s, when he was less active in politics, he was offered the Mastership of University College Oxford despite remembering only one visit to Oxford in his life and never having previously dined at High Table at either Oxford or Cambridge. Naturally he accepted. He said he wanted little to do with fund raising, but then found it quite easy to raise Pounds 300,000 for the college by a single letter. Other letters followed. Only Armand Hammer turned him down. The book contains big gaps. Goodman claims that the English legal system, with its division between solicitors and barristers, is 'demented', but he has not been prominent in seeking to reform it. He is unduly complacent about the law of libel, out of which professionally he has not done badly. His foreign travel is limited, his interest in economics non-existent, and he does not say much about the changing state of Britain over time. He professes a great love of theatre and music; the evidence here is confined to name-dropping and fund-raising. He is also capable of great contempt (though not, of course, in the legal sense) of the Foreign Office in particular, the civil service in general, of Harold Wilson's other cronies, sometimes of Wilson himself, and of practically every member of the Tory party since 1979, though he is careful not to be too rude about Lady Thatcher. His political hero, kept to the end for the encomium, was Harold Macmillan. In short, Lord Goodman seems a trifle pleased with himself. No intelligent man, especially a lawyer, should write, as he does: 'I believe fervently.' One may hope fervently; belief is a different matter.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Reort by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>   [Text] The unified command of the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has appealed to Fatah members and  cadres and the Fatah Hawks in the occupied territories to  withdraw their confidence from 'Arafat's leadership and rebel  against its orders, policies, and course as this leadership has  given up national rights. This came in a statement issued by  the two fronts' unified command.    The unified command said that the massacre of Jabaliya in  Gaza once again shows that the occupation does not differentiate  among the revolution's strugglers, and that it pursues its  terrorism against all the sons of the Palestinian people.    For his part, DFLP secretary General Nayif Hawatimah has  emphasized the need to immediatley stop wagering on the U.S.  Administration. He called for discarding the belief that  Washington will bring pressure to bear on Israel, as the  Oslo-Cairo agreement proponents claim. Hawatimah called on  those who defend this agreement to give up their positions in  the PLO.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bashkortostan's President Murtaza Rakhimov stated  that his republic did not need a civic accord agreement. He  told Interfax that the signing of declarative agreements was a  waste of time, given a stable political and ethnic situation in  Bashkortostan.    "Russia's troubles are rooted in its ailing economy, not in  a  lack of political declarations," he said.    He also pointed out that the Bashkortostan leaders had  concentrated on measures to prevent the economic ruin and to  create normal conditions for industrial production.    To quote Rakhimov, the leaders of Bashkortostan have passed  a  number of decrees aimed at shaping reserve salary funds and  delaying tax payments.</p>

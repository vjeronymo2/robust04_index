			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Australian wool sold well again this week, and the overall market indicator finished another 8 cents higher at a new seasonal peak of 554 cents a kg. New Zealand was also a firm market, with some wools dearer, though the selection there had a slant to carpet types and not always comparable with last week's sharply dearer sale. The outstanding market of the week was the auction of British wool in Bradford with prices 7.5% to 10% dearer, and also at new seasonal peaks. All the pressure to rising prices seems to be coming from primary markets and little pull from the retail end is indicated in the trade. Australian offerings are higher than expected in the remaining weeks of the season and a negligible amount of stockpile wool is to be added to three auctions to test out this method of stockpile disposal, due to start in the first half of the next season.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Foreign Affairs Josef Zieleniec </F> and Defense Minister Antonin Baudys by LIDOVE NOVINY reporters  "vik, has"; place and date not given: "The Czech Minister of  Foreign Affairs Is Convinced That Our Place Is by the Side of  the Allies"]    [Text] Prague--The issue has been discussed for several  days now as to whether President Havel's and Prime Minister  Klaus's views on possible NATO air strikes in Bosnia differ. The  view could also be heard that the minister of foreign affairs  rather backs Vaclav Havel's statements in support of air  strikes, made during the president's visit to Thailand. In this  context, we asked Josef Zieleniec a few questions:    [LIDOVE NOVINY] What is your view of possible NATO air  strikes in Bosnia?    [Zieleniec] First, it must be realized that the world is  still at a loss about what to do about this conflict and that a  solution can come only from within the former Yugoslavia,  perhaps with help from international organizations. Second,  however, we also have to realize that the NATO countries'  ultimatum is meant, first and foremost, as some kind of relief  for the citizens of Sarajevo. It is an attempt to prevent the  city from being strangled.    It was very hard for the NATO states to arrive at this  decision, which is not only militarily intricate but also  politically risky. I believe that, at such a moment, our place  is by their side. If we use the word "allies" in relation to  these countries, we should be taking this term seriously in good  times as well as in bad--that is, even when decisions that are  painful and difficult for them are at stake.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Prime Minister Klaus does not believe that  there will be any air strikes. What is your opinion?    [Zieleniec] I have been in politics for too long to let  myself be dragged into forecasting. Nevertheless, I hope they  will not occur. Everything suggests that NATO issued its  ultimatum with all due responsibility, and it seems that the  warring parties, too, realize this. If the ultimatum is  accepted as a serious warning, there need not be any air  strikes, which is certainly the wish of all people who care  about peace in Europe.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Should we back the allies only with regard  to the ultimatum, or should we back them also in the event of  actual air strikes?    [Zieleniec] The ultimatum cannot be detached from its  fulfillment, for otherwise it would be empty rhetoric and a  political mistake.    Minister of Defense Antonin Baudys, too, spoke with LIDOVE  NOVINY about the possibility of air strikes. He said, among  other things, that the NATO Council's decision on whether to  intervene in Bosnia has its pros and cons. "The NATO analysts  and strategists have enough information and are sufficiently  qualified to know how to decide. I believe that their decision  was correct. It is true, and it is also my opinion that a  solution does not lie in air raids or other acts of military  intervention but only in negotiations. As the negotiations  still have not produced any results, however, it was necessary  to exert stronger pressure on the parties to the Bosnian  conflict to sit down at the conference table with a greater  measure of goodwill to seek a compromise. This is how I  perceived the ultimatum and the NATO Council's agreement to the  possible bombing of the Serbian artillery positions. As far as  our attitude is concerned, I do not want to foist upon our  representatives ulterior motives in the sense that, when we want  to be in NATO, we must agree with it. NATO surely will not  request our cooperation now because we are not a member."</p>

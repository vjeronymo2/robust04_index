			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Markets: A Blockbuster of Paramount importance - Wall Street BOND YIELDS may be rising again, economic growth is still spotty, and concern about the coming quarterly reporting season is growing - but US share prices have been more than holding their own. If anyone needs to know why market sentiment has remained so robust, Wednesday's release of the latest mutual fund sales figures provided a good part of the answer. According to the Investment Company Institute, a record Dollars 12.1bn of investors' money flowed into stock mutual funds in August. The numbers are quite startling. Not only was the August figure up 24 per cent from the Dollars 9.7bn stock fund inflows recorded in July but, over the first eight months of this year, stock funds have attracted a record Dollars 82bn of new money. This is already more than the Dollars 78bn recorded in all of 1992, itself a record year. It has been said many times in the past couple of years, but it is worth saying again: the flow of investors' money into the equity markets is unprecedented, in both size and consistency, and it has been the most important factor behind the present, and very long, bull market. The impact upon share prices of the heavy buying of equity funds would have been even more pronounced but for the fact that there has been an equally unprecedented supply of new stock to meet the demand from individual investors. This week, the latest equity issuance figures were released by Securities Data, the New Jersey-based financial information group. They showed that US, and a growing number of foreign, companies have been raising capital by issuing new equity in record amounts this year. In the first three quarters of this year, 539 companies made their debut on the equity markets; they raised a total of Dollars 40bn, already more than in all of 1992. The past three months have been particularly busy, with Dollars 13.4bn raised through initial public offerings, or IPOs (flotations), more than half the Dollars 24.4bn raised through all stock issues. It is not difficult to discover why investors' appetite for IPOs is so strong. US share prices have been at, or near, record levels for most of the year but, more importantly, the performance of IPOs has been spectacular. According to Securities Data, the average IPO stock gained 28.7 per cent in price between the date of issue and the end of September. With short-term money market funds returning not much more than 3 per cent, and bond funds between 5 per cent and 7 per cent, no wonder investors are scrambling to buy into new stock issues. This week's deluge of data, however, did not carry an entirely positive message for US stock markets. The fund sales figures showed that more and more investors are buying into foreign equity funds. Moreover, analysts who track fund flows say that much of the money going into foreign funds is coming straight out of domestic stock funds. Of the Dollars 12.1bn that went into all stock funds in August, Dollars 6.64bn, or just 55 per cent, went into funds that invest only in US stocks. The rest of that money departed overseas as investors, believing US equities to be too costly and possibly fearing an imminent correction in US markets, went in search of cheaper, more attractive foreign stocks. Fund managers in New York, Boston, and across the US say that their customers' interest in stocks has been overwhelmingly biased towards foreign markets over the past few recent months. Yet, as long as interest rates remain low and keep luring investors out of low-yielding money market funds and bank certificates of deposit, the flows overseas are not overly worrying. Wall Street, however, will begin to sweat if interest rates (which rose above 6 per cent at the long end of the bond market this week) start heading upward, and investors continue to find foreign equities more attractive than the home-grown variety. At least the battle for control over Paramount Communications, the entertainment group, is providing the domestic markets with something to get excited about. The contest between Viacom and QVC heated up this week when Blockbuster Entertainment announced it was investing Dollars 600m in Viacom in a deal that should allow Viacom to increase its agreed offer to Paramount, which is at present lower than QVC's rival bid. Viacom is also rumoured to be close to securing additional funds from several other companies. Foreign markets may look more attractive to US investors at the moment but they cannot possibly offer a bid war as exciting and intriguing as the fight for Paramount, which is far from over.

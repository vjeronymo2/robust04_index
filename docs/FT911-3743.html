			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Government adds Pounds 4m to YT funding EXTRA financial help is being provided by the government to ensure that its guarantee of a place to all young people on its main training scheme for 16- to 19-year-olds is met. Essex Training and Enterprise Council warned last month that its funding allocation of Pounds 12.3m for Youth Training in 1991-92 would leave about 5,000 young people without a YT place, out of an estimated total of 6,450 in the county. The warning came when many Tecs were expressing fears that cuts in funds for YT, coupled with rising un-employment, could leave them unable to meet the guaran-tee. Mr Roy Lawrence, chairman of Essex Tec, said: 'Essex Tec is delighted that the government has moved so swiftly to provide an extra amount - more than Pounds 4m - in response to the recent review of YT in Essex.' The Department of Employment said Essex Tec had been told that the government would underwrite any overspend after the Tec had spent on YT the Pounds 12.3m and any operating surpluses arising from savings on its other training budgets. The department said it believed Essex was the only Tec which had said it could not meet the guarantee. If other Tecs made similar claims they would have to be reviewed.</p>

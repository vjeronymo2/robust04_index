			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Mexico: Salinas leads the attack on poverty IN THE dusty squatter town of Chalco, in the state of Mexico, slogans for Solidarity cover billboards and houses. Schools, roads and clinics are named Solidarity. Women in blue tracksuits roam the streets promoting Solidarity. This is Mexico's Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.9bn) a year anti-poverty initiative, the most visible government programme of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Attacked by critics as a pork-barrel that subverts democracy, Solidarity is hailed by government officials as a leap forward. The need for some kind of anti-poverty programme is uncontroversial. According to the World Bank around 20 per cent of Mexicans - 17m people - are extremely poor: that is, they do not have enough money to meet minimum nutritional levels. Most of these live in the countryside. They have the lowest levels of education and are from, and have, large families. Solidarity is intended to integrate these people into the mainstream economy, by giving them critical public services, and letting them benefit from the government's pro-market economic reforms and restructuring (lowering inflation to single digits, reducing middle-class subsidies and reforming agriculture). In four years, Solidarity has provided around 10m people with electricity and water, 8m with drainage, provided half a million school scholarships and created 2,400 small businesses. Unlike many poverty plans, the Solidarity infrastructure programme does not pour money into depressed areas. It is founded largely on the president's belief that projects that are run locally will be better supported and more efficient. The community must first form a Solidarity committee which requests funds for specific projects. The federal or state government provides basic materials, technical help, and the local Solidarity committee builds its road, school, or clinic. Since the community is sharing the cost of a project (through time committed) and identifying its own needs, it is unlikely to choose plans that do not benefit it. Further, the federal government saves money. Mr Carlos Rojas, head of Solidarity, estimates that roads are built at 70 per cent of normal cost and schools at 60 per cent. There are about 100,000 Solidarity committees around the country, forming a network of support for Mr Salinas. The president has taken care to ensure he is identified closely with the programme: he spends two days a week inaugurating Solidarity projects and handing out land titles, dashing with his entourage of journalists, businessmen, and politicians from village to village by helicopter. The school, clinic, or land title is then widely seen as his personal gift. The opposition argues that the programme undermines democracy by making it difficult for the opposition to compete. There is also evidence Solidarity spending is directed politically. Mr Juan Molinar, a professor at the Colegio de Mexico, has just completed an econometric evaluation of Solidarity spending and concludes: 'Solidarity is not an apolitical policy for alleviating poverty; on the contrary it is clear that the central planners make the decision to spend based on political and electoral concerns.' The World Bank asks whether the Solidarity programme should be more focused on its key programmes. It covers food support for the undernourished, free credit for farmers, risk capital for small businesses, scholarships for children, land titles for squatters, and urgent infrastructure needs, such as as roads, electricity, hospitals, to name a few. Government officials retort that an all-embracing programme is necessary given the costs associated with the restructuring of Mexico's economy. Mr Donaldo Colosio, social development minister, says: 'The network of social protection is crucial given the current economic restructuring, above all the (economy's) technological and productive transformation.' Solidarity, Mr Colosio says, is thus helping start new businesses in parts of the country worse hit by industrial restructuring - Puebla, Veracruz, and northern Tabasco. Mr Carlos Flores Rico, the social development delegate for the state of Mexico, argues Solidarity has helped the Institutional Revolutionary Party electorally not just because it gives public goods away, but also because it gives citizens a stake in their community. 'Now people own their houses, electricity, and water whereas before they were outcasts,' he says. Their view of the system has changed.' For this reason, even those like the World Bank who believe the structural economic reforms are likely to have a longer term impact than a Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn anti-poverty programme, accept the value of Solidarity. The programme, they argue, has helped generate political support for economic reforms by giving people tangible benefits instead of just hardship.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky has said in  Washington that although Hungarian foreign policy is basically  directed toward the West, ties with Russia also have to be  consolidated. Following his talks with U.S. Defense Secretary  William Perry, Geza Jeszenszky said that the United States is  beginning to understand Hungary's special position in connection  with Vojvodina and that the Serbs are wrong to think that the  Hungarians treat them as an enemy. Further details about Geza  Jesznszky's visit to Wasington are given by Miklos Martin Kovacs:    [Kovacs] The United States sees clearly that the Hungarian  Government's intention is also to settle the Balkan crisis as  soon as possible and in the fairest way. [passage omitted]    Also in Washington, in the White House's Roosevelt Hall,  President Clinton met members of organizations representing the  Visegrad countries in America -- Czechs, Poles, Hungarians, and  Slovaks. Laszlo Papp, one of the five Hungarian participants in  the meeting representing the local branch of the World  Federation of Hungarians, told Hungarian Radio that President  Clinton made it clear that his government continues to rely on  their opinion, since it pays special attention to  Eastern-Central Europe and the U.S. Government is clear about  the interests of the region. Bill Clinton added that the two  main American concerns when evaluating the various governments  are the progress of privatization and the enforcement of  democracy.</p>

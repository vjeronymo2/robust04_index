			<p>BFN     [Text] As a result of the Wednesday Russian-Finnish talks  in the Kremlin the Russian Central Bank and Ministry of Finance  have been instructed to work out a system guaranteeing foreign  investments against political risks. Such certificates will  stimulate Finnish investments in the Russian economy, the  Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari told the press after his  talks with President Boris Yeltsin.    According to Yeltsin, the talks were very fruitful for the  simple reason that they offered many concrete venues to  Russian-Finnish relations at a new level. Among other things  the two sides discussed the speedy adoption of legislation for  the protection of investments, the prevention of dual taxation  and several others matters that should stimulate economic  relations.    Yeltsin also said that several new big projects were  discussed with the Finnish president, in particular the  construction of the Yamburg-Germany gas pipeline in North Russia  with a branch to Finland. Ahtisaari is going to discuss the  matter with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin later on Wednesday,  Yeltsin announced.    Yeltsin said that the Russian debt to Finland is small and  ways of regulating it were discussed. He stressed that Russia  and Finland have no political problems.    Answering a question from Interfax after the Kremlin talks  the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev called them very  successful, fruitful and dynamic. He said they went far beyond  bilateral relations.    Kozyrev was satisfied that the Finnish side confirmed the  need for establishing the post of a human rights commissioner  for Baltic countries similar to the one existing in the  framework of the CSCE. He said this is especially important in  view of the upcoming meeting of Baltic foreign ministers in  Tallinn. "Until recently the debate on the matter was very  difficult, he said, and I even thought of not going to Tallinn."    Kozyrev said that Russian-Finnish relations, the absence of  any territorial problems between the two sides can become a good  example for Baltic countries, Latvia and Estonia in particular,  so that they would not lay any territorial claims to Russia.    "We cannot retreat from the principles or essence of CSCE  decisions and make territorial claims to each other. This would  be tantamount to opening Pandora's box", the foreign minister  said. To prevent these matters from becoming an obstacle for  the world community they should simply never be raised again.    Kozyrev said he did not think Finnish mediation is necessary  in Russian-Estonian talks. "We do not need mediators, but we  always accept friendly help", he said.    "We do not demand privileges for the Russian-speaking  community in Baltic countries. We demand equality. It is not a  Russian question, it is a question of human rights and  morality", Kozyrev said.</p>

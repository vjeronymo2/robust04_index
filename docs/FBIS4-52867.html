When the county people rose in a powerful struggle against  the development of nuclear weapons and the construction of the  nuclear waste dump by the puppet clique on the 12th and 13th of  May, the puppets ruthlessly cracked down upon the protesters and  touched off a wave of arrest targeted at those who led the  protest.    The news analyst says:    It is the Kim Yong-sam group that must be brought to justice  in South Korea, the group that has introduced U.S. nuclear  weapons and, as if it were not enough, is stepping up its own  criminal nuclear development to impose a nuclear scourge upon  the nation and is bringing sufferings to the people by dumping  nuclear waste at random.    The puppets, themselves being the criminals, are brutally  suppressing the people in the anti-nuke struggle. This is a  shameless and outrageous fascist violence, which reminds us of a  thief crying "stop thief!".    The Kim Yong-sam clique must immediately stop developing  nuclear weapons and dumping nuclear waste and step down as  demanded by the people.</p>

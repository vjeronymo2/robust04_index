			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'A' IS FOR AWFUL  </P> <P> Harry Shearer (Man Bites Town, " 'A' Is for Awful," Sept. 16) claims that the  only individuals who are in our public schools today are "people who have no  choice."  </P> <P> Let me correct him. Speaking for myself and many fellow colleagues, we have  chosen to remain teachers because we care about America's future and wish to  contribute to our nation's success. We have not given up to find work  elsewhere. Unlike Shearer, we have chosen to stay and fight.  </P> <P> RICHARD HALSEY  </P> <P> Escondido  </P></p>

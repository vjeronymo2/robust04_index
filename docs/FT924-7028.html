			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (5): Going gets tough - Securities A FOREIGN fund manager visiting a Korean securities firm in the high-rise financial district of Youido was horrified to find the staff playing table tennis. His tale is not unusual: the Korean securities industry expanded rapidly in the late 1980s, but many stockbrokers now find they are overstaffed and overbranched at a time when commission income is falling because of the weak stock market. Added to this, competition on their home turf has increased as several foreign securities houses have set up branches in Korea to accompany the opening of the market to foreigners. The securities sector is in need of rationalisation. Overheads are high, after expansion at home and abroad, but Korean securities houses are reluctant to cut branches and staff. Given the Korean cultural aversion to sacking employees, securities companies admit the only way they can curb growing wage bills is by halting annual recruitment. Commission income for equity trading is down as the bear market has deterred individual investors, who once dominated activity, and institutions - although the latter are obliged to invest specified amounts in the market as part of the government's attempts to prop up share prices. The securities houses, too, have been forced to participate in stock market support measures and many are sitting on enormous share portfolios on which they have made a loss. Daewoo Securities, the largest broker, said its holdings amounted to about Won500bn at the end of September, and it expects to see a 15 to 20 per cent book loss on its portfolio at year-end. One foreign analyst estimates the big securities houses are sitting on share portfolio losses of Dollars 100-200m each. The Securities Supervisory Board points out that most of the securities houses made losses in the first six months of the financial year, with combined losses for the 10 largest brokers amounting to Won76bn. The outlook remains bleak as Korean securities houses expect to face increased competition from the handful of foreign brokers that have opened branches in Seoul. Branch status allows a foreign securities house to conduct research and liaison business, and to generate revenue by placing buy and sell orders. However, the orders have to go through a Korean broker, who receives 30 per cent of the commission. Jardine Fleming, one of the first to open a branch, admits that under current market conditions it is not making a profit on the broking side: instead it makes money by investing part of its Won10bn minimum capital requirement in the high-yielding bond market and from proprietary trading. Baring Securities and Jardine Fleming both made small losses in their first year as branches, but compared with their domestic rivals, they have the advantage of being leaner outfits, without a large branch network and huge workforce. The domestic houses see them as a threat for several reasons. First, Koreans would prefer to do business directly with overseas investors, rather than share the commission with a foreign house. Secondly, they are worried that foreigners could steal their domestic institutional clients. So far, foreign houses have made little headway on that front. Business in Korea depends primarily on relationships built up over many years. As one Korean stockbroker puts it: 'In Korea there is no big difference between the securities houses in terms of transaction costs or research. Fund managers often have their own research team - what is more important is the relationship with the broker, the frequent calls, visits and dinners.' Yet attitudes appear to be changing. Foreign houses place far more emphasis on the quality of their research and some Korean houses admit that with the arrival of foreign houses, Korean institutions are showing a keener interest in the research material put out. Finally, if stock market activity picks up, some foreign houses may be tempted to put up the relatively large sum required for a seat on the stock exchange, allowing them to trade directly. 'At the moment, the volumes generated simply do not justify a seat,' says Mr Philip Smiley, branch manager of Jardine Fleming. But if and when they do, Korean brokers believe they will provide 'really tough competition'.</p>

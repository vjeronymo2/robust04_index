			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> AIR FORCE FINDS RADAR AND ARMED AIRCRAFT A HAZARDOUS MIX  </P> <P> In the control tower at Robins Air Force Base, Ga., Master Sgt. George Green  asks one important question when the pilot of a fighter, attack or bomber  aircraft requests permission to make an unscheduled landing.  </P> <P> "Are you carrying external electro-explosive devices?"  </P> <P> If the answer is yes, chief controller Green picks up a direct line to the  operator of the PAVE PAWS radar installation two miles south of the central  Georgia base.  </P> <P> The radar operator flips a switch, and for several minutes, until the plane  lands, half of the $90 million radar screen, built to give instantaneous  warning of any submarine-launched missile off the southeastern United States,  is shut down.  </P> <P> Since November, 1987, the Air Force now acknowledges, the north face of PAVE  PAWS at Robins has been turned off an average of 14 times a month -- for a  total down time of about an hour a month -- so that planes carrying externally  mounted EEDs can land.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Precautionary Shutdowns  </P> <P> Operation of the defensive warning system is interrupted to prevent accidental  detonations of the EEDs, tiny explosive charges that are in virtually every  military weapons system and in the planes and ships that deliver them.  </P> <P> EEDs are used, among other things, to trigger weapons, drop bombs, or jettison  fuel tanks. They are detonated by an electrical circuit, but can be set off by  high levels of electromagnetic energy from environmental sources such as radio  waves, radar, static electricity and lightning.  </P> <P> The Air Force insists that the periodic interruptions have not hindered the  effectiveness of the early warning system because the shutdowns occur at random  and other radars are available as backups. Routine maintenance, the Air Force  says, shuts the radar down for about 40 hours a month.  </P> <P> "Our primary concern at Robins with PAVE PAWS is safety of flight," Lt. Col.  John Harmon, commander of the base communications squadron, said. "We want to  make sure that we have procedures in effect so there is no possibility of any  plane having externally mounted EEDs flying in a dangerous situation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protects Wide Area  </P> <P> PAVE PAWS stands for Precision Acquisition Vehicle Entry Phased Array Warning  System. The 10-story, pyramid-shaped installation at Robins, one of four such  facilities in the nation, has thousands of computer-directed antennas that can  scan 240 degrees to a distance of 3,000 miles. The radar reportedly can  identify an object the size of a basketball when it is 1,500 miles away.  </P> <P> The radar near Robins is the only one near an active runway; there have been no  problems reported near the others.  </P> <P> PAVE PAWS had been in operation for a year at Robins before Air Force officials  became convinced that its powerful electromagnetic emissions might endanger  aircraft.  </P> <P> They instituted the periodic shutdown procedure and established a restricted  zone around the radar of one nautical mile, about 6,000 feet, for all aircraft  flying at or below 6,400 feet.  </P> <P> The Air Force contends that it has taken a conservative and cautious approach  at Robins, but critics, such as Patricia Axelrod, coordinator of the HERO  Project, say the location of the radar near a base where ordnance is handled is  a disaster waiting to happen. The air base, Georgia's largest, is near the  community of Warner-Robins, population 40,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Federal Suit Filed  </P> <P> The HERO Project, which derives its name from the Navy acronym Hazard of  Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance, is part of a coalition that has filed  suit in federal court in Washington, alleging that the military has not  shielded its weaponry sufficiently to prevent accidents.  </P> <P> Axelrod and the defense specialists assisting her in the lawsuit say that the  6,000-foot hazard zone is not sufficient. She cited Navy documents recommending  that the EA-6 Prowler airplane, laden with electronic-warfare equipment far  less powerful than PAVE PAWS, should be kept at least 8,000 feet away from  areas where ordnance is handled.  </P> <P> Axelrod also said the flight restrictions at Robins force pilots into "a  trapeze act without a net" because of the possibility of human error in the  chain of communication required to shut down the radar when a plane is landing.  </P> <P> Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also  has criticized the restrictions because of their reliance "on the potentially  fallible human links between the pilot, control tower, and PAVE PAWS radar  operators."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Evaluation Requested  </P> <P> Nunn has asked the Air Force for an official evaluation of the potential  hazards to aircraft at Robins, and of the long-term adequacy of the current  procedures.  </P> <P> Lt. Gen. Donald J. Kutyna, who heads the Air Force Space Command responsible  for the warning system, acknowledged in a recent interview that he would rather  have the radar someplace else.  </P> <P> "Based on what I know today, the radar may not hurt anything, but there is some  concern. Otherwise, there wouldn't be any flight restrictions," he said. "If I  had the choice, all things being equal, I would put the radar where I would not  have to impose any safety zone."  </P> <P> The Air Force said the initial environmental assessment for PAVE PAWS concluded  that the restricted zone needed around the radar would not interfere with the  flight paths of any aircraft using the Robins runway.  </P> <P> That conclusion was changed in 1987. Further calculations were made while the  Air Force was developing plans to triple the power of PAVE PAWS to enhance its  ability to track satellites in space. The new figures indicated that a larger  restricted zone was needed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Peak Power Measured  </P> <P> The key difference in the new calculation was the way the radar's power was  measured. The first assessment used the average power of the radar pulses over  time; the later one used the peak power of each pulse.  </P> <P> Air Force officials acknowledge that the contractor who did the initial  assessment recommended using peak power to calculate the restricted zone, but  that advice was rejected because Air Force experts at the time did not believe  brief exposure of an EED to the radar pulses would be hazardous.  </P> <P> "We were on the cutting edge of technology with PAVE PAWS at the time we made  that initial environmental assessment," Kutyna said. "To have learned something  new since that time does not say that you were making a mistake before."  </P> <P> The Air Force already has spent $600,000 to have Raytheon Corp., which built  the radar system, study the problem. Raytheon recommended moving the  installation, at a cost of $37.7 million, or modifying it, at a cost of $27  million, so it would shut down automatically if a plane breached the restricted  zone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Permanent Solution Sought  </P> <P> Kutyna said moving the radar is not feasible, but the modification proposal is  under consideration. He said a panel of senior Air Force officers has been  convened to make recommendations by June on a permanent solution to end the  flight restrictions.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the Air Force has shelved its plan to triple the radar's power  so it could take over the space-tracking functions of the outdated radar system  at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., at an annual savings of $11 million.  </P> <P> "Unless there is a solution in the books that comes out of this study, I would  say the chances of putting that (power) upgrade on there at this time are not  high," Kutyna said.  </P></p>

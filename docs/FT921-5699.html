			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Chelsea given completion date for ground purchase MARCH 26 has been set as the date when Chelsea Football Club should complete the Pounds 22.85m purchase of its west London ground from a subsidiary of Cabra Estates, the heavily indebted property company. The date has been agreed by both sides, but Chelsea has described this as a matter of routine and plans to appeal against the recently imposed High Court order to complete the purchase. 'Hopefully by the end of the week we will apply for a stay of the order to pay Pounds 23m,' said Mr Peter Taylor of Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warrens, the club's solicitors. Chelsea is continuing to pursue a claim for damages against the vendor. Its aim is to get a damages award set against the purchase price. Last week's judgment was not favourable to this line of argument and Chelsea also intends to take this claim to appeal. Cabra, which last week announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 11.3m for the six months to September 30, wants to get the money in before its March 31 year-end. It would help to reduce net debt of about Pounds 52m, which is on demand.</p>

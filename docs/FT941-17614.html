			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Farewell, then, to the BES - It became too much of a tax break for its own good Goats, gymnasiums, whisky, racing cars, hairdressers, hospitals, films, Oxbridge colleges - you name it and there has been a business expansion scheme involved. But the BES, which latterly became too good a tax break to be true, was finally laid to rest last night. Many will not mourn its demise, particularly those who invested in the many trading companies which failed in the early years. For others, however, the transformation of the BES from venture capital to property backed by cash or bank guarantee means it has been a very good investment. A major factor in its abolition was mounting unease - expressed most critically by the Labour party - that the wealthy and BES sponsors were benefiting at the expense of the state. The BES enabled investors to shelter up to Pounds 40,000 a year at their top marginal rate of income tax as long as they held their investment for five years. This meant that a 40 per cent taxpayer could make a Pounds 20,000 investment in a BES at a net cost of only Pounds 12,000. Like its predecessor, the short-lived business start-up scheme (BSS), the government's original intention was to raise finance for businesses by providing tax incentives for investors. But while the BSS, dogged by legislation that was too restrictive, accounted for only Pounds 40m in its two years of existence, the BES brought in more than Pounds 1.1bn in its last 10 months alone - more than a quarter of all BES funds raised. This should suggest that it was an unqualified success. But the largest proportion of the money, Pounds 3.4bn, was raised only after 1988 when Nigel Lawson, then chancellor of the exchequer, decided to use the BES to increase the supply of private rented accommodation to improve labour mobility. In the five years to 1988/9, the BES raised only Pounds 780m in total. The graphic shows that annual investments increased slowly but steadily from Pounds 105m in 1983/4 to Pounds 201m in 1987/8. But legislative changes meant that investment in trading companies fell acutely in the 1988 tax year and never recovered to the same degree. Trading companies had a double blow in 1988. Not only did Lawson extend the BES into a tool of government housing policy, he also capped (to Pounds 500,000) the amount trading companies could raise. But private renting companies (and shipping) were allowed to raise up to Pounds 5m. At first, the BES industry did not welcome these changes. In an open letter to the chancellor, Charles Fry, chairman of the largest BES sponsor, Johnson Fry - doubted that landlords would consider the scheme a good investment because the security of tenure afforded to tenants was too great. Moreover the reduction of the top rate of income tax from 60 per cent to 40 meant the BES was a less valuable tax break than before. Nevertheless, it raised twice as much in the 1988 tax year than in the previous 12 months. Financial services groups developed attractive, assured tenancy issues where a qualifying company could buy houses and rent them for five years, after which they could be sold and investors could collect any profits free of capital gains tax. This was attractive in a strong property market and, at the time, there were few who could predict the scale in the fall of property prices, especially in the south-east of England. In addition, 1988/89 was the last tax year in which investors could carry back tax relief on BES investments to the previous year when the 60 per cent income tax rate was in force. Sponsors were not slow to capitalise on the marketing opportunities that this provided and flooded the market with new issues. Investors were attracted by brick-based assets where typical returns of 17 per cent a year were cited. This assumed a 10 per cent annual rise in property prices and 40 per cent BES income tax relief. Trade funds and trading companies raised only Pounds 29m in 1988/89 of the Pounds 421m total. But they fared better the following year when the drop in property prices made investors nervous of putting money into a falling market. Enthusiasm for the BES also waned that year when Lawson ended the double tax advantages of investing in closed companies - those controlled by five people or fewer. Investors had been able to gain tax relief on money borrowed to invest in assured tenancies in addition to the usual income tax BES relief. If the trading companies thought the fall in property market prices would mean a mass return by investors who had deserted them, they were disappointed. Sponsors refined assured tenancy issues to allow exit routes after five years, with a commitment by companies to buy back the shares from investors. Bank guarantees and backing helped to squeeze out the risks associated normally with the BES, while distorting the spirit of the legislation. Instead of stimulating the rental housing sector, universities and Oxbridge colleges were allowed to use the tax breaks. The notorious loan-back schemes developed in 1992 proved hugely popular, accounting for two-thirds of BES funds raised in the '92/93 tax year. Effectively, these allowed investors to leave the BES after only six months instead of the full five years and were abolished in the March 1993 Budget - by which time they had soaked up much of the burden of the repossessed properties. Arranged exit assured tenancies did not promise the same kind of return that a successful trading company might offer. But their success in raising large amounts of funds appears to have been due to a combination of the attractiveness of the tax break and the asset backing provided. By contrast, many of the early trading companies have lost investors' money. BES specialist John Harrison estimates that, of the 227 trading companies funded by public prospectus issues or collective funds in 1983/94, more than 100 have failed, including some of those which achieved a stock exchange listing. The riskiest were the smallest - those raising less than Pounds 500,000 - which, up to 1988, showed a failure rate twice that of the larger companies. A study* published by the Small Business Research Trust in 1988 concluded that the BES had fallen well short of the government's aims. It found that the take-up rate of the BES was low compared with other sources of equity finance for the small business sector, such as loan guarantee schemes and the enterprise allowance scheme. Furthermore, although the BES was intended largely to benefit high technology businesses, the main recipients were in service sectors or in asset related businesses, 'reflecting the attraction of the BES as a tax shelter for higher-rate taxpayers with a predominant concern for security rather than risk.' *Closing the Equity Gap?

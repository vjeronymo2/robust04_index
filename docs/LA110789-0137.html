			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Abernathy rebuffed: The board of trustees at the Rev. Ralph Abernathy's alma  mater, Alabama State University, has reversed a decision to name a new  dormitory after the civil rights leader. Trustees said the action was taken  because of allegations in Abernathy's recent autobiography, "And the Walls Came  Tumbling Down," that Martin Luther King, Jr. had extramarital affairs with two  women the night before he was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968.  </P> <P> Setting the record straight: The daughter of Polish President Wojciech  Jaruzelski is getting lots of media exposure but doesn't like all of it. Monika  Jaruzelska, 25, declares the Sunday Times of London was off base in saying that  she and her father argued over imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981. She  also was less than thrilled with recent photos in the French weekly Paris-Match  showing her at home with her father, in front of a fireplace, in a limo, in bed  in a sleeveless undershirt, and wearing a gray fur coat.  </P></p>

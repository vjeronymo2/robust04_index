			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOSTAGES FREED, REBELS GIVE UP IN TRINIDAD  </P> <P> The five-day hostage crisis that devastated the capital city of Trinidad and  Tobago ended Wednesday with the surrender of 112 black Muslim rebels who were  holding 46 captives in two besieged downtown buildings.  </P> <P> Minister of Planning Winston Dookeran, who led the government's negotiating  team, said the hostage takers surrendered unconditionally and are being  detained under heavy guard at the Teteron army barracks, 10 miles west of Port  of Spain.  </P> <P> When asked if the government had deceived the rebels into believing they would  be pardoned and released, Dookeran evaded a direct answer and simply repeated  his assertion that the capitulation was unconditional.  </P> <P> Government spokesman Gregory Shaw had earlier suggested that the rebels could  face charges of treason and murder for crimes that included the bombing deaths  of at least two policemen. But Dookeran, who was himself a hostage for the  first day of the five-day ordeal, would go no further than to say that  "appropriate charges will be laid after an investigation."  </P> <P> "The government condemns this abhorrent crime," Dookeran said at a press  conference late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Dookeran announced that Parliamentary Secretary Leo Divine died of gunshot  wounds to the leg, received during the violent takeover of the Parliament  building.  </P> <P> He added that ailing Prime Minister Arthur N. R. Robinson, who was released by  the rebels on humanitarian grounds Tuesday, was hospitalized in good condition  and "there is no intention for him to resign."  </P> <P> But some rebels of the group known as Jaamat al Muslimeen insisted that the  government had promised them amnesty and that they were to be allowed to return  to their controversial religious commune just north of Port of Spain. They said  part of their supposed deal included Robinson's resignation.  </P> <P> The rebels, a number of whom appeared to be of East Indian descent, looked more  like prisoners than pardoned men as they filed out at gunpoint, one at a time  through a drenching tropical rain, to tightly guarded buses outside the  Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT) building, where 29 of the hostages had  been held.  </P> <P> The leader of the attempted coup that led to the hostage taking, Yasin abu  Bakr, was spread-eagled against the wall of a building near the TTT  headquarters and searched before being prodded toward a bus.  </P> <P> Abu Bakr, clad all in white and with hands clasped atop his head in surrender,  smiled broadly and called "Allah is the greatest" to journalists. Earlier, he  had walked out of the television building, placed his rifle in the street and  then stood at attention as his followers came out singly at two-minute  intervals, holding weapons over their heads. He submitted to a search only  after all his followers had been searched first, face down on the concrete or  up against a wall, and then loaded aboard the buses.  </P> <P> A few hostage takers spoke to reporters from the windows of the buses that took  them away, with one crying out, "We succeeded in our goal of exposing the  corruption of this island." Several insisted that the government had promised  to abide by an agreement to grant them full pardons, let them return to their  homes at a Black Muslim enclave north of the capital and call elections in the  near future to form a new government.  </P> <P> Three hours later, as darkness settled over the no-man's land around Red House,  the Parliament building where 17 top government officials had been held, the  hostages there filed out singly, applauding with relief.  </P> <P> Several, including Minister of National Security Selwyn Richardson, limped out  of the Parliament building to a waiting panel truck. Richardson and Robinson  had suffered gunshot wounds to the leg during the violent takeover last Friday.  </P> <P> Although most hostages and all but three hostage takers appeared unhurt, there  was no official word on their medical condition. The hostages were taken to the  army's Camp Ogden for physical and psychological examinations.  </P> <P> Asked what development had led to the breakthrough Wednesday that ended the  crisis, government spokesman Shaw replied, "I have no idea."  </P> <P> Shaw said, "As far as the government is concerned, (the surrender) is  unconditional. The hostage situation is over."  </P> <P> As to what would now happen to the rebels, he said, "I know nothing about what  their prospects or their future will be like." But he added that "they could be  charged with treason and murder."  </P> <P> Shaw insisted that the government had "made no agreement" with the rebels.  During the past three days, there had been authoritative reports that an  agreement detailing a staged release, as was finally achieved, had been at the  heart of hostage negotiations and tentatively accepted by both sides.  </P> <P> A number of Trinidadians interviewed during the hostage release expressed shock  when they heard rebel claims that they had been promised amnesty.  </P> <P> "Any agreement made under that kind of duress will not stand up legally and  must not be honored," said Bonny Patrick, a Port of Spain businessman.  </P> <P> The hostage crisis began at 6:10 p.m. last Friday when the rebels drove an  explosives-laden car into the enclosure of the country's central police  station. The station was demolished and the policemen died when the car bomb  exploded.  </P> <P> Almost simultaneously, two groups of rebels assaulted the Parliament and  television buildings, trapping the government officials, including the prime  minister, employees of TTT and others. A handful of the captives in Red House  were allowed to go free during the early hours of the siege.  </P> <P> Negotiations with the hostage takers began early Saturday and were carried out  mostly through the mediation of an Anglican clergyman, Rev. Knolly Clarke.  </P></p>

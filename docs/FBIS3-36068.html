A document circulated by Yugoslav representatives in Vienna  says the Yugoslav Army does not plan to deploy additional types  of heavy armaments or combat systems on Yugoslav territory in  1994, said the Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesman.    "Information on location of forces and their armaments  against the background of the on-going combat operations in  Bosnia and Herzegovina testifies to the Yugoslav interest in  military security and stability in the region," said Karasin.</p>

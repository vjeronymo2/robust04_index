			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television In the words of S. Sondheim, comedy tonight. On BBC1 Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders resume the partnership they interrupted for solo careers. Saunders has emerged as the more talented of the two, or perhaps the shrewder judge of her own talents: Absolutely Fabulous has been epoch-making, while French's forays into comedy and drama have shown her to be less versatile and a less good judge of scripts. Never mind; they are together again at 9.30, and the BBC's recent return to Dickensian costume does not go unnoticed. For some time Rory Bremner has been providing genuine satire, abetted by the intelligent and incisive double act of Johns Fortune and Bird in the isolated fastness of Channel 4. There is usually more pointed comment in five minutes of his shows than the flailing spite of Spitting Image and complacent juvenilia of Have I Got News for You put together. A BAFTA award this year was well deserved. Rory Bremner's Christmas Turkey at 10pm should provide plenty of stuffing and lots of sauce.</p>

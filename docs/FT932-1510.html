			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Silentnight founder fails to cut dividend MR TOM Clarke, founder and former chairman of Silentnight Holdings, the beds group, yesterday unsuccessfully tried to persuade shareholders to cut the company's dividend from 5.75p to 5.25p at the annual meeting. He argued that not enough profit was being retained for development. Mr Clarke also opposed the board over its search for three non-executive directors to help comply with Cadbury recommendations on corporate governance. He claimed this would push directors' annual salaries and fees over Pounds 1m, compared with about Pounds 600,000 at present. Both criticisms were heavily supported by a show of hands among more than 100 mainly small, private shareholders. However, both failed on card votes because trustees acting for 51 per cent of the shares - all owned by Mr Clarke and his family - supported the board, arguing management should be either backed or sacked. Mr Clarke said inflation had been 24 per cent over the last four years, while Silentnight's turnover had risen only 21 per cent in the same period. Pre-tax profits had risen 8 per cent and profits attributable to shareholders 13 per cent. Dividends, however, had risen by 16 per cent and retained earnings by only 11 per cent. Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman, said a good second half of last year had made up for a poor first half. Dividends were being maintained at last year's total of 8p. He said Silentnight had been ahead of 1992 in every month since Christmas. Directors' earnings were lower in Mr Clarke's time because the business and the board were smaller. With Pounds 14m cash in the bank, he was not worried about having enough in reserve.</p>

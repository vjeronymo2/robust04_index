			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A report by ITIM correspondent  Dani Zaqen on page 1 of Tel Aviv HATZOFE in Hebrew on 2 January  adds: "Political sources in Jerusalem and the PLO leadership  have officially confirmed an ITIM report from last week  according to which the security forces completely ceased hunting  Fatah terrorists in the territories, including those who  committed murders of Israelis and Palestinians." The report goes  on to say that "senior military elements" have expressed  opposition to this move, saying that "it delivers a death blow  to the IDF deterrence power." HATZOFE adds that "this  opposition has been relayed to the IDF command and through it to  the prime minister, and it has been learned that Rabin is  currently considering rejecting or postponing the move."</p>

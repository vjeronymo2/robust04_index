			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / UN brings the vote to Cambodia's outback: The logistics involved in getting the country's electorate to the polls BRINGING democracy to the Cambodian outback is no easy task for the United Nations. To reach villages like Phum Talat in the remote north-east, you need a Russian Mi-17 helicopter powerful enough to carry a mobile polling station and lift itself out of the glutinously muddy rice-fields used as landing pads. You need the three Uruguayan soldiers, armed with guns, grenades and dark glasses, to defend the UN election team in case of attack by Khmer Rouge guerrillas; the young Australian radio operator; the Ghanaian policeman wearing little black gumboots and a US army helmet two sizes too big, who shepherds voters to cardboard voting booths under a mango tree; the Russian flight crew; and the Cambodian election officers. You need men like Giuseppe Andreoli of the Italian carabinieri, who jokes with barefoot women voters while he checks for weapons with a metal detector, and Lt-Col Surjit Singh, the magnificently moustachioed international polling station officer, recently retired from the Indian army. In 15 minutes the polling station is established. Voters, summoned by shouts across the fields, arrive on foot or by dugout canoe. The headman of Talat (population: 193) tells people to vote, and they vote; soon the tables and chairs are packed to be helicoptered to the next village. As if confronted by 19th century Christian missionaries, the villagers are baffled but delighted by the novelty of this week's UN-organised elections. Some of the communities in this part of Stung Treng province are too small and too remote even to merit the attentions of government intimidators who have murdered and threatened opposition politicians across Cambodia. There are no party agents to monitor the election, and none has been to the village to campaign. Many people are unaware of the existence of the government, let alone the opposition parties. They have never voted before and most are mystified by the ballot papers on which they are supposed to leave a pencil mark. The last visit by a government official was about two years back, but Khmer Rouge soldiers came through only three days ago to borrow a boat to cross the river. The village has no school and no doctor. Illiteracy and malaria are so common that UN volunteers question the value of their efforts to preach the gospel of western democracy to Cambodian peasants. 'It's not very logical in a way to talk about democracy to people who are dying of malaria,' says Linda Trudel, a Canadian district electoral supervisor. 'We ask them if they have any questions and they say, 'yes, do you have any medicine for malaria?'' In these remote and peaceful villages in the jungle, where pot-bellied pigs grunt contentedly in their mud-wallows and girls aged six smoke home-made cigarettes, the impact of the UN could be short-lived. Sixty-seven people voted in Rompot, the last village on Lt-Col Singh's circuit, although there are only 60 registered voters. 'It's a small village,' he says. 'People have got nothing else to do.' Rompot's inhabitants are left with the tables and chairs, and what is probably the first pollution they have ever known: plastic wrappers from US military MREs ('Meals Ready to Eat') provided as rations to the election workers. Talat and Rompot are also left with the memory of a big white helicopter. People cluster round to touch the beast which terrified their water buffalo and peer inside before it disappears again for ever. 'I want,' says one man, 'to buy it.'</p>

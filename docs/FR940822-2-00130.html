			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Submission Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An original and three copies of all concept papers submitted for consideration in Fiscal Year 1995 must be sent by first class or overnight mail or by courier no later than November 23, 1994, except for concept papers proposing projects that follow-up on the National Conference on the Managment of Mass Tort Cases which must be sent by March 10, 1995 (see section II.B.2.l.), and concept papers proposing to implement an action plan developed during the National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts which must be sent by October 6, 1995 (see section II.B.2.i.). A postmark or courier receipt will constitute evidence of the submission date. All envelopes containing concept papers should be marked CONCEPT PAPER and should be sent to: State Justice Institute, 1650 King Street, Suite 600, Alexandria, Virginia 22314.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is preferable for letters of cooperation and support to be appended to the concept paper when it is submitted. If support letters are sent under separate cover, they must be received no later than January 13, 1995 in order to ensure that there is sufficient time to bring them to the Board's attention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Institute will send written notice to all persons submitting concept papers of the Board's decisions regarding their papers and of the key issues and questions that arose during the review process. A decision by the Board not to invite an application may not be appealed, but does not prohibit resubmission of the concept paper or a revision thereof in a subsequent round of funding. The Institute will also notify the designated State contact listed in the Appendix when the Board invites applications that are based on concept papers which are submitted by courts within their State or which specify a participating site within their State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Receipt of each concept paper will be acknowledged in writing. Extensions of the deadline for submission of concept papers will not be granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Application Requirements for New Projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as specified in section VI., a formal application for a new project is to be submitted only upon invitation of the Board following review of a concept paper. An application for Institute funding support must include an application form; budget forms (with appropriate documentation); a project abstract and program narrative; a disclosure of lobbying form, when applicable; and certain certifications and assurances. These documents are described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

Application Form (Form A)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The application form requests basic information regarding the proposed project, the applicant, and the total amount of funding support requested from the Institute. It also requires the signature of an individual authorized to certify on behalf of the applicant that the information contained in the application is true and complete, that submission of the application has been authorized by the applicant, and that if funding for the proposed project is approved, the applicant will comply with the requirements and conditions of the award, including the assurances set forth in Form D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

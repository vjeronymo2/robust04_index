			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Budget approved in Hungary HUNGARY'S conservative coalition government yesterday survived crucial budget votes in parliament, boosting its hopes of reaching a new funding agreement with the International Monetary Fund The government's unpopular plan to increase value-added tax on foodstuffs and other staples from 6 to 10 per cent was approved by a majority of 13. The comfortable margin of victory for the government was ensured by the absence of some opposition MPs from the Free Democrats and Young Democrats, two liberal parties which have no desire to fight an early general election. The governing Hungarian Democratic Forum of Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, has a majority of just one following the recent defection of right-wingers to the newly-formed Hungarian Justice party. Approval of the supplementary budget - which followed yesterday in a later vote by parliament - staves off the prospect of an early election as Mr Antall, leader of the longest-running government in post-Communist central Europe, had warned he would be unwilling to lead a minority administration. An election is due to be held next May. Officials believe, however, that the Democratic Forum's coalition allies are likely to grow more rebellious, and a further challenge may come this autumn when the restrictive 1994 budget comes before parliament. The change to VAT is part of a mini-budget aimed at holding Hungary's budget deficit to Ft215bn (Pounds 1.5bn) this year. That would keep the public sector deficit down to 6.8 per cent of gross domestic product and put it on track for a further reduction to 5.6 per cent in 1994. Yesterday's approval by parliament comes at the same time as a reported compromise in talks between the International Monetary Fund and the trade unions over social security funding. Resolution of the two issues sets the scene for Hungary to conclude a new 18-month accord with the IMF which would provide access to Dollars 700m in loans. The Fund suspended credits when Hungary's budget deficit careered through agreed parameters in mid-1992. An IMF seal of approval now would in turn clear the way for a World Bank package of credits to restructure Hungary's most indebted companies and support the recapitalisation of the country's largest commercial banks whose balance sheets are littered with non-performing loans granted to loss-making state-owned enterprises.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Daimler revs up Daimler-Benz has huge potential. This is not because the German behemoth has performed well in recent years but precisely because it has not. It has suffered from high engineering costs, over-staffing and a confusing mix of businesses. This means there is massive scope to turn its operations around. The good news from Daimler's first-half figures is that the first fruits of restructuring are reaching the bottom line. There is more to come. It is not simply a matter of shedding jobs and shifting production to lower-cost locations. Daimler also needs to focus on those businesses where it can achieve global scale. Mercedes already fits the bill. Most of its AEG division, with the exception of rail systems, probably never can. Dasa, the aerospace arm, is somewhere in between. For it to be a successful global competitor, rationalisation of the European defence and aerospace industries is necessary. In a few years, Daimler could turn itself into a streamlined motor, aircraft and train manufacturer - after which one could re-examine whether it makes sense for the three divisions to be yoked together. The big risk for investors is that management could become complacent. With demand picking up, the company may think the pressure to perform is off. Yesterday's comments by the outgoing chairman, Mr Edzard Reuter, that this year's profits would be 'thoroughly satisfactory' could cause some concern. The net profit margins of 1 per cent forecast by analysts are measly. Mr Jurgen Schrempp, the next chairman, should be aiming much higher.</p>

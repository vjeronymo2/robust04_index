			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: Strong yen buffets Honda profit Honda, buffetted by the sharp appreciation of the yen and weak markets in Japan and Europe last year, recorded a sharp deterioration in results for the year to March 1994. The Japanese automotive group saw consolidated sales decline 6.5 per cent to Y3,863bn (Dollars 32.3bn) from Y4,132bn, while pre-tax profits plunged 47 per cent to Y46.89bn from Y88.56bn. Net income was 36 per cent lower at Y23.69bn, against Y37.16bn, although this figure was helped by a better performance from Rover, the UK-based car company in which Honda owns a 20 per cent stake. Honda said, however, it expected a strong improvement this year with the launch of new models, including a recreational vehicle it is developing and sport utility vehicles it is marketing on an original equipment manufacturing basis. Consolidated sales are forecast to rise 3.6 per cent this year, to about Y4,000bn. The car company also expects net income to surge 119 per cent to about Y52bn, largely as a result of off-loading its equity holding in Rover this year, and expected strong sales in the US. Honda and Rover have agreed to unwind their cross-shareholding. This will have a significant impact on Honda's net income as the Japanese company has had to reflect a 20 per cent share of Rover's results in its accounts at the net level. Total sales fell 7 per cent in Japan, 4 per cent in North America and 21 per cent in Europe. The results for North America and Europe were influenced significantly by the higher yen, which Honda said had caused a fall in operating profits of Y147bn. The yen's appreciation easily wiped out cost-cutting efforts and gains generated from lower research and development expenses. To minimise the impact of currency fluctuations, Honda is moving a greater proportion of its manufacturing overseas. It is targeting sales of 1.87m units for cars globally, compared with 1.75m units in fiscal 1993. At home, Honda expects model launches to help boost unit sales by 9.5 per cent, rising to 620,000 units from 566,000 last year. Other sales targets for cars this year are 860,000 units in North America, compared with 828,000; 160,000 against 156,000 in Europe; and 230,000 elsewhere, compared with 203,000. For the parent company, sales totalled Y2,505bn, down 7 per cent from Y2,695bn, while pre-tax profits fell 55 per cent to Y22.7bn from Y50.2bn. Net income declined 52 per cent to Y14.3bn, from Y30.1bn.</p>

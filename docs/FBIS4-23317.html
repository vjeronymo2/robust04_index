			<p>BFN     [Text] The international community, notably the United  States, Canada, UNICEF, the Red Cross, and the Republic of South  Africa [RSA] continues to show concern about the Rwandan drama.    The United States has just offered 50 vehicles, which will  help in the evacuation operations of civilians still in the  areas of fighting in Kigali, and U.S. President Bill Clinton  once again discussed the Rwandan case during his discussions  with Italian political leaders when he was visiting Rome  recently. Canada is reportedly ready to provide 300  telecommunications experts, and the Canadian defense minister is  reported to have left for Rwanda to study the situation on the  spot in order to better understand what there is to be done.    UNICEF has started sensitizing the international community  to  raise $5 million for the Rwandan victims. As for the RSA, it  intends to collaborate with the United Nations in the framework  of humanitarian assistance to the Rwandan population. The RSA  recently stated it was not ready to dispatch an armed force to  Rwanda.    While other peace-loving countries are coming to help  Rwanda,  it is deplorable that the Egyptian Government continues to help  the Rwandan Government clique, which has plunged our country  into a bloodbath. This Egyptian Government recently offered  $750,000 for arms purchases to the Rwandan executioners.</p>

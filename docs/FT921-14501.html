			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Hilton Hotels earnings decline 25% to Dollars 84.3m THE SLUMP in the US hotel and leisure industries was underlined yesterday when Hilton Hotels, one of the leading lodging and gaming groups, reported a 25 per cent reduction in 1991 profits to Dollars 84.3m after tax. In the final quarter, Hilton made Dollars 29.6m after tax, compared with Dollars 27.3m in the same period of 1990. However, the apparent improvement was due to the absence of a Dollars 10m property provision. At the operating level, profits fell by 18 per cent to Dollars 56.3m. Hilton said that recession and the over-supply of hotel space had 'severely impacted' operations for the year. Occupancy levels were down from 68 per cent in 1990 to 64 per cent last year, while average room rates remained unchanged. During the 12-month period, gaming profits fell by 12 per cent to Dollars 115m, and hotel profits by a sharper 23 per cent, to Dollars 92.9m. Revenues overall were Dollars 1.11bn (Dollars 1.12bn). However, in the fourth quarter it was the gaming side which saw the sharpest setback. Operating income from hotels improved, from Dollars 27.3m to Dollars 31.7m, while the Nevada-based gaming operations turned in only Dollars 26.4m, compared with a record Dollars 48.4m in the last quarter of 1990.</p>

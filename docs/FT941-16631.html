			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Slump in bonus payouts shows signs of easing - The outlook for with-profits endowments Anyone hoping to pay off a mortgage with an endowment policy in 1994 will be watching closely the life insurance companies' announcements of this year's bonus rates. Bonuses on with-profits endowments have been cut quite savagely in the past few years as insurance companies realised they could no longer afford to tap into their reserves to pay for past miscalculations. This year, the cuts are more modest and there are actually some increases. The picture emerging from the handful of companies which announced their bonus rates this week (more are due within the next few weeks) is that anyone with a 10-year endowment maturing this year is looking at a lower payout than in previous years, while some holders of 25-year policies will face only marginal cuts or possible slight increases. Actual bonus rates have been held to the same level as last year in some cases, but the final payouts are lower because policies maturing this year have accumulated fewer of the high bonuses of the 1980s. The final payout on a with-profits endowment policy is made up of the sum assured and all bonuses. Reversionary bonuses, added annually, cannot be taken away once they have been given. Sometimes, reversionary bonuses are calculated in two parts: an ordinary bonus, which is a percentage of the sum assured; and a bonus on previous bonuses, so that growth is compounded. These build up over the life of a policy. Finally, a terminal bonus is added to the policy when it matures, to pass on a share of any investment returns not already allocated with annual bonuses. Terminal bonuses can be more than 100 per cent of the sum assured. With-profits endowment policies are, however, designed to smooth out investment returns over time. In a year when shares do well (most life funds are invested mainly in equities, along with some property and fixed interest securities), bonuses will usually be less than the stock market growth rate so that, in years when stocks do not do so well, a similar bonus can still be paid. Actuaries have to guess what average investment returns will be over the life of the policy. If they get it wrong, and pay far too much for several years when actual returns are low, they will eventually have to compensate by paying too little when investment returns are better. This is what has been happening recently. In 1990, bonuses were raised when they should have been cut. Bonus cuts and slightly better investment returns in subsequent years may not yet have quite compensated for the dent that made in reserves. Cuts have slowed this year but the picture is not entirely rosy: most insurance companies say bonuses are likely to fall further in future, as high rates can no longer be justified in times of low inflation and expected lower investment returns. Larger cuts were prevented this year only because of spectacular stock market performance towards the end of 1993. Bonuses on unitised with-profit endowments have also been cut by most companies this year, but they depend less on the discretion of the actuaries and more on the actual performance of the investment fund. Some insurers have to be particularly cautious with 10-year payouts this year because there are larger than usual volumes of 10-year policies maturing. Life assurance premium relief was abolished in 1984 and many people rushed to buy policies before the deadline. Miscalculations this year could cost insurers more than normal. Although returns from endowments are falling, insurance companies are keen to stress that, for a relatively low-risk investment, they still provide a respectable return above inflation, which has also been falling. For example, a Norwich Union with-profits endowment taken out 25 years ago by a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 a month would now be worth Pounds 58,694, representing an annual yield of 12.9 per cent. A 10-year policy on the same basis is now worth Pounds 6,674, a yield of 11.9 per cent. In comparison, Pounds 30 a month paid into a unit trust savings plan for the median UK equity income fund, starting 10 years ago, would now be worth Pounds 7,048, and Pounds 101,228 after 25 years (according to the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, and Micropal). If the money had been invested via a personal equity plan, those figures would be Pounds 7,724 and Pounds 146,993. Of course, unit trusts do not provide any life insurance cover but many endowments, particularly 10-year policies, are taken out purely as investments with the life insurance element being a side issue. Worries in recent times that some low-cost endowments would fail to pay off the mortgages they were intended to cover appear to have faded somewhat for policies maturing in this and the next few years. But if investment returns are low throughout the 1990s, that might present a potential problem to holders of policies from the late 1980s.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              WITH-PROFIT ENDOWMENT POLICY 1994 MATURITY VALUES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Insurer                10 year    change          25 year      change                                   on year                      on year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- AXA Equity &amp; Law*   Pounds 6,734   -7.3%       Pounds 61,130   -2.8% Clerical Medical    Pounds 6,537     -6%       Pounds 60,820     -1% Friends Provident   Pounds 6,709   -2.5%       Pounds 61,636   +0.2% General Accident    Pounds 6,567   -0.4%       Pounds 65,604   +0.2% Norwich Union       Pounds 6,674   -4.5%       Pounds 58,694   +0.8% Royal London        Pounds 7,198   -1.7%****   Pounds 62,014   -2.8%**** Scottish Life       Pounds 6,105     -2%       Pounds 63,252     +2%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Policies maturing on January 1, 1994, taken out by man aged 29, paying Pounds 30 a month.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * As at December 1993.

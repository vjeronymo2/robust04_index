			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Trust launched to seek undervalued assets Scottish Value Management is launching an investment trust which aims to seek out undervalued UK commercial and industrial companies. The Undervalued Assets Trust is expected to raise Pounds 40m-Pounds 50m through a placing and offer for subscription. Companies will be selected through value management techniques, analysing accounting data to find shares which stand at a significant discount to their real worth. 'The UK market is not an efficient one. Exaggerated market sentiment can colour perceptions of a company, clouding judgment on shares where there is value to be found,' said Mr Colin McClean, managing director of Scottish Value Management, who set up the company in 1990 after managing funds for Scottish Provident, FS Assurance and Templeton. The company already manages two listed investment trusts, both of which invest in other investment trusts. It also has an insurance fund, SVM Superior Growth, with an investment remit similar to the new trust. Launched in October 1991, it was among the top ten performing funds (out of more than 600) last year. Undervalued Assets Trust is issuing only ordinary shares, breaking the current investment trust trend for all trusts, except those with a split capital structure, to attach warrants to their ordinary shares. The placing is due to close on March 31, and the public offer will run from April 6 to April 20.</p>

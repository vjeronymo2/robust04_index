			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Microsoft will face new US anti-trust probe THE US Justice Department has launched an anti-trust investigation of Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, an official of the government agency announced last night. The department is taking on the case following a three-year probe by the US Federal Trade Commission, which was deadlocked twice over whether to take action against Microsoft. Four commissioners voted, two for and two against filing suit against the company. Last month, after the second FTC deadlock, the Justice Department requested a transfer of documents obtained by the FTC during its investigation. The department's decision to proceed with the case is a serious blow to Microsoft, which had dismissed the FTC's investigation as having 'raised nothing of concern'. The department's involvement moves the case into the political arena and could test the Clinton administration's tougher stance on anti-trust enforcement. If the department finds evidence of anti-competitive activity, it will have to decide whether the public interest is served by taking action against one of the most successful high technology companies in the US. Microsoft confirmed yesterday that it had been told the department was taking up the case and said it would co-operate fully with the new investigation. The Justice Department said it would 'fully utilise all materials submitted by the FTC to avoid duplication', and expected to move forward rapidly with the case. Competitors have accused Microsoft of using its dominant role in the market for personal computer operating systems software to limit competition through unfair marketing tactics. Last month, Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, accused Novell, a Microsoft competitor, of stirring up trouble in Washington in an attempt to force Microsoft to raise its prices for personal computer software. Novell, however, alleges that Microsoft aims to limit competition by offering computer makers discounts if they agree to pay Microsoft software licence fees for all of the computers of a particular model that they sell. The company's 'per processor' licensing scheme has already been outlawed in Korea and is being scrutinised by authorities in other countries. Microsoft has denied any wrongdoing. The company recently posted earnings of Dollars 265m (Pounds 178m) on sales of Dollars 1.04bn for its fourth quarter ended June 30. It reported earnings of Dollars 953m for fiscal 1993, a 35 per cent rise over the previous 12-month period.</p>

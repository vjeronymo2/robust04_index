			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JESSE JACKSON'S ROLE IN RELEASE OF HOSTAGES  </P> <P> I feel it is time for the U.S. government to impose some restrictions on  private citizens such as Jackson from pursuing their own personal foreign  policy. Jackson doesn't seem to realize that if a player continues to carry the  ball by himself to exploit his own ambitions, it eventually reduces the  effectiveness of the team as a whole and causes a strong resentment among other  players.  </P> <P> JOHN ERICKSON  </P> <P> Ontario  </P></p>

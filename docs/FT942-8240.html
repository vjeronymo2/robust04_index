			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Admiral Crowe adds a hat to his collection: George Graham reports on the diplomatic priorities facing the new US ambassador in London When he retired from the US navy in 1989, Admiral William Crowe presented his collection of about 1,000 hats to a museum in his native Oklahoma. 'What I overlooked was that people assumed I continued to collect hats, so they continued to send them to me,' he said. On Tuesday he will add another hat to his collection when he arrives in London as the US ambassador to the UK, just two weeks before President Bill Clinton arrives to take part in D-day commemorations. For Admiral Crowe, who was a midshipman at the Annapolis Naval Academy at the time of the Normandy landings, the occasion offers an auspicious start to a posting that may no longer be the plum it once was. In an interview with British reporters in Washington, shortly after taking his oath of office, Admiral Crowe was careful to play down the seriousness of the policy differences between the US and the UK, most notably on Northern Ireland and Bosnia. 'I have characterised our relationship as like a vast iceberg, and the things we disagree on are the tip of the iceberg,' he said. Admiral Crowe avoided detailed questions on Northern Ireland, but said one of his priorities was to visit the region as soon as possible. More importantly, however, Admiral Crowe, who served as chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff under President Ronald Reagan, argues that differences of opinion are inevitable in the uncertain world following the Soviet Union's collapse. 'We lost the benchmarks of the cold war and the way forward is somewhat murky, and not only for London and Washington,' Admiral Crowe said. 'In many senses the whole international community is groping.' Admiral Crowe acknowledges that Mr Clinton's foreign policy doctrine may be 'a little more vague than some of his critics would want' but insists that a doctrine exists. 'The people who shape foreign policy are not given enough credit. The international community is in disarray right now,' he said. As a US ambassador, Admiral Crowe says his first priority will be to dispel uncertainty over where his country stands. 'There's often an understanding among laymen that the purpose of diplomacy is to be nice. I'm not sure that is the proper view. The purpose of diplomacy is to make sure that the views of your country are properly represented and conveyed,' he said. Admiral Crowe, who wrote his Princeton doctoral thesis on 'The policy roots of the modern Royal Navy, 1946-63,' is no stranger to the UK, although his new residence in Regent's Park will be more lavish than his previous flat in Kensington Church Street. These larger quarters will soon be filled, however, with about 100 selected items of headgear, ranging from western Stetsons and deerstalkers to guardsmen's bearskins and Royal Navy antiques.</p>

Provisional figures for the week ending November 28 show 174  people suffering from "flu-like illness" for every 100,000  members of the population -- a fall from 200 in the first week  of November. Cases of influenza proper are put at 36 per  100,000, compared with 39 in the previous week.    The epidemic started in Scotland and during October worked  its way south. The figures for the second half of November show  a similar pattern for its decline. Rates of flu-like illness  have dropped in the north, from 229 per 100,000 in early  November to 158 last week. They have reached a plateau in  central and southern regions, at 200-245 per 100,000, and are  now expected to fall.    Researchers do not know what is causing the decline. Dr.  John  Watson, of the Public Health Laboratory Service, said the  severity and tenacity of a flu virus was impossible to predict.  "It is determined by the extent to which a population has  recently come across a similar virus and retained some  immunity," he said, adding that a resurgence of the epidemic  this year is possible but not likely.    In the week ending November 19, 42 deaths from influenza and  influenzal pneumonia were recorded at the Office of Population  Censuses and Surveys, a rise from 28 the previous week and just  two per week in early October. The number of deaths attributed  to flu in any winter ranges from 1,000 to the estimated 25,000  of 1989. In a typical year it is between 3,000 and 4,000.</p>

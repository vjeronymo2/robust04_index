			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 26 SEA LION BODIES FOUND ALONG BEACH  </P> <P> The bodies of 26 sea lions and one seal, most of them decomposed, washed ashore  over the weekend, police said.  </P> <P> Dr. Aleta Hohn, a biologist with the La Jolla National Marine Fisheries  Service, which does research on the status of marine mammals, said the animals  were found on Navy and state property on Coronado beaches.  </P> <P> "Some of the animals looked like they had been shot, but, after a necropsy was  done on four of the animals, no bullet holes were found," Hohn said. "Birds  sometimes peck at the animals, and the peck holes look like bullet holes."  </P> <P> The federal organization had received reports Monday that some of the animals  had been shot, Hohn said, adding that most of the animals may have become  entangled in gill nets and died at sea before floating ashore.  </P> <P> Of the 80,000 sea lions off California, 4,000 are shot to death each year by  commercial fishermen.  </P></p>

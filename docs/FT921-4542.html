			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / TUC blames 'short-term' culture for industry's ills MANUFACTURERS will have to abandon the short-term culture that has characterised their post-war development if Britain is to build a new generation of world-class companies, according to a study by the Trades Union Congress. The study, which will form the centrepiece of a conference in London today, says British industry's preoccupation with short-term returns is one of the fundamental reasons why it has failed to compete with other countries that belong to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. According to a TUC 'checklist for action' the challenge for industry is 'not simply to develop companies which provide high dividends for their shareholders in the short-term; it is also to create an envir-onment in which firms are encouraged to pursue long-term approaches to investment and innovation, and therefore to contribute to the high-pay, high-productivity economy that trade unions seek'. The TUC says a consensus between employers and unions, led by the government, is necessary to restore Britain's manufacturing competitiveness. The government, it says, has the primary role in developing a strategic view of industrial priorities, identifying the key objectives for industry. The study concludes that the government should create the correct framework for company law and practice to encourage a longer-term corporate perspective. Takeover and merger policy should minimise short-term pressures while rules on share dealing and accounting should encourage a longer-term view of investment by capital markets. The TUC says companies must invest more in skills through company-based training and retraining. British businesses plan to raise spending on innovation this year, according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry and National Westminster Bank. The survey, conducted among more than 300 companies, shows that 43 per cent of companies expect to step up spending on innovation - including research and development of products and processes, market research and joint ventures with overseas companies. Only 15 per cent said they intended to cut innovation expenditure this year. Innovation Trends Survey. CBI, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU.

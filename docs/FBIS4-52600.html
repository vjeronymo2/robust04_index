			<p>BFN     [Text] Some Thai timber merchants have resorted to  smuggling and paying kickbacks to corrupt officials to bring  Cambodian logs in the form of processed wood across the border  in direct violation of UN trade sanctions against the Khmer  Rouge [KR].    The boom in timber smuggling has also financially benefited  several police, soldiers, customs and forestry officials who man  roadblocks from the Cambodian border to Bangkok.    Chat Phatthana Party MP Thanit Traiwut of Trat, in an  interview with the BANGKOK POST at the border here yesterday,  said Thai timber traders had invested heavily in the logging  business in Cambodia and they had managed to bring only a small  fraction of their timber out of Cambodia before the March 31  deadline expired.    "A large quantity of logs remain in Cambodia. So local  businessmen have to resort to smuggling to recoup their  investment otherwise the logs will be left to rot," said the MP,  who said he quit the timber business only three months ago.    Tens of thousands of felled logs have been left in Khmer  Rouge- controlled territory in the Samraong area in Battambang  alone, according to Lok Nong, a Khmer Rouge cadre in Samrod.    One of the main problems discouraging Thai timber merchants  from engaging in straight and legal dealings with Phnom Penh is  the issuance of a new regulation requiring a Certificate of  Origin to export Cambodian timber.    Mr Thanit explained that to obtain the CO is a complicated  process and also involves under-the-table money payments. A  normal fee of US$35 is charged for a cubic metre of timber to be  exported, but merchants sometimes have to pay up to US$60 if all  the expenses to obtain a CO are added up.    "With the CO, the Thai merchant must notify the Thai customs  which will then pass on the document to the Finance Ministry,  the Foreign Ministry the Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh, the  Cambodian Foreign Ministry and finally to the Forestry  Department of Cambodia which has to verify the CO," said Mr  Thanit.    "The whole process may take up to three months and, by that  time, the CO's term has almost expired and a new CO would have  to be obtained."    But even with the CO being verified the merchants will still  have to pay taxes to the Khmer Rouge guerrillas because the logs  are in guerrilla-controlled territories, said another timber  merchant.    "That means merchants will pay twice for each lot of timber  to the Phnom Penh government and to the Khmer Rouge," he said.    But the money and trouble saved by not obtaining the CO from  Phnom Penh the merchants have to hand out in bribes to a host of  Thai officials, namely the police, troops, customs and forestry  officials, who man the various roadblocks along the roads  leading from the Cambodian border to the sawmills in Thailand.  The longer the trip for each truckload of timber, the higher  the payment in bribes.    "Sometimes, a temporary roadblock just pops up with the  officials demanding money for convenient passage in addition to  the permanent checkpoints," said the merchant who declined to be  named.    The timber merchant claimed he had to pay at least 50,000  baht to all the checkpoints for each truckload of processed wood.    "We have to make arrangements with all the officials  involved  otherwise there will be problems," he said, adding that if this  is not done in advance, the timber will run the risk of being  impounded as contraband.    And in that case, he said, some merchants had to pay as much  as 300,000 baht "ransom" under the table to get back the truck  as well as the cargo.    Despite the small amount of royalties levied by Phnom Penh  for the timber export, most timber merchants said they still  prefer smuggling because they have to move the logs across the  border as fast as possible otherwise they will rot.    According to Mr Thanit, no less than 100 timber-laden trucks  have been seized by officials for overloading and smuggling.    The Chat Phatthana MP said he had received complaints from  many merchants about the alleged extortion.    But despite the "extortion" from the authorities, several  merchants have sought -- and made--deals with the Khmer Rouge.    "We care very much about the honesty and safety of the Thai  merchants who invested their money in our territories,' Lok Nong  told the Bangkok Post.    He said he felt more comfortable dealing with Thai merchants  than with European, Singaporean or Japanese traders.    Lok Nong claimed that only 20 per cent of forests in  Cambodia  were cut. He said the committee had set some rules about  logging and only mature trees are to be felled.    He admitted that logging and gem mining were still the two  major sources of income for the Khmer Rouge. He complained that  after the UN-monitored general elections in Cambodia supplies to  the guerrillas had been cut off.    He gave his personal assurance to Thai loggers that felled  trees in guerrilla-controlled territory would not be lost.</p>

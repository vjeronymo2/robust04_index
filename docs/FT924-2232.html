			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Maastricht journey resumes: The Edinburgh summit's successful conclusion has put the Community back on track The Edinburgh summit will go down as the moment when the European Community pulled itself together and put its house in order. After months of drift and indecision, EC leaders struck a series of deals which offer a reasonable prospect of saving the Maastricht treaty, thus ending the political crisis which has gripped the Community since Denmark rejected the treaty in a referendum last June. Even more important, the weekend agreement between the Twelve on the EC budget and on enlargement talks with Austria, Finland, Sweden and, later, Norway, provides a second, perhaps more secure framework for the Community's development to 2000. 'We have solved the Rubik's cube that was laid before us,' declared Mr John Major, UK prime minister, shortly before midnight on Saturday in the packed media centre at Meadowbank sports centre. Other EC officials agreed that the much-derided UK presidency had indeed pulled off a high-stakes gamble. 'By making everything interdependent,' said a Brussels official, 'the British turned Edinburgh into an all-or-nothing summit.' In the post-summit afterglow, it was easy to overlook that success had come at a price. The legally-binding exemptions from Maastricht obtained by Denmark go to the heart of the EC's ambitions as agreed in the treaty, notably the goal of a single European currency by 2000 and a common EC defence policy. Nor did the summiteers tackle in a serious fashion the broader crisis in the EC. A continental recession is spreading into Germany. The European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) continues to be plagued by instability. Beyond its borders, the EC faces the threat of the Yugoslav crisis turning into a wider Balkan war. A sobering reminder of this came on the eve of the summit when 1m Greeks took to the streets in Athens to protest against possible EC recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. The Macedonia issue underlines the limits of the EC's powers, especially in dealing with a recalcitrant member, in this case Greece. Faced with the Greek government's opposition to possible Community recognition of Macedonia, EC leaders pledged a 'substantial' package of aid to the former Yugoslav republic and held out the promise of World Bank and International Monetary Fund assistance; but they ducked the fundamental issue. Yet with some justification, Mr Major can argue that, without a settlement of the EC's internal problems, there is little prospect of turning the Community's attention outward. The breadth of agreements reached at Edinburgh give the EC a genuine chance of a 'relaunch' next year when, in a comic twist of fate, the UK hands over the presidency of the EC to Denmark. The Danes represented the most pressing issue at Edinburgh: namely, how to resolve Danish demands for opt-outs on Maastricht, without re-opening the treaty or requiring re-ratification of a new treaty by member states. Without an agreement on the Danish issue, the summit was doomed to failure. Given the legal acrobatics involved in finding a solution, EC leaders strove to convince observers that they had made the Danes sweat. Yet the outcome left Denmark with all of its substantive demands intact. These included exemptions from the third phase of monetary union when the Twelve are supposed to move to fixed exchange rates by 1999 at the latest; a common EC defence policy; common EC citizenship; and co-operation on justice and immigration matters at a Community rather than inter-governmental level. The Danish deal was made even more palatable by some useful practical steps on making EC decision-making more open and the bureaucracy less intrusive. In future, votes in the Council of Ministers will be published and some policy debates will be open to the public. The European Commission has also agreed to exercise more restraint in proposing legislation. But a promised hit-list of EC directives for scrapping fell far short of British hopes. Foreign diplomats in Edinburgh said the Danish deal looked like the EC was turning into a Community a la carte, where members can pick and choose what they like. Yet there is a precedent: a year ago the UK rejected Maastricht's social policy chapter and reserved its right to take part in a common currency. Other observers took a more charitable view by comparing the Danish outcome with the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales. 'It's like Charles and Diana,' said a German EC-watcher, 'Denmark has chosen the path of separation but not divorce.' Whatever its legal niceties, the Danish package comes down to raw political expediency: how to ensure that the Danish people approve a second referendum on Maastricht, at the end of April or early May. Or as one UK official put it: 'The goal of the summit is to save Maastricht, irrespective of its contents.' Both Mr Poul Schlueter, the Danish prime minister, and Mr Major pointed out that without ratification of Maastricht by all Twelve there can be no treaty; indeed, Mr Major refused to be drawn on his own ratification timetable beyond a promise to complete 'hard on the heels' of the Danish vote. The Anglo-Danish shilly-shallying on Maastricht plainly infuriated most EC leaders. Over lunch on Friday, Belgium took the lead in warning Denmark and Britain that they could not stop the Ten pressing ahead 'with the substance of Maastricht'. Virtually all the other leaders joined in; but no one ventured to predict what will happen if the Danes say No once again next spring. There is considerably more certainty about the EC budget. The summit's seven-year budget deal is a big achievement because it removes the one issue always guaranteed to fray tempers and produce political stalemate: money. The Edinburgh package allows the Community to plan for the future with a degree of security, just as it did in February 1988 when, once again, German generosity broke the logjam. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president who before Edinburgh railed against the risk of creating an EC run on the cheap, appeared satisfied. 'I have got 85 per cent of what I wanted,' he said. The budget deal is a compromise between north and south - or between the rich and poor members of the EC. But by contrast with 1988, Chancellor Kohl on this occasion has become a reluctant paymaster. Burdened with the costs of unification, Mr Kohl insisted that the Twelve commit themselves to begin enlargement negotiations with Austria, Finland and Sweden early next year. The accession of the richer northern states by 1996 fits the German goal of spreading the budget load. For Spain, which led the fight for more development funds, the deal offers firm numbers on so-called structural and cohesion funds funnelled to the poorer members of the Community, including Greece, Ireland and Portugal. In real terms, Spain can claim that it has won a doubling of these funds by 2000. In effect, the increase in funds is the 'bribe' for southern members to pursue the budgetary discipline necessary to meet the strict criteria to qualify for European monetary union (Emu) Yet the question is whether the goal of Emu is still feasible. The summit's limited agenda was again underlined by the leaders' unwillingness to discuss the turbulence in the exchange rate mechanism, which has plagued the system since Denmark's No vote in June cast doubt on monetary union. Instead, EC finance ministers agreed to a modest serious of measures aimed at stimulating growth in the Community, mainly through co-ordinated measures aimed at boosting capital spending in west and east Europe. The European Investment Bank is to set up a temporary lending facility of Ecu5bn (Pounds 4.04bn) to finance roads and telecommunications projects with more flexible lending criteria. The summit also agreed to set up a new European Investment Fund with Ecu2bn of EIB capital to provide guarantees to small and medium-sized businesses. But UK claims that the combination would stimulate private finance for Ecu24bn worth of projects look far-fetched. Cynics might dismiss the growth package as a confidence trick. But confidence is just what the Community needs after the buffeting of recent months. This is why the enlargement talks with the Austrians and Scandinavians are viewed as so important by Mr Delors, Chancellor Kohl, Mr Major and President Francois Mitterrand. Besides persuading Denmark that it cannot afford to be left out of the EC, the enlargement talks are also aimed at recapturing the dynamism of the late-1980s when the EC embarked on its goal of a single intergrated market by the end of 1992 and a common European currency by 2000. Yet the lesson of the summit is that, while almost every member state believes enlargement is a good thing, they each have a slightly different impression of what it will mean for the EC as a whole. Late on Friday night, Chancellor Kohl spoke expansively of a Community stretching eastwards to include Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Federation, and the Baltic states - but not Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey or the Balkans. For Mr Kohl, enlargement should help the EC absorb the German giant at the centre of Europe while also giving the Community the resources to become an equal partner with the US and Japan. Britain, too, shares the desire for a wider EC. But the UK is far more wary of loose German talk of 'political union' and is deeply sceptical about the EC's chances of pulling off Emu. France - pulled along by Germany - now appears reconciled to the fact that the Community must first widen its membership before tackling the problem of 'deepening' EC institutions. The institutional problems raised by an enlarged Community will not go away. More members surely means more majority voting in the Council of Ministers; it may mean, too, a greater role for the European Parliament; it could even require a new EC constitution. The uneasy compromise reached at Maastricht - a mix of intergovernmental co-operation and tentative federalism - will have to be revisited, most likely at a conference to review the treaty in 1996. For the moment, Mr Major is savouring the satisfaction of a job well done. Criticism of the UK presidency was, in hindsight, overdone. Thanks to a combination of clever legal drafting, meticulous preparation on the budget, and a little help from Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand, Mr Major can rightly claim that the EC is back on track.</p>

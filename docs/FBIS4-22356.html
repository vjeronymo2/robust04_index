			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by GOLOS ARMENII correspondent Grizor Apoyan: "What </F> Has Geydar Aliyev in His Luggage?"]    [Text] Moscow--However important the results of the  negotiations between the leader of Azerbaijan and the leaders of  the great states, his contacts with neighboring Turkey are in  the broad historical and geopolitical aspects of particular  significance, nonetheless.    Attempting to disarticulate and analyze in the stream of  reports from Ankara, Baku, and other information centers, the  key phrases concerning G. Aliyev's visit to Turkey, one  succumbs, frankly speaking, to a certain confusion in connection  with how soon the present president of Azerbaijan, who came to  power as "Moscow's man" and who was perceived as such overseas  (we recall the sharply negative reaction of both Turkey and  Washington to Elchibey's ouster), has gone over to the other  side, so to speak.    "Turkey is the friendly, fraternal country closest to  Azerbaijan." "We are one people," this statesman, who in his  speeches on his assumption of office almost never mentioned  Turkey, increasingly emphasizing the age-old productive ties of  Azerbaijan and Russia and, in particular, his, Geydar Aliyev's,  outstanding role in the strengthening and development of these  relations, now declares.    In order, obviously, to compensate for the undesirable  impression that had arisen in connection with Azerbaijan's  membership of the CIS and to emphasize the insignificance and  "innocuousness" of this fact, G. Aliyev declared:  "Unfortunately, certain forces are in Turkey currently spreading  various inventions concerning Azerbaijan and its development  along the path of independence. I, as president of Azerbaijan,  assure you that no force can deprive our state of independence."    Even a certain arrogance and open disregard for the opinion  and interests of Russia are appearing in Mr. Aliyev's tone. Here  are some words from his interview with Turkish correspondent  Adnan Advan.    Correspondent: The Friendship [words illegible], and  Cooperation Treaty includes an article which points out that if  one party is the victim of aggression, the other will adopt  measures against the aggressor. What do you think, will this  evoke a negative response from Russia?    G. Aliyev: If we have, indeed, appended our signatures to  these documents, we must remain true to them.    The same approach has been demonstrated in purely economic  matters affecting Russia's vital interests in the Caucasus  region. "I have no doubt that an oil pipeline will pass through  Turkey," G. Aliyev says, as though specially teasing, knowing  full well that this question cannot leave Moscow indifferent.    The impression that Geydar Aliyev has in his old age  embarked  upon a dangerous playing with fire is strengthened particularly  when you read his off-hand statement: "Let them recognize that  the Caucasus was previously part of a great empire." Although  this appeal applies to an equal extent to both Turkey and  Russia, it would seem, it is easy to understand which empire he  is talking about.    In Mr. Aliyev's opinion, the time has now come when we need  to recall the bygone words of Kemal Ataturk: "The Soviet Union  is today our friend, neighbor, and ally. We need this  friendship. But no one can now foresee what will happen  tomorrow. We could find ourselves broken up like the Ottomans,  broken up like Austro-Hungary. Nations that are now held  together by a strong hand could tomorrow be scattered. The world  balance could change. And Turkey should know what to do in this  case. This friend of ours is ruling our brothers, to whom we are  bound by a common language and religion and with whom we are one  in essence. We must be prepared to take them under our  protection. Not silently wait for this day but be prepared for  it." Comment would be superfluous, as they say.    On the other hand, G. Aliyev gave the assurance in the  course  of his visit to Turkey that the war (in Karabakh) could not go  on for long. But unless this was the most artless propaganda  move aimed at attracting potential Turkish investors in the  economy of Azerbaijan, what kind of resolution of the Karabakh  conflict, we would like to know, has he in mind here. After all,  by the time of his visit it had become perfectly obvious that,  despite the country's drastic militarization, he has not  succeeded in achieving the promised military victory at the  fronts--even limited, even symbolic--and the shadow of the new  (and, perhaps, also the old) Suret Guseynov obviously prevents  him presenting constructive proposals. Perhaps there is  something else also. In any event, no fundamentally new features  in Azerbaijan's quite rigid position have been observed as of  late at all. It is appropriate to note in this connection, for  example, that at the recent conference in Moscow, "Interethnic  Conflicts on the Territory of Russia and Countries of the Near  Abroad," Mr. Rizayev, ambassador of the Azerbaijan Republic in  Russia, returning to the sources of the Karabakh conflict,  reiterated the depressing catalogue of charges, which set the  teeth on edge, against the notorious Armenian nationalists, the  notorious Armenian mafia, and the notorious center, not having  ascertained a single Azerbaijani factor here, so to speak. In  spite of the actual facts and documents formerly confirmed by  the Azerbaijani side itself, the ambassador of the Azerbaijan  Republic maintained that the socioeconomic position of Armenians  in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was higher even than  in Armenia and Azerbaijan and that the change in the demographic  situation in Karabakh (and, obviously, in Nakhichevan, where  there were hardly any Armenians left long before the Karabakh  events) was explained by the fact that the Armenians are a very  talented people and that for this reason they yearn for space  and big cities, where they may realize their outstanding  capabilities.    What is typical here is that the Azerbaijani side never  offers any versions of a comprehensive solution of the Karabakh  problem, always constructing its protests entirely on  accusations and demands for the unconditional liberation of the  occupied territories. What kind of constructive approach is this?    Of course, the speech at some conference even of an official  with the rank of ambassador of a sovereign state could  ultimately be considered merely his personal opinion, did this  viewpoint not correlate right down to trifling details with the  position of Azerbaijani delegations at negotiations of all  levels--from exclusively social through the highest political.    In this light we have no choice but to think that Azerbaijan  remains a convinced supporter of a military solution of the  conflict. This is really very disheartening because very many  people had connected with the assumption of office in Azerbaijan  of the quite experienced and politically astute Geydar Aliyev  the hope that Baku would not need additional senseless  casualties for it to finally recognize present-day realities.  But, as we can see, youthful ardor is sometimes manifested even  in people of a ripe old age. And at the most inappropriate  moment, as a rule.    Familiarizing oneself with the words of G. Aliyev, it is  hard  to escape the impression that the elderly figure, who has tried  out everything in his time, is now simply entertained by the  mere possibility of playing near the end at "the collapse of  great empires." Or their reconstruction, which is equally  dangerous. And, what is most distressing, not for their  ill-starred architects but for the unfortunate peoples rashly  entrusting their fate to them.</p>

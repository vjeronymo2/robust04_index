			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / People: Thompson: no rank outsider David Thompson, until the beginning of this week non-executive chairman of Rank Xerox in the UK, yesterday moved to Gestetner Holdings. The office equipment distributor has been looking for a part-time chairman since May, when Inchcape took a 15 per cent stake and Australian entrepreneur Basil Sellars, who had been chairman and chief executive as well as, indirectly, a substantial shareholder, gave up his executive responsibilities. In the photocopier market, Rank Xerox and Gestetner are competitors in the medium and smaller machines. Thompson, 61, who admits to a 'slight lump in the throat' at leaving the company for which he has worked for 27 years, felt far too young to retire. Hence, when presented with the current opening, his reaction was simply one of 'why not?'. He adds: 'With all the wisdom of 12 hours' experience, it looks as if Gestetner has a reasonable operating structure. It is quite strong in Latin America, and doing reasonably well in the Far East. Europe is poor, but so it is for most companies.' In May, a fellow countryman of Sellars', Greg Megaard, was appointed group managing director. Thompson says there will be 'an executive tinge' to the job, which will entail 'taking a close interest in the financial aspects of the business'. Meanwhile Sellers stays on as a Gestetner non-executive director. 'The classic assumption is that we will be tripping over each other,' Thompson acknowledges, but is adamant that this will not be the case. 'We have talked about it,' he says firmly. He expects to be in the chairman's seat 'circa three years, maybe longer . . .if my performance is satisfactory'. Coming to office machines via the colonial police in the former Northern Rhodesia, Thompson moved to IBM, working in the UK and the US, before joining Rank Xerox. He has been chairman of Rank Xerox UK since 1990.</p>

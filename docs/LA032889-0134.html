			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SOVIETS LOSE CONTACT WITH PROBE  </P> <P> The Soviet Union lost "stable radio contact" with its backup space probe to the  Martian moon Phobos, possibly dooming an ambitious program to scout out  possible landing sites for a manned expedition to the planet, Tass said today.  </P> <P> Last September, the Soviets lost contact and abandoned the first of the twin  Martian probes, Phobos I, but space engineers redoubled efforts to ensure  success of the sister probe, Phobos II, to Mars and the Martian moon Phobos.  </P> <P> Tass reported that contact with Phobos II was lost on Monday when the probe  focused its cameras to take pictures of the tiny Martian moon, which is 17  miles wide.  </P> <P> "After these operations were completed, the information was to be sent back to  Earth, but Mission Control was unable to establish stable radio contact with  the probe as scheduled," Tass said.  </P></p>

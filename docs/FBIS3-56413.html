The meeting was of fundamental importance  for the Japanese side since it was to attest that, following the  parliamentary elections, there had been no change in Russia's  acknowledgment of the territorial problem as a real, pressing  problem. It became known yesterday evening that the bilateral  meeting has been postponed indefinitely on the Russian side's  initiative.    The reasons given have plunged the Japanese into profound  depression: The Russian side gave domestic political factors  linked with the new parliament as the reason. In Tokyo this was  interpreted unequivocally as meaning that the political changes  taking place in Russia do not as yet allow Moscow to clearly  make up its mind about Japan. And this means that the accords  secured during Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan in October are, as  it were, up in the air.    Japanese concern intensified after the first press  conference  given by Vladimir Shumeyko, who has just been elected speaker of  the Russian parliament's upper chamber. News agencies reported  that the new speaker said that the disputed islands are Russian  territory and cannot and will not be surrendered to anyone.  According to Shumeyko, there is no question of the ownership and  future of the islands of Kunashir, Iturup, Habomai, and Shikotan  at all. What is more, the speaker pointed out that the  government and cabinet of ministers apparatus backs the stance  espoused by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, which boils down to the  idea that the territorial question does not exist in  Russian-Japanese relations. But the most significant point in  Shumeyko's statements, as reported by news agency channels, is a  previously unheard-of statement: The speaker said that the  Russian Government's stance on territorial matters is at  variance with Russia's official position.    Shumeyko virtually admitted that not only does the Russian  president not have the last word or the deciding say as far as  the parliament is concerned but even as far as members of the  cabinet, which the president himself formed, are concerned.    People in Japan have not so far commented on this revelation  -- evidently they are at a loss to find the necessary words and  phrases straightaway. But ultimately it is not a question of  Japanese comment but of the fact that Moscow seems to see  nothing bad in this situation.</p>

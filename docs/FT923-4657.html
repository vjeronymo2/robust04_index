			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Township violence reports 'biased' BIASED reporting of township violence in South Africa is hindering both peace talks and constitutional negotiations, according to the South African Institute of Race Relations, which has published a report detailing what it calls an international campaign of 'disinformation' about South African violence. Organisations such as Amnesty International, the International Commission of Jurists and the South African-based Human Rights Commission 'distort the causes of violence', the Institute says. In its 50-page report, it details cases in which these three organisations have 'ignored the rules of evidence', elevated allegation to the level of fact and reported evidence selectively. All three organisations accuse the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party of being the main perpetrator of political violence, in collusion with the South African police. But, the report says, they ignore the ANC's role in township violence: it argues that the ANC's policy of rendering South Africa ungovernable in the mid-1980s has left a legacy of violence which is difficult to overcome, and provides evidence that intimidation and coercion often accompany the ANC's mass action campaigns, further fuelling violence. The report notes that the ANC often relies on the reports of these organisations to substantiate its accusations against Inkatha and the government. The institute, for its part, argues that it is very difficult to apportion blame for incidents of township violence, noting that of 2,030 violent incidents analysed for 1991, it was impossible to identify the agent of the attack in 87 per cent of cases without relying on 'untested allegation or speculation'. 'Reports which are seen to be one-sided can easily fan the flames of violence', the report concludes.</p>

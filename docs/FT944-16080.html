			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sellers of ICI Leading chemicals stock ICI was pushed down by selling that followed an international conference call held by US bank Goldman Sachs for around 60 leading UK, US and European investors. The house argued that US commodity prices were beginning to soften and, as the most expensively rated company among its US and continental European peers, ICI would be vulnerable to a downturn. Shares in the company were off 9 at worst and, by the close of trading, recorded a net fall of 3 1/2 to 810 1/2 p with 5m traded. GEC stepped into the bid saga at VSEL, declaring itself a 'bona fide potential offerer' and raising the temperature, if not the immediate stakes, in what could become a bidding auction for the submarines group. VSEL put on 10 to 1,320p while British Aerospace, which has an agreed 1,280p share offer on the table, shed 4 to 467p. GEC was the most actively traded of the trio, gaining 4 to 300p in 7.5m trades. Royal Insurance was the heaviest traded insurance stock, with turnover of 9.8m the highest since mid-August, and said to have reflected hefty switching out of one of Royal's convertible stocks and into the ordinary shares. The latter closed 4 higher at 299p. In banks, big buying by James Capel lifted HSBC to 745p before a close of 737p, a net gain of 11, while better than expected third-quarter results from NatWest Bancorp helped NatWest shares jump 13 to 510p. Barclays rose 10 to 573p after the bank dismissed recent market hints of heavy losses on its proprietary trading books. Disappointment following interim figures from Alexandra Workwear saw shares in the work clothes supplier tumble 23 to 161p. Elsewhere in the sector Dewhirst, the clothing and toiletries group, fell 3 to 124p as one house took on a line of 1.7m shares at 123p and sold them at 122 1/4 p. Eurotunnel fell 18 to 245p - almost 7 per cent - following a UK press report ahead of Monday's trading report that the group might struggle to meet its profit forecasts, thereby unsettling its supporting banks. Most dealers firmly suspected that Monday's results statement would contain bad news. 'It is never wrong to panic where Eurotunnel is concerned,' said one analyst yesterday. Lonrho tumbled in heavy trading as rumours of financial difficulties within the private financial empire of joint chief executive Mr Dieter Bock sent the shares into a nose-dive. The rumours centred on German holding company Advanta Management and led to speculation in London that Mr Bock might be forced to dispose of part of his near 19 per cent shareholding in Lonrho. The speculation was denied by the German company, which described talk of a 'liquidity blockage' as absurd. Lonrho shares closed 12 lower at 131 1/2 p with 12.9m traded. The latest traffic figures from airports group BAA pleased the market, pushing the shares up 10 to 517p on turnover of 4.7m as Sep-tember traffic grew by 8.3 per cent whereas most analysts were going for less than 6 per cent. BAT Industries recovered 9 to 457p. The tobacco and insurance conglomerate announced it had secured a majority shareholding in Russia's Java tobacco factory in return for an agreement to pump Dollars 70m into the company. The three-year investment programme will raise Java's production rate from 14bn cigarettes a year to 20bn. Hanson, which has been restrained recently by heavy US dealing, rose 6 1/2 to 236p on turnover of 11m. Meanwhile, traded options in the company saw the equivalent of a further 5m shares changing hands. Other statistics, Page 39</p>

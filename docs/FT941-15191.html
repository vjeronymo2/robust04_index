			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Eurotunnel faces Pounds 1bn legal action British and French construction companies have presented their final bill for building the Channel tunnel by starting legal action to recover more than Pounds 1bn which they say they are still owed. The contractors are claiming Pounds 2.6bn for installing mechanical and electrical equipment. The original amount agreed for this work was Pounds 630m at 1985 prices. The contractors say Pounds 1.5bn of the sum they are owed has already been paid. The timing of the claim may embarrass Eurotunnel, the project's operator, which is expected to make a Pounds 500m rights issue soon as part of a Pounds 1bn fund-raising move. Details of the contractors' demands will have to be disclosed in any rights issue document unless it can be settled beforehand. Construction companies say the size of the claim is likely to surprise prospective underwriters. Transmanche Link, a consortium of five British and five French construction companies, officially handed over the project to Eurotunnel on December 10. The builders agreed to complete the tunnel, which has been dogged by persistent rows between Eurotunnel and the contractors, only after Eurotunnel made an additional payment last summer of Pounds 235m. Eurotunnel has said that money would have to be repaid with interest if contractors could not substantiate outstanding claims. The cost of constructing the tunnel, including interest payments, has risen from an estimated Pounds 4.8bn in 1987 to more than Pounds 10bn. The builders say delays by Eurotunnel in agreeing last summer's interim settlement with contractors had added a further Pounds 500m to the cost. Eurotunnel has strongly disputed the claims. Negotiations between the construction companies and Eurotunnel are expected to begin shortly in a bid to resolve the issue.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Uruguayan Foreign  Minister Sergio Abreu said the Chilean proposal to establish,  along with the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), a free  trade zone "needs to ripen." The minister said he hopes this  proposal "will not harm the trade benefits established for the  signatory countries of the Asuncion Treaty," which in March 1991  gave rise to Mercosur -- comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay,  and Uruguay.    While in Belem do Para (Brazil), where he is participating  in  the OAS General Assembly, Abreu told the Montevideo newspaper EL  OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO that the Chilean proposal to join Mercosur  within a free trade zone has in principle been well received by  the Uruguayan Government.    Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa announced on 6 June  in Belem do Para that, within 10 years, his country will  establish a free trade zone with Mercosur. Today, he formalized  the proposal in a document he presented in Buenos Aires to  Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, the current Mercosur  council president.    Abreu stressed: "The Chilean proposal needs to ripen because  it only expresses a political will. A concrete proposal is  required on the deadlines and the scope of the association  sought by the government of President Eduardo Frei."    The Chilean announcement was well received from a political  viewpoint because it is a step forward in the regional economic  integration. It is necessary to hear the proposal's technical  aspects before giving an official response.    Abreu admitted that any proposed "violation" of the common  external tariff system, which the four Mercosur partners will  strenuously attempt to establish next month, would be  unacceptable. He added that the Uruguayan viewpoint is shared  by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim.    Uruguay considers unacceptable any trade agreement which  enables another country to have privileged access to the  seizable Argentine and Brazilian markets without paying the same  common external tariff that must be borne by the two other  Mercosur members.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Letter: A business that is burdened by a bureaucratic paradox Sir, I run a modest but diversified agricultural estate, and for 1991 have counted the number of different offices of government, local authority and statutory bodies with which I am required to correspond. My tally is 64 different official offices. Could this burden of compliance be a record for a small business, whose office comprises myself and a part-time bookkeeper? In 1979 the Conservative government was elected to roll back 'the frontiers of the state', but a paradox of Thatcherism seems to be that my business is now burdened with a greater bureaucracy than ever.

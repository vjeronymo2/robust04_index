			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (17): The prerequisites of prosperity - A new respect has emerged for capitalist financial institutions and for success ONE OF the unexpected side-effects of the collapse of authoritarian, command economies throughout central and eastern Europe is a new respect for the capitalist institutions which help create a 'level playing ground' - and a new recognition of the linkage between democracy and prosperity. Both points were forcibly made by Prime Minister Jan Krzysztof Bielecki in his speech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London after attending last month's inauguration of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) - itself the first pan-European institution of the post-cold war period. A self-confessed 'liberal economist', Mr Bielecki argued nevertheless that recent east German experience indicated that the classic leave-it-to-the-market approach was 'inherently flawed' in relation to the needs of the post-communist countries with their 'fragile, even non-existent market controls'. Instead, he argued, governments themselves have to manage the transition to a market economy 'by creating the legislative and administrative machinery that underpins the market and which is taken for granted in the west'. In Poland's case, the creation of financial and other institutions based largely on already existing institutions and methods in use by European Community countries is proceeding apace. The deliberate aim is to create that intricate web of laws, institutions and interconnected services which Stalinist theory despised as non-productive but which capitalist practice has demonstrated as the prerequisite of prosperity. A stock exchange, that quintessential capitalist tool, opened to much razzamatazz in Warsaw last month, although it will only really start operating regularly from June. Sited in the building which once central committee, its functioning is closely modelled on the Lyons bourse. The combination of hard times in the City of London and the awesome size of the potential demand for financial expertise in all aspects of privatisation, evaluation, accounting and legal work has made Warsaw a temporary Mecca for hordes of City firms and foreign banks. International institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the European Commission have all set up shop-assessing projects, disbursing loans and greatly improving the quality and availability of statistics and analysis. Meanwhile, Poland is busy setting up its own Development Bank, modelled closely on Germany's post-war Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau. The bank is headed by Mr Wojciech Kostrzewa and advised by Mr Matthew Olex, one of three vice-presidents, who used to run capital market operations for Lloyds Bank. Its main functions will be to act as a partner for the World Bank and other institutions and concentrate on restructuring state enterprises and investment in small and medium private companies. Three foreign banks, from France, Austria and Italy, are expected to take a joint 10 per cent stake shortly. The recently created EBRD is expected to work closely with all these institutions in part-funding projects and seeking out potential equity investments in the rapidly privatising economy and newly-created Polish companies. Last year more than 500,000 new businesses were registered in Poland, mostly in the retail trade, wholesale and warehousing, road transport and related services and construction. Many failed in their first year. The great majority are small and under-capitalised. But they are the seed corn out of which will grow the middle class of the future. This is the prospect which underpins the effort to create an insurance industry, based largely on UK practice, build up unit trusts and develop a competitive commercial banking system. More than 65 private banks have been authorised over the last 18 months while the IFC and World Bank are involved in a project to provide technical assistance to nine former branch offices of the National Bank of Poland. These have been hived off to form nine state-owned commercial banks. Two of the nine are slated for privatisation this year and the IFC is busy setting up 'twinning arrangements' with foreign banks. A shake-up is also taking place in foreign trade financing where 15 banks have now been granted foreign exchange licenses and a new Export Development Bank has been set up. The new arrangement is expected to sharpen competition for Bank Handlowy, which up to now has accounted for around 90 per cent of Polish foreign trade financing. But the bank, under its US-trained new president, Mr Cezary Stypulkowski, plans to streamline its traditional business in the rapidly expanding foreign trade area and to add retail banking, corporate finance and other operations to its services. But the need to attract foreign investment and privatise and restructure small- and medium-sized state companies has also created big opportunities for entrepreneurial merchant banking services such as those offered by the Polish Investment Company (PIC). Owned and staffed mainly by bilingual Anglo-Polish professionals with a wide range of financial experience in the City and elsewhere, the PIC, in which Swiss bank Corporation also has a 23 per cent stake, is in some ways a symbol of the new, professional Poland now rapidly emerging.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Prudential's new business holds firm in recession DESPITE THE recession, Prudential Corporation's new business held firm last year. New annual premium business, more vulnerable when consumer confidence is low because it requires long-term saving commitments, dropped slightly from Pounds 663m to Pounds 662m. But single premium business increased by 25 per cent to more than Pounds 3bn. Single premium products showed strong growth in the UK, rising 52 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn (Pounds 926m). Most of this came from the Prudence Bond, a single-premium bond investing in the Prudential's main with-profits fund, which was launched through independent intermediaries in May and took in Pounds 350m. The Prudential is also distributing the bonds through its own sales force. Mr Peter Nowell, chief actuary, said he had no plans to follow the lead of other offices and withdraw the bonds from the market. The other main sources of new business were additional voluntary contributions to pensions, popular when people are worried about their jobs, and 'transfer bonds' which receive transfers from pension plans when the holders are made redundant or change jobs. Mr Mick Newmarch, group chief executive, said: 'The strong growth in single premiums is all the more pleasing given the current recession and the major restructuring of our direct sales operation.' Outside the UK, sales of annual premium products fell 8 per cent to Pounds 172m, while single premium business rose by 9 per cent. See Lex</p>

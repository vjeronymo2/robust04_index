			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANAMA: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY;  </P> <P> PANAMANIAN BACK IN MIAMI TO FACE CHARGES  </P> <P> A Panamanian officer indicted along with deposed dictator Manuel A. Noriega on  drug-related charges was escorted to Miami on Monday by U.S. drug enforcement  agents, the Justice Department announced.  </P> <P> Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, a Noriega loyalist who commanded a Panama Defense Forces  unit in the province of Chiriqui, gave himself up to U.S. forces in Panama,  spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said.  </P> <P> Del Cid was one of 15 Noriega associates indicted in February, 1988, by a  federal grand jury in Miami. He is wanted on four counts related to cocaine  possession and laundering of drug profits, the spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> After turning himself in, Del Cid was arrested by agents of the Drug  Enforcement Administration in Panama, she said.  </P> <P> DEA agents escorted him to Miami. "Normally, he would have been flown in by  U.S. marshals, but this was not an ordinary case," she said.  </P> <P> A federal official in Miami, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Del Cid  probably will be arraigned before a magistrate in Miami today but would not  comment further.  </P></p>

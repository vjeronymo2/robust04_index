			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARINE AIR STATION VS. COUNTY DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> After serving 22 years in the armed forces, I just couldn't resist writing  concerning those city fathers and a small group of citizens who want the  Marines to move the Tustin helicopter facility.  </P> <P> Is it really a noise problem or is it greed -- that some investors would like  to grab the land?  </P> <P> A good real estate agent will take a prospective buyer all over an area and  point out what business or armed force installation in an area might be a noise  factor.  </P> <P> About 30 years ago, when we returned from overseas, we purchased a home in Long  Beach.  </P> <P> On the first trip through the area, the real estate salesman pointed out the  flight paths used by Douglas Aircraft Co. and the Air Force base in Long Beach.  We had the opportunity to purchase the house in the air paths or find another  house. We purchased the house.  </P> <P> For the past 25 years, we have lived in Cypress, below the LAX, John Wayne and  Los Alamitos base flight paths, and it has never bothered us.  </P> <P> If you are busy with your life and have varied interests, you don't have time  to worry about aircraft flying overhead.  </P> <P> Early in the 1960s, the Air Force moved out of Long Beach because local groups  complained about jet noise. The local population "jumped up and down" because  the loss to the area was more than $1 million a month, and the joke was that  the Air Force was not flying jets. They were Douglas Aircraft Co. jets. Just  imagine what Tustin will lose if the Marines move out of the base.  </P> <P> Let us be realistic and think about higher taxes as a result of revenue that  will be lost.  </P> <P> Isn't it being patriotic to help our government save money and not burden our  Marines, who are doing their job day in and day out for the protection of our  country?  </P> <P> EUGENE L. ZECHMEISTER  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

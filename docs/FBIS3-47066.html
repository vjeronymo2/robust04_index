In addition, the sources said, representatives of the agency  and the Russian Defense Ministry will meet in Tokyo in early  February for a second round of official consultations on  security matters following a similar meeting in Moscow in June  1992.    The working-level talks with China, which will be attended  by  defense officials and ranking members of the Self-Defense Forces  and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, are the first since  the visit of China's defense minister in 1984.    Following a trip to China by then Defense Agency Chief Yuko  Kurihara in 1987, regular working-level defense talks were  envisaged, but the plans were suspended after Beijing's military  crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators at the Tiananmen Square  in June 1989.    Tokyo, however, decided to go ahead with the original  project  after Washington and Beijing resumed defense talks with the  visit of a senior Pentagon official to China last autumn, the  sources said.    The defense talks come at a time of allegations that China's  long-time ally North Korea is pursuing a nuclear weapons  development program.    "Through dialogue with other countries such as China and  Russia, we aim not only at fostering mutual understanding, but  also at making sure that Japan has a say concerning North  Korea's alleged nuclear development," a Defense Agency source  said.    The talks also reflect the agency's efforts to launch a  broader security dialogue with Asian neighbors to revise  outdated Cold War defense patterns, the sources said.    Defense consultations with Russia will therefore focus on  security guarantees and be upgraded to section chief level, the  sources said.    In line with more active military exchanges to build trust  in  the Asia-Pacific region, Japan will see the first ever visit by  an incumbent South Korean defense minister at the end of March,  the sources said.</p>

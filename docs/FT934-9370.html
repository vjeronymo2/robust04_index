Congress's efforts to prove it is taking action against crime usually provoke cynicism among prosecutors and police chiefs around the country. Most violent crime falls under state and city jurisdiction.

'Proposals to put more police officers on the beat nationwide and to construct new high-security prisons are sound. Little else deserves support.'</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL '90: THE GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE  </P> <P> Bolsa Grande  </P> <P> Coach: Bill Holst (third year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 5-6, 4-3  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 8  </P> <P> Returning starters: Four on offense, four on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Jeff Miller, QB-DB, 6-0, 155, Sr.; Lepage Moaliitele, OG-LB,  5-10, 180, Jr.; Marcus Wilson, RB-LB, 6-1, 200, Sr.; Maurice Wilson, RB-DE,  5-10, 180, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Jason Gonzales, WB-B, 5-11, 160, Sr.; Mervyn Leituala, OF-DE,  6-0, 175, Jr.; Steve Lim, WR-DB, 5-7, 140, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: As the Wilson twins go, so goes the Matadors' offense. The Wilsons are  the key weapons in Coach Holst's triple option, which this season will have  Miller at quarterback. Moaliitele is the class of an offensive line that  includes 305-pound tackle Rayme Manuele. The team will feature a 4-4 defense  led by linebackers Marcus Wilson, Moaliitele and Matt Leituala. The Matadors  will find out how they size up with the rest of the league in a hurry. They  face Rancho Alamitos in their league opener Sept. 28.  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P> <P> Coach: Jeff Buenafe (third year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 3-7, 1-6  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 15  </P> <P> Returning starters: Five on offense, five on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Dennis Amunson, RB, 6-1, 175, Jr.; Brent Brodhagen, RB, 5-11,  205, Sr.; Brian Brodhagen, LB, 5-11, 200, Sr.; Scott Fridley, OG, 5-11, 170,  Sr.; Richard Gutierrez, OG, 6-1, 195, Sr.; Sung Hyun, DG, 5-4, 162, Sr.; Bob  Ioja, QB, 6-3, 190, Sr.; Mario Rodarte, DT, 6-1, 177, Sr.; Ashley Reyes, C,  5-11, 172, Sr.; Angelo Sablan, DB, 5-9, 165, Sr.; Tim Silva, WR/DB, 5-10, 150,  Sr.; Brian Swogger, WR, 6-5, 195, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: John Fonseca, DT, 5-10, 225, Jr.; Raul Gonzales, DB, 5-8, 150,  Jr.; Adrian Ioja, TE, 6-3, 212, Jr.; Mike Knee, C, 6-0, 176, Jr.; Doug Pluard,  LB, 5-10, 185, Jr.; Bob Rosa, RB, 5-10, 145, Jr.; Glenn Sorensen, LB, 5-11,  175, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Argonauts have finished seventh, eighth and seventh the past three  years, winning one league game in that stretch. Buenafe is not optimistic about  the new season.  </P> <P> Kennedy  </P> <P> Coach: Mitch Olson (third year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 5-5, 4-3  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 11  </P> <P> Returning starters: Two on offense, three on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Vince Church, RB-DB, 5-10, 175, Sr.; Scott Jones, WR-DE, 6-1,  175, Jr.; Mark Leach, C-LB, 6-0, 200, Sr.; Morgan Murakami, WR-DB, 5-10, 170,  Jr.; Corey Phipps, FB-LB, 6-0, 190, Sr.; Rod Rosales, QB-DB, 5-10, 170, Sr.;  Robert Togais, OG-DE, 6-1, 185, Sr.; Joe Youkhan, OT-DT, 6-3, 275, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: R.J. Gonzales, WR-DB, 6-2, 165, So.; John Guthrie, QB-DB, 6-1,  170, So.; Ray Mobley, RB-DB, 5-10, 170, So.; Ed Montchaikul RB-DB, 5-10, 165,  Jr.; Ryan O'Connor, OG-LB, 6-0, 200, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Church, an all-league running back who last season ran for 641 yards  and 11 touchdowns, is the team's mainstay. He has 4.5 speed in the 40 yards and  plays a mean cornerback, the position where Olson says he's a a Division I  college prospect. Youkhan adds muscle at tackle.  </P> <P> La Quinta  </P> <P> Coach: Roger Takahashi (fifth year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 9-5, 5-2  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 14  </P> <P> Returning starters: One on offense, seven on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Eman Bayani, OT, 5-10, 220, Sr.; Walter Dawkins, RB-DB, 6-0,  165, Sr.; Garett Frisby, OT-DG, 6-3, 185, Sr.; Don Hopkins, QB-DB, 6-0, 175,  Sr.; Greg Livermore, LB, 5-9, 185, Sr.; Craig Reynolds, LB, 5-11, 170, Sr.;  Jorge Sanchez, RB-DB, 5-9, 157, Sr.; Joe Slouka, DE, 5-8, 159, Sr.; Justin  Sogoian, TE-P, 6-4, 180, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Sam Barbee, DB, 6-2, 165, Jr.; Bill Boulton, LB, 5-10, 180, Jr.;  Brock Dehart, OL, 5-11, 160, Jr.; Steve Quach, WR, 5-7, 135, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: What the Aztecs lack in size they make up with speed. Quach, promoted  from junior varsity, is the fastest player on the team. The offense is suspect,  but the defense is solid, anchored by all-league selection Reynolds and by  Sanchez, who had five interceptions last season. Dawkins will figure in both  the offensive and defensive backfields.  </P> <P> Los Amigos  </P> <P> Coach: Art Michalik (seventh year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 2-8, 1-6  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 10  </P> <P> Returning starters: Six on offense, four on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Jeff Lavere, OT-DT, 6-0, 275, Sr.; Matt McCready, TE-LB, 6-3,  220, Sr.; Derrick Ragsdale, RB-DB, 6-0, 190, Sr.; Ethan Siddall, QB, 5-10, 155,  Sr.; Roger Wojceichowski, OT-LB, 5-11, 225, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Dan Grudt, TE-LB, 5-11, 155, Jr.; Mike Thayer, RB-LB, 5-7, 150,  Jr.; Andre Roberson, WR-DB, 6-4, 190, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Lobos shared last place last year with Garden Grove, but Michalik  sees better things ahead for his team. "We are going to surprise some people,"  he said. "I'm happy with the team." Contributing to the coach's cheerfulness  are Ragsdale and Siddall, who will be entrusted with making Michalik's power-I  and split-backs offense work, and McCready. Wojceichowski leads an  inexperienced offensive line. He also will help out on defense, along with  McCready and Thayer.  </P> <P> Pacifica  </P> <P> Coach: Bill Craven (14th year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 8-2-1, 7-0  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 23  </P> <P> Returning starters: Three on offense, three on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Jason Blade, DB, 6-0, 165, Sr.; Ryan Bremer, TE-LB, 6-0, 190,  Sr.; Chris Castellano, QB, 5-11, 160, Sr.; Mike Christie, DB, 6-2, 180, Sr.;  George Figueredo, C, 5-11, 210, Sr.; Matt Langenfeld, OG-DT, 6-1, 230, Jr.;  Chris Maroney, LB, 6-0, 185, Sr.; C.T. McDonald, OT, 6-3, 220, Sr.; Derek  Nicholson, RB, 5-11, 160, Jr.; Dave Selof, OT, 6-2, 220, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Eric Stevens, WR, 5-11, 155, Jr.; Eddie Thompson, OG, 6-2, 215,  Sr.; Dan Thomas, DE-DB, 6-1, 180, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Craven doesn't rate his team among the league favorites, but others,  namely Rancho Alamitos Coach Mark Miller, are not taking the lure. Said Miller:  "He (Craven) says the same thing every year." The Fighting Irish have only six  returning starters, but with 23 returning lettermen, there's got to be some  talent.  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos  </P> <P> Coach: Mark Miller (fourth year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 4-6, 3-4  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 17  </P> <P> Returning starters: Nine on offense, eight on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Eric Moore, TE-DB, 6-4, 190, Sr.; Vince Otteman, RB-DT, 5-9,  190, Sr.; Leonard Sims, OT-DE, 6-2, 240, Sr.; Chris Singletary, QB-LB, 6-1,  225, Sr.; Tim Starke, LB, 5-10, 175, Sr.; Lia Togia, OG-LB, 6-1, 220, Jr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Marshall Brown, WR, 6-0, 160, So.; James Cabral, OT, 5-9, 215,  Jr.; Luther Tolbert, DB, 5-8, 170, Jr.; Ulysses Trammell, RB, 5-7, 140, Sr.;  Leon Vickers, RB, 6-0, 175, So.  </P> <P> Outlook: Running back Dana Riddle, who carried the ball 381 times last year,  has graduated. But the Vaqueros have plenty of returning starters, including  all-league members Sims, Starke and Otteman. Much of the Vaqueros' hopes ride  with senior quarterback-linebacker Chris Singletary, who's back after breaking  his leg in the opening game of the last season.  </P> <P> Santiago  </P> <P> Coach: Paul Allen (first year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 4-6, 3-4  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 17  </P> <P> Returning starters: Five on offense, 10 on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Mike Carrasco, QB, 6-0, 181, Jr.; Jaime Estrada, LB, 5-11, 182,  Jr.; Kevin Gilliam, RB, 5-8, 175, Sr.; Nicky Levale, RB, 5-11, 216, So.; Scott  McGarrh, WR, 5-11, Jr.; Dang Nguyen, LB, 5-10, 165, Sr.; Joe Polman, LB, 6-2,  211, Sr.; Noa Utu, LB, 6-2, 212, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Ben Espinoza, OG, 5-10, 187, So.; Minh Nguyen, OT, 5-10, 195,  So.; Ngan Nguyen, C, 6-1, 205, So.; Travis Tisor, RB, 5-9, 173, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: In his first year at as Santiago coach, Allen, an assistant coach at  Whittier College the past three years, is trying to revitalize a team that  hasn't finished higher than fifth the last two seasons. To do so, he'll have to  depend on all-league linebackers Polman and Utu, both of who are on major  college material because of their size and speed, to solidify a defensive unit.  </P></p>

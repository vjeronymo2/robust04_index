			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Blue Arrow judge unlikely to resign MR Justice McKinnon, the Blue Arrow trial judge, is unlikely to resign in spite of severe criticism by the Court of Appeal of his conduct of the trial; nor is he likely to be dismissed. Removing High Court judges from office is very difficult. They have the right to hold office 'during good behaviour'. Only corrupt or criminal behaviour is likely to put their job at risk. Criticism of a judge for his handling of a case by a superior court is an everyday occurrence. Although critical of Mr Justice McKinnon, the Appeal Court did praise some aspects of his handling of the case, in particular the lucidity of his summing up. He has already been replaced with Mr Justice Brooke for the second and third parts of the Blue Arrow prosecution.</p>

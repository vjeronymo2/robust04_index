			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: </F> "Unexpected Aggression"]    [Text] When relations between Brazil and the United States  seem to be on the way to normalization, areas of friction that  have almost been forgotten reappear. It is known that the human  rights issue has always been taboo for our governments, and it  is also known that the State Department is forced by law to send  to the U.S. Congress a report on the human rights situation in  the entire world. Any reference to Brazil in that report is  received in Brasilia with outrage even, and the executive branch  does not seem to understand that the human rights issue is a  universal concern.    Although no one expected it, a top U.S. Government official  touched on this issue in rude language during a meeting of the  UN Human Rights Commission. But this is what happened in Vienna  last week. We were described as a country where "street children  go around in the garbage looking for food and are hunted for  sport." Vivian Derryck went even further, saying "that  negligence is too close to savagery to be called anything else."    During the Collor administration, the Foreign Ministry  feared  the problem of children and human rights would allow a broad  international campaign against Brazil like the campaign carried  out against the Medici administration in relation to the  massacre of Indians.    Unfortunately, by the inertia of the government and the  indifference of broad sectors of society, there are still cases  that, taken out of context, allow speeches like Mrs. Derryck's  to be delivered to audiences that receive them well despite the  prompt and harsh answers from the Brazilian representatives.  Even now in Londrina there was an ad published in a newspaper  inciting the killing of minors involved in holdups. The  psychopathy of the ones who ran the ad is not taken into account  by the people in the nongovernmental organizations and the U.S.  diplomatic corps, which writes the human rights report. In fact,  this is similar to the "hunted for sport" referred to in the  Candelaria massacre. When in international meetings the real  efforts made by nongovernmental civilian organizations,  different churches, and officials of some states to improve the  situation of children are ignored, it is natural for the federal  government to feel justly hurt by the abuse typical of student  body elections, which can only be replied to by denying the  moral authority of the U.S. Government to make this type of  abuse. Unfortunately, however, this is the situation we will  have to live with for many years. Mainly because the increase of  juvenile crime in association with the economic crisis,  unemployment, and the indifference to moral values are making  people insensible and inclined to deal with this problem in the  simplistic manner, and many times with the complicity of  officials who are blind to everything.</p>

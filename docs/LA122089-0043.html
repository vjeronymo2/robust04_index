			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MASTER'S SHOWCASES GREER IN 74-53 WIN  </P> <P> As debuts go, it was far from spectacular, but neither Damon Greer, nor  Master's College Coach Mel Hankinson, nor anyone in the estimated crowd of 650  at Bross Gymnasium was complaining after the Master's 74-53 victory over Cal  Baptist in a National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 men's  basketball game Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Greer, one of 10 players who quit San Jose State's team in January protesting  what he called then-Coach Bob Berry's verbal abuse and mental cruelty, had six  points, four assists and three rebounds in his first collegiate game in more  than 11 months.  </P> <P> "I was just glad to be back out there," Greer said. "I had the butterflies as  usual, but my main concern was to just help the team and not make too many  mistakes."  </P> <P> While it was obvious that Greer will need several more games to be totally  comfortable on the floor again, the former Cleveland High standout did show  flashes of brilliance that left the crowd oohing and aahing.  </P> <P> On two occasions in the second half, Greer fed teammate Tom Bruner (18 points)  with passes on fast breaks that resulted in a two-hand jam and a layup. Later,  the 6-foot guard went above the rim to tip in a missed layup by David  Humphreys.  </P> <P> "We certainly feel good about his first night out," Hankinson said. "The  addition of him and Humphreys make us a very strong team at the point-guard  position . . . That's a very excited locker room in there right now. Those guys  are talking about winning 10 games in a row.  </P> <P> "Damon adds a whole new dimension to our team. With his athletic ability, he  has the capability of scoring or setting up a basket at any moment. His  addition makes us one of the strongest college division teams in this region."  </P></p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Daimler's arrival marks new spirit at US securities agency - Accounting requirements have deterred foreigners from the NYSE. Patrick Harverson argues the SEC may be relaxing IT IS a tradition at the New York Stock Exchange that the arrival of a stock listing is marked by a ceremony on the trading floor. When Harley-Davidson was floated a few years ago, one of its famed motorcycles was driven on to the floor for the opening of trading. Whether Daimler-Benz, which later this year will become the first German company to list its shares on the NYSE, will commemorate its debut in a similar fashion remains to be seen. As Mr William Donaldson, NYSE chairman joked: 'I don't know whether we can get a Mercedes on to the trading floor, but I'm certain we'll find a suitable way to celebrate the first trade.' Mr Donaldson has every reason to be pleased. Although it has always been the world's largest stock exchange, the NYSE has struggled to attract listings from foreign companies. It has long argued that the strict domestic accounting requirements that the Securities and Exchange Commission, the securities industry watchdog, insists foreign companies meet before selling their securities to US investors put the NYSE at a disadvantage. The NYSE's main rival for overseas listings in the increasingly competitive international capital markets is the London stock exchange. It has been able to attract more foreign companies because standards of financial disclosure in the UK are less onerous than in the US. This allowed London to build a large lead on the NYSE. There are 760 foreign stocks listed or actively traded on the London SE. Only 121 non-US stocks are traded on the NYSE, even though it is a bigger, more liquid market than London's. To narrow this gap, the NYSE has lobbied hard to get the SEC to relax some of its rules, but the agency has insisted that US investors should be allowed access to the same information on foreign companies that is available on domestic companies. This insistence has deterred many foreign companies, who view the US accounting requirements as too costly and burdensome. German companies, with their more secretive approach to accounting, have stayed away. This week's agreement between the SEC and Daimler, suggests the SEC may be adopting a more accommodating stance. There was, said Mr Gerhard Liener, Daimler's chief financial officer, a new spirit at the agency. Although the SEC insisted it had not changed its policy on financial disclosure, it was clear the agency made modest concessions to match Daimler's - primarily concerning the accounting of the German company's past earnings and the treatment of goodwill. The importance of the Daimler listing to the NYSE and other US markets is that it proves to foreign companies that agreement over the thorny issue of accounting standards is possible. The NYSE hopes the Daimler-SEC agreement will open the door to other foreign companies seeking a foothold in the world's largest capital market. As Mr Donaldson says: 'It is my hope that (the) announcement is the first step down the road toward accords that will open US markets to hundreds of companies in Germany and elsewhere in the world, and do so as soon as possible.' Daimler's chief financial officer is inclined to agree with Mr Donaldson. Mr Liener said it was probable that Deutsche Bank, Daimler's largest shareholder and Germany's biggest banking group, would seek a listing in New York. Other big companies from Switzerland and Austria, where accounting principles are similar to Germany's, may follow the path. While Daimler is coming to the US markets because it wants access to a large new pool of capital, it is unlikely that the German company would be breaking ground were it not for the growing appetite among US investors for foreign stocks. US investors have been reluctant to invest overseas, partly because the lack of information about foreign companies raised the risks of buying non-US stock, and partly because domestic equities had for so long provided secure, bountiful returns. However, much has changed. Mr David Boyle, managing director at Citibank, which is one of the leading US depositary banks for foreign shares, says: 'Over the last four to five years advances in technology - primarily in data processing and telecommunications - means that the flow of information around the world has increased greatly, and this has allayed a lot of investors' concerns here in the US.' More importantly, US investors have begun looking overseas for better returns on their money. As Mr Boyle says: 'US investors are seeking higher risk-adjusted returns on their portfolios. Price-earnings ratios here have been high for some time, given there has been quite a run in the market in recent years.' Consequently, trading on US markets in foreign shares (primarily in the form of depositary receipts, which are issued by almost all overseas companies in the US other than those from Canada) has risen over the past few years. According to Citibank, Dollars 24.1bn of depositary receipts were traded on US exchanges in 1985. By last year, that figure had jumped to Dollars 123.2bn. There is a growing supply of foreign securities to meet that demand. Securities Data in New York says that 49 foreign companies issued Dollars 5.5bn of common stock in the US last year, up from 1991, when 31 issuers sold Dollars 4.7bn worth of common stock. Just seven years ago, a meagre Dollars 636m of stock was issued in the US by foreign companies. Although Daimler was reluctant to be pinned down on whether, or when, it might join the list of foreign issuers, it seems likely that the German company will be selling its securities to US investors over the next 12 to 18 months. In the meantime, Daimler must concentrate on more important issues - such as finding a suitable way to celebrate the opening of trading in Daimler stock on the NYSE.</p>

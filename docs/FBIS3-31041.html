Granic told journalists he made the proposal in a letter  Friday to United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    As well as proposing the withdrawal of "elements" of its  army  deployed south of the southern Bosnia-Herzegovina city of  Mostar, Zagreb also called on the UN to set up frontier controls  on the border between Bosnia and Croatia.    "At the same time, Croatia is asking for guarantees from the  UN concerning the security of the Croat enclaves in central  Bosnia," Granic added.    The troops in question were deployed on both sides of the  Neretva River along a 27-kilometre (16-mile) corridor between  the border and the town of Buna, south of Mostar, Granic added.    Granic said the troops stationed east of the river were  Croatian Army regulars, and those on the western bank were  "former members of the Croatian Army" fighting as "volunteers"  alongside Bosnian Croat forces.    On February 3, the UN Security Council called on Croatia to  immediately withdraw all its regular forces from Bosnia or face  international sanctions.    The UN has estimated between 3,000 and 5,000 Croatian  regulars are fighting in Bosnia.    Zagreb has denied the allegation, but admitted it has  deployed troops south of Mostar and in the hinterland of the  Croatian Adriatic port of Dubrovnik, and that around 2,000  Croatian military "volunteers" are active inside Bosnia.</p>

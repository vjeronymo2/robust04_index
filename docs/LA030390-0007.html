			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF SEASON IS LONGER, IT SHOULD BE BETTER  </P> <P> As long as the NFL is going to revise its schedule to 17 weeks, they should  take the opportunity to make it more fair and competitive:  </P> <P> (1) All teams should play weeks 1-5 and 13-17, with all byes to occur in weeks  6-12 (four teams a week for seven weeks).  </P> <P> (2) Weeks 14-17 should be reserved for intradivision play.  </P> <P> (3) No "Monday Night Football" in the last week of the season. All teams should  get the same amount of rest before the playoffs.  </P> <P> JAMES OLMSTEAD, Valencia  </P></p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Concorde, but not Cleveland fallacy Sir, Once again your Leader writer devalues a well-argued examination of the failings of the Local Government Review ('Councils and the Concorde fallacy', June 14) with the repetition of the myth that there is case for abolishing a conurbation-wide authority in the Teesside area because Cleveland County is 'unpopular'. Fact: Results of Mori opinion polls for the Local Government Commission show the level of community identity with Cleveland is above average, higher, for example than Lincolnshire, Dorset, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire - and twice the level of Avon with which you seek to bracket us. Fact: When Harris Opinion Research surveyed local people on behalf of the Institute for Local Government Studies it found satisfaction levels with Cleveland County services among the highest recorded for any local authority in recent years. Fact: Cleveland County Council has not argued for its own survival, but for the recreation of a Teesside-wide authority, with a separate authority for Hartlepool. The Mori survey figures show that the identity level of Teessiders with a Teesside-wide authority is one of the highest recorded anywhere in the country. You are quite right to compare this ill-fated Review with the 'Concorde fallacy'. But please - stop repeating the 'Cleveland Fallacy.' Bruce Stevenson, chief executive and treasurer, Cleveland County Council, PO Box 100, Municipal Buildings, Middlesborough, Cleveland TS1 2QH</p>

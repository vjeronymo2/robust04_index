			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Louis Won and So Lai-fun] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong's various liberal groups are considering  whether to join the new Democratic Party, which will be formed  in October.    Only one day after the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK)  and Meeting Point announced their merger to form a new  prodemocracy flagship, several parties have shown interest in at  least cooperating with the new party.    The vice-chairman of the Association for Democracy and  People's Livelihood (ADPL), Leung Kwong-cheung, said his group  informed Meeting Point chairman Anthony Cheung Bing-leung  yesterday that they would be interested in taking part in the  preparation for the Democratic Party. Mr Leung quoted Mr Cheung  as saying he would consider the ADPL's proposal but did not say  when he would give a reply. He said the ADPL had started  consulting its members about a possible move to join the new  party.    The Hong Kong Democratic Foundation (HKDF) chairman Patrick  Shiu Kin-ying said he had also started consulting members about  joining the new party. He said the idea of merging with other  democratic parties had been been raised a few months ago but was  shelved because there had been divergent voices within the  group.    Admitting that some members preferred to join the pro-China  Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, rather than  the "subversive" UDHK, Mr Shiu expected that their worries in  cooperating with the new party would be eased. "The composition  of the new party will successfully break Chinese isolation to  the pro- democracy bloc. I am very optimistic that members will  receive it with great interest," he said. However, he said the  HKDF would have to decide in what form it would join the  Democratic Party.    He said it was possible that the HKDF would remain as a  separate entity and take the role of a think tank and a support  group for the new party. The newly formed 123 Democratic  Alliance has not decided whether to join the Democratic Party,  but will continue to look at the development of the local  political scene.    Vice-chairman Willy Ng Wai-cho said the alliance however,  did  not rule out the possibility of joining the Democratic Party.    The Hong Kong Affairs Society chairman Gerry Wai Ka-cheung  said he would support its members joining the Democratic Party.</p>

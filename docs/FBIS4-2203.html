			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party </F> committee, at the regional meeting on propaganda and ideological  work on 2 March]    [Text] The regional meeting on propaganda and ideological  work is a very important one. The major tasks of the meeting  are to conscientiously carry out the guidelines of the national  meeting on propaganda and ideological work, and to mobilize all  levels of leaders, all Communist party members, and all comrades  on the propaganda and ideological front in the region to further  seek unity of thinking, enhance morale, grasp the overall  situation, and do a solid job to create a new situation in  propaganda and ideological work in order to continuously push  forward reform, opening up, and modernization of the region.    At this point, I would like to dwell on three issues.    1. The issue of the important significance in doing the  propaganda and ideological work well during the new situation.    An important meeting with overall significance, the national  meeting on propaganda and ideological work was held not too long  ago by the CPC Central Committee at a critical moment when China  was building a new socialist market economic system and carrying  out the modernization drive. Important speeches made by central  leading comrades Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Ding  Guangen at that meeting have profoundly expounded upon the  importance of the propaganda and ideological work during the new  period, have set forth major missions that should be shouldered  by propaganda and ideological work departments in building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, and have called on the  whole party to strengthen and improve leadership over propaganda  and ideological work in a bid to raise propaganda and  ideological work to a new level. The fundamental principles and  the major tasks set forth by that meeting are characterized by  the distinctive feature of the times, are major policy decisions  adopted by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as  its core, to carry out the principle of "taking a two-handed  approach and being tough with both hands," and are the strategic  dispositions for ensuring the triumphant progress of the cause  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Successfully  implementing the guidelines of that meeting in line with the  realities of the region is of great, immediate and far- reaching  historical significance in carrying out the work principle of  "seizing favorable opportunity to deepen reform, expand the  scale of opening up, promote development, and maintain  stability," in promoting the reform, development, and stability  of the region, in bringing up new generations of people who are  politically aware, morally-sound, well-educated, and  well-disciplined, in consolidating and developing socialist  relations among all nationalities, and in building socialism  with Chinese characteristics. All Communist party members in  the region, leading cadres at all levels in particular, must  fully understand the great significance of the national meeting  on propaganda and ideological work, conscientiously study the  documents of that meeting, profoundly comprehend the guidelines  of that meeting, and make great efforts to truly implement the  work ideas and various dispositions defined by that meeting in  doing practical work.    Within the magnificent cause of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, the propaganda and ideological front is  an important front shouldering the important task of providing  spiritual motivation, ideological guarantee, and intellectual  support. Our party has always attached high importance to  propaganda and ideological work. Since the third plenary  session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  has made many brilliant and distinct expositions on  strengthening the party's propaganda and ideological work. He  has repeatedly stressed the necessity of putting propaganda and  ideological work in an extremely important place and actually  paying attention to the work without any slackness. The third  generation of the party's leading collective, with Comrade Jiang  Zemin as its core, has paid extremely high attention to  propaganda and ideological work and has set forth a series of  correct principles, policies, and demands on the propaganda and  ideological work under the new situation. We should profoundly  comprehend and earnestly implement these principles, policies,  and demands.    As far as our Inner Mongolia Region is concerned,  strengthening propaganda and ideological work is of especially  important significance. First, our region is located in the  border area where the economic and cultural conditions are  relatively backward, the reform and economic development tasks  are very heavy, and the tasks of emancipating the mind and  changing concepts are more arduous than any other place. Thus  we are required to widely create public opinions and open a path  for unceasingly emancipating the mind, changing concepts, and  accelerating reform and development through our propaganda and  ideological work. Second, as China will issue the greatest  number of reform measures this year than in any previous year,  we will face many difficulties. Particularly in places like our  region, which is restricted by conditions in various aspects,  people are relatively weak in withstanding the reform strain and  will thus have more ideological problems. This requires our  efforts to strengthen guidance through our propaganda and  ideological work, help the people correctly recognize the  situation, and understand reform in an effort to more  extensively mobilize the masses to support and participate in  reform and to guarantee success in reform. Third, ours is a  regional autonomous region of minority nationalities and a major  region where the current international hostile forces have  stepped up their efforts to implement the strategy of  "westernization" and "disintegration" in our country. The  activities of "Pan-Mongolism" have been aggravated abroad and  class struggle still exists to a certain degree in China. We  are facing a fairly complicated struggle in political and  ideological spheres. Thus we are required to strengthen  propaganda and ideological work and strengthen education on the  political situation, on the Marxist nationalities concept and  the religious concept, and on our party's nationalities policy  and religious policy. Only thus, can we effectively resist the  plots of " westernization" and "disintegration" of the hostile  forces at home and abroad, consolidate and develop an excellent  situation of stability and unity in our region, and effect a  long period of order and stability in the border areas. In the  face of this new situation and new task, we must pay greater  attention to propaganda and ideological work. This work must be  strengthened and not weakened; and be improved and enhanced and  not be allowed to remain stagnant.    During recent years, our region has made great achievements  in propaganda and ideological work, and played a positive role  in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Party committees at all levels have paid  attention to promoting and guaranteeing the accomplishment of  all tasks through propaganda and ideological work. The  situation in which the whole party attends to propaganda and  ideological work is being formed. Generally speaking, all  departments on the propaganda and ideological front are capable  of carrying out their work in line with the party's basic line,  and have submitted themselves to and served the central task of  economic construction, conducted education on the party's basic  theories and basic line, on patriotism, collectivism, socialism,  and national unity, done much work to introduce our region's  typical cases and experience in reform and development, to  strengthen spiritual civilization in the urban and rural areas  and external propaganda work, and to invigorate the cultural  sphere, and made new progress in many aspects. The regional  party committee and government are satisfied with the propaganda  and ideological work and trust the ranks of propaganda and  ideological workers.    While recognizing the achievements, we should also recognize  that our propaganda and ideological work is not compatible with  the development of the current situation. The party and  government leaders in some localities have failed to pay  sufficient attention to propaganda and ideological work, and  have the problem of being "soft with one hand and tough with the  other hand" in practical work. Efforts are needed to adopt a  clear-cut stand and further enhance the ability to specifically  conduct propaganda and ideological work; strengthen theoretical  study and propaganda in close connection with reality, and  provide support and guarantee for reform, development, and  stability; and further improve cultural and economic policies.  To solve these problems, we must further conscientiously study  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, profoundly understand its essence, and  strive to enhance our awareness and steadfastness in  implementing this theory.    Persisting in the principle of "taking a two-hand approach  and ensuring that both hands are tough" is the basic principle  of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics as set  forth by Comrade Xiaoping under the new historical conditions.  This basic principle demonstrated gigantic forces and produced  profound influence when there was severe unrest in the  international situation, major domestic reform was being carried  out, and the western hostile forces were launching  "westernization" and "disintegration" strategies against us. We  should proceed from reality to study this important idea of  Comrade Xiaoping and emphatically solve the following three  ideological and practical problems.    First, we should firmly define the awareness of "taking a  two- hand approach." In building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, we should not only replace poverty with wealth  but also replace ignorance with civilization to form a healthy,  scientific, and civilized way of life. Comrade Xiaoping pointed  out during his inspection of south China in 1992: "To catch up  with the `four little dragons of Asia' in the next 20 years,  Guangdong should not only promote its economy and improve the  social order and the general mood of society but also surpass  them in building material and spiritual civilizations. This is  the so-called socialism with Chinese characteristics." The  party as a whole is warned that socialism with Chinese  characteristics is a socialism characterized by highly developed  material and spiritual civilizations. In their real life, some  comrades regard economic construction as a "tangible task" and a  "real target" and the improvement of party style and  administrative honesty and the ideological and political work as  an "intangible task" and an "impractical target." So, they  placed the improvement of party style and administrative honesty  and the ideological and political work in a marginal position.  We must clearly define that the basic line of the party is to  take the economic construction as a key link. This key link  must be neither obstructed nor attacked. The work in various  spheres must be focused on, be submitted to, and serve this  link. The stress on "taking a two-hand approach" is aimed at  ensuring the central link of economic construction through the  improvement of spiritual civilization. We must profoundly  understand that when the spiritual civilization is ignored, the  material civilization will not develop well and we will be  divorced from the party's basic line of "one center and two  basic points." Comrade Xiaoping said that "if the spiritual  civilization is not strengthened, the material civilization will  be damaged and we will regress in the course of building the  material civilization. It will be impossible for us to win  success in revolution and construction if we only rely on  material conditions." At a meeting of political bureau standing  committee members that was held in 1986, Comrade Xiaoping  further stressed: "If common practice regresses, the success in  economic construction will become meaningless. The  deterioration in other aspects will bring about economic  deterioration. If the tendency spreads unchecked, a world where  corruption, theft, and bribery run rampant will take shape.  Comrade Xiaoping's statement is pregnant with meaning and  provides the people with food for thought. The party committees  at various levels should approach from the high plane of the  successful strategy of building a socialism with Chinese  characteristics to fully understand the importance and urgency  of building the party's propaganda and ideological work and  firmly foster the awareness of "taking a two-hand approach."  This is the prerequisite as well as the ideological foundation  for realistically and consciously paying attention to the  propaganda and ideological work. In principle, some comrades  understand the importance of strengthening the construction of  the spiritual civilization and the ideological and political  work. However, in doing their practical work, they think that  the party and the government should divide the work of building  spiritual and material civilizations. They think that the  ideological and political work is a matter for party committees  and propaganda and ideological work departments and that the  ideological and political work is not related to their  professional work. Thus, the phenomena of "the two hands"  divorced from each other results. We must understand that  although our comrades work at different posts and their specific  tasks are different, their major target is identical and all of  them are working to liberate and develop productive forces,  safeguard the reunification of the motherland and the great  unity of various nationalities, and build a socialism with  Chinese characteristics. Therefore, the party committees and  governments at various levels should persist in the principle of  "taking a two-hand approach," all comrades of the party,  regardless of their jobs, have the duty to assume responsibility  for building both spiritual and material civilizations. We must  neither isolate the material civilization from the spiritual  civilization nor set one against the other.    Second, we should profoundly comprehend the exposition that  "the biggest mistake lies in education" and enhance the concern.  In 1989, in light of the tendency to neglect ideological and  political education, Comrade Xiaoping set forth, in a clear-cut  stand, the exposition that "the biggest mistake in the past  decade was in education." He said: "Upon sober reflection, we  assess the mistake in education to be even more serious than  that of inflation." In 1992, while dwelling on the question of  how to ensure long-term stability and order of the state, he  pointed out: "Both persons failed, opposing bourgeois  liberalization instead of focusing on the economic issue.  Therefore, they cannot be forgiven." Comrade Xiaoping pointed  out earnestly: "It cost us a dozen years to achieve today's  results in building special zones, but it will only take a  single night to destroy. While easy to destroy, it is difficult  to build up. Failing to watch out for signs of problems,  something will go wrong." Obtaining a profound understanding of  these expositions is of great significance for us in  strengthening propaganda and ideological work. The current  overall situation, the economic and political situation, and the  international environment we now face are favorable to us.  However, the ideological problems within the party and in  society are extremely complicated, various kinds of instable  factors remain, and the task on ideological and political work  are extremely arduous. In addition, some of our comrades are  immersed in specific affairs, are not serious about politics,  and lack a sense of concern. Some comrades remain indifferent  to negative feelings, are reluctant to criticize erroneous  speeches, and even chime in with such speeches. If we allow  these problems to go unchecked, they will certainly lead to the  spreading of evil trends and erroneous ideas. In particular, if  we pay no attention to guiding our cadres and the masses through  education and let various sorts of mistakes, reactionary ideas  in particular, spread unchecked in the process of building the  socialist market economic structure, not only will our economic  construction, reform, and opening up be adversely affected, but  our morale will also be dampened and our cause, ruined.    Third, we should conscientiously implement the measure of  "being tough with both hands." In the past few years, we  shouted loudly for building spiritual civilization and  strengthening ideological and political work whenever there was  a meeting, but, the results were not good enough. The essential  reason was the failure in implementation. Comrade Xiaoping  pointed out straightforwardly: It is not that we have failed to  stress the adherence to four cardinal principles, the  ideological and political work, the opposition to bourgeois  liberalization, and the opposition to spiritual pollution, but  that we have fallen behind in consistency, taking action, and  even talk about them." He exhorted the whole party that "in  building spiritual civilization, in improving the party style,  and in improving the atmosphere of society, we must be resolute  without any slackness and must begin with specific affairs."  Comparing our work against this instruction of Comrade  Xiaoping, we can actually find some problems that cannot be  neglected. First, we have not been resolute enough. Although  some measures have been adopted, they are not dynamic enough to  have formed a prevailing atmosphere. Second, our measures have  been sometimes resolute but sometimes slack. Some comrades have  forgotten propaganda and ideological work when the work is  smooth, and when confronted with problems, they became suddenly  attentive to propaganda and ideological work. Third, some  comrades do not have the courage to solve problems beginning  with the specific incidence of their own localities and units,  and do not have the courage to talk about and manage the obvious  problems, and then let these problems go unchecked for fear of  running risks and giving offense. To actually change this  situation, party and government leaders at all levels of all  units as well as all comrades of the party must enhance party  spirit, adhere to principles, and actually attend to practical  work with the spirit of being responsible for the interests of  the party and the people. They should not only map out plans  and measures for strengthening propaganda and ideological work  but also do their work in a down-to-earth manner and truly carry  out what they have written and said in order to truly turn the  ideological and political work from being merely ideology to  practical work and yield great results in this regard.    2. On the current main tasks of the propaganda and  ideological work front.    Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out at the national propaganda  and ideological work conference: The propaganda and ideological  front must firmly grasp the fundamental guide of the theory on  building a socialism with Chinese characteristics, "arm the  people with scientific theories, guide the people with accurate  mass media, portray the people with lofty spirits, and mobilize  the people with outstanding works." This "fundamental guide and  the work in four aspects" are to make an overall arrangement and  work out a good idea for achieving the propaganda and  ideological work in the course of accelerating the setup of the  socialist market economic system. The basic propaganda and  ideological work tasks at present and in the foreseeable future  as set forth by the region according to this spirit are as  follows: We should work closely in line with the overall  situation of reform, development, unity, and stability; arm the  masses with the theory on building a socialism with Chinese  characteristics; conduct propaganda on the party's basic line,  principles, and policies among the masses; educate the masses  with ideas of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; mobilize  the masses' enthusiasm with the goal of becoming fairly well-off  and seeking common wealth; seek unity of thinking; have firm  confidence; unite with the people; mobilize the cadres and  people of various nationalities; bring their enthusiasm,  creativeness, and arduous and pioneering spirits into greatest  play; and create a good social mass media environment and  provide forceful ideological and political guarantees for  realizing the region's two current fighting goals.    A. We should grasp theoretical study so that the theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics will take root  in the hearts of the people. Arming the cadres and the people  with the theory on building a socialism with Chinese  characteristics is the primary task of the propaganda and  ideological work front as well as the key to achieving  propaganda and ideological work. The propaganda and ideological  work conference set higher, new demands on fulfilling this task.  We must conscientiously implement this spirit and solidly  deepen the study of the theory on building a socialism with  Chinese characteristics.    The organizational and propaganda departments under the  party  committees at various levels should make overall plans,  including both long-term and short-term arrangements. The main  contents of the study are to study volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the "decision" of  the third plenary session of the 14th party congress. We should  prominently grasp the study of the leading cadres at or above  the banner and county level, particularly the key groups. In  study, the key groups at various levels should combine theories  with practice, seek unity of thinking, perfect policy decisions,  sum up experiences, promote the organic combination of the work,  and strive to deepen their study and better apply what they have  studied. Through the study of the key groups at various levels,  we should guide the broad masses of party members, cadres, and  people to engage in the study. From now on, we should educate  party members mainly with the theory on building a socialism  with Chinese characteristics so as to have the broad masses of  party members and cadres grasp the theoretical essence of  emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, to answer  and handle various practical problems, to be able to profoundly  understand and comprehensively implement the party's basic line  of "one center and two basic points," to be able to deeply  understand and grasp the basic viewpoint of developing the  socialist market economy, to be able to accurately understand  and handle the relationship between stability and reform and  development, to be able to accurately understand and constantly  persist in the basic principle of "taking a two-hand approach  and ensuring that both hands are tough," and to be able to play  an exemplary role in persisting in the purpose of serving the  people wholeheartedly.    As far as our Inner Mongolia is concerned, one of the most  important aspects in studying theory is to persist in using the  Marxist nationalities concept and nationalities policy to arm  the broad masses of party members and cadres of various  nationalities. The party's nationalities theory and  nationalities policy are a component of the theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. The broad masses of  cadres across the region, particularly the party leading cadres,  should firmly cultivate the Marxist nationalities concept, study  and grasp our party's basic theory and basic policy on solving  the nationalities issue, and study and understand the ideology  and thesis of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on nationalities issues and  work. Through conducting realistic, in-depth, and extensive  education on nationalities theory and policy, we should strive  to grasp the basic viewpoint, clarify the rights and wrongs on  some major issues, and reach a common understanding.    At present, we should further unify thinking and enhance  understanding on the following basic viewpoints:    A united multinational country with a long history, China's  territory has been developed jointly by the people of various  nationalities and created a brilliant Chinese culture;    Over a long period of relocation and fusion, the people of  various nationalities have formed a Chinese nation whose people  are closely interrelated and bonded strongly with the sense that  being a part of the Chinese nation is the spiritual tie linking  the people of various nationalities together, and the idea that  "all nationalities are indispensable to one another" as the  ideological basis for safeguarding national unity and promoting  common prosperity;    All natural resources in the localities are the commonwealth  of the Chinese nation, and translating the natural resources  advantages into economic advantages is the common task for all  nationalities;    The essence of the party's policy on nationalities is aimed  at developing minority areas and realizing common prosperity  among the people of various nationalities;    We should stress essence and not form in observing minority  areas;    We must uphold the "three essential criteria" in assessing  the work of minority areas;    In essence, the issue on the uneven development in various  localities is an issue of the history of society and economic  development and is absolutely not an issue of inequality among  the people of various nationalities;    A process is required in narrowing the gap between minority  areas and developed areas and realizing common prosperity;    Promoting great unity among the people of various  nationalities and maintaining political and social stability in  minority areas is the overall situation of the party and the  state and is where the fundamental interests of the people of  various nationalities lie;    An important method used by hostile western forces in  dissolving socialism is that of using the nationalities issue  and religious issue to disintegrate China, which not only means  disaster for the various nationalities in China, but also for  the whole world;    Our struggle against a small number of national splittists  is  a conflict between ourselves and the enemy to the people of  various nationalities, the splittists.    With a common understanding, we will be able to build a  strong line of ideological defense to oppose "westernization,"  and "disintegration," narrow the market for the activities of  the national splittist force to maximum, eliminate interference,  realize a long period of order and stability in the border  areas, safeguard the unification of the motherland, and  accelerate development in our region and the common progress and  prosperity among the people of various nationalities.    B. We should correctly guide public opinions to serve  in-depth reform, to accelerate development, and to safeguard  stability. Grasping correct media guidance is aimed at  mobilizing the masses of people of various nationalities to  actively participate in reform and in the modernization drive.  We should apply all sorts of propaganda and media means,  implement the party's theories, line, principles, and policies  of the new period among the masses of people through solid and  effective work, publicize the situation and tasks to the people,  clearly explain the new problems and new contradictions emerging  in the course of reform to the masses, provide a strong  ideological and political guarantee for accelerating reform and  opening up, and create a good media environment for developing  the economy and promoting national unity and social stability.    This year is critical to deepening the reform and  accelerating the development of the region. In deepening the  reform, we should emphatically make breakthroughs in five  aspects, that is, to make new breakthroughs in establishing and  perfecting the socialized comprehensive service system in rural  and pastoral areas; in transforming the mechanisms of industrial  and commercial enterprises; in reforming financial and tax  systems; in reforming pricing and financial systems; and in  conducting organizational reform, changing government functions,  and carrying out reforms in subsidiary fields. After making  breakthroughs in these five aspects, we will be able to create a  new situation in overall reform. At present, because the people  have different positions and interests, and use different angles  to approach issues, various sorts of ideological problems will  naturally exist. This requires our party committees at all  levels and our comrades on the propaganda and ideological front  to strengthen investigation and study, to master in a timely  manner the changes in the people's ideas and feelings, to do a  good job in giving ideological persuasion, resolving  contradictions, and harmonizing public feelings, and to guide,  in a clear-cut way, the masses to comprehend, support, and  participate in reform. At present, the most important and  urgent task is to purposefully do the propaganda and ideological  work for the difficult and hot issues for the common concern of  the masses.    For instance, the issue on how to approach the gaps between  the development of the region and advanced localities. Through  the guidance by mass media, we should make the people definitely  understand the following facts: At present, the region's  general situation of economic development is good, and the  region has made a very great progress if compared with the past.  There are many-sided reasons for causing the gaps between the  region and advanced localities, the gaps exist between those who  have become prosperous first and those who lag behind, and this  kind of gap will be hard to avoid in a certain period of time.  In accelerating development, we should stress solid work and  efficiency rather than blindly competing with one another in a  race for speed. In accelerating development, we should make  best possible use of the rich natural resources of the region's  agriculture and animal husbandry to engage in large-scale  cropping and breeding in a bid to increase the value in an even  faster manner. In accelerating development, we must deepen  reform, overcome the ideas of "waiting, depending on, and asking  for someone else," and get rid of the defects of "common big  pots," "iron rice bowl," and "egalitarianism." In accelerating  the pace of making the region become prosperous, we should  depend on the concerted efforts and arduous struggle of the  people of all nationalities and should be aware that it is of no  avail to blame God and men and being negative and pessimistic is  detrimental to development. The region enjoys exceptional  advantages and has tremendous potentials in developing the  economy and thus the bright prospects in invigorating the  region's economy should be fully understood. After reaching a  common understanding of these issues, we will be more confident  and vigorous, create a new spiritual outlook, and obtain an  ideological foundation and motivation for achieving success in  our work.    For another instance, anticorruption is also a hot issue  with  which the masses are concerned. It should be noted that the  people's dissatisfaction with corrupt phenomena is a  manifestation of their concern with the party and their hope of  making the party strong and pure. As the propaganda and mass  media departments of the party, we should guide the masses to  have a correct understanding of the opposition to corruption.  In this regard, we should define the following several basic  viewpoints: The main trend of our party is good, the  overwhelming majority of party members and cadres are honest and  clean in performing official duties and are conscientious in  serving the people. In opposing corruption, the attitude of the  CPC Central Committee is resolute and the measures are  effective, and the regional party committee and most party  organizations in the region have been brave in tackling and  dealing with corruption. Corrupt phenomena are serious, and the  anticorruption campaign is a long-term task, which cannot be  accomplished in one stroke. We should be ideologically prepared  to deal blows to corruption firmly and unremittingly and should  also embrace the sense of urgency. In launching the  anticorruption campaign, we should stress discipline and the  legal system and should depend on the masses to build up a  powerful momentum of mass media instead of launching movements.  Correctly launching the anticorruption campaign in line with  the arrangements of the CPC Central Committee will not affect  economic construction, reform, and opening up, but will provide  important guarantees for reform and construction. Our party  will always oppose corruption and will certainly be able to  achieve results at each stage of anticorruption and gradually  reduce the phenomenon of corruption to the lowest degree.    To accurately grasp the focal points of the orientation for  mass media it is necessary to grasp various media. Media, such  as newspapers, publications, and radio and television programs,  are key means to achieve the propaganda and ideological work.  Therefore, these news mediums should bring into full play their  special characteristics and advantages in guiding the mass  media; persist in the principles of unity, stability, vigor, and  propaganda by giving positive examples; accurately grasp the  orientation for propaganda and mass media; positively support  and develop accurate and healthful mass media; overcome lopsided  and irresponsible mass media; and resolutely eliminate and end  harmful mass media. Our mass media must really conform to the  principles and policies of the party and actually stand for the  majority of the people's opinions and interests. We must never  support the mass media that are not suitable to the theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the party's  basic line and basic policies, and the party's policies toward  nationalities and religions, and that are not conducive to the  national unity and the reunification of the motherland.    Further strengthening external propaganda is an important  aspect of accurately grasping the orientation for mass media.  Success in external propaganda is of great strategic and  realistic significance in expanding Inner Mongolia's  international and domestic influence; promoting the economic,  scientific and technological, and cultural exchange between our  region and the outside world; and forming a good external  environment that is conducive to deepening reform, expanding the  scale of opening up, and accelerating the pace of development.  We must further strengthen the awareness of external  propaganda, use the geographic advantages, use various channels  and forms to disseminate Inner Mongolia, have the outside world  understand Inner Mongolia more clearly, and have Inner Mongolia  walk toward the whole country and the whole world with wide  strides.    C. We should well grasp the ideological education and strive  to advocate a good mental outlook and a good social practice.  The fundamental purpose of strengthening the ideological  education is to cultivate new persons with ideals, morality,  education, and a sense of discipline. At present, we should  focus our efforts on educating the broad masses of cadres,  people, and youngsters with the spirit of serving the people  wholeheartedly as repeatedly advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong;  the spirit of having ideals, morality, education, and a sense of  discipline as repeatedly stressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; and  Comrade Jiang Zemin's 64-character pioneering spirit so as to  have these spirits become the strong spiritual pillars of the  socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the social  practice in the new age and to further forcefully resist the  influence of such corrosive ideas as money worship, hedonism,  and out-and-out egoism.    According to the demands of the new situation of setting up  the socialist market economic system, at present and in the  foreseeable future, the party committees, the governments, and  the propaganda and ideological departments should emphatically  solve the following few problems by conducting the ideological  education in a clear-cut and vivid manner. First, we should  educate the people to have firm confidence in socialism, foster  lofty ideals, and consciously engage themselves in the great  cause of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics.  Second, we should enhance the cadres and people's confidence in  deepening reform and accelerating development and guide them to  be inspired with enthusiasm, work hard, and tide over  difficulties. Third, we should educate the cadres and the  people to foster the ideas of ardently loving the motherland and  showing concern for the collectives and to accurately handle the  relationship between the interests of the whole and those of the  part and between the interests of collectives and those of  individuals. At the time of conducting the ideological  education, all departments and units should closely proceed from  their work realities and the broad masses of cadres and people's  thinking to do their jobs well, solve problems ahead of them,  stress real efficiency, and avoid practicing formalism.    At the same time, we should also conduct education on  building our country and conducting all undertakings through  thrift and long years of hard work, and on professional ethics,  social morality, and basic national and regional conditions. We  should make the people understand that in such an economically  underdeveloped area like ours, arduous struggle and building the  country through hard work should be an important guiding  ideology during the whole course of economic development and  that any acts of going in for ostentation and extravagance,  parading one's wealth, and engaging in extravagance and waste  are incompatible with the demands of the times and the desire of  the people. Even when we become rich in the future, we should  also actively promote the spirit of arduous struggle and  building the country through hard work. Through extensive and  in-depth education, we should also promote the progressive,  sound, and civilized way of living, promote the revolutionary  spirit of unselfishness and selfless dedication, and enable more  people, particularly young people, to correctly cultivate the  concept on value and on the outlook on life, to enhance their  sense of the legal system, and to consciously observe law and  discipline, professional ethics, and social morality. It is  necessary to educate cadres and the masses to recognize the  basic national and regional conditions, link the work they are  engaging in with the overall development situation of the  region, and consciously contribute to accelerating Inner  Mongolia's reform, opening up, and economic development.    To strengthen ideological education of the new period, we  must pay attention to summing up experience, promoting typical  examples, and unceasingly enhancing the ideological work of the  whole society. We should stress the exemplary role, moral  quality, and strength of educators while conducting education  and strive to create a social environment and cultural  atmosphere for enhancing educational results. We should give  democracy full play; respect, understand, and care for the  people; adopt the forms and methods that are easily accepted and  welcomed by the masses, make all activities imbue with  education, and guide the masses to conduct self education and  mutual education. In short, we should give full play to the  positive role of ideological education in correctly guiding the  people's social value orientation, social morality, and social  ideology.    D. We should attend to literary and artistic creations and  provide more healthy and rich spiritual products for the people  of various nationalities. As far as the literary and art front  is concerned, to implement the guidelines of the national  propaganda and ideological work conference, it must pay special  attention to producing outstanding literary and artistic works  on promoting the main melody and manifesting the regional and  national characteristics, and at the same time, promote the  creation of various literary and artistic works to satisfy the  daily increasing needs of the people of various nationalities.    To invigorate literary and artistic creations, we must  uphold  the correct orientation of serving the people and socialism and  implement the principle of letting "a hundred flowers blossom  and a hundred schools of thought contend." Speaking from the  angle of leadership, first, leaders should grasp the  orientation; second, they should formulate good policies; and  third, they should organize and coordinate the work well and  create a good environment for invigorating literary and artistic  creations. It is necessary to adopt effective measures to  enhance the quality of creations, exert efforts to produce a  number of outstanding works, such as films, television programs,  literature books, dramas, music, dance, folk arts, and artistic  works. Propaganda and cultural departments at all levels should  produce good literary and art works in an effort to guide  literary and artistic creations. In publication work, we should  uphold the orientation, deepen reform, maintain the  characteristics, and play a greater role in building the two  civilizations in the whole region. We should support and  protect the literary and artistic works with quintessence of  national culture and a fairly high value.    We should continue to implement the principle of "achieving  development on the one hand and eliminating pornography on the  other" to promote healthy development in Inner Mongolia's  cultural undertakings. It is hoped that all literary and art  groups, writers, and artists will fully understand their noble  mission, live up to the high expectations placed on them, raise  spirits, go deep into the reality of life, devote themselves to  work, and create a number of outstanding works that reflect the  spirit of this era and the local and national characteristics  and that are artistically appealing. Meanwhile, the efforts of  various fields should be mustered and effective measures adopted  to greatly rectify the cultural market so that notable results  can be achieved in a short time. In developing cultural  undertakings, we should gear them to the needs of the masses,  rely on the masses, and mobilize the forces of the entire  society to make Inner Mongolia's mass cultural activities vivid,  lively, rich, and colorful.    3. On strengthening party leadership over propaganda and  ideological work.    Now that the major principles for the propaganda and  ideological work have been defined, the key to the next step of  work is to publicize the guidelines of the party Central  Committee and the regional party committee at the grass-roots  levels in a down-to- earth manner. This requires that our party  committees at all levels further strengthen leadership over  propaganda and ideological work, firmly grasp the initiative in  doing propaganda and ideological work, and make the work more  fruitful through practical and effective work.    First, we should attach great importance to the party's  propaganda and ideological work and grasp the initiative in  leadership work. Propaganda and ideological work has a strong  political, policy, and ideological nature. While paying close  attention to and achieving success in reform, opening up, and  economic construction, party committees at all levels should  conscientiously strengthen and improve leadership over  propaganda and ideological work. They should list propaganda  and ideological work high on their agenda, study it on a regular  basis, draw up the principles, tasks, and work focuses of the  propaganda and ideological work for different periods, and  devote more energy to guiding and helping propaganda departments  to discuss and address major issues and to raise work levels.  Major leaders of party committees should concern themselves  with the propaganda on major issues, and propaganda departments  should participate in major political and economic activities so  that propaganda and ideological work will more directly permeate  the party's central work. When formulating strategic plans for  economic and social development, party committees and  governments at all levels should include the development of  propaganda and cultural work in the general plans. Whether party  and government leaders attach importance to propaganda and  ideological work and whether they have the ability to carry out  propaganda and ideological work should be regarded as important  criteria to judge whether they are politically strong and have a  high leadership level. As long as our leaders fully understand  the important position and role of propaganda and ideological  work, they will be able to actively carry out ideological and  political work and fundamentally grasp the initiative in  propaganda and ideological work.    Second, we should change work styles and pay close attention  to implementation of work. All departments, units, and comrades  on the propaganda and ideological fronts should vigorously  conduct investigation and study and seek truth from facts when  doing specific work. Intensifying investigation and study is  the basic skill for a success in propaganda and ideological  work. Comrades on the propaganda and ideological fronts should  go down to the grass- roots levels to learn about the actual  conditions and develop their investigation and study in both  range and quality. They should establish more ties not only  with cadres but also with the masses; learn more not only about  typical experiences but also about the specific conditions in  large areas; and conduct not only in-depth investigation but  also in-depth study.    On the basis of having a good knowledge of first-hand  materials, we should explore something with a regular pattern  and guiding significance, and make propaganda and ideological  work more specific. Seeking truth from facts is the basic  demand for guaranteeing success in propaganda and ideological  work and the work style and attitude that propaganda and  ideological workers should have. Propaganda departments at all  levels should formulate objectives for fulfilling the task  within a certain stage and measures for guaranteeing the  fulfillment of the task in line with the work plans proposed by  the central authorities and the regional party committee, pay  attention to sharing the work with departments of the  corresponding level and responsibilities with the lower levels,  combine the efforts of both, and implement the measures well.  We should make each and every propaganda unit and propaganda  worker clearly understand his responsibility, perform his own  work well, and guarantee that all propaganda and ideological  tasks will be well implemented.    Third, we should strengthen coordination and form a joint  force. Propaganda and ideological work is a project involving  the whole society which must be accomplished with the  coordinated efforts of the whole party and all sectors. Party  committees at all levels and all grass-roots party organizations  in enterprises, the rural areas, organs, schools, and  neighborhoods should emphasize this work. Administrative  departments at all levels and the mass organizations, such as  the trade unions, Communist Youth Leagues, and women's  federations, should grasp this work in line with their own work.  All departments on the propaganda and ideological front should  grasp this work specifically and form a lively situation in  which the whole party, the higher and the lower levels, and all  sectors jointly grasp and manage propaganda and ideological  work. Propaganda and ideological departments at all levels  should be good at maintaining coordination with other  departments, exchange information regularly, establish ties, and  seek understanding and support from all sectors. Investments  are needed in strengthening propaganda and ideological work.  All localities should actively support propaganda and  ideological work in terms of financial and human resources in  line with the actual economic development situation, gradually  improve propaganda means and cultural facilities, and create a  good environment for propaganda and ideological work.    Fourth, we should emancipate the mind, deepen reform, and  enhance vitality for the development of propaganda and cultural  undertakings. To strengthen the party's leadership over  propaganda and ideological work, we must uphold the reform  principle, regard reform as a motivation, and promote the entire  propaganda and ideological work to a new height. To reform  propaganda and ideological work, we must uphold the principles  conducive to strengthening and improving the party's leadership  over propaganda and cultural undertakings, giving full play to  the enthusiasm and creation of the propaganda and cultural  workers, invigorating and developing the propaganda and cultural  undertakings, and building the "two civilizations," and realize  the demand proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin on "changing  functions, improving relations, streamlining administration, and  raising efficiency." The basic ideas of reform are to further  reform and improve the leadership system and leadership form of  the party and government in propaganda and cultural units;  cultivate the socialist cultural market concept and gradually  establish a new pattern of cultural work that fits the market  economy; accelerate the pace of reforming the internal  management system and operational mechanism of the entire  propaganda and cultural front and promote the transition from  cultural work to cultural industry; strengthen the  institutionalization and standardization of propaganda and  cultural work and enable the people to have laws to abide by and  regulations to follow in carrying out propaganda and ideological  work; promote and develop various forms of "link-up" between  cultural units and enterprises; and actively expand external  cultural exchange and strive to make a large number of cultural  products enter the international market. To reform propaganda  and ideological work, we must persist in attaching prime  importance to social efficiency, and under this basic  precondition, realize an integration of economic and social  efficiency.    On the basis of having a good knowledge of first-hand  materials, we should explore something with a regular pattern  and guiding significance, and make propaganda and ideological  work more specific. Seeking truth from facts is the basic  demand for guaranteeing success in propaganda and ideological  work and the work style and attitude that propaganda and  ideological workers should have. Propaganda departments at all  levels should formulate objectives for fulfilling the task  within a certain stage and measures for guaranteeing the  fulfillment of the task in line with the work plans proposed by  the central authorities and the regional party committee, pay  attention to sharing the work with departments of the  corresponding level and responsibilities with the lower levels,  combine the efforts of both, and implement the measures well.  We should make each and every propaganda unit and propaganda  worker clearly understand his responsibility, perform his own  work well, and guarantee that all propaganda and ideological  tasks will be well implemented.    Third, we should strengthen coordination and form a joint  force. Propaganda and ideological work is a project involving  the whole society which must be accomplished with the  coordinated efforts of the whole party and all sectors. Party  committees at all levels and all grass-roots party organizations  in enterprises, the rural areas, organs, schools, and  neighborhoods should emphasize this work. Administrative  departments at all levels and the mass organizations, such as  the trade unions, Communist Youth Leagues, and women's  federations, should grasp this work in line with their own work.  All departments on the propaganda and ideological front should  grasp this work specifically and form a lively situation in  which the whole party, the higher and the lower levels, and all  sectors jointly grasp and manage propaganda and ideological  work. Propaganda and ideological departments at all levels  should be good at maintaining coordination with other  departments, exchange information regularly, establish ties, and  seek understanding and support from all sectors. Investments  are needed in strengthening propaganda and ideological work.  All localities should actively support propaganda and  ideological work in terms of financial and human resources in  line with the actual economic development situation, gradually  improve propaganda means and cultural facilities, and create a  good environment for propaganda and ideological work.    Fourth, we should emancipate the mind, deepen reform, and  enhance vitality for the development of propaganda and cultural  undertakings. To strengthen the party's leadership over  propaganda and ideological work, we must uphold the reform  principle, regard reform as a motivation, and promote the entire  propaganda and ideological work to a new height. To reform  propaganda and ideological work, we must uphold the principles  conducive to strengthening and improving the party's leadership  over propaganda and cultural undertakings, giving full play to  the enthusiasm and creation of the propaganda and cultural  workers, invigorating and developing the propaganda and cultural  undertakings, and building the "two civilizations," and realize  the demand proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin on "changing  functions, improving relations, streamlining administration, and  raising efficiency." The basic ideas of reform are to further  reform and improve the leadership system and leadership form of  the party and government in propaganda and cultural units;  cultivate the socialist cultural market concept and gradually  establish a new pattern of cultural work that fits the market  economy; accelerate the pace of reforming the internal  management system and operational mechanism of the entire  propaganda and cultural front and promote the transition from  cultural work to cultural industry; strengthen the  institutionalization and standardization of propaganda and  cultural work and enable the people to have laws to abide by and  regulations to follow in carrying out propaganda and ideological  work; promote and develop various forms of "link-up" between  cultural units and enterprises; and actively expand external  cultural exchange and strive to make a large number of cultural  products enter the international market. To reform propaganda  and ideological work, we must persist in attaching prime  importance to social efficiency, and under this basic  precondition, realize an integration of economic and social  efficiency.    In conducting reform in the propaganda and ideological  work, we should also display the spirit of daring to do and try.  We should boldly explore things as long as they conform with  the demand of the party's basic line, with the demand of  building socialist spiritual civilization, and with the law of  self development of propaganda and cultural undertakings. We  should also bravely renew these things so that we can find out a  way of reinforcing the vigor of propaganda and cultural work  through reform and of promoting the prosperity and development  of these undertakings.    Fifth, we should realistically enhance the construction of  leading bodies and personnel's contingent among the departments  in charge of propaganda and ideological work. This represents  an organizational guarantee for successfully conducting the  propaganda and ideological work. Leadership of departments in  charge of propaganda and ideological work and every cadre in  these departments must act in unison politically with the CPC  Central Committee and the autonomous regional party committee.  They should strictly enforce the political and working  disciplines and no one is allowed to go his own way. The  propaganda and ideological work must be favorable for reform and  for developing and stabilizing the whole situation. By no means  should we have the propaganda and ideological work add to  turbulence. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "To upgrade the  quality of cadres, we may select so many measures for this  purpose from various angles. However, what is most important is  to upgrade the accomplishment in Marxist theories of the broad  masses of cadres and particularly of leading cadres." Comrades  engaging in the propaganda and ideological work should even pay  attention to upgrading their accomplishment in Marxist theories.  They should fully discern the importance of enhancing the study  of Marxist theories and of applying Marxist theories to arming  themselves from the high plane of the historic tasks undertaken  by propaganda and ideological workers; of the strategy of  safeguarding the reform, development, and unity; and of  stabilizing the whole situation. Propaganda departments at all  levels should formulate or implement the plans for holding  theoretical training classes to vigorously train in a systematic  way and in group a large number of comrades who actually and  practically know well the basic theories of Marxism and  Leninism. By regarding these comrades as backbone personnel, we  should have them bring along the theoretical study on propaganda  and ideological fronts across the region. Efforts should be  made to maintain the stability in the contingent of propaganda  cadres and to direct cadres on the propaganda and ideological  front to foster the spirit of having self-respect, being  self-possessed, and self-progressed; as well as to enhance their  sense of glory, mission, and responsibility in engaging in the  propaganda and ideological work. Party organizations at all  levels should enhance the ideological education among cadres in  charge of propaganda work and teach them to be loyal to the  party's propaganda undertakings, to ardently cherish their  professional work, to perform their duties thoroughly, and to  make contributions selflessly. The emphasis of successfully  building the contingent of personnel is to enhance the work of  building leading bodies on the propaganda and ideological front.  Efforts should be made to upgrade the political and  ideological levels of staffers among the leading bodies and to  enable the leading bodies at all levels on the propaganda front  to be the leading core with unified thinking, pure party spirit,  heightened spirit, unity, and practical work style. In line  with the personnel affairs criterion of four requirements and  the demand of having both ability and political integrity,  propaganda departments at all levels jointly with the  organizational departments should select a large number of  comrades who have the theoretical level of Marxism, as well as  ardently cherish and know well the propaganda and ideological  work, to enter the leading bodies at all levels on the  propaganda and ideological front. Party committees and  governments at all levels should show concern for the comrades  on the propaganda and ideological front in the fields of  politics, ideology, work, and livelihood so as to enable them to  give better play to their talent and to continuously make new  contributions.    The new situation and tasks of establishing the systems of  socialist market economy and realizing the two periodical  fighting targets set by the autonomous regional party committee  have set forth new and higher demands for the propaganda and  ideological work and also provided broad scope for the work.  Leading cadres in party organs at all levels and comrades on  the propaganda and ideological front should bravely assume the  heavy duty imposed on them by the age, heighten their spirit,  enhance their confidence, be willing to do work in a  down-to-earth manner, boldly create something new, and strive to  create a new situation in the region's propaganda and  ideological work!</p>

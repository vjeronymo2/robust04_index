			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Chinese coal at world price China will allow coal producers to sell most of their output at market-set prices in 1993 in an effort to dig the country's beleaguered coal industry out of debt, the official China Daily said yesterday, Reuter reports from Beijing. Officials from the China National Coal Corp (CNCC) told the newspaper that in 1993, prices for 190m tonnes of coal, or 57 per cent of the year's production total, would be allowed to float with the market against about 20 per cent in 1992. Coal is China's main energy source and has long been subject to strict government price controls, meaning huge losses for the industry as inefficient mines swallow up government subsidies. CNCC, a state monopoly, was able to cut losses by about 500m yuan (Pounds 56m) in 1992 thanks to the government's first effort at de-controlling prices, the newspaper said.</p>

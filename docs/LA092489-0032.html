			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASTERN EUROPE AND GERMANY  </P> <P> Following your excellent coverage of the events taking place in Eastern Europe,  especially the escape of the hundreds or thousands of young East Germans from  Hungary to the West, I am reliving the moments of joy and euphoria that I felt  when I escaped from Hungary to Austria with my brother during the night of Nov.  24, 1956. It is an indescribable feeling that can only be compared to giving  birth to a child.  </P> <P> I am very proud of Hungary and would like to thank Austria for helping the  refugees of Eastern Europe all these years.  </P> <P> MARIANNE MARTIN  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

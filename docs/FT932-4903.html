			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Observer: Gatt tactics Virtually everyone agrees that Peter Sutherland, the EC's nominee and former EC competition commissioner, would make a first-class director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. So what is to be made of the last-minute shenanigans in the run-up to Wednesday's election of Gatt's new boss? Some Latin American trade ambassadors have been miffed by the general assumption that with European and American backing he is a shoe-in for the job, leaving the two Latin American nominees, Juan Fernando Jaramillo of Colombia and Julio Lacarte-Muro of Uruguay as also-rans. But experienced Gatt hands suspect a sub-plot. What is really at stake is the distribution of deputy posts. One is earmarked for an American. The second has up to now gone to India, and Latin America desperately wants the new one likely to be created.</p>

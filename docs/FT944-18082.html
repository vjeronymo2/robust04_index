			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Observer: Red not dead As and when the British Post Office is privatised, will the red pillar box be destined for the scrap heap? Doomsters fear the familiar piece of street corner furniture may go the way of telephone booths, which, following the sale of British Telecom, metamorphosed from sturdy red edifices to distinctly flimsier glass arrangements. They should take heart, though, from Bill Cockburn, the Post Office's chief executive, who claims there are no such terrible schemes afoot. To prove the point, he keeps a model of the Victorian post box in his office - a veritable beacon to his commitment to keep them red for e'er and a day.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Vickers Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers, may be forgiven for feeling depressed that the Kuwaiti tank order has gone to the US. Whatever the political shenanigans behind the decision, it highlights the risks of relying on the defence business. Vickers needs another order for its Challenger 2 tank in the next 18 months, and Kuwait was one of its best opportunities. Oman or Saudi Arabia may yet come up trumps, but no decisions will be made there until well into next year. The cash injection from an order would have come in handy. Rolls-Royce Motors has been sucking cash out of the business and gearing has risen uncomfortably, limiting Vickers' room for manoeuvre. If BMW were still interested in acquiring part or all of Rolls, it might feel the price has just fallen.</p>

The petition, which was submitted by ICI International, Inc. of Orlando, Florida ``ICI''), a Registered Importer of motor vehicles, requested NHTSA to determine that a 1971 Daimler Limousine DR 420 passenger car that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because it has safety features that comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, those standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 30570) that contained a thorough description of the petition, and solicited public comments upon it. One comment was received in response to this notice, from Jaguar Cars Inc. (``Jaguar''), the United States importer of new motor cars manufactured by Jaguar Cars Ltd., the manufacturer of the 1971 Daimler Limousine. Jaguar noted that Jaguar Cars Led. never produced a ``DR 420'' model Daimler Limousine, but that it did produce a model ``DS 420.'' ICI subsequently acknowledged that ``DS 420'' is the appropriate model designation for the vehicle that is the subject of its petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its comments, Jaguar expressed disagreement with ICI's claim that the 1971 Daimler Limousine DS 420, as originally manufactured, complies with Standard. Nos. 103 Defrosting and Defogging Systems, 104 Windshield Wiping and Washing Systems, 203 Impact Protection for the Driver From the Steering Control System and 205 Glazing Materials. Jaguar further asserted that the 1971 Daimler Limousine DS 420 cannot ``be easily modified'' to comply with Standard Nos. 108 Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment, 208 Occupant Crash Protection, 209 Seat Belt Assemblies, and 210 Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ICI was given an opportunity to respond to Jaguar's comments. In its response, ICI failed to supply sufficient information to establish that the 1971 Daimler Limousine DS 420 complies with Standard Nos. 103, 104, and 203, and can be easily modified to comply with Standard No. 210. NHTSA requested ICI to supply this information on six separate occasions from November 17, 1993 to January 24, 1994, but received no response to any of these requests. This has compelled NHTSA to conclude, from the state of the record, that it cannot determine that the 1971 Daimler Limousine DS 420 is eligible for importation. The petition must therefore be denied under 49 CFR 593.7(e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 108(c)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(C)(ii), and 49 CFR 593.7(e), NHTSA will not consider a new import eligibility petition covering this vehicle until at least three months from the date of this notice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(C)(ii); 49 CFR 593.7; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: March 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William A.

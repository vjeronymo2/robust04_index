			<p>BFN     [Text] Sydney, May 25 (AFP) -- Australian government  forecasts for rapid economic growth were thown into doubt  Wednesday as official data unexpectedly showed a slump in  business investment, analysts said.    Handing down his budget for the year to June 30, 1995,  Australian Treasurer Ralph Willis said on May 10 that a surge in  business investment -- forecast at 14.6 percent for 1994-95 --  was "crucial" to his forecasts of economic growth. But the  Australian Bureau of Statistics reported Wednesday that private  capital expenditure fell 5.4 percent in the three months to  March 31 to a seasonally adjusted 5.884 billion Australian  dollars (4.2 billion US). The median market forecast had been  for a rise of 5.0 percent.    "The government's whole economic strategy is based on very,  very poor foundations altogether," said Societe Generale  Australia's chief economist, Ivana Bottini.    "They recognised that the big weakness was business  investment and they did absolutely nothing to promote business  investment in the budget -- they assumed it would just magically  improve," she said.    In raw terms, the bureau predicted a six percent rise in  private sector capital spending in 1994-95 from the 1993-94  estimate of 27.452 billion dollars. That rise depended on  actual capital spending exceeding latest private sector  expectations by about 10 percent. This had occured during  1992-93 and was likely to happen in 1993-94, the bureau said.    "On the face of it, even the expectations data for 1994-95  appear likely to fall short of the rosy outlook in the budget  forecasts for a 14.5 percent increase in investment," said  Stephen Koukoulas, senior economist at Citibank Australia.    "These figures suggest that the budget forecasts for  business  investment are very optimistic."    Willis insisted his forecasts remained intact because actual  business investment in the next financial year would outstrip  private sector expectations by more than the bureau's forecasts.    "With economic conditions continuing to improve and with  general business confidence remaining extremely high," he said,  the difference between actual investment and business  expectations "can be expected to increase."    Bottini, however, said Australia would be doing well to  achieve a six percent rise in business investment 1994-95.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Leading Article: Prelude to recovery THE PRIME minister's troubles are not over, not by any means, but the worst may be behind him. The outlook for Mr John Major this spring is less gloomy than at any time since Black Wednesday. He may not regain all of his previous authority for a while, perhaps not ever, but his chances of survival are high. The evidence that he is out of the woods, or nearly so, is mounting. The UK economy is recovering. Mr Major cannot honestly claim the full credit for this. He opposed - indeed condemned out of hand - the policy change that made recovery possible. He failed to understand why it was impossible under the policy he did prefer. But he did have the wit to seize the opportunity given by sterling's abrupt and expensive exit from the ERM last September. If the prime minister was not particularly wise, he has at least proved to be lucky. Monetary easing has been so sharp that some sort of recovery was inevitable. Today the signs are everywhere: in the housing market, in retail sales, in industrial output and even in unemployment. The upsurge may well prove steeper than was supposed by most forecasters, including the Treasury, earlier this year. Luck cannot be relied upon, however, especially where British economic recoveries are concerned. Too many have ended in the same painful way, with excess consumption, balance of payments crises and rising inflation. The danger facing Mr Major is not that there will be no return to growth, but that it will not last. Export-led growth The British economy has the lowest underlying rate of inflation for close to a generation. But it also has close to the largest ever fiscal deficit in peacetime and a substantial current account deficit at the end of a deep recession. The government needs fast growth to provide a painless cure for the fiscal deficit, while such growth would exacerbate the external deficit. The way out must be export-led growth. But export-led growth means growth without soaring real wages. It means resisting excessive appreciation of sterling, if necessary by cutting interest rates again. It means closing the fiscal deficit aggressively. Above all, it means that this recovery must not end in a spurt of wage inflation. Does Mr Major have the mettle to achieve all this? On past form the answer is, once again, mixed. The bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty is past the most difficult portion of its passage through parliament. It may yet suffer a reverse, but that looks unlikely. This is a tribute to the prime minister's persistence. A long drawn-out and debilitating episode that threatened to split the Conservative party is drawing to a successful close. It may not have been magnificently managed, but it has been managed. To mark the moment, Mr Major has embarked on a series of speeches that promote the positive aspects of Britain's membership of the European Community. Little that he has said is likely to play well on the Continent, but the endeavour may contribute to an aura of renascent leadership at home. Challenges ahead The pits closure episode is another case in point. The initial announcement that 31 coal mines were to be shut down at once was an error of judgment, for which Mr Major as well as the industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, was rightly blamed. During the ensuing months it looked as if this might result in a wholesale retreat. In the event the government has saved most of its original strategy, albeit at a high cost in temporary subsidies. A trial of a similar nature is now about to be endured by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, as he wrestles with teachers who threaten to boycott tests of their pupils' performance under the national curriculum. Other possible setbacks lie ahead. Liberal Democrats are the current favourites to capture Newbury from the government in the forthcoming by-election. That would further shave the government's already unreliable majority in the Commons. If the Danes surprise everyone by voting No to Maastricht in the referendum on May 18 the UK cabinet is likely to be divided about what to do next. Meanwhile the government's agonising over Bosnia, while understandable, does not enhance its reputation. As to later in the year, the government is already in retreat from privatising the Post Office and equalising the pension age; rail privatisation may prove to be what one of its critics has called 'poll tax on wheels.' If the prime minister is to restore confidence in his ability to take difficult decisions he must first end the present uncertainty about who, if anyone, is to be reshuffled in his cabinet. Ministerial nervousness is contributing to a stultifying of the government's will to act. Mr Major has demonstrated his loyalty to his chancellor for long enough. The employment secretary has not been a success; the secretary for social security is not grasping any nettles. The foreign secretary should be kept in post as long as possible. Some cabinet ministers should go; some should be moved to new posts. A strong, reconstituted, and credible team is sorely needed.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Strong money supply figures fuel optimism CITY ECONOMISTS are optimistic that strong money supply figures to be published by the Bank of England today will point towards a revival in consumer demand. Weekly money supply statistics already released by the Bank suggest that M0, the narrow measure of money supply and a good guide to overall demand, grew by about 3 per cent in the year to November. This is the highest annual growth rate for any month this year and compares with growth of 2.4 per cent in the 12 months to October and 2.1 per cent in the year to September. Release of the M0 figure used to occur about two weeks after the end of the month in question. It has been brought forward to the end of the relevant month to coincide with publication of the Treasury's new monthly assessment of the economy. Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Greenwell Montagu, described the rise in the growth of narrow money as 'significant'. 'There has been this ceiling of 2.5 per cent which the M0 figure has not been able to break through so far this year,' he said. The news will provide a glimmer of hope on prospects for UK growth, but comes at a time when assessments of the economy remain predominantly gloomy. It will hearten Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who at the weekend urged home-owners and businesses to have confidence about the future. He said at a meeting of the Conservative Political Centre, a party discussion group, at Conservative Central Office in London: 'While economic conditions have been difficult, I now believe there are a number of reasons why confidence should grow.' He said cuts in interest rates, plus rises in real incomes combined with income tax reductions in the Budget meant that real take-home pay for someone on an average income with a typical mortgage had increased by Pounds 37 a week. Hotels, catering and business services will be among the first UK industries to feel the benefits of devaluation, a report says today. Cambridge Econometrics, the research group, says the devaluation of sterling, which is expected to average 15 per cent next year compared with this year's rates, will contribute to overall export growth of more than 6 per cent next year and in 1994. The report says industries relatively dependent on the US will benefit more quickly as economic growth in Europe slows down. Business services, 'already a competitive UK industry', will experience rapid growth in exports as national markets open up.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Austaralia's main market indicator closed this week at exactly the same figure as a week ago. 628 cents a kg. The offering was a small one, and only in the final week iof the selling season at the end of June will a more normal quantity of wool be sold. Dull conditions quite normally tend to spread from end-of-season auctions to the rest of the wool-using industry, especially as holidays and the approach of holidays have a similar influenece. The fact that the wool market has managed to maintain strength, with prices showing no significant setback since the Easter recess, has helped to strengthen sentiment about the longer term outlook. Business may be slow and competitive, but chances of buying more cheaply are sensed to be receding.</p>

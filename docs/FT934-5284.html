			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (2): Korea: a tale of two systems THE KOREAN ECONOMIES: A COMPARISON OF NORTH AND SOUTH by Eui-Gak Hwang Clarendon Press, Pounds 40 380 pages It is novel for a book about development economics to open with a dedication to 'the Lord Jesus Christ . . . foremost supporter, moral economist and political adviser in my life', but that is how Eui-Gak Hwang introduces his study of North and South Korea. Hwang, professor of economics at the Korea University in Seoul, goes on to top each chapter with either a Biblical text or a piece of oriental poetry. The reader thus starts to speculate exactly which Biblical extract will come up next, for example to set the tone for a chapter on Public Finance in North and South Korea; the answer, appropriately enough, is Isaiah's prophetic roaring that claims must be supported by evidence. In the conclusion, Biblical reference also comes in handy to duck a judgment on the likely pace of Korea's surely inevitable reunification process. Here, the author cites Proverbs: 'In his heart a man plans his course, but the Lord determines his steps.' Most of this unusual book is devoted to a painstaking assembly of parallel data about the two Koreas. Hwang goes to great lengths to try to render comparisons between the two meaningful, which is no easy task given the secretive nature of the North Korean authorities and the problem of interpreting that data which does exist, especially with regard to exchange rates. His underlying purpose, however, appears to be to do his bit for the reunification debate, by adding to our understanding of the historical relationship between the economies of north and south and their potential complementarity in the future. Hwang has worked in Germany and thought about the problems of bringing together the unruly offspring of communism and post-colonial capitalism. The historical picture presented does not conform to the western caricature whereby after a period of domination by Japan, the second world war bestowed upon South Korea American patronage, market capitalism and prosperity, while the north chose autarkic Marxist-Leninism, leading to economic collapse and poverty. Prior to the division of the country in 1945, Korea south of the 38th parallel was the poorer, more agricultural part of the peninsula. The north had the minerals and most of the heavy industry. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Hwang supports the view that the communist northern economy grew more rapidly than the south's, where a combination of political confusion and natural disadvantage impeded progress. Although it is clear that the south recovered from these setbacks and became in the 1980s one of the outstanding economic performers in the world, it was not until at least the mid-1970s and possibly not until the 1980s that the south actually overtook the north in terms of per capita GNP. During the 1980s, in spite of a Deng Xiao-Ping inspired 'opening up', economic data from the north became ever scarcer, contributing to the impression that successive plans were failing to hit their loudly proclaimed targets. But even in the 1980s, when Hwang argues the central planning system failed to deal with the growing complexities of the northern economy, his figures suggest annual growth in the north never fell below 1.7 per cent in local currency terms, exceeding 12 per cent in 1982 and 1983. In the 1980s, however, the south streaked ahead; by 1989 the south's dollar gnp per capita was double that of the north. By some measures, it is now four or five times that of its neighbour. Even this, Hwang implies, should not be taken crudely as a triumph of one system over the other. Although he acknowledges the inestimable value of greater personal freedom in the south and the more widespread availability of consumer choice, he notes disapprovingly the wider gap between rich and poor in South Korea and adds that 'other indicators, such as life expectancy, mortality, literacy, and other physical quality-of-life indexes, merely serve to indicate that there exists no significant difference between the north and the south.' Not for this author much regard for the regular current rumours of food riots and impending political collapse. Hwang thus implies that North Korea's future might be better foreseen in comparison with that of China or even with other politically authoritarian, free traders in the region, than with post-glasnost Russia or Albania. The north may have a totalitarian system, dominated for half a century by the unpredictable Kim Il Sung, but it has dabbled with capitalism, through joint ventures, especially with Japan. North Korea, the author says, has an economy which is 'on a road to quasi-market principles at least.' Some will think this altogether too optimistic and even Hwang says that the cultural re-harmonisation of the two Koreas will present serious difficulties, especially given the rapid widening of the economic gap in recent years. Given North Korea's recent high-risk manoeuvres on its nuclear weapons programme, the politics as well as the economics appear to point to measured rather than sudden progress in the drama of re-unification.</p>

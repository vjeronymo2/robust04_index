			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / O&amp;Y seeks court protection: Asks for insolvency law refuge from creditors OLYMPIA &amp; YORK Develop-ments, the world's biggest property developer, which has debts of Dollars 12bn (Pounds 6.7bn), last night applied to an Ontario court for protection from its creditors under Canadian insolvency laws. Lawyers for O&amp;Y and its bank lenders appeared before a judge in Toronto after working hours. O&amp;Y, owner of Canary Wharf, the Pounds 3bn office development in London's Docklands, is the biggest company ever to make an insolvency filing. The move, which seems likely to be followed by similar action in the US, will send tremors through the North American and UK commercial property markets, which are already in the grip of a severe recession. Mr John Major was informed earlier this week that a protection request was likely, as were the Canadian government, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada. A decision on whether to place Canary Wharf into administration under UK insolvency legislation is expected to be taken in the next few days. The move to apply for protection was made under Canada's Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act to prevent groups of creditors from seizing assets. Certain US subsidiaries were also expected to file under Chapter 11 legislation for protection for a limited number of properties in the US. The insolvency filing marks the end of two months of frantic attempts by O&amp;Y and its bankers to restructure debt without the help of court protection. Mr Paul Reichmann, the company's publicity-shy founder, has desperately tried to avoid the embarrassment of such an admission of his difficulties. O&amp;Y made the filing with the support of its main bank creditors, led by Citicorp of the US, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, in order to organise an orderly reconstruction of its business. The aim is to emerge from the protection of the courts as a going concern after several months. O&amp;Y will try to keep Canary Wharf out of administration for as long as it can. However, one banker said earlier in the day that, if the parent company went for CCAA protection, the 11 bank lenders to Canary Wharf - the showpiece of government attempts to redevelop Docklands - may go for administration. A decision is likely in the next few days. This will depend largely on whether the UK government takes office space at Canary Wharf for thousands of civil servants at a commercially acceptable rate. Mr Reichmann seems likely to remain in charge of the business. He will continue to work with Mr Steve Miller, the partner of investment bank James D. Wolfensohn who has been leading the negotiations with O&amp;Y's 100 banks. O&amp;Y's bank creditors face big losses on the Dollars 12bn they have lent to the company. However, bankers said they would have been forced to recognise these losses even if the company had not made an insolvency filing. O&amp;Y hopes that the Canadian and US courts will give it protection from the demands of creditors for up to a year. During that period, it will continue talks with banks on a plan to defer principal payments on the Dollars 12bn of debt for five years and pay interest on Dollars 4bn in the form of new shares. Bankers decided that O&amp;Y should seek the protection of the courts because four different groups of creditors were threatening to seize assets and upset the process of restructuring the debt. If these creditors had attempted to obtain control of assets in an unco-ordinated way, other lenders to the company might have suffered, O&amp;Y and its bankers felt. The latest blow to O&amp;Y's attempts to keep creditors at bay was a ruling yesterday in the UK High Court that Dollars 240m owed to the US investment bank Morgan Stanley was payable immediately. The debt relates to a deal made in 1990 by which O&amp;Y purchased a long leasehold on Morgan's offices at Canary Wharf. Although the agreement was between Morgan and one of O&amp;Y's UK subsidiaries, called Rochmoor, the liability falls on the parent in Canada. O&amp;Y will make a decision before Wednesday about whether to appeal. O&amp;Y's Canadian operations also face demands for an immediate payment of CDollars 17m (Pounds 8m) in interest from holders of CDollars 325m of bonds. The bondholders yesterday threatened to seize rents payable to O&amp;Y by occupants of a Toronto office block, First Canadian Place. Meanwhile, a syndicate of eight banks led by JP Morgan, the US commercial bank, is foreclosing on a Dollars 160m loan secured on a New York property. Finally, O&amp;Y has still to resolve the problem of how to redeem hundreds of millions of dollars in commercial paper, a form of short-term debt securities, which are secured against Toronto's Exchange Tower. O&amp;Y had been hoping that the Canadian government would provide a bridging loan to facilitate the sale of the tower and repay the commercial paper holders. O&amp;Y's financial crisis was precipitated in March when holders of Dollars 800m of its commercial paper demanded immediate repayment. Although O&amp;Y believes its assets have a net value of around Dollars 5bn, it has run out of cash to meet short-term payments.

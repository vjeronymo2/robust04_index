			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Castro urges Cubans to resist pressure by US President Fidel Castro has asked Cubans to continue defying economic pressures from the US and to be 'ready to go to the grave' defending the revolution which he led 35 years ago, writes Canute James in Kingston, Jamaica. Speaking on the anniversary of the revolution at the weekend, he said Cuba had achieved a feat in 'resisting the imperial power'. The island's mounting economic problems have led the government to implement a series of changes, including self-employment in some sectors, an increase in the number of private and co-operative farms, and the free use of foreign currency.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Briton appointed BIS chief: Bank of England man sees strong role for Basle in Europe MR ANDREW Crockett, appointed yesterday as general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, said the BIS would probably intensify its research efforts on the problems associated with financial derivative instruments and on eastern European monetary issues. Mr Crockett, executive director of the Bank of England with responsibility for international affairs, expects to succeed Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy on January 1. Mr Lamfalussy is to become president of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) in Frankfurt, the precursor of a European central bank. Speaking at a press conference following the monthly BIS governors' meeting in Basle, Mr Crockett said he foresaw no diminution of the BIS's activity once the EMI began to operate. The BIS operates officially as a central bank for 33 central banks, holding on average 10 per cent of their reserves. But its significant roles are as a centre for research on financial trends and issues and as a forum for central bankers to discuss them. 'I would see the creation of the EMI as an opportunity for the BIS to refocus its activities on the global context,' he said. He cited commercial banks' capital adequacy, the very rapid expansion of derivative products and problems arising from the rapid evolution of payment settlement systems. 'There is no doubt that derivatives is a subject that has attracted a lot of attention. It would not surprise me if we refocus our activities to devote more resources to that. My concern is to make sure that the staffing and analysis and statistical research is adequate for the governors' needs.' Mr Crockett also signalled a greater effort by the BIS to serve its many eastern European central bank members. 'I think there is an important role for the BIS in serving the needs and interests of these countries as they emerge towards integration with the rest of Europe.' He acknowledged that many western European central banks could well reduce their deposits at the BIS as European monetary union progressed. 'Obviously, once European economies reach stage three, they will not have the same need to hold reserves, some of which they deposit at the BIS. So it is not unreasonable to expect their deposits with the BIS to diminish.' Mr Crockett made clear that he fully supported the process of European monetary union. 'I have been associated in the past four-and-a-half years with a lot of activity, including Maastricht. 'I am very committed myself to the work that has gone on in Europe. 'I believe in the process of monetary integration, but of course, that has to take place in a realistic context and taking account of the realities,' Mr Crockett said.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Warburg highlights exposure - Implementation of derivative accounting rules SG Warburg yesterday became the latest in a series of British banks to highlight exposure to derivatives under pressure from European law and industry guidelines enacted at the end of last year. Derivatives are the financial instruments such as swaps, futures and options whose value is 'derived' from more conventional financial assets. Their presence and treatment in accounts has come under growing scrutiny in the last few months, particularly in the light of the hundreds of millions of dollars lost by such blue chip companies as Proctor &amp; Gamble and Metallgesellschaft. But accountants and other readers of accounts warn that the new disclosure requirements now in place for banks still only provide very little information, and that this data needs to be interpreted with great care. Warburg's accounts for the year to March 31 1994 contain a number of changes to the format of the profit and loss account and balance sheet and accompanying notes, as well as an 'operating and financial review' designed to describe the company's performance and strategy in text. 'This is a more transparent document,' says Mr Simon Leathes, Warburg's group finance director. 'As time moved on we felt it was appropriate to give people who read our accounts more information.' No new disclosure is more significant than note 30, which shows for the first time Warburg's 'forward and futures contracts' divided between three categories: exchange rate contracts, interest rate contracts and equity contracts. Three numbers are provided under each heading: contract or underlying principal: a notional value for the gross volume of outstanding derivatives business at the balance sheet date. replacement cost: the cost to the bank if counterparties to the derivative contracts fail to meet their obligations. The cost is calculated by aggregating those contracts with a positive value when 'marked to market' at current prices. credit risk weighted amount: a Bank of England formula to give an indication of the credit risk of the contracts. The categories used and the level of disclosure provided are similar to those adopted in the latest accounts produced by banks such as Barclays, Kleinwort Benson and Schroders. The reason for the additional disclosures dates back to the introduction of the EU fourth company law directive, which lays down reporting requirements but specifically excluded banks and insurance companies as special cases needing separate rules. In the UK, these EU rules for banks were incorporated in Schedule 9 of the UK Companies Act - generally known as the 'bank accounts directive' - and came into force for companies with year-ends after December 22 last year. It included references to derivatives. Far more detailed advice has been provided in an accompanying 'Sorp' - statement of recommended practice - produced by the British Bankers' Association. While not mandatory, it represents best practice which banks would be loathe to ignore. However, the level of disclosure still provides an imperfect picture. 'It is very hard to give information that really reflects the risks involved,' says Mr Leathes. 'It is very hard to know how to do so without misleading people unless you have a detailed knowledge of how firms with big numbers are managing their risk. The whole thing could boil down to very little.' Mr John Tattersall, a banking partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, says warily that readers could try to compare the replacement cost of contracts against the balance sheet total, or the credit risk value against the banks' more conventional exposures such as customer loans. His waryness is shared by Mr Chris Taylor, a partner in the capital markets group of accountants Price Waterhouse. 'I'm not sure it's terribly sensible to compare anything. This is very crude measure with very raw data. He warns that the exchange, interest and equity contract categories are still enormously broad. He adds that while the figures provide an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty in a transaction, they do not assess the market risk. Mr Taylor says that draft proposals from the US Financial Accounting Standards Board, issued in April, would disclose the average, maximum and minimum market value of contracts during the financial reporting period.</p>

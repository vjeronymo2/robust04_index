			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben and 'Aqiva Eldar] </F>   [Excerpts] In the past few weeks, a state body subject to  the Prime Minister's Office presented Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin with a plan for a peace arrangement with Syria. The paper  was drafted in parallel with similar work done by the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] and the Foreign Ministry.    The plan, drafted at the initiative of that body's research  department, assumes that, in the framework of the agreement,  there will be a total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights  and that the negotiations with Syria will focus on security  arrangements and stages of normalization and withdrawal.    The authors of the document propose a staged withdrawal over  a period of more than 10 years, during which the IDF will  maintain its military presence on the Golan. They believe that  future peace relations between Israel and Syria will be similar  to those existing between Israel and Egypt -- perhaps even  cooler.    The team that drafted the document on the arrangement with  Syria prepared a proposal four months ago on an arrangement with  the Palestinians. That paper determined that the preferable  solution for Israel is the establishment of a  Jordanian-Palestinian confederation.    Of the three staff works prepared in anticipation of the  resumption of the negotiations with Syria, only the one prepared  by Major General Ilan Biran was done by order of the prime  minister and followed his guidance regarding the principles of  the arrangement. Biran's paper speaks of a withdrawal on the  Golan Heights, but not a full one. The Foreign Ministry and the  state body, which assumed that a full withdrawal will be carried  out, based their work on their own assumptions. [passage  omitted]    As U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the  Middle East approaches, Israeli sources in Washington have  reported that Israel will not relay detailed plans on peace  arrangements and a withdrawal to Syria through the United  States. The prime minister will again ask the secretary of  state to propose to Syria to begin a practical discussion of the  security arrangements, but it is not clear whether al-Asad will  accept this proposal and waive his demand that Israel pledge a  full withdrawal in advance.</p>

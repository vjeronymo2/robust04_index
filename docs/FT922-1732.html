			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Golf: A superstar signs in WHEN Phil Mickelson turned professional rec- ently, he did so to a roll of drums and a fanfare of trumpets. Not since Jack Nicklaus was a fat, crew cut teenager with a high pitched voice has a young amateur excited the world of golf like Mickelson. It is not just because he is left handed, good looking in an aw-shucks sort of way and inordinately polite. He refers to Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer as Mr Nicklaus and Mr Palmer. Nor is it that every manufacturer of golf equipment has been after him to sign a contract to use their clubs and every agent has tried to lure him into their stable. It is that on known form he is the most exciting amateur to join the paid ranks since Ben Crenshaw 20 years ago. There is even a suggestion that he is as good as Nicklaus was when he turned pro 30 years ago. But Nicklaus did not become an instant millionaire the moment he signed as a pro. Mickelson did. He has signed a contract to play Yonex clubs for which he is reported to receive a annual salary of Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 294,117) and annual incentive bonuses of the same amount again. This is in addition to a signing bonus of Dollars 1m (Pounds 590,000). He was 22 last Tuesday. Some birthday present. Mickelson began hitting shots when he was 1 1/2 years old. At five he played his first round, accompanying his father. He was so keen he ran between shots. A natural right hander, Mickelson plays golf the other way around because of the way he was taught. He would stand facing his father and copy exactly what his father did. Last Wednesday Mickelson sat at a dais, three feet above his questioners, in a room at the US Open. At his feet were America's golf writers. The symbolism was hard to avoid. 'I have seen the future and I'm frightened,' said one reporter after hearing Mickelson speak. There was none of the cockiness that Nicklaus had at the same age, nor, for that matter, much of the tongue-tied, golly-gosh syndrome that other young men demonstrate. Instead, we watched and listened to a young man who has been guided every step of the way these past few years by a coterie of advisers who include Dean Reinmuth, his golf teacher, Steve Loy, the Arizona State University golf coach, and sports psychologist Bob Rotella. He was nervous all right but that's no bad thing. At least he was gracious. In my memory some players are filed under a section marked memorable stroke or incident. Seve Ballesteros's bunker shot with a three-wood during the 1983 Ryder Cup is one such stroke. The sight of Nicklaus conceding that putt to Tony Jacklin in the 1969 Ryder Cup is another. Mickelson playing a chip to the 15th green during the Walker Cup at Portmarnock last summer is a third. The hole is praised and feared for its beauty and difficulty. To the right of the green, no more than two yards from the edge of the putting surface, is the beach. The green is elevated. The flag was in the middle of the green. Mickelson's ball had rolled off the putting surface and dribbled down the bank. He needed to loft the ball 12 or 15 feet in the air to get it up the bank and drop it as softly as he could so that it would stop near the flag. Most other golfers in such a position would have chipped their ball with a straight-faced club, trundling it up the bank. Mickelson thought differently. The moment he pulled a sand wedge out of his bag a frisson of excitement went around the spectators. He was going to flop it onto the green. Peter Alliss was commentating and remembers thinking that such a shot could not be played. 'He's an idiot to try it' Alliss thought. Alliss and the rest of us were confounded when Mickelson's soft swing seemed to do little more than caress the ball. It inscribed a gentle parabola pitched by the flag and halted two feet further on. Having the nerve to consider such a shot was one thing; being able to bring it off quite another. It was clear then that we were watching a man of extraordinary talent. 'No one else in the world could have played that shot' said Jim Gabrielson, the US team captain. 'No one.' As they say in soccer circles, Mickelson now 'has it all to do.' Many young men have turned pro after dazzling amateur careers, one of the most recent being Scott Verplank who won one tournament on the pro tour while he was still an amateur - as did Mickelson. Whether Mickelson, who hit 68 to lie third after the first round of the US Open on Thursday, can succeed where they failed remains to be seen. 'Pressure is something exterior' he said once. 'It's what the media put on you, what other people say. A ten-foot putt is a ten-foot putt whether it's for Dollars 100 or Dollars 1. Pressure is something that shouldn't affect you inside.' Brave, bold words. One hopes they do not come back to haunt this likeable young man. Golf needs him.</p>

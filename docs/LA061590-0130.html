			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROTHERS WERE NOT PLANNING AN ESCAPE;  </P> <P> MENENDEZ CASE: SHERIFF'S OFFICIAL SAYS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE MURDER  SUSPECTS WERE SEEKING TO FLEE JAIL.  </P> <P> There is no evidence that either Lyle or Erik Menendez, accused of murdering  their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion, was planning an escape from the  Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail, a Sheriff's Department official told The  Times on Thursday.  </P> <P> Lt. William Sieber, head of the sheriff's fugitive warrant escape detail, said  investigators "are unable to validate with any accuracy or certainty that  either of these two gentlemen played a part in the tampering with the chains  which were used to secure them."  </P> <P> After a daylong hearing in Santa Monica Superior Court last Friday, a Sheriff's  Department spokesman told the news media that two links in a chain binding Lyle  Menendez's ankles had been filed almost through.  </P> <P> In addition, authorities recovered notes from the brothers' cells possibly  indicating an escape attempt, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Both the chains and the notes were sent to the sheriff's crime lab for  analysis.  </P> <P> "In our professional opinion, the chains were not cut by either of the Menendez  brothers," Sieber said Thursday.  </P> <P> He also said that the notes and diagrams recovered from the brothers' cells  were of a building that could not be identified, adding that he could not  conclude that the notes had anything to do with an escape attempt.  </P> <P> A sheriff's source who requested anonymity said Thursday that the department  should have conducted "a more thorough investigation" before releasing details  of the alleged escape attempt to the news media.  </P> <P> Lyle Menedez, 22, and his brother Erik, 19, are charged with the Aug. 20  murders of their parents, entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his wife,  Kitty.  </P> <P> The brothers, arrested in March, are being held in County Jail while awaiting a  preliminary hearing in the highly publicized case.  </P> <P> They had been held in a high-security area of the jail near each other, but  they were moved farther apart Friday night so they could not communicate while  the investigation into the alleged escape attempt continued.  </P> <P> Neither brother would answer deputies' questions about a possible escape  attempt when they were returned to their cells Friday night, officials said.  </P> <P> Sieber said the question of how the two links in Lyle Menendez's chain had been  cut remained unanswered, and that the matter was still under investigation.  </P> <P> Approximately six notes, handwritten in pencil on yellow legal-size tablets,  were foiund in the brothers' cells, Sieber said. He said the notes referred to  "moving from the U.S. to Europe."  </P> <P> But investigators could not conclude that the notes had anything to do with an  imminent escape attempt, the lieutenant added.  </P> <P> One of the pieces of paper confiscated by a deputy had a drawing on it,  according to a member of the Menendez family.  </P> <P> Sieber confirmed this and said the drawing, complete with notations of  stairwells, was of a building that could not be identified.  </P> <P> A relative speculated that Lyle Menendez had been designing a new restaurant  that he wanted to purchase. He had bought a restaurant last February in  downtown Princeton, N.J., where he had lived and attended college. He had been  considering developing a chain of franchises.  </P> <P> Sieber said both the district attorney's office and the court would be notified  of the sheriff's findings. He added that no new charges would be sought against  the brothers.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Resolution issued by Fourth Session of Ninth National </F> Assembly]    [Text] In 1993 our economy continued to improve. All major  economic targets were reached or overfulfilled. In an important  step, the socioeconomic situation was put under control.  Political stabilization was maintained. Our external relations  were broadened. Vietnam's reputation in the world was  heightened. The achievements recorded in 1993 and previous  years created a momentum for the country to develop in the  following years.    However, our economy still has many weaknesses. Many urgent  cultural and social issues have not been solved in an efficient  manner. The evil practices of waste, corruption, and smuggling  is still prevalent. Order and discipline in economic and social  management are still not firm enough.    Based on that situation and the new requirements, the  National Assembly resolves that the main duties and targets for  1994 will be as follows:    1. Orientations and Duties for 1994 and Following Years: We  must strengthen all recorded achievements, carry out the first  step of industrialization and modernization, and grasp  opportunities to accelerate our economic development rate in  order to move our country on to a new developing stage. At the  same time, we must make important cultural and social changes,  intensify the fight against corruption and smuggling, maintain  political stabilization, broaden external relations, and protect  our national independence, sovereignty, and integrity.    2. Main Targets in 1994: General domestic production will  increase by eight percent. General industrial output and  agricultural production will increase by 11 percent and four  percent respectively. Food production will be 25 million tons.  Exports will increase by 20 percent. The inflation rate must  be below 10 percent. The rate of population growth must be  lowered by 0.06 percent.    The National Assembly Resolution outlines the major duties  and measures to be executed in 1994:    1. The Economy:    A. Agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture must be  comprehensively developed together with the development of their  respective processing industries. All production, business, and  service activities must be accelerated in a diversified manner  in cities and rural areas.    In 1994 we must carry out the granting of land as regulated  by the law. External economic activities must be intensified,  especially the export sector. We have to replace imported  products with those that can be produced locally; we have to  limit the import of nonessential goods, and efficiently protect  local production. We must restore, upgrade, and construct our  material and social infrastructure and selectively build some  heavy industrial establishments in key sectors.    B. We must practice thrift in production and consumption to  save money for development investment and improve the  productivity, quality, and efficiency of our business and  production. We have to increase our accumulated savings for  future investment and promulgate, amend, or supplement  mechanisms for efficient mobilization and use of capital  resources. We must quickly and satisfactorily provide funds  from the state budget for the implementation of approved  planning and reform the infrastructure management to prevent  negativism and waste.    We must fully exploit all our saving capacity for  development  investment in all economic sectors. In macro-management, we  have to create favorable legal conditions to enable people to  invest their money in business and eliminate administrative red  tape and embarrassing actions which may discourage investors.    We must implement policies to strongly encourage foreign  investment and set up mechanisms that clearly define  responsibility regarding foreign loan applications and  repayment, ensure good use of foreign loans, and avoid heavy  debts for subsequent years.    We must immediately form economic courts according to the  stipulations of the revised and amended Law on the Organization  of People's Courts and issue relating legal documents --  especially legal documents dealing with the implementation of  the Law on Business Bankruptcy and the Regulation on Court  Procedures of Economic Cases -- to ensure the early operation of  economic courts.    C. We must continue to reform the national financial policy  and banking system and set up and develop a capital market and  share holding companies, gradually introducing shares, credit  notes, and bonds to create the requisite basis for the  establishment of stock markets to meet the increasing demand for  the movement of capital and use of the economy. We have to  amend and supplement mechanisms and policies to ensure strict  implementation of the guidelines on practicing thrift in  government offices, army, public security forces, mass  organizations, and business enterprises for more development  investment.    D. We must continue to strengthen and build efficient  state-run economic units in key areas and sectors so that they  can shoulder their leading role in the national economy. We  have to strengthen and improve the state trading sector and  firmly control the import- export of necessary materials. We  also have to firmly hold the wholesale service and maintain a  necessary part in the retail service so that the state trading  service can work together with other economic sectors to  accelerate production development and protect the benefits of  the producers and consumers.    We must fundamentally reform the organization and management  mechanism of state-run economic enterprises and introduce a  shareholding system for suitable businesses to attract more  capital resources and create more of a driving force to prevent  negativism and improve business operations. We will gradually  apply firm steps to share business profits according to basic  salaries and sell a percentage of shares with concessional  conditions to officers and workers working directly at the state  enterprises. We will sell shares and bonds of some state-run  enterprises to other economic sectors and to the public on a  experimental basis. We must perfect all contractual forms used  in state enterprises.    On the basis of equitization, it is necessary to organize  administrative councils and adopt other suitable organizational  forms to effectively manage the production and business  activities of enteprises.

E.

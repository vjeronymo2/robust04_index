			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Lloyd's warned of further legal action LEADERS OF Lloyd's Names yes-terday warned of escalating legal action after its governing council rejected a bail-out scheme to help Names hardest hit by recent losses. A minority of Lloyd's Names - individuals whose assets back the insurance market - will bear the brunt of Lloyd's estimated Pounds 2bn 1989 losses to be announced next week. The bail-out scheme was rejected because of commercial and legal problems. Instead, help will be limited to a possible improvement of the 'hardship' relief offered to Names faced with bankruptcy. Mr Tom Benyon, chairman of the Society of Names, a group representing members in difficulty, said Lloyd's 'faced death by a thousand writs'. Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations working party, which represents a number of Names' action groups, said: 'It's a tragedy. They have missed a major opportunity and face mounting chaos.' Many Names allege that negligence by professionals in the market is responsible for their losses. More than 2,000 have taken action. Mr Mark Farrer, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents more than 9,000 Names, said he was 'disappointed' but accepted that there was a 'significant lack of support' among more successful Names for a bail-out.

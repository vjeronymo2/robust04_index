Historic changes have taken place in China's economy since  its opening to the outside world. The country now ranks 11th in  the world, making up two percent of the world's total trade  volume. But 15 year ago it followed 31 other countries,  accounting for no more than one percent of the world's total  trade volume.    China's imports and exports hit 195.8 billion U.S. Dollars  last year, five times over the 1978 figure. They now occupy  about one-third of the country's gross national product (GNP)  and one-fifth of the country's GNP comes from its exports.    To standardize its trade regulations in line with  international practice, China has sped up foreign trade reforms.    Now licence is required on only 138 varieties of commodities  before they can be exported, 52 percent less than the figure for  1978. At present all but 16 varieties of special exports can be  freely exported.    As for imports, China has lowered its import tariffs twice  following its elimination of the import adjustment tax. The  tariff rate is now 7.3 percent lower than that of 1978.    China is also learning from foreign countries' experience in  economic, financial and business management. A shareholding  system is being established in its state-run enterprises. A  financial system in the framework of the central bank,  specialized banks and commercial banks is also being built in  the country. Price reforms are continued for the establishment  of a unified and open market system.    The unified exchange rate system China has adopted since  January this year is helping the country to achieve even more in  its opening-up to the outside world.    China has made itself an ideal place for foreign investment  through opening up its huge potential market and implementing  international practices.    China has so far drawn foreign investment from more than 100  countries and regions. Six percent of the country's total  industrial output value comes from its foreign-venture  enterprises, and their imports and exports make up more than  one-quarter of the country's total imports and exports.    By the end of 1993, 167,500 foreign investment enterprises  had registered for operation in China. Moreover, foreign  investment now ranges from finance, real estate and insurance to  retail sales, foreign trade and business information services.    China has encouraged its enterprises to compete with foreign  enterprises overseas. Some Chinese enterprises have set up  branch ventures in foreign countries, bought foreign  enterprises, partaken of shareholding in foreign enterprises and  issued stocks abroad.    By June 1993, China had set up 4,453 enterprises with a  total  investment of more than five billion U.S. dollars in other  countries and regions. Meanwhile, contract labor service  cooperation has been expanded to more than 160 countries and  regions.    So far, China has opened to the outside world a total of  500,000 square kilometers of its area, including 339 cities and  counties with a total population of 320 million.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Overseas activities hold Meggitt downturn at 2% MEGGITT, the specialist engineering group, yesterday reported profits down only 2 per cent as a result of resilience in its overseas markets. The pre-tax line for the 1991 year fell from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 23.5m on sales down less than 1 per cent at Pounds 301.9m. Earnings per share fell from 9.4p to 8.6p, reflecting what Mr Ken Coates, chairman, said was 'a remarkable performance' for the industry. The company is to pay a final dividend of 2.4p, giving a total of 3.6p - up 5.6 per cent for the year. The largest controls division was strongly supported by sales in Germany and to a lesser extent in France but was hit by recession in the UK. Mr Coates said several UK companies had seen an improvement in orders in recent months. Profits rose 10 per cent to Pounds 7.4m. In aerospace, where profits rose 15 per cent, the group continued to develop civil markets and benefited only briefly from Gulf war-related spending. The smaller electronics and energy divisions increased profits by 14 per cent and 21 per cent respectively, although the latter reported delays in capital spending in the second half. Meggitt also cut Pounds 25m out of working capital during the year, reducing gearing from 59 per cent to 26 per cent before the Pounds 39m rights issue last September. At the year-end it had Pounds 22m cash on deposit. Mr Coates said the group had 'taken advantage of the recession to do all the things you need to do in a business that has grown very quickly'. The group also provided within minority interests for a redemption premium - the additional cost to the company should preference share holders redeem their shares. This was in line with a new accounting directive on convertible bonds issued by the Urgent Issue Task Force of the Accounting Standards Board. COMMENT Meggitt has about it the air of a company preparing the market for a rights issue-financed acquisition. Opportunities have not been as good for quite a while, we are led to believe. There is, however, a case for caution and not only because Meggitt so nearly got its fingers burned before it walked away from its 1990 bid for USH. Operationally, the controls division will be unable to rely so heavily on Germany or France where growth is slowing and signs of recovery in the UK that Mr Coates refers to are still little more than faint stirrings. Likewise aerospace, the other key division, is in for a rough couple of years with aircraft orders falling globally. Brokers are looking for pre-tax profits this year, including the benefits of the recent acquisition of Endevco, the US sensors company, of Pounds 25.8m, giving a prospective multiple of 11.</p>

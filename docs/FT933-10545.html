			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / City University raises Pounds 20m from technology arm buy-out LONDON'S City University yesterday sold a subsidiary company to its staff for Pounds 27m, in an unprecedented deal for a British university. The university, which has an annual turnover of about Pounds 50m, will realise Pounds 20.25m from the deal, which will be spent on capital projects and on a long-term endowment for academic initiatives. The remaining funds raised will be split between the original inventors of the company's products. City Technology, the company which has been sold, makes environmental monitoring equipment, and has benefited heavily from the passing of 'green' legislation such as the Clean Air Act in the US. The company was started in 1977 to work on a project with the National Coal Board, but most of its business now comes from the US and Germany. In the year to June 1992 it made a profit of Pounds 3.8m, all of which accrued to the university, on a turnover of Pounds 11m. It has won two Queen's Awards for technology and two for export achievement. Its main products are electro-chemical gas sensors, used to monitor toxic emissions from factories, and as safety devices by workers in enclosed spaces such as mines and sewers. The company moved to Portsmouth in 1990, and now has a workforce of about 140. 3i, the venture capital group, led the equity syndicate which underwrote the buy-out in conjunction with CINVen, Montagu Private Equity and Prudential. The university, which was advised by Kleinwort Benson, accepted the management offer ahead of several lower bids from the US. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said many universities had established scientific and technical subsidiary companies to boost income, but none had previously been sold. It said further similar initiatives were possible although it was unlikely that any other university would be able to raise money on such a scale.</p>

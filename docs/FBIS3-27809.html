Declaring that ideology can never be bound in chain, the  analyst says:    Some time ago, the puppet Kwangju District Court passed  prison terms on five students of Chonnam National University who  had studied the chuche idea.    Kim Yong-sam, who ruthlessly tramples upon the freedom of  the  choice of ideology and quest of truth, while advertising  "civilian politics," is a political hooligan and tyrant not  different in the least from the preceding military dictators.    His group is trying to keep off the attraction of the great  chuche idea and incite North-South confrontation, resorting to  bayonet. But it is a foolish act.    The more frantic Kim Yong-sam gets in brandishing the  bayonet, the stronger the resistance of the people will grow and  the clearer it will reveal to the world its ignorance and  incompetency as a ruler without a philosophy worthy of being  followed by the people.    The puppets must guarantee the people the freedom of choice  of ideology and the quest of truth and release the illegally  arrested students.</p>

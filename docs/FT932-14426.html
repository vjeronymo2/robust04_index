			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Observer: Dream time Things must be looking up at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the worldwide advertising giant. The Saatchi Brothers are starting to generate Big Ideas again. Maurice Saatchi, who once toyed with the idea of buying Midland Bank for Pounds 3bn, appears to be getting itchy fingers once more. Ivan Fallon, the Saatchis'J well-connected biographer, reported in yesterday's Sunday Times that Maurice wants to buy Express Newspapers, the two national flagships in Lord Stevens' United Newspapers empire. A price of around Pounds 200m has been mooted but this is a fraction of what they are worth and there is no sign of any backers. It sounds like this might have been one of those rather long cocktail conversations that got out of hand. Lord Stevens has chatted with Maurice but is still not sure whether he was joking or not. Could this be a smokescreen while Sir Nicholas and Lady Lloyd, the husband and wife team editing the Daily and Sunday Express, dream up their rumoured management buy-out?</p>

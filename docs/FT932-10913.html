			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Diesel unit helps Metra recovery METRA, the Finnish industrial conglomerate, returned to the black in the year to February, helped by a strong performance from the diesel engine division, restructuring and a weaker markka. Profit after financial items amounted to FM43m (Dollars 7.94m), compared with a FM203m deficit previously. The dividend is being held at FM2 per share. Sales rose 7 per cent to FM10.5bn, with the biggest improvement coming from Wartsila Diesel, where sales grew to FM5.1bn from FM3.3bn. The group has benefited from a strong increase in power plant sales, and in particular from the popularity of plants with a multi-fuel burning capability. It is the world's leading supplier of diesel power plants of more than 1Mw, with a 20 per cent market share, but it has also maintained a strong presence in the marine engine market despite a lower level of world shipbuilding orders. Wartsila Diesel lifted operating profits to FM285m from FM177m, as the unit's order intake climbed to FM3.5bn from FM1.7bn. Metra said it had benefited from its reduced exposure to the depressed Finnish construction market following last year's disposal of its building materials activities. It retains a small involvement in this sector via associate companies. A further improvement is expected in the group's performance this year, with sales predicted to reach FM10bn in the months from March to December 1993.</p>

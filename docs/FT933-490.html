			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Leading senator to stand down SENATOR Donald Riegle of Michigan, chairman of the Senate banking committee, announced yesterday he would not seek re-election next year. Mr Riegle is the sixth senator standing down in 1994, and the third to fall victim at least in part to financial scandal. His departure is expected to bring Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, until now most active in budget and economic policy, to the banking committee chairmanship. Like Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, who announced his retirement earlier this month, Mr Riegle was one of the 'Keating Five' linked to Mr Charles Keating, head of Lincoln Savings and Loan whose bankruptcy cost the government more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn). Although the Michigan state Democratic party has rallied behind Mr Riegle, his withdrawal will cause some relief. The likely Republican candidate, Mr Spencer Abraham, once an aide to former Vice-President Dan Quayle, is an astute though uncharismatic politician who is expected to mount a strong campaign. With 34 Senate seats up for re-election in 1994 - 21 of them held by Democrats - Republicans have a sporting chance of reclaiming the Senate majority they lost in 1986.</p>

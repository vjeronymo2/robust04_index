			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Zaire premier prompts protests MR Nguza Karl-i-Bond, Zaire's prime minister, has suspended the pro-opposition national political conference, prompting street protests in the capital, Kinshasa, agencies report. The conference was supposed to have brought to an end 27 years of autocratic rule by President Mobutu Sese Seko, but this was not to be. Mr Nguza said the conference, dominated by opponents of the president, was contributing to violence in the central African country. Street protests flared against the decision and opposition supporters yesterday set up barricades in several districts of the capital Kinshasa. The city remained tense.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Brussels weighs value of Eurocrats THEY clutter up Brussels' best restaurants, use their inflated salaries to push up rents for native Bruxellois, and park their polluting cars in the locals' spaces. Many Belgians have mixed feelings about the transient Eurocrats and their hangers-on. But Brussels' aspirations to be the political capital of Europe have brought growth as well as gripes, according to a report published yesterday. Mens en Ruimte, a Brussels consultancy, has calculated that the Belgian capital benefited from BFr96bn (Pounds 1.6bn) last year, directly or indirectly spent by EC institutions, diplomats, lobbyists, journalists and other businesses. They make up a total of 46,000 people, half of them Belgian and all employed in the service of the European ideal. The report was commissioned by Mr Jos Chabert, the Brussels minister responsible for external relations. Part of his job involves convincing citizens that their snooty EC neighbours are not merely the 'Euro-parasites' publicly reviled by some extremists. Instead, he said yesterday, they brought 'prestige, well-being, growth and jobs' to Brussels and Belgium. And the 75 per cent real increase in house prices since 1985 was due mainly to other external factors and not to the influx of non-Belgians. Compared with diplomats and EC 'fonctionnaires', the 581 international journalists - the largest press corps in the world outside Washington - had the least lavish spending habits. But, as the report added tactfully, 'the non-quantifiable, but certainly appreciable value of their presence lies in the image of the European capital they convey to millions of readers, listeners and viewers around the world'. Unfortunately, there was not much to report about the EC institutions' contribution to the Brussels economy yesterday: most Eurocrats had decided to add to Thursday's Ascension Day holiday and take Friday off.</p>

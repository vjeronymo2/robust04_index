			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Shadow of Deng darkens hopes for democracy: The Chinese leader has set the tone for talks on Hong Kong, which now seem to have collapsed Pronouncements by China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, on Hong Kong may not have quite the same messianic force as a fatwa issued by an Iranian ayatollah but they have set the tone for an uncompromising Chinese position. These include his warning in September 1982 to Lady Thatcher, then British prime minister, that in the event of unrest in the colony during the transition to 1997 China reserved the right to intervene. He also urged that the two sides work closely to ensure a smooth transfer. More importantly, he advised Britain's premier, fresh from her victory in the Falklands war, that sovereignty was non-negotiable. Chinese officials, taking their lead from Mr Deng's 'talk', have played hardball over Hong Kong's future, first in negotiations on the Joint Declaration of 1984 in which Britain ceded sovereignty, and subsequently in discussions on the Basic Law - the colony's post-1997 constitution. Mr Deng is also reported to have warned in conversation with colleagues that Britain would resort to 'little tricks' aimed at muddying the waters in the lead-up to 1997. Mr Patten's plans to broaden the franchise for elections in Hong Kong appear, in the Chinese mind, to fall into this category. Beijing insists that the Patten formula contradicts prior Sino-British agreements. Mr Deng's Hong Kong fatwa has meant that from the beginning of Sino-British negotiations over the Patten formula in April this year there has been little room for compromise or manoeuvre. Britain's negotiators, in 17 rounds of talks, have often felt they were talking to a brick wall. Beijing has, on occasions, hinted at possible compromise, but suggestions of flexibility have proved illusory. Officials have returned time and again to a re-statement of basic principles which derive from the views expressed by Mr Deng in his meeting with the then Mrs Thatcher. Pointedly, Mr Deng's views on Hong Kong were published on the front pages of Chinese newspapers on September 24, the day after Beijing failed to win the nomination for the 2000 Olympics. This was seen as more than a coincidence and appeared to reflect Beijing's displeasure over remarks by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, in which he had forcefully championed Sydney's bid. British officials in Beijing hope that in the Chinese way an 'eleventh hour' compromise might be possible, but they also recognise that the signs are not auspicious. Chinese officials have for weeks been canvassing publicly the prospect of a breakdown of talks. Mr Jiang Enzhu, a vice-foreign minister and China's chief negotiator, has said that there are two possibilities: success or failure. There is no doubt that China has been bolstered in its approach to the talks by a feeling that it has not much to lose by refusing to budge: after all, Hong Kong will return to Beijing's control in three and a half years whatever Mr Patten's electoral arrangements. No Chinese official would presume to contradict (or seek to reinterpret) Mr Deng's edict. Indeed, Premier Li Peng in his National Day speech on October 1, noted that the 'recent publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talk on the Hong Kong problem has fully expressed our determination'.</p>

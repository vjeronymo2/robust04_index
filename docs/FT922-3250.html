			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Morland attacks Greene King record MORLAND, the Thames Valley-based brewer fighting a hostile Pounds 104m bid, yesterday attacked predator Greene King's investment record and marketing strategy. Sir Humphrey Prideaux, Morland chairman, also promised a forecast of pre-tax profits, earnings per share and dividends for the year to September 1992. Morland's advisers said the offer, which Greene King, the east Anglia-based brewer, has made final, undervalued the company. 'A business of Morland's quality deserves a much higher price than is on the table. They have closed the door at far too low a level.' Morland said that Greene King had lost large amounts of money investing in leisure activities.</p>

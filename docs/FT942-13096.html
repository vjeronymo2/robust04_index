			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Solidarity steps up demands Poland's Solidarity trade union yesterday called on the government to remove state sector wage controls and limit planned energy price rises as a condition for suspending strikes by power workers. The demand came after Mr Marek Pol, the industry minister, told strikers at the Belchatow power plant that he would drop plans to restructure the opencast lignite mining sector which has until now been the strikers' chief demand. In response the miners agreed to step up coal supplies to one third of Poland's generating capacity, thus removing the threat of power cuts, but said that the action would be resumed tomorrow if wage controls were not lifted. Solidarity has called an eight-hour general strike in Warsaw tomorrow to back the demands which include the implementation of collective wage bargaining procedures promised last year.</p>

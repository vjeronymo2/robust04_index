			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: Western Mining sees profits rise Western Mining Corporation, one of Australia's largest mining companies, has forecast an 'appreciable' increase in first-half profits for 1994-95. It said if improved prices for its metal products continued into the second half, the full-year should also see higher results. In the financial year to the end of last June, WMC made a profit - after tax but before abnormal items - of ADollars 119.7m (USDollars 88.6m) down 27.8 per cent on the previous year's figure. At the annual meeting in Kalgoorlie, Sir Arvi Parbo, WMC's chairman, said the East Spar gas field off the north-west coast of Western Australia was to be developed at a cost of ADollars 250m. WMC is operator of the joint venture, and holds a 30 per cent interest in the field. Sir Arvi said the field had reserves of about 350bn cubic feet of gas and 25m barrels of condensate. Development of the project will take place over the next two years. The chairman said WMC wanted to become a much larger producer of copper  - its main operations are at Olympic Dam in South Australia and Nifty in Western Australia - and was exploring in the Philippines and Chile as well as its home country. The company hoped to expand its European talc activities and was considering the production of high analysis fertilisers for Australia. State Bank of New South Wales, which the state government is planning to sell to Colonial Mutual Life for ADollars 576.5m, announced operating profits of ADollars 70.5m before tax. After-tax profits rose 87 per cent, to ADollars 40.1m.</p>

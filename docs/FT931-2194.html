			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: Battle lines begin to form OUTSIDE Moscow's White House, again the epicentre of drama, two rival demonstrations, each 3,000-strong, were held apart by police. The Communist one, though, tried to beat up an ABC cameraman. Inside, too, there was no sign of the unanimity of six months ago, when many of those present were rallying round Boris Yeltsin as hero of the August 1991 putsch. Now, milling about the debating chamber, were Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, Mr Valery Zorkin, constitutional court chief, Gen Pavel Grachev, defence minister, Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister, and, of course, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker. They were comrades in arms no longer. Gen Grachev, with Mr Victor Barannikov, security services head, stuck dourly to their line: they would observe the constitution and keep the peace. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister and once thought by centrists and conservatives to be a potential fifth column in the presidential cabinet, also stuck doggedly to his brief - to support Mr Yeltsin and proclaim the government would carry on working. Gen Rutskoi, finally - it seemed - severing his tenuous connection with the man on whose ticket he ran for vice president nearly two years ago, claimed the president had put himself beyond the constitution. Significantly, he said he and Mr Yuri Skokov, Security Council secretary, had refused to sign the presidential decree declaring 'special rule'. This means the Security Council loses its organiser and the president a useful counsellor. Gen Rutskoi and Mr Skokov have wide contacts in the administration and armed forces and may now use them. The Supreme Soviet is often placid, usually relatively well ordered. Yesterday's hastily called session did not make much effort to be orderly: indeed, it probably lacked a quorum but worked on anyway. Mr Zorkin, ever the peacemaker, said the proceedings should be restrained, especially as it appeared the president's decree on special powers had not been registered and so was not in force. Even in the shadow of what the majority said was threatened totalitarianism, the Russian bureaucracy ground on at its own pace: or had Mr Yeltsin drawn back? Whichever it was, said Mr Zorkin, 'we cannot pretend nothing has happened'.</p>

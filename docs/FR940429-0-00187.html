			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has determined through experience that the addition of a branch campus or other location that offers a complete educational program can have a major impact on the financial status of the whole institution and the ability of the whole institution to administer the Title IV, HEA programs. For many years, the Secretary has required institutions that seek to add a location at which a complete educational program is offered to undergo a certification review so that the Secretary could ascertain whether the institution has the financial resources and sufficient administrative capability to support another location. In addition, section 498(b) of the HEA requires the Secretary to have a form on which the institution describes the relationship between a main campus of an institution and all of its branch campuses. It follows then that the Secretary cannot scrutinize a branch campus in a vacuum. Thus, this provision is a codification of the Secretary's longstanding policy and application procedures and new statutory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters that discussed employer-sponsored training programs seemed not to understand that if institutions contract with employers to provide training programs at the work-site or some other off-campus location that employer is paying for the cost of training and no Title IV, HEA program funds are involved, there is no need for the institution to notify the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has established a requirement that an institution must notify the Secretary of a location that offers at least 50 percent of an educational program if the institution wishes to have the location included in the institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. The Secretary puts institutions on notice that they may be required to file a complete recertification application in such situations, but the Secretary expects to make requests for complete recertification applications only rarely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notification and application requirements for changes in name, location, or address. Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters stated that the Secretary should not require an institution to undergo a recertification review if the institution changed only its name, address, or location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section requires only that institutions notify the Secretary of such changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Required forms and information. Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters asserted that the proposed requirement of &sect;668.12(e)(2) for an institution to provide to the Secretary upon request all information that the Secretary needs to certify an institution was too broad. Their perception was that the requirement would give the Secretary unlimited access to institutional information under the guise of a certification review. They recommended that the provision be revised to state that the Secretary would request only the information and documentation specified on the application form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This provision refers only to information and documentation needed to certify that the institution meets the standards in this subpart, particularly the factors of financial responsibility and standards of administrative capability. The application form clearly specifies the information and documents that institutions must submit with their application. However, the Secretary must retain the flexibility to request additional information or documentation to clarify or support an institution's response on the application, should that be necessary. The Secretary notes that this provision would not require an institution to provide information such as tenure information contained in faculty records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.13&blank;Certification Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirements for certification. Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters objected to the proposal that an institution could be refused full certification that the institution meets the standards of subpart B and may participate in the Title IV, HEA programs because of a problem identified at one of its branch campuses. These commenters suggested that it was not fair to restrict the certification for an institution based upon a problem that was identified at its branch location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The commenters misunderstood the purpose of this provision. Section 498(j) of the HEA requires a branch campus, as defined by the Secretary, to be certified under the requirements of this subpart to be included in an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. Thus, a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> branch campus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> must separately demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction that it meets, for example, the factors of financial responsibility and standards of administrative capability. The commenters should note that the Secretary has defined  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> branch campus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  narrowly, in part for this reason, in the Institutional Eligibility regulations. A more complete discussion of the implications of meeting that definition is found in those regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several comments were received recommending that an institution's financial aid officer be included in the list of personnel that are required to have precertification training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Pursuant to the administrative capability standards set out in &sect;668.16, every institution is required to designate a capable individual that is responsible for administering the Title IV, HEA programs at the institution. This designated individual, who is usually a financial aid administrator, is required to have precertification training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

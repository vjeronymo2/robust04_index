			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROCKWELL GETS PACT FOR WORK ON MIDGETMAN;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: ANAHEIM DIVISION AWARDED $30.6-MILLION CONTRACT TO CONTINUE  DEVELOPMENT OF MISSILE'S GUIDANCE SYSTEM.  </P> <P> Rockwell International Corp. said Wednesday that it has won a $30.6-million  contract to continue development of a guidance and control system for the  Midgetman nuclear missile.  </P> <P> Rockwell's Autonetics Strategic Systems Division in Anaheim won the one-year  Air Force contract to continue work on the single-warhead Midgetman, formally  known as the Small Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.  </P> <P> Rockwell, which began work on the Midgetman in 1984, has 170 people employed on  the program. No additional hiring is expected during the next year, the company  said.  </P> <P> As part of the contract, Rockwell will develop an electronic chip system  designed to better withstand radiation exposure in a nuclear war.  </P> <P> Full-scale development work for the guidance and control program could boost  the value of the contract to $470 million, based on current Air Force  estimates, Rockwell officials said.  </P> <P> Dunbar Lockwood, an analyst with the Arms Control Assn., a Washington think  tank, said cuts in defense spending have resulted in the Midgetman program  being stretched out. The Air Force has spent $3.3 billion on the program since  1984. Before the recent award, Rockwell had received $390 million in contracts  for the guidance and control system.  </P> <P> The Air Force has proposed building 500 Midgetman missiles at a cost of $41.8  billion, with deployment to begin in 1997.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has requested $202 million for Midgetman development  during the fiscal year that began Monday.  </P> <P> With deep cuts expected in the Pentagon's budget and the prospect of a nuclear  arms control agreement, the Democratic-controlled Congress is expected to  support the Midgetman over the rail-based MX, Lockwood said.  </P> <P> Since U.S. arms control negotiators have proposed a ban on multiple warhead  missiles such as the MX, the Midgetman has a better chance for deployment.  Proponents of the Midgetman contend that the system would be less vulnerable  than the MX missile in the event of a massive nuclear strike.  </P></p>

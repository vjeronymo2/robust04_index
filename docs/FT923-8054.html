Having inflicted their soap opera on the Brits for more than five years now, they are preparing to indoctrinate the younger generation with tales of the times when Mr Plod ruled the pavements. BBC Enterprises, which bought the rights to Noddy, the 40-year-old Enid Blyton character, earlier this year, has just received an order for more than half a million copies of the entire Noddy book series from Australia - that's one Noddy for every three pre-school Australians. The books about the flop-hatted garden gnome will fill four 40 ft containers. 'It's a most significant sale,' said a very pleased spokesman from BBC Enterprises.

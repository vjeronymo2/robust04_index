			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / US trade gap widens as imports grow The US trade deficit in goods and services widened sharply in May to Dollars 9.17bn (Pounds 5.88bn), from a revised Dollars 8.53bn in April, as import growth continued to outstrip export performance, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The deficit was higher than market forecasts of a little more than Dollars 8bn. However, there was little reaction to the trade figures yesterday as US markets waited for testimony due today from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, before the Senate banking committee. The politically sensitive US trade deficit with Japan fell almost 20 per cent in May to Dollars 4.39bn, on an unadjusted basis. Even so, the US deficit with Japan for the first five months of this year reached almost Dollars 25bn, up about 10 per cent on the deficit in the equivalent period last year. The merchandise trade deficit deteriorated to Dollars 14.1bn in May, the highest figure in more than six years, against Dollars 13.3bn in April. Exports of goods were little changed for the month, at Dollars 40.4bn, while goods imports rose to Dollars 54.5bn from Dollars 53.7bn the month before. Higher costs pushed up the US oil import bill by 9.2 per cent to an unadjusted Dollars 4.03bn, while imports of clothing and telecommunications equipment also rose strongly. The services surplus edged up in May to Dollars 4.9bn. The US trade surplus with Mexico soared to Dollars 353m in May, from only Dollars 7m in April, as Mexico surpassed Japan for the month to be the second-largest trade partner for the US after Canada. The overall US trade deficit for the first five months of this year is running at Dollars 41.96bn, against Dollars 25.84bn for the equivalent period last year. About half the overall deterioration in the US trade position this year has been with Europe, Merrill Lynch, the New York securities house, pointed out yesterday. US exports to Europe should begin to rise as European growth picks up. In addition, US services exports for June should receive a fillip from spending related to the World Cup football tournament, Merrill said. The World Cup was held in the US from mid-June until last Sunday, and generated much revenue through sales of foreign television rights and through tourism.</p>

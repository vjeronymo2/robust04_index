			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATTEMPT TO SAVE CARWASH IS SCRUBBED BY L.A. PANEL  </P> <P> A campaign to turn a Studio City carwash into a cultural monument was scrubbed  Wednesday when Los Angeles officials decided the place was too common looking  -- and its customers were not uncommon enough.  </P> <P> Dashing the hopes of residents who tried to thwart construction of a mini-mall  on the site, members of the city's Cultural Heritage Commission voted 4 to 0  against a landmark designation for the carwash and an adjoining gas station and  coffee shop after several preservation experts testified against the idea.  </P> <P> Commissioners said the 28-year-old automotive complex fails to meet the city's  criteria as a cultural treasure. Those guidelines include requirements that  such sites either have "the distinguishing characteristics of an  architectural-type specimen" or be "identified with historic personages or with  important events."  </P> <P> The vote clears the way for a developer who owns the southeast corner of  Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards to remove the three buildings and start  construction of a new $15-million mini-mall in 90 days.  </P> <P> Homeowners' unhappiness with builder Ira Smedra's shopping center plan had  sparked the unusual cultural monument application -- which in recent weeks  attracted worldwide attention as the latest example of Los Angeles' wacky love  affair with the automobile.  </P> <P> A monument designation, if ratified by the City Council, would have delayed  Smedra's demolition plans for up to one year. That would have given supporters  time to try to persuade Smedra to somehow incorporate the carwash, gas station  and Tiny Naylor's restaurant in his project, residents said.  </P> <P> Members of the cultural panel had indicated last month that they were split 2  to 1 in favor of the designation. A formal vote was delayed until Wednesday to  allow a newly appointed fourth commission member to take his seat on the board.  </P> <P> Homeowners told the panel that the carwash, which is topped by three  55-foot-tall, boomerang-shaped steel beams, serves as "the gateway to Studio  City."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Example of Car Culture  </P> <P> "A landmark doesn't have to be a statue of a Yankee general," said Kathy  Negele, who lives a few blocks from the carwash's beams. She urged that they be  preserved as an example of San Fernando Valley car culture.  </P> <P> But historian Portia Lee testified against the application, asserting that the  origin of the carwash boomerang is uncertain. "History is not instant, even in  Southern California," she said, noting that the carwash was built in 1961.  </P> <P> Knox Mellon, retired director of the State Office of Historical Preservation,  said the carwash meets neither architectural nor historical landmark  guidelines. He warned that designation of such a "marginal" site could haunt  the city panel in the future.  </P> <P> The only commission support for the carwash came from its president, Amarjit S.  Marwah. He said the site meets the city's cultural criteria, adding, "I'm  personally against mini-malls and Mickey Mouse developments. . . ."  </P> <P> When it became clear he was outnumbered, Marwah joined the other commissioners  in making the vote unanimous, however.  </P> <P> Save-the-car-wash campaign leader Jack McGrath said residents will urge City  Councilman Joel Wachs, whose district includes the carwash corner, to ignore  the commission action and ask council colleagues to approve the cultural  designation anyway.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Memories for Children  </P> <P> "We've very disappointed," McGrath said. "We've demolished so many things in  the San Fernando Valley. We haven't kept any memories for our kids."  </P> <P> Wachs was unavailable for comment after the meeting. One of his chief deputies,  Greg Nelson, said it is uncertain whether the City Council "can make an end run  around the commission. . . . We're trying right now to find out what we can  do."  </P> <P> Smedra, meantime, urged residents to work with him in deciding on the final  touches for his proposed 53,000-square-foot, two-story shopping center.  </P> <P> One of those touches, he hinted, might just be the 55-foot-tall boomerangs.  "We've offered to donate them to the L.A. Conservancy," Smedra said.  </P> <P> Jay Rounds, executive director of the Los Angeles Conservancy, said his group's  preservation officer is investigating Smedra's offer.  </P> <P> "It has always been our policy to favor preservation of things on the original  site wherever possible," Rounds said.  </P></p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Portugal bank stake sale raises Es19.4bn Portugal has raised Es19.4bn (Dollars 119.6m) from the privatisation of 19.5 per cent of Banco Fomento e Exterior, a trade and investment bank, in an oversubscribed public offer on the Lisbon stock exchange, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon. Discounted prices, dividend pledges and tax concessions proved strong attractions for small domestic investors, making the sale a success for the government's 'popular capitalism' programme. Interest from foreign investors, however, was negligible. Orders were placed for 33.3m shares, although only 15.6m were on offer. Demand was particularly strong for a 3.4m share tranche reserved for small investors at a discount of 8.5 per cent to the basic offer price of Es1,300 a share. Domestic investors were also attracted by the promise of a 1995 dividend of at least Es60, and by tax allowances that do not apply to non-residents. Foreign investors bought only 0.63 per cent of the bank.</p>

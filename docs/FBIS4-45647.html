			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by O. Balandina: "Marine Inspection Will Be </F> Intensified"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Border Troops are  responsible people. So, in the same serious manner as they are  equipping their new base, they have begun to perform their  primary task -- protection of our oblast's sea borders. They  will be facing even more tasks beginning this spring. The  Border Troops Kaliningrad Group commander and the Oblast  Environment Protection Committee chairman have approved a plan  for cooperation between the Border Troops marine group and the  environment protection committee. I attended a joint meeting of  the unit, at which 14 officers and warrant officers, who had  gone through special training, received certificates from the  Oblast Environment Committee as nonsalaried staff members.  During the ceremony, Marine Inspection chief T.I. Gryn  expressed her confidence that the engagement of the Border  Troops staff and equipment will help to improve protection of  the fish population, detain ships violating regulations, monitor  sea pollution by oil, waste, and soil, as well as to constantly  control extraction of amber, and in the future, also oil from  platforms. Ships patrolling internal and territorial waters, the  continental shelf, and the Russian Federation's economic zone,  will either take on board Oblast Environment Committee  inspectors, or they themselves will perform such duties, as  nonsalaried staff members. Having discovered violations, they,  as inspectors, will fill out protocols of detention.    The cooperation plan also envisions a permanent exchange of  information on the situation in controlled regions and the  location of foreign industrial or scientific-research vessels.  The results of patrols and plans for future cooperation will be  discussed every week at briefings with the participation of  Marine Inspection representatives.    Undoubtedly, such close cooperation will significantly  intensify control over protected waters, and will bring an end  to illegal fishing by foreign vessels. The Border Troops have  already begun to implement the cooperation plan.</p>

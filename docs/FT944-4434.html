			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: VSEL The government's decision to refer both the British Aerospace and GEC bids for VSEL to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is bizarre. The competition argument is thin. True, a GEC takeover would reduce the number of UK warship manufacturers from three to two. But the Ministry of Defence, as a monopsonist, is quite capable of looking after itself in negotiations. The public interest argument for referral is even stranger. The government cannot seriously be suggesting that either BAe or GEC is a threat to national security. The referrals are an irritation for all three companies. VSEL shareholders obviously lose out, since there is some doubt whether a lucrative bidding war will resume in March. BAe can at least comfort itself with the knowledge that the first part of its 'trombone' rights issue, worth Pounds 178m, is still intact. That can be used to restructure its loss-making turbo-prop business. Its shareholders, though, can hardly be pleased that more money will presumably have to be spent on underwriting fees post-March on top of the vast sums that have already been spent on the trombone. Meanwhile, GEC can draw grim satisfaction from the fact that it has managed to drag BAe into the Monopolies Commission with it. Ministers are embracing the idea of greater cross-border collaboration between Europe's defence groups. That may count against an eventual merger of GEC's and BAe's defence businesses. But ministers should note that, while European link-ups are fine in theory, other governments are wary of moves that would undermine national sovereignty.</p>

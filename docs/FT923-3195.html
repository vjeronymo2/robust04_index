			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Leading Article: US tax wrangle FOR A country that suffers from a conspicuous shortage of savings and an endemically weak current account, the US is oddly cavalier in its treatment of the providers of foreign capital. Once again the US subsidiaries of foreign multinationals are being called on to make a bigger contribution to the US fiscal pot. As in the earlier battle over unitary taxes in the mid-1980s, the international business community is justifiably enraged at the manner in which the US is going about the job. The chief bone of contention is the tax treatment of transfer prices at which goods are shunted across national boundaries within the same group of companies. In February the US Internal Revenue Service abandoned the internationally accepted approach whereby transfer prices  - a chargeable cost against taxable profit - were judged in accordance with the arm's length principle. It decided instead to measure foreign-owned companies' profit by reference to average profits in comparable domestic businesses. This approach could now be given a legal basis as a result of a bill sponsored by Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Mr Bill Gradison. Under the proposed legislation taxpayers who have not already negotiated an agreement with the IRS on transfer pricing would be required to obtain their own information about the average profits of comparable businesses and to pay tax on that basis, rather than on the basis of their own disclosed profits. For good measure the bill seeks to introduce capital gains tax on the disposal of shares by foreign owners of US companies - a measure that was dumped from the 1989 Budget Reconciliation Act after clamorous international protest. Meanwhile, Democratic presidential nominee Mr Bill Clinton proposes to raise substantial revenues with his own assault on transfer pricing. Foreign profits It is not inconceivable that there is widespread abuse in the US over transfer pricing. Certainly studies have tended to show that the level of profitability in foreign owned companies has been significantly lower than in domestically owned business. Yet it would be surprising if this were not so. For much of the 1980s foreign direct investment into the US was growing at more than 20 per cent a year. The profitability of the total stock of foreign investment would thus have been heavily influenced by start-up costs and the desire to invest in building market share. At the same time the returns on the more aged stock of domestic assets would have been overstated, relatively, through the impact of the historic cost accounting convention on depreciation. Nor is there any evidence that the US is a bigger loser from transfer pricing abuses than, say, Britain, Germany or France. But that, of course, misses the point, since the US is not chiefly concerned to address the question of international tax avoidance. Mr Clinton, as with Mr Bush, is simply anxious to seize any opportunity to raise revenue by the backdoor. National paranoia At the same time the Rostenkowski-Gradison bill is just one more instance of the national paranoia about Japan and the associated urge to bite the hand that provided the lion's share of the Dollars 1,000bn of foreign capital that the US has imported since 1980. As with the Structural Impediments Initiative, the US is seeking to have it both ways. But this time, as well as violating tax treaty obligations, the proposed legislation catches Europe in the cross-fire. European governments can be relied on to lobby fiercely to mitigate the damage. There is a clear need for the issue of transfer pricing to be addressed at international level. To that end the OECD has already set up a task force which will provide the data for a properly informed debate. In the meantime US multinationals would do well to remind their friends in Washington that the European response to the unitary tax wrangle was to introduce legislation to permit retaliation. With so much at stake on both sides it would make no sense to proceed with such an arbitrary approach to the taxation of the profits of foreign companies in the US.</p>

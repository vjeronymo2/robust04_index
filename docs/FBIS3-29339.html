The deputy prime minister,  Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim, told a news conference in Kota Kinabalu  today that the decision was taken after consultations with the  prime minister, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, and other  National Front [BN] leaders. Datuk Sri Anwar said there is no  way the federal government can cooperate with a PBS-led state  government, as its policies and personalities were inconsistent  with those adopted by the BN.    On the privatization of several key government agencies in  Sabah, Datuk Sri Anwar said the process was conducted contrary  to the principles and rules of privatization adopted by the  federal government. Any project privatized by the federal  government is first evaluated by the Economic Planning Unit  before it is considered and approved by the cabinet. The  interest of the government and the respective states is always  safeguarded. In the case of Sabah, privatization is decided by  a single person and the interests of Sabah were ignored.</p>

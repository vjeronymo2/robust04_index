			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Driving-licence plan sparks fears on ID cards The Department of Transport yesterday proposed that driving licences should include the holder's photograph, heightening speculation by civil liberties groups that the government will introduce national identity cards in the next session of parliament. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, said the new driving licence was 'long overdue', and would carry security features to prevent fraud. The department suggested that in the longer term microchips could be added to driving licences to convert them into 'smart cards' - holding details of endorsements, medical information and possibly national insurance details. Liberty, the civil-liberties campaign group which opposes identity cards, said: 'The more information a card carries, the more likely it is to be used as an identity card.' Mr John Major, the prime minister, recently backed the principle of identity cards as a way to combat crime and fraud, but ministers are still debating what form they should take. There are also concerns about the costs of introducing a national card network. When parliament debated identity cards in June, the launch cost was put at Pounds 450m, with subsequent annual costs of Pounds 100m. The transport department said the costs of the new licence should be much lower. The prime minister's efficiency unit looks likely to recommend the introduction of 'swipe' cards to combat social-security fraud. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has backed such a scheme amid signs that benefit fraud has reached about Pounds 150m a year. He described the system of paying by order book as 'probably one of the most archaic and insecure means of transmitting money known to man', adding that computer companies would soon be invited to introduce systems into post offices. It is less clear whether the government will push ahead with a system based on the more sophisticated 'smart card' suggested by the transport department as a future replacement for driving licences. Home Office officials believe such a national card would redress the difficulties faced by police and customs officers following the opening of European Union borders and an upsurge in terrorism. The Association of Chief Police Officers believes identity cards should be voluntary. Police officers have expressed doubts in the past over whether ID cards could help to combat crime, although the association said yesterday: 'We also have to recognise that one of the weapons of the terrorist is anonymity and the ease with which they can merge into normal life.' Mr Frank Dobson, Labour transport spokesman, said: 'We have no objection in principle to the idea of photos on driving licences but we have doubts about the costs and benefits. We also don't believe they should be used as a back-door way of introducing national identity cards.' He said that cheque and credit-card fraud could be countered more effectively by requiring banks and building societies to have photos on credit cards. Then the private sector, and not the government, would bear the costs. The transport department's proposals, which are still only provisional, would be introduced in July 1996, initially for provisional licences. Consultation continues until the end of November.

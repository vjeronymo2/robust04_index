			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Writs likely at Lloyd's this week MORE THAN 2,000 members of syndicates at the Lloyd's insurance market formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency expect to serve writs against their agents early this week, Richard Lapper writes. But there are strong indications that the prospects are receding for an out-of-court settlement between about a dozen groups of loss-making Names - the individuals whose capital backs the Lloyd's market - and their agents. Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, said: 'The problem has some fairly intractable dimensions.' Seven Gooda Walker syndicates lost more than Pounds 900m between 1987 and 1990, mainly because of their involvement in so-called 'spiral' reinsurance business in which syndicates and companies reinsure each others' exposures to high-level catastrophe loss. Some 2,000 Gooda Walker Names, some of whom face losses more than five times the amount they deposited with Lloyd's, voted last November to take legal action against 67 agents who placed them with the Gooda syndicates. Mr Michael Deeny, an accountant and rock concert promoter who chairs the Gooda Walker Names Action Group, said his group had raised more than Pounds 4m to finance the action.</p>

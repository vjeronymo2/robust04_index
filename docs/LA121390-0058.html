			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC, CAL STATE CRITICIZED ON QUAKE PREPARATIONS;  </P> <P> SAFETY: A STATE COMMISSION SAYS THE SCHOOLS ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO BRING  BUILDINGS UP TO STANDARDS.  </P> <P> California's two public university systems have been sharply criticized by the  California Seismic Safety Commission for failing to bring campus buildings up  to earthquake safety standards.  </P> <P> The Cal State system has neither an adequate policy statement about the need  for seismic safety nor a plan to bring it about on its 20 campuses, the  commission said in a report made available Wednesday.  </P> <P> And the University of California system has a policy to retrofit existing  buildings but is not implementing it quickly enough, the report said. Failure  to do so immediately "will continue to expose both people and programs to a  high degree of vulnerability for years, perhaps decades, to come," the report  said.  </P> <P> The commission said the plan for the nine UC campuses was good in concept but  that "there are serious problems in the areas of funding and accountability."  </P> <P> Officials of both university systems agreed that many buildings still need to  be made safer but complained that they lacked funds to do the job.  </P> <P> The commission report acknowledged that both systems face a funding problem but  urged them to shift their priorities so that more money is spent to shore up  hazardous buildings, rather than on other purposes.  </P> <P> The report was a response to an executive order signed by Gov. George  Deukmejian after the 1989 Bay Area earthquake, calling on all state agencies to  make seismic safety a high priority.  </P> <P> The governor ordered the commission, made up of 15 of his own appointees and  two state legislators, to monitor progress and report to him periodically. This  is the first report dealing with the two university systems. It does not list  the buildings considered to be unsafe.  </P> <P> The commission praised the UC system for an earthquake safety program that  dates to the mid-1970s and also had kind words for UC President David P.  Gardner's "personal commitment to seismic safety."  </P> <P> But decisions by local campus officials have not always matched that  commitment, the report said.  </P> <P> For example, new coaches' offices, a weight-training room and a "Hall of Fame,"  paid for with private gift funds, were added to Memorial Stadium on the  Berkeley campus, even though no additional structural improvements were made  and the 72,000-seat football stadium sits astride the dangerous Hayward Fault.  </P> <P> "In this case, improving intercollegiate athletic facilities was a higher  priority than improving the seismic safety of this known collapse hazard," the  report said. "Instead of reducing the risk by reducing occupancy, the campus  actually chose to increase it."  </P> <P> Nadesan Permaul, a UC Berkeley official, said the additions, all part of the  "Cal Sports '80s Improvements" program, were approved by two engineering firms.  </P> <P> Permaul said there was a "difference of opinion" between the structural  specialists engaged by the Seismic Safety Commission and those hired by the  campus.  </P> <P> "We certainly respect their opinion, but we feel we've taken a prudent,  cautious approach in making these improvements," he added.  </P> <P> Sandra Smith, a UC assistant vice president for policy analysis and capital  planning, said the system is just as eager as the commission to make campus  buildings safe.  </P> <P> "We've been working on seismic safety for many years," Smith said. "The issue  is lack of funds. The commission wants seismic safety to be the university's  highest priority, but we have other state mandates to meet at the same time,"  such as increasing campus capacities to accommodate the top one-eighth of the  state's high school graduates who are eligible for the system.  </P> <P> Smith said UC has identified 149 buildings on its campuses as "poor" or "very  poor" and has repaired, or has plans to repair, all but 49.  </P> <P> "We look at that as pretty significant progress," she said. "We would do them  all but the problem is, where does the money come from?"  </P> <P> While the report deals at some length with UC, the section on Cal State is  short because of the lack of a specific policy aimed at addressing the seismic  issue.  </P> <P> Possible sources of money to pay for repairs have not been identified and Cal  State has been unwilling to increase student fees to pay for structural repairs  in such student-funded buildings as cafeterias and dormitories, the report  noted.  </P> <P> Tom Coffin, chief of architecture and engineering for the 360,000-student Cal  State system, said a 10-year earthquake-repair plan has been prepared but  conceded that "there has been no systematic effort" to solve the problem.  </P> <P> "We haven't had the money to do it," Coffin said. "Unlike UC, we don't have any  discretionary money we can move around for a purpose like this. All our money  comes from the state."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> After the October, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake, Gov. George Deukmejian issued  an executive order directing state agencies, including the University of  California and California State systems, to make seismic safety a priority for  state structures. The governor ordered the California Seismic Safety  Commission, a 17-member body including both engineers and representatives of  local and state government, to monitor progress being made in improving  earthquake safety in state structures.  </P></p>

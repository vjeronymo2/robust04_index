			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Scrapping Tecs computer system may cost Pounds 50m A COMPUTER system developed by the Department of Employment to underpin the administration of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in England and Wales has been abandoned by the department at a potential cost of more than Pounds 50m. The Tecs had complained that the system was difficult to operate, had many shortcomings and did not adequately meet their needs. In all, some 7,000 errors and requests for changes to the system had been recorded by April this year. The National Audit Office, the public expenditure watchdog, says today in a sharply critical report that the failure of the Tecs computer system to work properly was a result of glaring management inadequacies. Now that the department has decided to withdraw from the system, the Tecs will have to make their own computing arrangements using their own funds. The office says there is no guarantee that they will be able to mount a more appropriate or cost-effective solution. It says the debacle exemplifies many of the deficiencies 'commonly found in recent years in the management and control of government computer projects'. Among the faults it identified, all typical of poorly managed computer projects, were: Failure to make rigorous risk assessments as timescales and requirements changed. Failure to involve users of the system from the outset to ensure the intended purpose was being met. Failure to manage a technically complex project effectively. It is equally critical of the department's decision to pull out of the provision of IT services to the Tecs. It says: 'It is unfortunate that the decision was not informed by a comprehensive cost benefit analysis', concluding that 'without such an analysis, it is unclear whether the way forward chosen by the department represents the most appropriate and cost effective means of meeting Tecs information technology needs.' The Tecs were established between 1990 and 1991 to develop local training, enterprise and education strategies. They are companies which negotiate annual contracts with the department of Employment to improve the Governments' Pounds 1.7bn a year training and enterprise programmes. The computer system, known as the Field System, was designed to replace the inefficient stand-alone computers used by the department's field offices. With the establishment of the Tecs, the department redesigned the system to meet the needs of the new organisation. It expected the Tecs to use the system, budgeted at Pounds 71m, into the 1990s. Some Pounds 48m had been spent by April this year when the department pulled out of the project. The NAO said the Tecs spent a further Pounds 4.6m of their own funds on additional software, hardware, training and support in attempting to make the system work. A vital module, designed to deal with payments and accounting, was so unwieldy that most Tecs continued, for an average of 16 months, to use a manual alternative. The module was eventually overhauled at a cost of Pounds 2m, but even so by August last year 20 of 71 Tecs surveyed by the NAO said they had selected alternative systems to produce payments and accounting information. The NAO says the way the department managed the project and its disregard for contract tendering and letting procedures in the appointment of computer consultants to work on the project amounted to 'serious failing in control'. Consultancy had been budgeted at about Pounds 2.3m; by September last year some Pounds 11m had been spent on more than 200 individuals and firms.

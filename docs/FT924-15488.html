			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / International Company News: Elf in plastics venture with Rhone-Poulenc ELF Aquitaine, the French oil group and Rhone-Poulenc, France's leading chemicals company, yesterday announced a joint venture in plastic films, marking an improvement in the cool relations between the two state-owned companies. Elf's chemicals subsidiary, Elf Atochem, is to take majority control of the venture, Soplaril, which will have a turnover of FFr800m (Dollars 167.4m) in four plants across Europe and be one of the region's largest producers of food wrapping film. Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, the current chairman of Elf Aquitaine, who is close to the Socialist party, was ousted as head of Rhone-Poulenc in 1986 by the conservative government of the time. He was replaced by Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, a close friend of former president Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the centre-right UDF party, and appointed to his present job at Elf by the Socialist administration in 1989. Since then, collaboration between the two groups has been rare and relations between their chairmen distant.</p>

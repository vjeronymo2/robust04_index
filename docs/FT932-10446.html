			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Deep divisions remain on outlook for Italy - Milan's fresh start The surge in prices in Milan this year, with shares rising by about 20 per cent since January, has triggered deep divisions, among even the most experienced analysts. For the 'super-optimists', Italian equities are just at the start of a long-overdue re-evaluation, which will see prices rising by at least 50 per cent, as investors belatedly appreciate the market's merits. 'Evidence' that the forecast is correct is mainly political. Aletti, a Milanese broker, points to last month's referendums, which showed an overwhelming popular desire for change, as proof that political reform is firmly on the agenda. The new government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former governor of the Bank of Italy, is a further indication of movement. Though distracted by last week's defection of four ministers within hours of taking office, the government's survival of a parliamentary vote of confidence last night shows it is now in business. At the other extreme are those counselling caution. Such analysts, principally London-based, say that Italy may be changing, but it still has a rocky ride ahead. While not denying the real impact of the political reforms that have already taken place, they argue that the process is still at an early stage. Hence the referendum, the most important aspect of which was to herald the reform of voting in general elections, must be followed by new laws. Those will only be the first steps to new elections and a new government, whose composition remains wholly unclear. Inevitably, a handful of analysts take the middle ground. The team at Albertini, a respected Milan-based house, is 'pretty bullish' about the market, and predict that it still has 5-10 per cent to rise before a consolidation this summer. However, they appreciate the political minefields ahead. Mr Ciampi may command respect, but if he practises as prime minister what he preached as central bank governor, the 1994 budget, being brought forward to July, could be a battleground. The budget will contain some harsh medicine to put Italy's public accounts in order. Although much was achieved under the previous Amato government, the problem of the government deficit has swollen this year, as revenues have fallen below expectations on account of the recession. Even in its present, more reformist mood, parliament is hardly likely to welcome even tougher spending cuts and tax rises, meaning that the passage of the 1994 budget and possible additional measures for 1993 is likely to be tortuous. Who is right? While caution may be the best approach, at least until the political picture clarifies, shares have continued rising. Foreign funds in particular, previously underweight or wholly absent from Milan, have scanned the headlines about political change and started buying. Big orders, even for liquid blue chips such as Fiat and Generali, have had a disproportionately large impact on the relatively small Milan bourse. Prices have rocketed on the back of foreign and domestic institutional buying, coupled with special situations such as privatisation or rumours of impending international alliances, as in the case of Fiat. The speed and scale of the upturn has embarrassed some of those counselling caution, with clients chiding their brokers for not telling them to plough in. 'People can get it so wrong,', admits Miss Marie-Christine Keith, of County NatWest, which is publishing a big Italy study next week. 'Generali, Fiat, Sip and Stet all look dear, but every time they weaken, big buyers come back into the market.' For investors looking for short-term performance and confident of timely selling tips, there is probably still some performance left on the back of more upbeat political news. For the long-term buyer too, the outlook seems remarkably positive. The political picture is changing fast, and economic fundamentals look brighter too. The fall in the value of the lira will boost exporters, while the entire corporate sector has been helped by last summer's agreement on abolishing the 'scala mobile' wage indexation system. That, along with the domestic recession, has contributed to an extraordinary slowdown in wage growth, while inflation has remained remarkably low in spite of the currency's plunge. Retail price inflation was 4.2 per cent last month, while wage growth is running at just 2.9 per cent. 'Who could have believed that as recently as 1991, the Andreotti government was giving 17 per cent wage rises to public sector employees,' says one analyst. It is the medium-term that looks most tricky. With a series of political obstacles still to be crossed, the market has immense potential for volatility. Slightly further ahead is the debate on electoral reform, which promises to be difficult. Beyond that are new elections, probably in the autumn at the earliest, and the formation of a new government, based on a coalition, the composition of which is today only guesswork. Then there is the small question of what they will do.</p>

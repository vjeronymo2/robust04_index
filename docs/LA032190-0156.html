			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INDIA REBUFFS COCA-COLA BID TO ENTER MARKET  </P> <P> Coca-Cola Co. lost its bid to return to India today when the government turned  down an application that would have allowed the soft drink maker to compete  with domestic producers.  </P> <P> Even a spokesman for Coke's top competitor, Pepsi-Cola, criticized the move as  a return to economic nationalism by India, which in recent years had encouraged  foreign investment.  </P> <P> Commerce Secretary S. P. Shukla said Coke's application to build a $3-million  plant in an export zone had been rejected. "The reasons for our move will be  explained in a letter to the applicant," he said.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Commerce said "protection of India's domestic  market played a major factor in the decision."  </P> <P> A request by PepsiCo. Inc. for an additional plant probably would also be  rejected, she added, speaking on condition of not being identified in keeping  with government practice.  </P> <P> Coke left India in 1977 when it refused to give the government details of its  secret syrup formula. An Indian company, calling itself Campa Cola, adopted  Coke's logo but not the taste.  </P> <P> The Coca Cola Co. applied two years ago to manufacture its syrup in an export  processing zone.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, only 25% of its output would have been sold in India to  local bottlers. As an added incentive, Coke offered to invest in a joint  venture in southern India to export tea concentrate to Japan.  </P> <P> Coke's goal was to break into India's $350-million soft drink market which is  now controlled by three domestic soda companies.  </P></p>

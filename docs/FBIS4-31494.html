			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, June 6 (CTK) -- [passage omitted]  The Slovak National Party (SNS) has returned to the national  principle. Having "cleansed itself" from the Cernak wing, the  "nationals" agreed that only a Slovak national could join the  party, the independent daily SME writes.    It writes that the rejection of a joint slate with Vladimir  Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) at the SNS  congress on Saturday [4 June] has created conditions for the SNS  to assume after the autumn early elections a position usual for  radical parties in stabilized democratic countries. The only  unpredictable step was the abolition of the post of honorary  chairman which affected the advocates of the rejected HZDS  coalition, Jozef Prokes and Marian Andel.    Though speculations about the SNS's split did not  materialize  at the congress, one surprise should be expected before the  elections: the participation of "some (former) leading  representatives" of the SNS on the HZDS slate, the paper says.    The pro-Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) daily SLOVENSKY  DENNIK writes that the SNS will turn into a discussion club at  the best, comparable with the Christian Social Union or Matica  Slovenska (cultural and educational organization).    The paper points out that it should not be forgotten that  Meciar had sent a clear message to the SNS, though only three  days before the congress -- he offered the SNS pre- and  post-election cooperation. "The nationals have turned down the  HZDS" and thus "voluntarily stepped on the road to power from  which there is no divergence.... The road-roller from Zlata  Idka (Meciar) is already rolling along it and he, as it is well  known, uses no by-passes, not to say traffic direction  indicators," the paper concludes.</p>

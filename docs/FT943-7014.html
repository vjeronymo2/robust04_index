			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz to buy VW engines Mercedes-Benz, the German maker of luxury and executive cars, is to buy engines from Volkswagen for use in a future passenger vehicle. It is the first time that Mercedes-Benz will have fitted another manufacturer's engines in one of its mainstream passenger vehicles, and is an important sign of its new readiness to develop alliances with other vehicle producers. The deal marks the second significant collaboration this year between two of Europe's biggest vehicle makers. In April VW agreed to license technology from Mercedes-Benz for the development of a new range of light commercial vehicles. Mercedes-Benz said yesterday that it is to purchase VW's VR6 engines and automatic gearboxes for use in its planned range of multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs), which are expected to be launched in early 1996. The new vehicle, to be named the Viano, will take Mercedes-Benz for the first time into one of the fastest growing segments of the European car market. The Viano will compete with established rivals such as the Renault Espace and new vehicles that are being launched by Peugeot, Fiat, Ford and VW itself. Mercedes-Benz said that engine and gearbox purchases from VW were expected to total around DM50m (Dollars 31.8m) a year. The Viano will be produced at the Mercedes-Benz plant at Vitoria, Spain, with a capacity of up to 25,000 units a year. Under the licensing deal announced earlier this year VW is to use Mercedes-Benz technology to develop a successor for its ageing LT range of heavy vans. Mercedes-Benz will also supply VW with components for the van, including steering gear, transmissions and axles worth around DM250m a year. Both deals represent part of the important consolidation taking place in the European vehicle industry, as makers seek to cut costs and reduce development times for new products.</p>

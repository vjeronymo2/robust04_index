			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  will have a separate meeting with opposition Democratic Party  Chairman Yi Ki-taek right after a Chongwadae [presidential  offices] luncheon Wednesday to exchange views on the North  Korean nuclear standoff and pending political issues.    At the meeting, the two will focus on the National Assembly  investigation of the Sangmudae scandal, which has been stalled  by related agencies refusing to produce documents requested by  parliamentary inspectors.    Wednesday's luncheon was arranged for Kim to brief leaders  of  the three government branches and chairmen of the ruling  Democratic Liberal Party and opposition Democratic Party on the  results of his recent visits to Russia and Uzbekistan.    Yi, recalling President Kim's promise at a May 28 meeting to  instruct the cabinet to cooperate in the parliamentary  investigation within legal limits, will urge Kim to make a  decision so the probe can proceed to a smooth conclusion while  the parliament's prestige is respected.    The president, explaining the need for international  sanctions against North Korea over its suspected nuclear arms  development program, will ask for the opposition party's  cooperation in a supra-partisan approach to diplomatic and  security issues, including the nuclear problem.    The opposition leader, noting that adopting sanctions is not  the best policy, will stress that the nuclear problem must be  settled peacefully in the United Nations and propose a direct  inter-Korean contact to find a solution.    On Kim's appointment of six new justices, Yi will ask the  president to exclude those who have cooperated with past  military governments.</p>

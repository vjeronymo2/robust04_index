			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Management: When fatal illness is a public affair - The executive's duty when serious sickness strikes What should the chief executive of a large quoted company do if he discovers that he has a serious, potentially fatal illness? How much of the problem should he make public, and when? This was the awful question which confronted Michael Walsh, chairman of US conglomerate Tenneco, on Tuesday last week when doctors told him he had a brain tumour. Walsh's response conformed with the face-the-facts regime he has imposed on the formerly flabby Tenneco since he took over as chief executive a year ago  -complete and immediate disclosure. He held telephone conference calls with securities analysts and the press early the following morning, in which he explained the nature of the problem, the treatment intended, and the median survival rate for patients in his condition (five to six years). He declared that he had virtually no symptoms, apart from a slight limp, and that the tumour would have no effect on his ability to carry out his job. A letter from his doctor supported this judgment. Why then, did he announce the news so quickly? Walsh said that if he had failed to act, rumour and speculation would have developed over his health, and this could have been damaging to investors in the company. 'Little deceptions become big deceptions.' he added. 'Pretty soon all your energies are going into managing the problem, not the business.' Numerous US lawyers and management consultants suggest that Walsh acted in an exemplary fashion - that full, frank and immediate disclosure of serious medical problems is in the best interests of a publicly quoted company and its shareholders. Indeed, US securities law obliges publicly quoted companies to disclosure facts when these are 'material' to its business. But as Keith Kearney, of New York lawyers Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell points out, this gives companies a fair degree of latitude in what they report on matters medical. Privately-owned US companies are under no legal obligation to report health problems. Coincidentally, this was underscored last week when TLC Beatrice, a foods group, only disclosed that its chairman, Reginald Lewis, had brain cancer the day before he died. Publicly tracking the course of a disease can be much more of a grey area than initial disclosure of the problem, pitting respect for an individual's privacy and suffering against shareholders' right to know. Time Warner faced this when Steven Ross, chairman and creator of the giant media group, was found to have prostate cancer. The company revealed the problem in November 1991 but insisted for months that Ross remained in control of the business, while working from home. It announced last June that he had taken temporary leave of absence for further treatment. Ross died in December. Walsh has waived all confidentiality about his medical condition with Tenneco's board, which will be kept fully informed by his doctors and will then have to decide what, if anything, to make public. Admirers of Walsh are hoping that no news will be good news.</p>

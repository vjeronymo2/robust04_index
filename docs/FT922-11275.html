			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Leading Article: Isolating Serbia THERE IS now a very broad international consensus that Serbia bears the largest share of responsibility for the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina, and that the man who can stop it, if anyone, is the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic. That should not be taken as implying that Serbia alone is to blame. Croatia, though publicly supporting Bosnia's independence and territorial integrity, appears to be playing a double game which will allow it either to absorb the whole republic into some kind of anti-Serb confederation or, if that fails, to annex the areas of western Hercegovina and northern Bosnia which have a substantial Croat population. And even the Moslem president of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, has recently shown signs of reneging on his previous moderation, by speaking of a Moslem republic rather than a multinational one. The Serbs, for their part, do have some valid arguments. In refusing to let the issue of independence be settled by majority vote they are invoking precisely the same logic that was used against them when they suggested a nationwide referendum to settle the fate of Yugoslavia. In such cases a vote proves only that one community is larger than the other. Nor is it true that Mr Milosevic is in complete control of their actions. As in Croatia, much of the actual fighting is being done by irregular forces with no clear chain of command. The federal army, many of whose officers are themselves Bosnian Serbs, is certainly not neutral, but it does not fully control the local commanders; nor is it directly answerable to Mr Milosevic. Small enclave What clearly is true, however, in spite of his denials, is that many of the irregular forces do emanate from Serbia, and that they have embarked on a strategy of evicting the Moslems from the towns of eastern Bosnia, until all of them are bottled up in a small enclave around Sarajevo. The international community is casting around for ways of convincing the Serbs that this strategy does not serve their best interests. Military intervention on the ground is most unlikely and in such a complex situation would almost certainly do more harm than good - though the option of an air strike should be kept in reserve to deter the federal airforce from intervening. The main focus for the time being is on ways of isolating Serbia. The only European state which seems intent on thwarting this, and thereby encouraging Serbia in a self-destructive policy, is Greece. This is to be explained partly by solidarity among Orthodox Christians, but more particularly by a shared hostility towards independent Macedonia. Self-defeating policy Trapped by an inflamed public opinion and a demagogic opposition, the Greek government is looking increasingly foolish, and isolating itself within the EC. It is very unwise to brush aside the explicit renunciation of territorial claims which Macedonia has written into its constitution, and thereby to undermine the political standing of the moderate and statesmanlike Macedonian president, Mr Kiro Gligorov. Moreover, its blockade of Macedonia has the effect of cutting the overland route by which Greek goods reach central and northern Europe, and many European tourists reach Greece. There could hardly be a more self-defeating policy. Greece's attitude makes it unlikely that an oil embargo on Serbia would succeed, since oil can reach Serbia through the Greek port of Salonica. Nor can sanctions do much more damage than has already been done to the ruined Serbian economy. In adopting any such measures foreign governments must not lose sight of the objective, which can only be to make the Serbs reflect seriously on the future they are building for themselves: a future in which they would have to reckon with the irreconcilable hostility of their neighbours, whose territory would be crowded with refugees demanding the restoration of their homes. Even now a political agreement, under which the Serbs of Bosnia would agree to support and participate in an independent Bosnian government while retaining links with their kith and kin in Serbia proper, offers a far more hopeful prospect.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC shows it is ready to compete for grain exports THE EUROPEAN Community has shown that it will be ready to compete with the US and other leading grain exporters when the 1992-93 season starts in July, European traders said yesterday, reports Reuter. Last week the EC's cereals management committee announced that it would open tenders on June 3 to export 3.1m tonnes of grain out of intervention stores in July and August. 'We like to make an early start to the export season,' an EC grain official in Brussels said. The sales from intervention will help to ensure the flow of shipments until EC new crop supplies arrive. The EC usually harvests its wheat crop in August, whereas the US starts to export in June. 'Brussels has shown it is ready to snap up any early export business,' a German grain manager said. Germany, which holds nearly half of EC grain intervention stocks, was allocated 1.4m tonnes of wheat, barley and rye at last week's tenders. 'The tenders bridge the gap between the old and new crops,' a UK agriculture official said, adding they were customary. They will also help to trim record EC intervention stocks and clear storage space for new crop grain. EC intervention stocks are expected to total some 28m tonnes at the end of June, up from 18.7m a year earlier. The surplus has been swelled by delays in shipments to the Commonwealth of Independent States and by a huge 1991 crop of just over 180.5m tonnes, including the former East Germany, up from 169.7m in 1990. Stocks rose despite increased intervention exports accounting for about a third of total exports, their highest ever share, traders said. Last week's intervention tenders are only a guideline. 'The market is sensitive to such signals so the volumes were a compromise,' the EC official said, adding they could later be raised according to demand. Bigger volumes could have depressed the new crop market. The price outlook is mildly bearish because of a lack of buyers and the prospect of a recovery in the world wheat crop, traders said, adding that dry weather could quickly change the scenario.</p>

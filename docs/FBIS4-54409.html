			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- The activity of Austrian  politicians concerning the completion of the Temelin nuclear  power plant in south Bohemia should not be seen as a threat to  or violation of the Czech Republic's sovereignty, Czech Premier  Vaclav Klaus told Parliament today.    He said steps taken on the issue by some Austrian  politicians  should not serve as a reason for the Czech diplomacy to resort  to resolute actions the consequences of which might hamper the  Czech Republic's relations with Austria.    Czech-Austrian relations in the power industry are defined  by  a Czech-Austrian agreement on nuclear security and protection  against radiation. According to the agreement, experts from  both countries meet annually and Austrian representatives are  informed on all Czech goals concerning the use of nuclear power.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has offered  Refa'el Eytan the police and internal security portfolio. If  Tzomet joins the government, it will receive the environment  portfolio as well. In a meeting scheduled for tomorrow, Rabin  and Peres will attempt to soften Meretz in anticipation of  Tzomet's inclusion in the government. Our party affairs  correspondent Yaron Deqel has the details:    The Eytan-Rabin contacts began a long time ago. In today's  meeting with Likud members, Eytan revealed nothing at all. A  nocturnal meeting between the Tzomet chairman and the prime  minister on 28 February gave birth to a written document  detailing points of agreement between the two. Today the Tzomet  Knesset members [MK's] received from Eytan -- each one  individually -- information about the document.    The Labor-Tzomet document stipulates that Refa'el Eytan will  be police minister in charge of Israel's internal security.  Tzomet will receive another portfolio -- the environment -- and  if that happens, Minister Sarid may be appointed information  minister.    In the document, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin pledges not to  harm the Jewish settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza and to  permit 5,000 completed housing units to be occupied.    Today the Tzomet chairman invited NRP [National Religious  Party] leader Zvulun Hammer and apprised him of the possibility  that Tzomet may join the coalition. [passage omitted] The NRP  is not involved in the Tzomet-Labor political moves at this  point.    The prime minister informed Shim'on Peres of the details two  days ago. The meeting was attended also by Histadrut official  Giyora 'Eyni, who along with Tzomet MK Pini Badash had  negotiated Tzomet's inclusion in the government.    Tomorrow Rabin and Peres will meet with Meretz ministers.  Ministers Shahal and Sarid are still in the dark about the prime  minister's plan to give their portfolios away to Tzomet people.  The move seems to be coming together.</p>

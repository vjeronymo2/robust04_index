			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Observer: Fate of the art Amid all the fuss about what's to happen to British Rail's multi-billion-pound pension fund, one little detail seems to have been missed. Who gets the art collection? British Rail's decision to invest Pounds 40m of its workers' pension monies in works of art in the 1970s has proved to be one of its more imaginative business decisions. Helped by Sotheby's, BR bought 2,200 high-quality objects from Old Masters and Impressionists to Chinese antiquities. Luckily it got rid of most of them before the art bubble burst in 1989, and reckons to have earned an annual return after inflation of 6 per cent on its investment. With the Impressionists, including important works by Renoir and Monet, it did much better. Having put in Pounds 3.4m, it recouped 10 times as much just before that particular segment of the market's technicolour collapse. Only around 350 objects remain in the collection but they include some of the finest canvases, particularly of the Old Master kind. There is a striking Van Dyck of the Little Princesses, on loan to the National Gallery of Scotland, and a Goya Bullfight currently thrilling aficionados in the Fitzwilliam. A similar Goya sold in December for almost Pounds 5m. Somehow Observer suspects that, if the remnants of the collection pass into the Treasury's hands, they will either be off-loaded at just the wrong moment or stuck in some anonymous warehouse. Perhaps the pension fund trustees should strike first, and hand what's left to the railway museum at York.</p>

According to a press  statement released here by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan  [PUK], the regime's leadership started to mass large numbers of  infantry and tanks east of the city of Karkuk along the front  line with the Kurdish forces. It was also stockpiling weapons  and equipment, and transporting about 60 tanks from the city of  Tikrit to the Khalid military camp near Karkuk. The statement  cited a party official in the regime, Muhammad Hasan al-Zubaydi,  as having told the inhabitants of (al-Hujah) area that "the  regime is worried about the possibility of a popular uprising in  the city of Karkuk and its environs and calls on all to arm  themselves to defend the city." The statement added: We bring  the attention of world public opinion, those concerned about  human rights and friends to the adverse consequences and the  monstrous massacres that could take place if the regime succeeds  in carrying out its plans against the northern areas. The  statement also reported that the regime had recently arrested a  group of retired military men in the city of Karkuk; their fate  was still unknown. The regime's authorities had also planted a  large number of agents in the midst of the people of the city  and increased its military presence fearing a popular explosion  against it. In another statement the Iraqi opposition movement  said that the aircraft of the Iraqi regime had recently bombed  the (Albu Namr) tribe in the area of (Hiziri) which is part of  Ramadi Province, as a result of which many members of the tribe  were killed or injured.</p>

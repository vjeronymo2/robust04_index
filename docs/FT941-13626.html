			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Technology: Clinton's trio of successes - Technically Speaking The administration of US president Bill Clinton had very mixed fortunes in its first year, but its efforts to promote government science and technology programmes were rewarded with three successes. As a result, these now have a better chance of contributing more directly to the US economy. One important achievement was the administration's work in the last days of the Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks to have the draft text revised to allow government-industry research partnerships to proceed largely free of Gatt red tape. Such partnerships are a keystone of Clinton's technology policy, one aim of which is to develop basic research insights into competitive new products. The 1990 draft text made government subsidies of industry projects liable to retaliatory action. Government subsidies to industry for basic research that were more than 50 per cent of a project's total cost were actionable, as were government subsidies of an industry applied research project for more than 23 per cent of the total. The Gatt draft text had elaborate requirements for advance notice by those forming such partnerships. Also, other nations could seek penalties through Gatt if they deemed a subsidy hurt their trade. This draft Gatt text would have made it risky for government officials to sign up industry research, as they do now on a range of scientific and technological projects. It would, for example, have imperilled the National Institute of Health's relationships with biotechnology companies. Computing the government's share in such projects would have been a nightmare. It would also have been open to dispute, and therefore to trade retaliation, if the Gatt subsidies committee judged the calculation wrong. The prospect of retaliation from other governments if a government-industry partnership invented a pioneering product might even dissuade companies from forming such partnerships. In November, science officials confronted US trade officials in a meeting of Clinton's new National Economic Council, and the Gatt text was changed in a last-minute session in Brussels. The new text exempts all government-industry partnerships formed for undirected basic research. Partnerships for industrial research are exempt if the government share is less than 75 per cent. A new category of 'pre-competitive development' subsidies are allowed if the government share is 30 per cent or less. A second success was the approval of a new National Science and Technology Council in the White House. It will be on a par with the NEC, the National Security Council, and the Domestic Policy Council. Like these it will be a forum to arbitrate conflicting agency positions. The chairman will be the president, though vice-president Al Gore may effectively be the chairman, while the day-to-day job will probably fall to Jack Gibbons, the president's science adviser. The council, along with its sub-committees, is to co-ordinate the Dollars 76bn (Pounds 51bn) government research and development programme, now spread among dozens of agencies. It will decide how to implement tasks such as basic research, communications and health. Importantly, Clinton wants this new council to decide - with the Office of Management and Budget - how funds should be allocated among competing agencies. Clinton's third achievement was to get Congress to fund his research and technology investments during the wrestling match with Congress over the budget for fiscal 1994. Despite the feverish budget-cutting mood of Congress and Clinton's agreement to cap federal spending for five years, research survived - civilian research even increased. The president also obtained funds for the technology investments he most wanted: the 'clean' car, the data superhighway and global climate research.</p>

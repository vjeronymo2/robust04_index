			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional behind rise at CCS AN exceptional credit arising from restructuring was behind a return to the black at CCS Group, the USM-quoted builders' merchant. After the credit of Pounds 1.49m, pre-tax profits for the half year to April 30 amounted to Pounds 1.5m, against losses of Pounds 38,000. G Blagg, the group's sole trading subsidiary, returned 'creditable figures in a difficult environment' directors said. Operating profits were Pounds 39,000 (Pounds 26,000). Earnings per share emerged at 9.47p (losses of 0.24p) or 0.1p (losses of 0.08p) excluding exceptionals. The directors were currently engaged in discussions which could lead to 'significant developments' in the company's interests.</p>

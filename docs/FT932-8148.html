			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs attack intervention in brewing industry AN ALL-PARTY committee of MPs yesterday slammed the government for meddling in the brewing industry. Intervention had caused 'unnecessary expense and turbulence' for brewing companies and 'distress and uncertainty' for pub tenants, the agriculture committee said. In a critical report on government action following the Monopolies and Mergers Commission 1989 inquiry into the industry, the committee said consumers had gained little benefit. A 17 per cent real increase in the price of beer since 1989 was 'a clear indictment' of the effects of orders which forced national brewers to free a third of their pubs from exclusive beer supplies. 'Far from increasing consumer choice within some regions, the effect has been to increase the strength of some local and regional monopolies which are just as pernicious, if not more so, as the complex monopoly allegedly existing in the national market,' the MPs said. Closures of rural pubs and the decline in the numbers of beers available nationally were further signs of the failure of the policy. The only 'unarguable success' had been the introduction of guest beers which pub tenants were allowed to buy from brewers other than their landlords. Questioning the need for the government's forceful intervention, which cost the industry Pounds 500m in restructuring, the committee said: 'We consider that reform of the licensing laws could have gone much of the way to introducing greater competition with far less traumatic results,' adding that such action should now be taken quickly. Much of the confusion within the industry over the past four years could have been avoided if a clear strategic path had been established from the outset, the report said. But there was evidence that both the MMC and the government had failed to understand the mechanics of competition in the supply of beer. The MMC's strategy, directed towards brand availability and price, was bound to miss its target; and there was no clear rationale for the government's course of action. The committee said competition and consumer choice should now be encouraged without further intrusive and burdensome regulation. The committee recommended a reduction in duties on alcoholic drinks to bring them closer to EC rates and said it would be sensible to tax drinks on alcoholic content. The Brewers' Society welcomed the report which, it said, confirmed its view that the MMC investigation and subsequent government orders 'reflected poorly on the administration of competition policy.'

The message reads: To the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song,  the sun of the nation:    We rang out a year of rewarding struggle in which we  advanced  along the chuche banner and are greeting the hopeful new year of  1994. The SKNDF Central Committee respectfully sends the first  greeting of wishing the great leader long life with the  consistent expressions of congratulations by all the vanguard  fighters and patriotic masses of various strata of the South.    The last year of 1993 was a historic year in which national  prestige of the chuche Korea was exalted further in the entire  world under the outstanding leadership of the great leader and  in which a new advance was made in the struggle of the 70  million fellow countrymen for national reunification. The  respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who adds  luster to the chuche chronicles with his unequalled exploits,  made brilliant achievements for the times and mankind last year  with his deep insight into the rapidly changing situational  demands and with his energetic ideological and theoretical  activities and great practice of the revolution.    Last year was marked by the culmination of the antisocialist  maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries to isolate,  stifle [chilsik], and crush [apsal] the Northern half of the  country and pull down the socialist fortress. The great leader  overcame and made a breakthrough in the manifold difficulties  and trials with his tested leadership, ever-victorious wisdom  and strategy, and the might of the wholehearted unity of the  leader, the party, and the masses, thus powerfully demonstrating  to the entire world the justness and invincibility of the chuche  socialist cause.    The celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the 7 July  war victory, which were grandly observed amid great admiration  of the people at home and abroad, were great festivities of both  our nation and mankind that built up as an everlasting  historical monument the immortal achievements of the respected  and beloved leader, who leads the cause of independence and the  cause of socialism of our times along the ever-victorious road.  They were a great epic, which vividly proved the chuche truth  that the people who pioneer their destiny independently and  creatively, upholding the great leader and under the leadership  of the leader, are ever-victorious.    With the noble idea of believing in the people as in heaven,  the great leader has devoted his entire life to the masses,  setting off on a life journey -- boarding a mass-oriented train.  Everywhere he gave sacred on-the-spot guidance, which he gave  so many times last year, miracles and innovations were brought  forth, enabling the brethren in the North to brilliantly  conclude the final year of the Third Seven-Year Plan in the  unprecedented world economic recession and achieved the  triumphant bumper crop, thus providing the firm foundation of  self-reliant economy.    The 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth Workers' Party of  Korea  [WPK] Central Committee, which proudly summed up the Third  Seven-Year Plan and put forth the revolutionary economic  strategy, marked another resplendent chapter in the glorious  history of the WPK, which victoriously pioneers the  hitherto-uncultivated chuche socialism under the tested  leadership of the great leader and the dear comrade leader. In  the land of the North, where the great leader's politics of  benevolence is in full bloom, all the people enthusiastically  put into practice last year the noble, beautiful traits of  devoting themselves silently to the party, the leader, the  group, and comrades without seeking any honor or compensation.  Thus, the North society highly demonstrated its prestige as the  crystal of wholehearted loyalty and filial duty and as a solid  sociopolitical living organism.    Last year, when there was the acute and serious  confrontation  between socialism and capitalism, the great leader firmly held  the control lever of history and elucidated clearly the  direction and position of the times, thus enabling the world's  progressive people to advance continuously along the road of  anti-imperialist cause for independence and of the movement of  rebuilding socialism.    The great leader, who is the lodestar of the fatherland's  reunification, presented last year the 10-point program of the  great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the  fatherland, which is comprehensive of the lofty spirit of  nation-loving and national independence, thus vigorously  arousing the 70 million fellow countrymen to the struggle to  realize the cause of the fatherland's reunification in the  nineties.    The great leader has verified Tangun as the originator of  our  nation, who actually lived, thus hardening the belief of all  fellow countrymen that they are a unitary nation inheriting a  5,000-year history and enabling them to achieve national harmony  and great unity.    With boundless happiness and pride in living and struggling  with the great leader as the sun of the nation, we stoutly  carried out the patriotic struggle to pioneer the nation's  destiny last year.    Our masses in the South made a counterattack on the  antidemocratic, antinational, and antireunification group, which  has strangled democracy with feigned reforms, taken pro-United  States and pro-Japanese flunkeyism and betrayal of the nation to  intensify its subordination, and pushed South-North relations to  the dangerous situation on the brink of war by pursuing  anticommunism and anti-North confrontation since the military  dictatorship turned into the civilian fascism. By doing so,  they have unveiled the current regime's mask of a civilian  government and deepened the crisis of the colonial fascist  system.    Through our struggle in a grave situation last year, we came  to bear even more firmly the faith that we will achieve the  victory of the cause of independence, democracy, and  reunification without fail as long as we have the great leader  and the immortal chuche idea.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is indeed a benevolent  sun that leads our SKNDF and other patriotic masses of various  circles to ceaselessly follow the patriotic road to  independence, democracy, and reunification under the banner of  struggle, without wavering in the colonial fascist forces'  persistent temptation and unyielding under any outrageous  reactionary offensive, no matter how giddily the dirty flood of  betrayal and reform overflows from the countries where  capitalism has been rehabilitated. The immortal chuche idea is  a brilliant beacon for pioneering our destinies.    In the new year, we will accelerate modeling the SKNDF and  the ranks of the movement for changes after the chuche idea,  under the brilliant chuche rays and substantially carry out work  to make the masses in various classes and strata have  consciousness and to organize them by using the respected and  beloved leader's memoir. By doing so, we will strengthen the  independent main forces of the national and democratic movement  in every way.    We will imminently and daringly organize and carry out the  mass struggle to smash the current traitorous regime that  pursues flunkeyism, nation-selling, and war, so that we can  mature the situation of the movement for changes on our own  initiative. We will also create a wind of nationwide advance  for independent reunification, upholding the 10-point program of  the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the  fatherland, and will make 1994 a historic year of national  reconciliation and unity.    Although the road of struggle is arduous and formidable, our  just cause will obtain victory without fail as long as the great  leader exists and the chuche banner vigorously flies at the  front.    This morning of the new year when the ardor of admiring and  following the chuche sun is filled in every place, the SKNDF  Central Committee conveys the wish of all the vanguard fighters  and masses of various classes and strata in the South for the  longevity of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song who is a  peerless patriot, a legendary hero, and the father of the nation.    [Signed] The SKNDF Central Committee    [Issued] 1 January 1994, Seoul</p>

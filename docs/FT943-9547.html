			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean exporters feel the heat - An economic warning sent to the island nations Caribbean commodity exporters have been warned that their foreign markets will become limited unless they improve production efficiency and the quality of their products. The warning is from the Caribbean Development Bank, which says that the region is also threatened by changes to the preferential export markets on which its commodities have been dependent. 'The preferential markets, at subsidised prices, account for a significant share of regional output,' says the bank, in its report on the performance of the region's commodities in 1993. 'This has increased the region's vulnerability to adverse changes in these arrangements, at the same time that the arrangements have contributed substantially to regional incomes and employment.' The Barbados-based bank, which provides loans for 17 members, and which has resources of Dollars 827m, with its main contributors being the US, Canada, the UK, France and Germany, offers little hope for a turnaround in the waning fortunes of the region's economies, all of which recorded declines last year. The region's sugar industry was affected last year by poor weather, and production fell by 3 per cent to 730,000 tonnes, with only St Kitts-Nevis, the smallest producer in the group, recording an increase. The largest fall, of 10 per cent, was in Barbados where the industry recorded its lowest output in decades, and had difficulty meeting its commitments to the European Union, the US and the domestic market. The largest absolute decline was in Jamaica where output fell by about 8,000 tonnes, the bank reported. Cane farmers in Belize were attracted by higher prices offered by molasses producers, resulting in a slight decline in raw sugar production. The region's bauxite producers - Guyana and Jamaica - recorded declines in ore production in 1993, with their cumulative output falling by 4.8 per cent to 12.09m tonnes. 'The performance of the industry in the region continued to be disappointing,' the bank says. 'In both countries, performance was affected by weak international prices.' The Jamaican industry, however, reported a 2.8 per cent increase in alumina production last year to reach 2.98m tonnes. Guyana's production of bauxite was affected by the flooding of some mines from heavy rain, and worker unrest, said industry spokesmen. Output of crude petroleum in Trinidad and Tobago fell last year 'in line with the declining pattern in recent years, despite the stimulation offered the industry by changes in petroleum taxation arrangements to encourage exploration', the bank says. The maturation of main oil fields and reduction in drilling reduced Trinidad and Tobago's crude oil production to an average 123,800 barrels a day in 1993, against daily average production of 135,800 barrels a day in 1992. The decline reflected a decrease in drilling in the year, with the total depth drilled being 68,500m, 10.3 per cent less than the previous year. The industry also suffered from a decline in oil prices, which averaged Dollars 18.45 a barrel, against Dollars 20.58 in 1992. 'The government's 1993 budget had been predicated on an average price of Dollars 21 per barrel of petroleum, with the result that measures to restrain expenditure were brought into effect,' the bank says. Barbados' small industry yielded 459,500 barrels of crude last year, a fall of 4 per cent. This accounted for 32 per cent of domestic requirements. 'The medium-term prospect is for continued decline in crude production in Trinidad and Tobago, with the outlook for international prices not being particularly encouraging,' it says. 'However, prospects for increased production of natural gas are promising as substantial investments are programmed over the medium term.' The depreciation of sterling against the US dollar and changes in the EU's import regime depressed banana production and earnings in the Windward Islands, according to the report. St Lucia's exports fell 13 per cent, while shipments from St Vincent declined 22 per cent. Export earnings averaged 30 per cent less. 'Although prices were similarly affected in Jamaica and Belize, higher production efficiencies in these countries led to an expansion in output,' the bank says. The industry's performance in the Windwards was also affected by 'poor management of the banana price shock on the part of the growers' associations' and unrest among farmers, mainly in St Lucia. The bank warns: 'The new European importing arrangements will require substantial increases in banana efficiency in the Windward Islands, together with a significant improvement in fruit quality, at the same time that unit prices will trend downwards to more closely reflect the lower price of Latin American fruit. 'The situation will be further influenced by . . . continuing allegations of inconsistency between the new banana regime and the new general agreement on tariffs and trade arrangements.'</p>

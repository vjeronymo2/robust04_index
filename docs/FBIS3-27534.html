U.S. policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina experienced a major  change over the past two weeks. Originally the United States  objected to any attempt to exert pressure on the Moslem  "victims," maintaining that the arms embargo on the Bosnian  Moslems should be lifted. But now the United States has changed  its mind, asking the Moslems to give up armed resistance and  accept the offer to open negotiations in pursuit of a solution  to the dispute. It was originally opposed to the peace plan  based on a partition between the Serbs and Moslems in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, but now it has begun to persuade the Moslems  to accept the partition plan. Originally the United States had  always maintained a hard line against the Bosnian Serbs and  stressed the need for sanctions and military action against  them, but now it has suggested that the United Nations lift step  by step the economic sanctions against the Serbs.    After the NATO summit, especially after the tragedy caused  by  the bombing of civilians in Sarajevo on 5 February, the  settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict has become a more  and more pressing need. The further extension of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina war will inevitably impaired NATO's  reputation to an extreme extent, and will be unfavorable to the  efforts to consolidate relations between the United States and  its European allies as well. So U.S. policymakers have begun to  consider a readjustment of their Bosnia-Herzegovina policy.  They have changed some hardline measures that used to be  practiced in the past, and started playing a more active part in  seeking a solution to the issue. Clinton's speech serves as a  concrete indication of this change, and it has also clearly  defined the orientation of the updated U.S. policy toward  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    First of all, in his speech Clinton stressed that the United  States, as the only existing superpower, cannot give up its  leadership over global affairs, and its involvement in the  settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict is in line with  U.S. interests. The U.S. policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina has  undergone several stages since Clinton assumed office at the  White House last year. At first, the United States proposed  lifting the arms embargo on the Moslem armed forces, which was  vetoed by European countries. After that, the United States sent  airplanes on the mission aimed at ensuring the delivery of  relief supplies to the people in distress. Later on, it  advocated an air raid operation against the Serb armed forces,  which was given up, again because of British and French  opposition. For quite a while, the stance taken by the United  States had made an impression on Europe that it was looking on  at others' trouble with indifference. Now that the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is further deteriorating and Britain and  France have shown a greater flexibility on the air raid  proposal, the United States will lose its leadership over the  NATO if it still keeps looking on at the conflict with  indifference. Under such circumstances, the United States needs  to readjust its Bosnia-Herzegovina policy.    Second, the United States, while wanting to retain its  leadership over global affairs, does not want to be involved too  deeply in the conflict in Europe. In his speech Clinton  stressed that Europe "must assume the major responsibility" for  settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict. The protracted  Cold War has very much worn out the United States. Nowadays it  can no longer meddle or directly play a part in regional  conflicts wherever it wants to as it once did. Therefore, more  and more Americans maintain that they should first deal with  domestic problems. And this tendency has been highlighted in  the Clinton administration's Bosnia-Herzegovina policy. The  United States will take a more cautious attitude toward direct  military involvement abroad in particular. In his speech  Clinton emphasized the United States has not dispatched and is  not intending to dispatch any ground force to Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Third, while dealing with the European security issue, the  United States needs to properly handle its relations with Russia  as well. For the moment, despite the many economic difficulties  it is facing, Russia remains quite influential militarily and  politically. Recently, in assuming a dominant posture, Russia  first managed to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the  conditions set by the NATO in the ultimatum and withdraw their  heavy arms from Sarajevo or turn them over to the UN  peacekeeping forces. After that, Russia decided to send troops  to join the U.N. peacekeeping force in their Bosnia- Herzegovina  mission. Russia's moves have shown the world that the  settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict would be  impossible without Russia's participation. The Clinton  administration, surprised at Russia's act at first, could not  but give it a welcome with reservations afterward. In his  speech President Clinton said: Russia has made an important  contribution to bringing forth a change in the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    According to analyses by the U.S. press, in adjusting its  Bosnia- Herzegovina policy and changing its mind to support its  European allies' partition plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  Clinton administration's greatest expectation is that all the  parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina will achieve a sustained armistice  under the threat of the NATO's ultimatum, so that the United  States will be exempted from direct military involvement in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict.</p>

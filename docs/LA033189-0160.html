			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SILVER ALLIANCE;  </P> <P> FAR-FROM-RETIRING ACTIVISTS MAKE LEISURE WORLD A POLITICAL FORCE  </P> <P> When Vice President Dan Quayle was stumping for votes last fall in a race  marred by allegations that he had used family connections to avoid active duty  in Vietnam, his campaign managers made sure his itinerary included a stop at  Leisure World in Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> They figured he would be guaranteed a warm reception, and they were right. With  less than two days' notice, Leisure World's Republican Club had no trouble  filling a meeting hall with a sympathetic crowd of about 1,000 people.  </P> <P> Herbert Schwartz, president of the Republican Club, grinned as he remembered  Quayle's visit -- and the time last year when he asked state Sen. William  Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) to speak at a Republican Club meeting at Leisure  World.  </P> <P> He didn't have to ask twice.  </P> <P> Although Campbell, whose district extends to the retirement community, was  immersed in legislative business, he flew down from Sacramento, gave the speech  and flew back, all in one evening.  </P> <P> Quayle and Campbell are among a long list of politicians, primarily  Republicans, who have received warm welcomes behind Leisure World's 6-foot-high  walls. Other Republicans have included Ronald Reagan (during his bid for the  presidency in 1976), Gov. George Deukmejian, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, state Sen.  Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach and a host of local politicians.  </P> <P> Ken Khachigian, a San Clemente lawyer who was a chief strategist for the Quayle  campaign and a senior adviser to Deukmejian during his last run for governor,  said, "I would never think of going through a Republican statewide campaign --  or a countywide campaign -- without sending the candidate to Leisure World."  </P> <P> National, state and local Republican politicians' eagerness to speak to this  group of voters is a telling measure of the well-organized political clout the  retirement community has amassed to protect its interests and its life style.  </P> <P> On the eve of the community's 25th anniversary celebration, residents are more  outspoken than ever, with their attention focused on the proposal for Laguna  Hills cityhood that will be put to a public vote June 6. If Laguna Hills  becomes the county's 29th city, Leisure World is expected to be its largest,  best-organized and most vocal constituency.  </P> <P> For Republican politicians, the logic of choosing Leisure World as a prime  stumping ground is obvious, Schwartz said.  </P> <P> Leisure World's Republican Club -- whose membership of 1,200 swells to 2,000 in  election years -- claims to be the largest in the country. (The community's  Democratic Club has 250 members, but President Helen Mills said membership has  been slowly growing in recent years.)  </P> <P> Voter registration within Leisure World is 62% Republican, 32% Democrat --  compared to 55% Republican, 35% Democrat countywide, according to the county  registrar of voters. (The American Assn. of Retired Persons estimates that  about 40% of its members -- age 50 and over -- are Republican, 40% Democrat.)  </P> <P> And Leisure World residents are more politically active than the rest of the  county, with 78% of them registered to vote, compared to 53% of the county  population.  </P> <P> "Our generation was brought up to vote," said Marion Miller D'Onofrio, a past  president of Leisure World's Republican Club and one of five Leisure World  residents chosen by lawmakers to serve as delegates to the state Republican  convention in February.  </P> <P> Leisure World represents the most formidably organized constituency in the  state, said a spokeswoman for Campbell, who recently introduced legislation to  increase benefits for retired teachers. The legislation, which is backed by the  governor and is now in committee, was the direct result of pressure from some  of Campbell's Leisure World constituency, the spokeswoman noted.  </P> <P> Although residents may contribute privately to candidates or campaigns, the  Republican Club does no fund raising. Political fund-raiser Jackie Campbell of  Huntington Beach, whose clients include Wilson, said she doesn't look to  Leisure World residents for big political donations. However, she said, Leisure  World residents contribute many "invaluable" volunteer hours, stuffing and  stamping direct-mail campaign literature and mounting voter registration  drives.  </P> <P> Leisure World was never intended to be a politically active community. Indeed,  community rules discourage public displays of political fervor -- posting  placards, posters or handbills is forbidden.  </P> <P> When it opened in September, 1964, developer Ross W. Cortese envisioned Leisure  World as a secure community for people 55 and over who, after raising families  or pursuing careers, were ready to settle into leisurely life styles, the  developer said in a recent interview at his office in Laguna Hills. Activities  in the 2,100-acre compound would center on such pursuits as golf, gardening,  horseback riding and social clubs. It would be a planned, self-sufficient  community with its own bus and security systems and maintenance facilities.  Within the secure walls, life would be quiet, neat and litter free. If  residents wanted to turn their backs on the outside world, well, they had  earned -- and were paying for -- that right.  </P> <P> Early on, the chore of governing this unincorporated community of about 21,000  residents was distributed among 80 small mutual associations run by residents  and set up to represent different segments of the community. But the multitude  of independent governing bodies proved to be unwieldy for a community of this  size. They were eventually consolidated into three:  </P> <P> United Laguna Hills Mutual, with 11 directors, representing 6,323 co-op units.  </P> <P> Third Laguna Hills Mutual, with 15 directors, representing 6,102 condominium  units.  </P> <P> Laguna Hills Mutual 50, with five directors and 311 units, represents a segment  called The Towers, two 14-story, full-service, high-rise buildings where such  amenities as three meals a day and maid and laundry service are provided.  </P> <P> From the governing ranks of these mutuals are chosen the 15 elected directors  of the Golden Rain Foundation of Laguna Hills, the main governing body that  sets policy for all the mutuals and whose role is comparable to that played by  a city council. The foundation is charged with maintaining the six clubhouses  -- including an 834-seat amphitheater -- five swimming pools, two professional  golf courses, eight tennis courts, equestrian center, bus system and  closed-circuit television station. The foundation also oversees a security  system that includes 14 guarded entrances staffed by 250 Leisure World  residents who work part time and 22 residents who work full time as security  guards.  </P> <P> Russell L. Disbro, general manager of Professional Community Management Inc.,  which is responsible for administering Leisure World's approximately  $63-million annual budget, said Leisure World is best described as a giant  homeowners association, where residents pay average monthly fees ranging from  $225 to $300. When fee hikes are periodically proposed, residents -- whose  condos sell for an estimated $60,000 to $600,000 today -- tend to protest loud  and hard.  </P> <P> But over the years, as the surrounding pasturelands have been replaced by a  bulging, congested suburban community, the residents' activism has been  directed increasingly at changes occurring outside their gates.  </P> <P> Leisure World's citizens have responded to outside threats to their status quo  with a fervor, organization and commitment usually associated with a  grass-roots environmental or consumer movement. At some Orange County Planning  Commission meetings, for example, they have been reprimanded for booing and  being generally unruly, noted Myra Neben, editor of the Leisure World News. She  has tracked the residents' political activities for the past 12 years and  considers the community one of the largest concentrations of actively "astute,  politically conscious" people anywhere.  </P> <P> "They have the time to be active, the time to write letters, to go to  meetings," Neben said.  </P> <P> Many also are used to exercising their influence, having retired from top-level  positions at major corporations.  </P> <P> And not all of the community's political activists are Republicans.  </P> <P> Minna Liebman, a Democrat, chuckles at the notion that she is an endangered  species there. She describes herself as "left of liberal" but also a  "pragmatist."  </P> <P> Liebman recently stepped down as president of the Gray Panthers' Leisure World  chapter, which she co-founded and headed for nearly a decade. She continues to  work with the organization, an activist group that lobbies for rights for the  elderly and is now pushing for a national health care program that would  benefit both young and old.  </P> <P> During the last election, Liebman organized an appearance at Leisure World by  consumer activist Ralph Nader, who was campaigning for Proposition 103 to  reform the insurance industry. About 700 people turned out for his speech.  </P> <P> Liebman, 76, stands just short of 5 feet, but the energy concentrated into her  small frame would be the envy of a college student. She finds the local chapter  of the American Assn. of Retired Persons too reticent. "All they want to do is  play bingo," she sniffed.  </P> <P> The activism of people like Liebman has caused developers as well as  politicians to take notice. Commercial and residential developers are careful  to touch base with Leisure World's planning review committee on projects they  want to build adjacent to the retirement community. And it is not unusual for  developers to change building plans to accommodate the committee's requests or  objections.  </P> <P> Carol Hoffman, a senior director with the Irvine Co. who has dealt extensively  with Leisure World on the 3,200-acre Laguna Laurel residential and commercial  shopping center project, said her company wouldn't think of not showing the  Leisure World review committee its plans for developments that will be adjacent  to the community. It would be foolish to get to the Planning Commission stage  and have a contingent of angry Leisure World residents show up to object, she  said. The Irvine Co., in fact, scaled back the density of its Laguna Laurel  project because Leisure World was concerned about increased traffic, Hoffman  noted.  </P> <P> Hoffman described Leisure World representatives as "aggressive in forwarding  their objectives" but also a pleasure to deal with because they are astute  about the review process and do their homework.  </P> <P> Developers have been generous in donating to Leisure World's 25-year  anniversary celebration, which involves a series of special events beginning  Saturday and continuing through Sept. 10. The Kathryn G. Thompson Development  Co. of Irvine, which is building the Audubon project near Leisure World, tops  the list of donors with a $50,000 gift, according to Debby Lamb, director of  Leisure World's recreation division. The Irvine Co.'s $10,000 contribution was  the second largest, she said.  </P> <P> Despite its clout, Leisure World doesn't always get what it wants. Residents  have lost a number of battles against proposed utility rate hikes in the  all-electric community. And a campaign to stop construction of a mortuary just  outside Leisure World's walls failed. But it takes more than a few defeats to  keep the community's more active members down.  </P> <P> One of the most visible and politically influential people in Leisure World is  71-year-old Herbert Schwartz. As president of the Republican Club and past  president of the Golden Rain Foundation, his clout within the walls of this  retirement compound is secure. But Schwartz also commands a presence outside as  well. He is a member of the invitation-only Lincoln Club, whose members include  some of the best-known politicians and businessmen in the county. He is on the  national board of governors of the American Jewish Committee and is chairman of  the county's Friends of the Library Foundation. Schwartz recently stepped down  as chairman of the board of the Orange County Community Development Council.  </P> <P> But the role that consumes much of Schwartz's time these days is that of  chairman of the Committee on Incorporation, the group that favors giving Laguna  Hills city status.  </P> <P> The issue has galvanized residents like no other in recent memory -- some say  it is the most important decision Leisure World as a community will ever have  to make.  </P> <P> Past cityhood efforts involving Leisure World have gone down in defeat.  Residents managed to have the community excluded from a proposed city of  Saddleback Valley, which voters rejected last November. An earlier Saddleback  Valley cityhood effort failed in 1981, as did moves in 1980 and 1982 to make  Leisure World itself a city. This most recent cityhood proposal, approved in  January by the Local Agency Formation Commission, will be on the June 6 ballot.  </P> <P> The proposed city of Laguna Hills would contain an estimated 45,000 residents  on 6,000 acres between Interstate 5 on the east and the Aliso Viejo planned  community on the west. The city would border unincorporated Laguna Niguel on  the south and the city of Irvine on the north. Leisure World would form the  geographic core.  </P> <P> The issue has set up a major political confrontation between pro-and-con  factions within Leisure World and has been the source of heated debate.  </P> <P> Al Hanson, 77, a board member of the Golden Rain Foundation, is pro-cityhood  and heads a Golden Rain subcommittee that is advancing the cityhood proposal.  </P> <P> "We can't stay inside of our cocoon and ignore what goes on around us," Hanson  said.  </P> <P> He believes that had Leisure World been a city it could have prevented such  problems as the heavy traffic on El Toro Road. He also believes that as a city,  Leisure World will ensure its effectiveness in the long-running battle against  commercial use of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. (The Leisure World Airport  Awareness Committee collected about $50,000 within a few weeks last year from  residents to fight commercial use of El Toro.)  </P> <P> Schwartz, a retired accounting executive who religiously avoided politics  during his working life, becomes animated when discussing cityhood. He is  convinced it is inevitable for the private community in which he has lived  since 1978.  </P> <P> "Take a look outside these walls," he said. "Our places of worship are outside  these walls. Shops, doctors, entertainment are all outside these walls. To have  a voice in what happens there, you can't depend on the county."  </P> <P> Leisure World is now nothing more than a homeowners association divided  geographically into separate segments, he said. "A city would speak as one  voice." Schwartz feels so strongly about the cityhood issue that, along with  Leisure World resident Jerard B. Werner, he was among the first to enter the  race for the five-member City Council to be elected June 6 if cityhood is  approved.  </P> <P> Wally Bjornson, 71, strongly disagrees with Schwartz. Bjornson, retired from  the Air Force and aerospace industry, came to Leisure World in 1981 to get away  from the headaches of the outside world. He doesn't relish dealing with them  again.  </P> <P> "I don't want to see us involved with the outside city or area," he said.  Cities only generate problems, Bjornson contends. "There's nothing that  (cityhood) could do for us that's not being done already."  </P> <P> Whatever the outcome, when the cityhood issue is resolved, some other issue  will inevitably surface, with residents making sure their voices are heard.  </P> <P> Schwartz spoke for many of his neighbors when he said, "As long as I have  something to say, I want to be involved. . . ."  </P> <P> Said Minna Liebman: "We're not ready to retire yet."  </P></p>

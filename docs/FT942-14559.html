			<p>940420 FT  20 APR 94 / Disaster centre for City banks opens A disaster recovery centre allowing banks and other financial institutions to continue trading with only a brief break if the City of London is bombed was unveiled yesterday. The centre has been built by Syntegra, the systems integration arm of British Telecommunications. The Pounds 15m centre, which has 500 trading positions, will be able to start within an hour if trading operations of banks are interrupted by incidents such as the IRA's Bishopsgate bomb of a year ago. Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, disclosed that it would be the first client of the Docklands-based centre. Its decision follows a contingency planning exercise after the Bishopsgate bombing. The centre, which will be able to operate independently for 10 days even if Docklands power supplies and services are disrupted, will also act as a back-up in case of electricity or telecommunications breakdowns in the City. Syntegra said its decision to build the centre was partly based on the huge risks to securities settlement operations. Trading operations might be unable to carry out back-office clearing and settlement operations in the event of a bombing. Mr Michael Cowan, chief administration officer for Merrill Lynch Europe, said 'years of hard-earned trust and goodwill could be lost in a few seconds' if the business was unable to execute a securities trade for a client. Merrill Lynch has arranged for 2,500 telephone lines to be switched to the centre in an emergency.</p>

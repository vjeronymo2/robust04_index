			<p>920328 FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: EMH shares suspended while talks proceed Shares in European Motor Holdings, the motor retail group formerly known as Cargo Control, were suspended at 123p yesterday as the company said it was in talks which might lead to it making a very substantial acquisition. European Motor Holdings, which bought the motor retail division of Thomas Robinson Group for Pounds 7.1m in November, incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 735,000 for the six months to September 30 on turnover of Pounds 3.7m.

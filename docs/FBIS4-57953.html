			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patricia Munoz Rios] </F>   [Text] The Mexican Government will carry out negotiations  with the United States and Canada to speed up the elimination of  tariffs on an official list of 157 products, most of which had  protective terms lasting five to 10 years, as originally  stipulated in NAFTA.    Today, the Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat  [Secofi] invited businessmen and individuals involved in the  production or marketing of those articles to express their  opinions "for or against" speeding up the opening.    Secofi has reported that, to determine whether or not this  expeditiousness is appropriate, the secretariat has consulted  with the involved producers, chambers, and agricultural,  livestock, and industrial associations through the Coordinating  Board for Entrepreneurial Foreign Trade Organizations [COECE].  The list was composed based on this consultation.    The list includes glass, wine, vegetables, dairy products,  grain, fruit, chemicals, vitamins, film, paper, fiber, textiles,  fabric, footwear, silverware, screws, refrigerators, freezers,  dryers, dishwashers, washers, machinery and equipment, ovens,  stoves, bicycle spare parts, and tools, in general, among others.    We are dealing with the elimination of tariffs for a large  number of articles. Some of the lines include bilateral export  products whose quantities and values are considerable.    The invitation, published today in DIARIO OFICIAL DE LA  FEDERACION, says: "Public consultation on the expeditious  lifting of tariffs for products of North American origin, as  stipulated by NAFTA, is hereby requested." The consultation will  last one month. Negotiations will start later.    The negotiations will be virtually bilateral because  Canada's  demands to expedite the commercial opening are relatively few in  relation to those presented by the United States and Mexico.  Canada's requests represent only 8 percent of the total to be  discussed.    According to NAFTA's paragraph 3 of article 302, NAFTA  member  countries can speed up the opening. "On request of any one of  the members, the interested parties will carry out consultations  to consider the possibility of expediting the elimination of  tariffs provided for in the tariff elimination lists."    The inclusion of these products does not represents a priori  commitment for the opening, but only the intention to sit down  and negotiate. Nevertheless, "generally speaking, the three  countries will consider lifting the tariffs on the products  included on the list."    The 157 products appear on the list at the request of three  countries' production sectors. In Mexico, all modifications will  involve consultations with the involved sectors and will be  negotiated between the governments later, Secofi said.    For this reason and to incorporate into the consultation  process the opinions and proposals "of all interested parties,"  Secofi has invited all persons and enterprises who so desire to  express their views on this subject through their chambers or  associations represented at COECE.    Views for or against speeding up the opening for the  products  included on the list should be addressed to the entrepreneurial  representatives prior to 23 June 1994. The remarks should  include the name of the tariff group involved, the signatory's  economic activities and the reasons for his interest, and  specific arguments supporting his case, such as the effect on  jobs, production, and exports.    The negotiations, "scheduled to be held in a few weeks,"  will  discuss only the products included in the groups listed. In  addition, the Mexican Government will agree to modify the speed  of tariff elimination on goods from the United States and Canada  and determine whether the consultation shows absolute consensus  for speeding up the process among the national production  sectors involved.    According to the list, which will also be released in the  United States, the two governments will negotiate the  expeditious lifting of tariffs on products such as wine  (including sparkling wine, grape must, brandy, and wine  coolers); various types of glass; textiles, such as flat cotton  fabrics; polyester fibers; metalized thread, velvet, and plush;  garments, such as suits, trousers, and silk ties; cotton towels;  curtains; and various types of footwear.    The list also includes vegetables, such as potatoes,  asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, and dried beans, and fruits,  such as mangoes, lemons, and grapefruit. Also, corn flour,  preserves, prepared or preserved tomatoes, and grapefruit juice  and other citrus products. [sentence fragment as published]  Also included on the list are photographic films, herbicides,  lumber, blinds, chemical paper, silverware, screws, untreated  zinc, stove spare parts, scissors, refrigerators, freezers,  driers, dishwashers, washers, electric ovens, stoves, and ranges.    The list also includes chemicals such as sodium cyanide,  monochlorodifluorethane, ethyl hexanol, tributylamine,  ethylenediamine, diethylentriamine, triethylentetramine,  lovastatine, e-nalapril malleate, hexamethylen, and  sulfamerazine, among others.    In the invitation, Secofi points out that a country can  refrain from participating in the negotiations on a given tariff  group for two basic reasons: either the importing of that  product to the country is already free of tariffs or the country  has no interest in eliminating the tariff.</p>

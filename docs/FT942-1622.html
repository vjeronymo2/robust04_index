			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / AT&amp;T enters European alliance AT&amp;T, the largest US tele-communications operator, will today announce an alliance with Unisource, the joint venture between the Dutch, Swedish and Swiss national telecommunications groups. The deal is the third and potentially most far-reaching of the recent alliances between US and European telecoms groups. Unisource will become the European arm of Worldsource, AT&amp;T's international venture launched last year to provide one-stop telecoms services for multinationals. AT&amp;T has enlisted several Asia-Pacific operators for Worldsource, but until now lacked a European partner. Last week the state telecoms operators of France and Germany signed a Dollars 4.2bn (Pounds 2.8bn) alliance with Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance operator. Also, British Telecommunications gained US regulatory approval for its Dollars 5.3bn alliance with MCI, the second-largest US operator. All three alliances are geared to providing one-stop telecoms services to multinationals, a market expected to grow rapidly with the opening of Europe's telecoms services industry to competition. An industry source said: 'Last week's Sprint deal forced AT&amp;T to stop dithering. It believes it is in danger of missing the European boat entirely.' The tie-up between AT&amp;T and Unisource is expected to be much looser than those between the other two US-European groups. Unlike MCI and Sprint, AT&amp;T is larger than its European partners, and the deal is not expected to involve any exchange of cash or equity. It may not be exclusive, although Unisource will agree to market AT&amp;T-branded services in Europe. For AT&amp;T, the deal follows a year of painful negotiations to find a European partner. Until late last year it was negotiating with Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom; however, problems about the shape of an alliance, and fears of regulatory barriers are believed to have scuppered the talks. Although it comprises three of Europe's smaller operators, Unisource has made an impact in the multinational corporate market. Earlier this year it bid successfully with AT&amp;T to provide telecoms facilities for more than 30 European multinationals.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Stockholm, 3 May (EFE) -- It was disclosed today  that Peruvian Foreign Minister Efrain Goldenberg has stated that  the little attention paid to the problem of terrorism is the  best sign that Sweden has changed its opinion on Peru.    At the end of his two-day visit to Stockholm, heading a  Peruvian commercial mission, Goldenberg signed an agreement for  the mutual protection of investments with Swedish Foreign Trade  Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel, who hopes the Swedish presence will  increase in Peru.    Bilateral trade currently leans in Sweden's favor. In 1992,  Sweden bought foodstuffs, fruit, vegetables, and textile  products from Peru totalling $8.7 million and sold machinery,  vehicles, engines, and optical equipment to Peru worth $40.5  million.    Goldenberg also met with Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha  af Ugglas and with some 100 Swedish businessmen to whom the  Peruvian delegation explained the economic, political, and  social stability Peru currently enjoys.    Goldenberg told EFE that Peru "experienced the greatest  economic growth in the continent" during 1993, which amounted to  7 percent, while the population grew by just 2 percent, adding  that in 1994 "we expect 5 percent growth."    Legislator Carlos Montoya and engineer Arturo Woodman, who  are part of the Peruvian delegation, lectured at the Stockholm  University's Latin American Institute on the subject: Peru, an  Emerging Economy.    The Peruvian delegation met with representatives of the  largest Nordic bank, the Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank (SE-Banken)  to whom they explained the privatization of the Peruvian banking  sector.    Goldenberg told EFE that the Peruvian Government "in the  next  few months will continue its privatization project" which  includes two large banks, two insurance companies, several  mining companies, and several hotel chains. Goldenberg also  mentioned the constitutional reform that will allow Peruvian  President Alberto Fujimori to run for reelection for another  five years, adding, "this will not be the only change."    Goldenberg said the Constitution, "drafted by a Constituent  Assembly, is the only one" in Peruvian history to have been  "ratified by a popular referendum." This has never happened  with any of the previous Peruvian constitutions.    Regarding the possibility of Fujimori being reelected for  another presidential term, Goldenberg stated that Peru is "a  full democracy," and reelection "is a mere possibility" about  which the president "has not even stated his intention."    Unlike on other occasions, the subject of terrorism was not  raised during his visit to Sweden. Goldenberg asserted that the  problem still exists and mentioned the successful arrest of  "Shining Path" leader Abimael Guzman. "without the firing of a  single shot."    The Peruvian minister did not dismiss the link between  terrorists and drugs, although he reiterated that coca  production and consumption in Peru is an "ancestral tradition"  of the people who use it in a "quite different way" from that of  modern society.    Goldenberg requested "concrete support from the  international  community" to implement alternative plans, but "the consumer  countries have not seriously tackled" the problem.    The visit was free of any incidents, although diplomatic  circles feared action by some of the 2,500 Peruvians residing in  Sweden, which prompted the tightening of safety measures around  the Peruvian visitors.    The delegation included Lima Stock Exchange Director Jose  Luque Otero and representatives of the National Industries  Association and of the Chamber of Commerce. They will also  visit Italy, Switzerland, and Austria to inform European  investors about the Peruvian economy.    The visit of the Peruvian commercial mission ended with a  meeting with the Swedish Riksdag's (parliament) Foreign  Commission. They left for Milan, the second phase of the tour,  this afternoon.</p>

Movement may accelerate the progress of reforms or may blow  them up. This is yet another poser for the government which is  pressed for time in this respect..." [sentence as received]    ROSSIYSKYE VESTI today begins the publication of a series of  articles revealing the logic and nature of the formation of  vertical ties between local executive power bodies. The first  article is by Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Russian presidential  administration's directorate for territorial affairs.    Having recalled that the power bodies of the subjects of the  federation (regions, territories, and republics) were formed on  the strength of "momo-party" lists and that the elected  officials constitute the old system of local governing councils,  Medvedev writes that, as a result, the two systems of state  power in Russia were doomed to confrontation.    "The main task now is to reform the second stage of state  power or the second element as represented by the state power of  the subjects of the federation. As a result, better prepared  people are to take office," Medvedev points out.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the need to combat mounting  inflation.    An article to this effect strongly cricicises Russian  businessmen -- a "class of proprietors - the main social base of  reforms" -- for not being in a hurry to boost and modernise  production and for prefering "to keep their money in foreign  banks".    Referring to the Washington-based Institute of International  Finance, the newspaper points out that the amount of outflowing  capital is already 30,000 million U.S. dollars, with 2,000  million dollars being added to them every month. "So, who helps  whom, we to the West or the West to us is the question. An  answer is not without interest, the newspaper points out.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Russian  Deputy  Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, dealing with the recent mortar  attack on a market in Sarajevo, when 68 people were killed and  about 200 wounded.    Churkin's opinion is that the main problem in the Yugoslav  conflict is posed by extremist approaches by all the three  conflicting sides, including the Serbs.    "Those who state that we as Slavs should side with the Serbs  bestow a doubtful benefit on the Serbs because they support  those of them who push their oun people to suicide," Churkin  pointed out. "In any case, there should be a question of a  political solution to the problem of Sarajevo and Bosnia as a  whole", he said.    TRUD on the results of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's  recent official visit to Georgia:    "One must give due credit to the courage of Boris Yeltsin  who  decided to visit Tbilisi -- the city where no one can be sure  that his next step would be as safe as the previous one".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA opens up with a report on preparations  for elections local government bodies in St. Petersburg.  [sentence as received] The electoral bloc "the Democratic Unity  of Petersburg", which unites about 30 organisations of reformist  orientation, now stands chances to get the largest number of  seats in the city assembly. Members of Russia's Choice  constitute the core of this bloc.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on Russia's military doctrine:    "The basic distinguishing feature of Russia's new military  doctrine is that it gives the president and the government the  right to use the armed forces to fight not only an external  enemy but also an internal one as well".    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA carries an article about former Chief  Justice of Russia's Constitutional Court Valeriy Zorkin. The  newspaper writes about him with respect and compassion.</p>

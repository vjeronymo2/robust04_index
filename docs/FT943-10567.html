			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Technology: Finally hitting the big time - Vanessa Houlder examines the commercial applications of massively parallel processors When Bass Taverns of the UK ran a promotion to boost the sales of Guinness in its pubs on St Patrick's night, it wanted to analyse the effectiveness of the campaign. Did the promotion increase sales of Guinness compared with other brands of beer? Did it boost margins? Did it build up customer loyalty? In the past, it has always been hard to analyse these kinds of questions with any degree of accuracy. Sifting through massive amounts of data to answer complex queries was too difficult and time-consuming for the company's mainframe computer. This year, however, marketing analysis of this type has become possible for Bass Taverns as a result of the recent introduction of a massively parallel processor, a relatively innovative type of high-performance computer. Parallel processors use numerous microprocessors to process a number of pieces of information simultaneously, rather than one bit at a time as in conventional computers. The power and speed of the MPP allows Bass Tavern's marketing department to manipulate sales data far more easily than before. 'Someone running the estate now has information in a far more flexible form,' says Mike Jones, director of IT planning and development at Bass Taverns. 'They don't have to fight their way through boxes of information.' Bass Taverns is just one example of a growing number of companies which are exploiting the power of parallel processors. Data-mining - the extraction of information from databases - is at this stage one of the most popular commercial applications of these machines. Financial institutions are using parallel processing to crunch through data to evaluate financial instruments. Retailers are using it to track the daily spending patterns of consumers. Banking and credit card companies can use it to detect fraud by going through databases and recognising unusual patterns. Other potentially important uses include computer modelling of car designs, 'just-in-time' warehousing, digital libraries, interactive multimedia and video-on-demand. Parallel processors are not intrinsically new. Ever since the technology was pioneered in the 1970s, research departments and science laboratories have been keen users. However, labs represent a relatively small market compared with the big and largely untapped commercial market. Many observers think the time has come for parallel processors to make inroads into the commercial market. 'I think parallel database technology is going to proliferate throughout the IT community within the next few years,' says Howard Richmond, vice-president of Gartner Group, a US consultancy. He predicts that commercial applications of parallel processors, currently worth Dollars 400m (Pounds 267m) a year, will become a multi-billion dollar market over the next few years. This enthusiasm is shared by the computer companies that are scrambling to get into the market, although some casualties are forecast as a result of more cut-throat competition, together with the cuts in the defence industry's spending on computers. One factor hastening the advent of parallel processors into mainstream commercial use is that researchers have begun to crack the programming problems which have dogged their progress until recently. Another reason for the upturn in interest in parallel processing is that companies are placing greater demands on their IT systems. 'Until now there has not really been a need for massively parallel processors. Now companies are needing to get a competitive edge by looking at sales trends,' says Keith Rankin a marketing manager at IBM, which launched its SP2 parallel processor earlier this year. Falling costs are also helping to attract new users. Since parallel processors often use cheap, mass-produced microprocessors, their cost can be one tenth of that of mainframes with the same theoretical processing power. The relatively low cost of parallel processors means that companies can introduce systems that would not have been economic using mainframes. British Shoe Corporation, which is using a Meiko parallel processor to give its buyers more information about sales trends, says that it is 'questionable' whether it would have justified the cost of installing the system on a mainframe. Humberside county council, which uses a Meiko parallel processing machine to manage the payroll records of its 60,000 employees and pensioners, likewise believes that the investment will pay for itself within three years. The machines' running costs are 20 per cent less than the mainframe which preceded it. The flexibility of parallel processors was another attraction for the council, which has an uncertain future under the planned reorganisation of local government. Expanding the power of a parallel processing system is a relatively simple matter of adding extra processors. 'The real beauty of the system is that we can grow as big as we want without losing performance,' says Bob Burchell, the council's IT manager. The eventual size of these machines is still a matter for conjecture. Meiko, the UK-based supercomputer company, is in talks with a bank that wants to build a 2 terabyte (trillions of bytes) system for marketing purposes, which it says is about 20 times larger than the largest available mainframe. 'We don't know whether it would be possible. We just don't know until we do it,' says Bob Carnell, a vice-president at Meiko. This underlines the fact that parallel processing machines are still a relatively unknown quantity. Many businesses are nervous about embracing them until their reliability has been proven beyond all doubt. 'Customers who are now buying parallel machines have to be a little brave,' says Robin Phillips, managing director of Parsys, a UK manufacturer. But many of the companies which are trying out these systems believe that being in the vanguard of MPP technology could give their businesses important advantages. Norman Ellis, business systems manager of the British Shoe Corporation, believes that the technology will lead to more informed decision making. 'It turns data into information,' he says. 'I believe it will make quite a radical change to the business.'</p>

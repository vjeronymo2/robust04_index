			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEEN-AGE SUICIDE  </P> <P> Having taken my children to see "Dead Poets Society," up for four Academy  Awards, including best picture, I was angered by the film makers' failure to  address the film's central issue -- teen-age suicide.  </P> <P> Momentarily thwarted by his father's attempt to dominate his life, one of Robin  Williams' most promising students shoots himself, a believable adolescent act  of revenge.  </P> <P> But who loses the most? Clearly the boy himself.  </P> <P> Yet, the film makers choose to make Williams' personal loss of his teaching  position the central story point. Is this responsible film making?  </P> <P> On the way home from the theater, it was clear from their conversation that my  kids loved the film. When I asked my 11-year-old if he thought the boy was  right in what he did, he said yes. After all, what choice did the boy have? His  father was destroying his life.  </P> <P> Fortunately, this gave me an opportunity to point out that no matter how much  we may disagree, suicide is not the answer. But how many children will see this  picture and never have similar discussion with their parents?  </P> <P> GARNER SIMMONS  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

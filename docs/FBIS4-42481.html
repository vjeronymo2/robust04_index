			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ola Hellblom, Agneta Jonsson, and Mosse Wallen: </F> "EU Election Will Cost Nordic Area 500 Million Kronor"]    [Text] Roughly 500 million kronor [Kr] will go on campaign  and voting costs in the run-up to the referenda on membership of  the European Union (EU) in Sweden, Norway, and Finland this  fall. Large proportions of this money will be spent to pay for  the vote itself. The strategies being followed for the  information campaigns vary tremendously in the three countries  concerned.    In Sweden, it is expected that the "Yes" campaigners will  contribute most in the form of support from the SAF [Swedish  Employers' Confederation] and also the business sector. In  Norway, it may be the "No" voters who free up the most funds in  the form of contributions from the Norwegian farmers' movement.  Meanwhile, in Finland both the "No" and the "Yes" camps are  encouraging restraint with regard to campaign funds.  <H5>  Low Finnish Budget </H5>   "Low budget" is the watchword when Finland votes on the EU  on  16 October.    The vote itself will cost the state Kr135 million, and only  Kr17 million will be split up between more than 30 different  organizations which are fighting for or against membership, or  merely want information about the EU.    More than 30 organizations fighting for "Yes," "No," or  merely wanting information about the EU have so far received  state subsidies for their activity, albeit not much, for a mere  Kr3 million has already been distributed. However, a further  Kr14 million will be released this summer.    In addition to the Kr17 million which the state will give to  the campaign organizations, the "Yes" campaigners can count on  receiving substantial support from the Finnish business sector's  employers' and industrial organization, TT.    "However, there will not be any larger sums than that," said  TT President Johannes Koroma, who has already paid out Kr7  million for various publications.    This surprising piece of news on the "Yes" side is  well-founded, partly because industry is terrified of repeating  the abortive nuclear power lobbying of last year, and partly  because it has learned from the mistakes made at the time of the  first EU referendum in Denmark.    In both cases, industry's massive lobbying backfired and led  to the opposite result to the one intended.    "I think Sweden began the whole EU debate too soon," said  Leif Fast, who is president of the business sector's "Ekonomiska  Informationsbyran" [Economic Information Office] in Helsinki,  which is handling lobbying and information about the EU on  behalf of the TT: "The people will not be interested so many  months from now," he maintained.  <H5>  Most for Norwegian "No" </H5>   When the Norwegian people wake up on 29 November, a good  Kr150 million will have been spent in an attempt to convince Ola  and Karl to vote -- and how to vote -- regarding Norway's  membership of the European Union.    It will cost one half of this sum, a good Kr70 million, to  hold the referendum in Norway. The rest will be gleefully spent  by the "Yes" and "No" movements on their campaigns over the six  months between now and the vote.    Today, Friday [27 May], the government will present its  proposal on the EU. It will contain the date for the  referendum, 27-28 November. The proposal will also suggest the  state's contribution to the various groups of campaigners. This  has been estimated at being as high as between Kr15 and 20  million to be evenly distributed.    The "No" movement is the rich cousin from the countryside,  whereas the three "Yes" groups are having a rough time of it  with thin wallets. The farmers -- both privately and via their  organizations -- are the largest contributors. Recently every  member of Norges Bondelag [Norwegian Farmers' Union] was asked  to cough up Kr400. The money will virtually all go into the  coffers of the "No" campaigners. In some counties [fylkar] the  dairies are giving their employees time off to work for the "No"  campaign, and the contributions of the 130,000 members have  already been used up.    "Every county [fylke] (administrative province) has its own  organization which receives its own money from regional  contributors. It is hard to estimate what that will produce.  Our campaign is costing us approximately Kr40 to 50 million,  including the funds provided by the state. We have around  Kr18.5 million saved up," said Kjell Erik Kallset, the  information chief of the "No to the EU" movement.    "We are hoping to drum up a total of Kr30 million, one third  of which will come from the state, another one third from the  NHO [Norwegian Employers' Organization], and the rest from other  contributors," said Frank Rossavik, speaking on behalf of the  three "Yes" groups.  <H5>  Swedish SAF Campaign </H5>   In Sweden, the "Yes" and "No" campaigns for the referendum  on  the EU will cost considerably more than in the other countries,  and even more than the information campaigns associated with the  referendum on nuclear power did -- where the information costs  totalled approximately Kr98 million. By the time of the  referendum on 13 November, the "Yes" and "No" campaigners will  have spent a little more than Kr100 million of state money. On  top of this comes the contribution to the "Yes" campaigners from  the SAF and the business sector, for which the figure of Kr200  million has been mentioned.    According to the proposal that has just been tabled, the  state will hand out Kr60 million in direct information funds.  Other state funds for information purposes include the Falldin  delegation, which has so far distributed Kr50 million in general  information resources.</p>

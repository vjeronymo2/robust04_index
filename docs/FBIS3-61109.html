			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vyacheslav Chornovil, chairman of the </F> People's Rukh of Ukraine, by Taras Zakharuk, under the rubric  "Interview of Current Interest"; place and date not given:  "Vyacheslav Chornovil: `The Main Point is To Ensure the Victory  of National-Democratic Forces'"]    [Text] A lot, a whole lot, may be said and written  about him--the acknowledged leader of, first, the  national-liberation, and, later, the national-democratic  movement; a politician who has ranked near the top of the list  of most popular Ukrainian politicians in recent years according  to the results of sociological surveys. However, today we are  offering our readers an interview with the chairman of the  People's Rukh of Ukraine rather than a narration about him--an  interview that touches on all aspects of our extremely  complicated life without skirting the most acute, most painful  topics.    [Zakharuk] Vyacheslav Maksymovych, what are the  peculiarities  of the national-liberation movement at present, now that we  allegedly have an independent state?    [Chornovil] First of all, we need to debunk the myth about  the independent state. Ukraine is still not fully independent.  We should refute the myth that the democrats are in power, that  the Rukh is an extremist organization, and quite a number of the  most varied fabrications. All of this should be done in a calm  and balanced manner without pushing the people into some kind of  social frustration, approximately the same way in which we  avoided strikes. We supported the idea of a general strike for a  single time when it was necessary to ensure a repeat election of  the Supreme Council. At present, it is necessary to bring  pressure to bear on the existing authorities through the most  peaceful measures--first of all, in order not to ultimately pull  Ukraine down because March, and the elections, are still far  away. Second, to use all of our propaganda resources in order to  debunk all these myths and ensure victory in the elections;  third, to ensure the greatest possible unity of democratic  forces after all.    [Zakharuk] On the point of unity: The national-liberation  movement split once various parties were created on the basis of  Rukh. Who can unite it again, how, and in what manner? After  all, is it all that necessary to artificially unite if this  process does not get underway by itself?    [Chornovil] Only very superficial politicians get nostalgic  for the erstwhile Rukh and believe that it could have been  preserved at the third or fourth congresses in the form in which  it existed at that time. We managed to do what appeared  impossible--we generally preserved Rukh, but in a somewhat  different form. Please note that in no postcommunist country has  a political organization in the form of Rukh circa 1990 lasted.  Recently I received an invitation to the final congress of the  People's Front of Estonia, which actually has already ceased to  exist. However, parties that have evolved on the basis of the  People's Front of Estonia gathered for the last meeting in order  to pay due homage to the historical task it has accomplished.  The situation in Latvia is the same. The Lithuanian Sajudis fell  apart completely. Landsbergis has created a small party on its  basis. Polish Solidarity also ceased to exist as a political  association.    Nostalgia for the possibility of keeping together liberal  communists and ultrarightists is a ludicrous illusion....    [Zakharuk] And even a dangerous one.    [Chornovil] Yes, and dangerous. Contradictions would still  poke out like an awl out of a sack. Finally, there was no unity.  When Rukh was created, unity was to a certain degree maintained  artificially. I now reread a stenographic record of the first  congress and see what contradictions already existed  then--contradictions between the presidium, which followed a  sort of liberal, somewhat national-communist direction deferring  to Kravchuk, and the auditorium, where anticommunist sentiment  was already mounting and the issue of independence was being  raised clearly. Therefore, this was an organization for a short  period of time which--we do understand this--played a  destructive role to a certain degree. It was destructive in the  positive sense of the word--the breakup of the empire, the  destruction of the communist system. Other organizations are  needed to construct and create. Cooperation among them is a  different matter. This is why Rukh was preserved in a completely  different form. In general, this is a unique phenomenon. We have  kept the structures, after all, we have kept mass membership and  succeeded in making this into a centrist organization of a  Christian-democratic, liberal-economic persuasion. So far, we  have succeeded in doing something that no one else has succeeded  at. If we succeed in holding on at this level for even a period  of time, we will make Rukh into a regular party--not the kind of  party that everyone here is accustomed to see, but an open-type  party. We would like to create a political organization on the  European or even American model. This is why our statute says  "sociopolitical organization" and contains no mention of a  party. This was foisted on us, foisted by a bad, imperfect law.    We have kept associate memberships and the status of  supporters. Therefore, Rukh is something very different from the  parties that exist here at present. However, we are no longer  the Rukh we were in 1990, nor can we be. At present, people are  saying: "Chornovil broke up Rukh, but unity could have been  maintained." It could not have.    There already was a Republican Party in Rukh, there was a  Democratic Party, and there was the right-to-left tug of war.  This problem had to be resolved.    Is unity in general necessary? It depends which kind. A  measure of agreement is needed, the ethics of a political  struggle are needed, and definitely the notion of a common  enemy, the notion of time and agreement on work, as well as  coordination of actions. However, it is unrealistic to once  again create some kind of organization with some kind of unified  programmatic and statutory principles. Only people with poor  knowledge of politics do that.    [Zakharuk] At a rally in Ivano-Frankovsk, Ukraine People's  Deputy Dmytro Zakharuk brought forth the slogan: "If you left  Rukh--go back to Rukh! If you were not in Rukh--go to Rukh!"  This gained him a very malevolent character in the mind of local  ultrapatriots. What do you think about this?    [Chornovil] Let them return to Rukh. To be sure, there are  people who now belong to other, very different, ideological and  political organizations. Having quit Rukh, they subscribe to  other views and have a different vision of the methods of  political struggle; in view of that, how can they return to  Rukh? If their departure from Rukh was caused by  misunderstandings on account of this ill-fated Supreme Council  of Ukraine and the ambitions of some politicians, whom some  people, failing to figure this out, followed, then our doors are  always open. Please, let them come back. Why on earth is Rukh to  be undone on the pretext that it is a public organization and  those are not? What does a "public organization" do? It does  more politicking than we do.    [Zakharuk] To what degree are you aware of information on  the  situation in our oblast? What is your evaluation of the actions  of the former chief of the city Rukh organization, Borys  Holodyuk?    [Chornovil] These are elements of ambition. They engage in  some kind of commercial operations there. Since we were forced  by legal requirements to register as a party--although I stress  that we did not want to--the People's Rukh of Ukraine has no  right to engage in commerce. This clearly did not satisfy the  chairman of your city Rukh. Second, the element of ambition. A  struggle for domination went on there, a struggle over who will  be the top person. This is our terrible misfortune. At first,  Holodyuk rushed there (to the Supreme Council of Ukraine--note  by Taras Zakharuk). He was not particularly welcomed; he was not  chosen to Larisa Skoryk's "cabinet"; so, giving up, he began to  look for something else for himself. These "vagrant leaders" are  our misfortune. You can see that he does not have any  ideological platform, he is a "vagrant leader."    [Zakharuk] With whom from the upper echelons of power, both  government and political power (in the parties, movements, and  political organizations), have agreements been achieved on  cooperation and unity during the forthcoming election? Who will  the People's Rukh of Ukraine support and at what level?    [Chornovil] Cooperation and unity are somewhat different  notions. You may have read our statement--we have come to an  agreement with virtually everyone, of course, except for the  extreme left and the extreme right. They have simply not  responded to our appeals. I mean the UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian  National Assembly-Ukrainian People's Self-Defense Forces] and  the DSU [Ukrainian State Independence], which in each issue of  their newspaper (NESKORENA NATSIYA--note by Taras Zakharuk)  sling mud at Rukh and at me in particular. However, had they  come too, we would have certainly not rejected them, at any  rate, we would have given it some thought. We are not ambitious,  and this, so to say, criticism does not annoy us much. The main  point is to ensure the victory of national-democratic forces, to  tear Ukraine out of the imperial noose, and to prevent its  transformation into a communist Vendee. As far as offenses  go.... My God, there are much more important things.    However, all of these are cooperation methods rather than,  if  we may say so, methods of complete unity. Full, complete unity  is not possible, say, between New Ukraine and Rukh. It would be  easier for us to find a common language with the KNDS [Congress  of National-Democratic Forces], with the national democrats.  However, they have other leanings.    Interestingly, it appears to me that if they were now given  an opportunity they would likewise fail to introduce a market  economy and would follow the course of firm regulation by the  state. This is already being seen a little, although they  maintain that they also support the middle class. However, these  administrative elements are strongly displayed by some people.    For example, one KNDS person, whose name I do not want to  give, said that these hearings ("Communism as a Dead End of  Civilization"--note by Taras Zakharuk) are unnecessary. We  should consolidate everyone, he said, and build the Ukrainian  state together with the communists. We are looking for the enemy  within, he said, whereas we have just one enemy--Russia. Nobody  is saying that there are not certain anti-Ukrainian tendencies  in Russia, and quite strong tendencies at that. I have recently  been to Russia, talked to Stankevich (adviser to Boris  Yeltsin--note by Taras Zakharuk), and I know that he is a man  with imperial leanings. However, pardon me! Failing to see with  whose hands these imperial tendencies may be carried out, and  that for all of that this will be done from within rather than  from without, that there may be attempts to tear Ukraine away  from within by the same communist or neocommunist forces....    They do not accept the notion "party of power," whereas we  vigorously explain it. It does not matter whether one has signed  up with the Communist Party again or not--this is the very same  nomenklatura.    [Zakharuk] Recently, Leonid Kravchuk said on the program  "The  Echo of Russia's Choice" on Ostankino that left-wing forces will  win elections in Ukraine and that he is not afraid of them, of  these left-wing forces. [Chornovil] Why should a person who  himself belongs to the left-wing forces be afraid of them? Why  would the secretary of the Central Committee for ideology be  afraid of left-wing forces? They say that Kravchuk said, as he  spoke before kolkhoz chairmen not so long ago, that the "Group  of 239" brought him to power, so what do you expect of him. This  is a man with an absolutely communist view of the world;  everything else amounted to the democracy game. That he  allegedly wanted to draw on Rukh was a game--a game aimed at  breaking up Rukh.    [Zakharuk] At present, we hear continuous whining almost  everywhere: "It is bad, it is poor here. All of this is due to  the disintegration of the Union, independence, and the fact that  Rukh and the democrats are in power...."    [Chornovil] Perhaps only the blind fail to see that the  democrats are not in power, to say nothing of Rukh. Certain  people who until recently called themselves democrats are indeed  trying to get somewhere; there also are our people at a certain  level. However, this is not power. All of this is done  deliberately. Nevertheless, those who are in power will always  lose in an environment of terrible economic recession and  impoverishment of the population. They want to ascribe to us  being in power in order to win elections, for the same people  who currently have power to win the elections and to remain in  power....    [Zakharuk] In this manner, certain political forces  vigorously propagate the thought that totalitarianism and a  dictatorship are needed for us to overcome the crisis....    [Chornovil] Yes, although it will not accomplish anything.    [Zakharuk] Recently, Sergey Grigoryants, editor in chief of  the GLASNOST magazine in Moscow, voiced the thought that the  extreme left and the extreme right are on one side, and European  liberalism and European democracy are on the other.    [Chornovil] You know, in Russia the extreme left has merged  with the extreme right. They cannot merge here because our  extreme rightists are advocates of statehood and patriots, after  all, although perhaps there are "excesses" sometimes....    [Zakharuk] However, Mr. Khmara very often votes the same as  Comrade Moroz....    [Chornovil] Yes. They cannot agree on the main point--on  these imperial leanings. However, communists vote against  concessions, and Khmara votes against concessions. This would  amount to plundering Ukraine, he says. They do not understand  that there is a large proportion of foreign capital in each  civilized country. In America foreign investment amounts to 40  percent; Japanese investments are particularly common. This  boosts the economy of the state, enriches the budget, provides  jobs, regular wages, and so on.    The thing that a concession is given for will not get away  from us. It is located on our land. Someone will invest funds  for us instead of us looking for them here. Certainly, not all  of the returns will be ours. However, what is unusual about it?  As a person gives, he should have something in return because  nobody will give something for nothing.    So, they agree on some social points sometimes. However,  there is one feature that will never allow to occur here that  which occurred in Russia, when fascists and communists manned  the barricades together. It is the independence of our Ukraine.    [Zakharuk] My final question. A response to it may be either  very short or very long. The current Supreme Council is  finishing its proceedings. How would you evaluate the activities  of deputies-members of the People's Council during this period?    [Chornovil] In general, favorably. We sometimes have  terrible  arguments in the People's Council. However, when something  decisive comes about, all of us, we might say, bristle. Recall  January, recall some other points.... For example, the way we  adopted the Declaration. After all, a group of patriotically  minded people has come. They part ways on certain things.  However, when it comes to business, Khmara is together with us,  all of us are together. We even go and storm the rostrum.    In general, our minority has accomplished something that  only  a majority could do in a civilized society--it has laid the  foundation of an independent Ukrainian state.</p>

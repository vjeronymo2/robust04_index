			<p>BFN     [Text] Ingush President Ruslan Aushev called on Russian  President Boris Yeltsin to take efficient measures to stabilize  the situation in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict.  Aushev has sent an open letter to Yeltsin emphasizing that the  decisions by the Russian leadership on normalization of the  situation and return of refugees and displaced persons to their  permanent residences are not being implemented. The state of  emergency in the conflict zone has continued for two years  already and more than 60,000 refugees cannot return to North  Ossetia.    Aushev said the Moscow talks between the North Ossetian and  Ingush delegations had brought practically no results. He  suggested that any further delay in implementation of the  Russian president's decree on refugees and displaced persons  issued on December 13, 1993, could trigger off unpredictable  consequences.    Aushev addressed the Russian president as the guarantee for  human rights in Russia to use all his power in order to prevent  new inter-ethnic conflicts in North Caucuses.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading FUTURES markets retained their confident tone yesterday in spite of the general disappointment with the absence of any move to lower rates at the meeting of the Bundesbank's policy council, writes Terry Byland. Stock index futures held on to a premium against cash, compared with the discount now computed on fair value. Traders said the March future appeared to be consolidating its position. The contract held comfortably above the testing 2,900 mark which was regained this week, trading at 2,907 in very late deals, a premium of some 2 points on the close of the underlying FT-SE 100 Index. Trading volume eased, with the March contract recording 10,691 lots compared with 15,631 on Wednesday. While there was no opportunity yesterday for arbitraging against the cash market, traders noted active rolling over of positions from the March and into the June contract - an indication of underlying bullish views at this stage of the month, according to most analysts. Business in traded options was also reduced yesterday, the day's total of 28,838 contracts contrasting with the previous 35,468. The FT-SE option, very active on Wednesday with 14,769 contracts dealt, traded only 7,439. The Euro FT-SE turned over 4,730 lots, while among individual stock options, British Steel stood out with 2,392 contracts.</p>

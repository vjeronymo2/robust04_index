			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Elliott 'at centre of sham payments' Mr John Elliott, the former head of the Elders IXL brewing and agro-business group, was at the centre of sham foreign exchange payments of ADollars 66.5m (Pounds 31.9m), Melbourne Magistrates' Court was told yesterday. The alleged transactions occurred in the late 1980s, the court was told on the first day of a committal hearing into whether Mr Elliott should stand trial for allegedly defrauding Elders. Mr Elliott was one of Australia's more colourful 1980s entrepreneurs, known for setting out to 'Fosterise the world' after Elders took over Carlton and United Breweries, makers of Foster's Lager, in the mid-1980s. Mr Elliott and former Elders executives Mr Peter Scanlon and Mr Ken Biggins each faces two counts of theft and one of conspiracy to defraud shareholders and creditors of the company. Another former executive, Mr Peter Cann, faces one count each of theft and conspiracy. Charges against a fifth former executive, Mr Kenneth Jarrett, were dropped last month after he agreed to plead guilty to deceiving the Elders board, and to give evidence against Mr Elliott during the committal hearings. Two Sydney bankers working for the Bank of New Zealand at the time of the alleged transactions also face charges of conspiracy to defraud. The charges relate to foreign exchange transactions in 1988 between Elders and the Bank of New Zealand and companies associated with a New Zealand businessman, Mr Alan Hawkins, then head of the investment group Equitycorp. The court heard the defendants had shareholders believe the transactions resulted in losses to Elders of ADollars 39.5m and ADollars 27m respectively. The hearing is expected to last at least three months, mostly without Mr Elliott and the other main defendants present.</p>

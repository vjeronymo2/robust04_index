The message was  handed over to the Palestinian leader by Russian President's  representative Viktor Posuvalyuk.    The Russian envoy earlier this week had two meetings with  Yasir 'Arafat in the Tunisian capital, where the PLO  headquarters are situated, on Monday and Tuesday.    The question of a possible adoption by the UN Security  Council of a resolution guaranteeing international protection  for the Palestinian population on the Israeli-occupied Arab  territories and also the problem of the Jewish settlements there  were discussed at the meetings.    The PLO insists on such resolution following the killing of  more than 50 Palestinians as a result of the terrorist operation  by Zionist extremists in a Hebron mosque at the end of February.</p>

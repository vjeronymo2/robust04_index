A national meeting of the directors of personnel  departments and bureaus which opened today reached this common  understanding: Closely revolving around the central task of  economic construction, we should broaden the scope of reform,  quicken the pace of reform, and gradually establish a personnel  management system that is in line with the socialist market  economic system.    It has been learned: relatively big progress has been made  in  the country's personnel work in 1993 -- structural reform has  entered the implementation stage from the stage of study and  discussion; the public service system has gradually proceeded  from experimentation to implementation, and work on hiring  through taking examinations and on giving rewards and imposing  punishments based on one's work performance has been carried out  in a planned way; reform of the personnel system of enterprises  and institutions has been speeded up and in-depth study of the  classified personnel management system is being conducted; the  reform plan and implementation rules for the new wage system for  government organs and institutions have been issued to all units  concerned; the personnel market has developed quite rapidly and  reasonable personnel flow has begun to take place; reform of the  job title system, promotion of outstanding middle-aged and young  experts, the issuance of special government allowances, and  other related measures have further rallied the enthusiasm and  creativity of professional and technical workers; and the task  of resettling demobilized military cadres has been smoothly  accomplished.    To develop as soon as possible a personnel management system  that is in line with the socialist market economic system, the  Personnel Ministry set forth the following primary tasks for  1994: to ensure the establishment and institution of the state's  public service system; to properly build up a new wage system  and to put it into operation; to ensure a good job in the  initiating and experimentation of the reform of the insurance  system of government organs and institutions; to further build  up the force of professional and technical workers, to  strengthen the management of them, and to improve the service  for them; to actively cultivate and develop personnel market  mechanisms; and to step up the establishment of laws and  regulations governing personnel affairs.    State Councilor Li Guixian attended the meeting and gave a  speech focusing on establishing and promoting the public service  system. He said: The establishment and institution of the  state's public service system is a major event in China's  political life and a basic requirement for deepening the reform  of the economic system and for building a socialist market  economic system.    Li Guixian said the establishment and institution of the  state's public service system is the focus of the current  efforts to quicken the pace of reforming the personnel system.  He called for initially establishing the public service system  next year in all departments of the State Council and in the  organs of the majority of provincial-level governments and  governments of cities with provincial-level economic powers to  lay a solid foundation for initially establishing the public  service system across the country in the following three years  or a little more time.    At the meeting, Minister of Personnel Song Defu made a  report  entitled "Broaden the Scope of Reform, Quicken the Pace of  Reform, and Establish a Personnel Management System That is in  Line With the Socialist Market Economic System." In his report,  Song Defu set forth a new idea for reforming the personnel  system -- establishing a categorized personnel management  system, a scientific and reasonable wage distribution system,  social insurance systems at various levels, macro personnel  management systems at various levels, a personnel market system,  and a system of personnel laws and regulations, and work to  refine these systems.</p>

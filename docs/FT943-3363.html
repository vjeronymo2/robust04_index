			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: IBC surges to Pounds 4.94m in first half International Business Communications, the publishing, conference, and data services group, announced interim pre-tax profits ahead at Pounds 4.94m against Pounds 1.37m. Most of the improvement came from conference operations, but the pre-tax figure for the six months to June 30 was also helped by a reduction in interest charges to Pounds 485,000 (Pounds 1.09m) following a capital reconstruction last June; the comparable period also carried a non-continuing debenture interest charge of Pounds 1.16m. Turnover rose from Pounds 29.1m to Pounds 38.4m. 'The performance has undoubtedly been enhanced by better trading conditions,' said Lord Rees-Mogg, chairman. 'Additionally, the release from the shackles imposed by the previous debt structure has allowed more freedom to progress.' Earnings per share were 10.1p (7.1p). There is an interim dividend of 1.5p (nil).</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The United States said Panama has sharply curbed visits by Americans in order  to obstruct monitoring of the May 7 presidential election. State Department  spokesman Richard Boucher said the move by the regime of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega  "is an effort to insulate Panama's electoral process from any credible degree  of public scrutiny." The department also said that Panama is printing false  voter lists, changing data in voting registries, providing insufficient ballots  for opposition candidates and using military personnel to campaign illegally.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE AUDEN-ISHERWOOD HIGH JINKS;  </P> <P> PLAYS;  </P> <P> BY W. H. AUDEN AND CHRISTOPHER ISHERWOOD; AND OTHER DRAMATIC WRITINGS BY W. H.  AUDEN, 1928-1938; VOLUME ONE OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF W. H. AUDEN EDITED BY  EDWARD MENDELSON (PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRESS: $39.50; 676 PP.)  </P> <P> One of the plays here is "The Ascent of F6," perhaps the most successful of W.  H. Auden's collaborations with Christopher Isherwood. Years afterwards,  Isherwood described how the noise of an avalanche, required in the action, was  suggested in two early productions. In London it was done "by setting up a  microphone in the backstage lavatory and flushing the toilet. The amplified  noise was awesome." And in New York, after "a pause of dead silence, . . .  somewhere in the back of the building, with terrific violence, a door was  slammed."  </P> <P> Similarly, in Auden's early poetry, the familiar is made strange and the  strange familiar. The "cigarette-end smoldering on a border/At the first garden  party of the year" is the portent of a dying class. When commonplace detail is  charged with such significance, the effect is inherently dramatic, as we can  see in the movies of Hitchcock, who started about the same time as Auden. The  effect is positively exhilarating: Putting down the book, coming out of the  movie, we recognize a world ominous with impending change, full of spies and  conspirators.  </P> <P> For the young Auden, then, it seems almost inevitable that his prodigious  productivity in the 1930s should have included the verse drama and the  contributions to documentary movies and radio brought together here, in the  first of eight volumes, and admirably edited by Edward Mendelson, his  bibliographer and biographer. Also collected are the fragments of a lost play,  alternate scenes to others, and two previously unpublished plays. Though three  of the plays were collaborations, the initiating impulse was essentially  Auden's, and it appears to be he who defined the type of drama being written.  </P> <P> This drama is the antithesis of Shavian realism, and has much in common with  German and French experiments of the time. Though Auden admitted to the  influence of Berlin vaudeville, he was much interested in introducing elements  from English folk plays, where characters had names like Pickled Herring and  Blue Britches, or from Mystery Plays like the Towneley Second Shepherd's Play,  where a thief swaddles a stolen sheep like a baby and hides it in a cradle. He  valued comic incongruity, and characters break into doggerel with no  provocation, or start dancing or stab people with hatpins. In "Paid on Both  Sides," "a charade," he presented feuding Norse heroes in a "Prep School  atmosphere." In "The Dog Beneath the Skin," the hero goes in search of a  missing heir accompanied by a dog who is actually the heir himself in disguise;  audiences must have recalled the popular English pantomime of "Puss in Boots."  </P> <P> I should perhaps say readers rather than audiences, because these plays are  seldom performed -- in fact I have never had a chance to see any of them on the  stage. As dramatic writing, the early plays in particular are disorganized and  difficult; and the last collaboration, "On the Frontier," is badly dated by its  schematic plot and by the vaguely Marxist cliches of its writing. (" . . .  Truth shall flower and Error explode/And the people be free then to choose  their own road!") Beside Auden and Kallman's libretto for "The Rake's Progress"  and the penetrating and subtle later fictions of Isherwood, these plays seem  juvenile and amateurish. Eric Bentley called them "sketchy extravaganzas," and  certainly none of them have the intensity or dramatic force of Bertolt Brecht's  best work, which they loosely resemble in type.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, this collection is, above all, fun to read, full as it is of  memorable high jinks. In "On the Frontier," there is a scene between three war  correspondents written as a parody of the witches' meeting in "Macbeth"; in  "The Dog Beneath the Skin," we are shown a lunatic asylum in a Fascist state  called Westland, in which the First Lunatic says in a patriotic speech to his  fellows: "Let us never forget that we are Westlanders first and madmen second";  in both this and an earlier play there are conversations between the hero's  left foot and right foot, one version by Auden and the other by Isherwood, both  funny; and best of all is the unforgettable climax to "The Ascent of F6," in  which the hero discovers that the fabled Demon on the peak of the Himalayan  mountain, robed and hooded, is his own mother -- a marvelous joke about the  Oedipus complex.  </P> <P> There is fertility of invention not only in incident but in the writing itself.  In the earliest poetry, full of gnomic obscurities, the young Auden's meaning  seems to be trying not always successfully to catch up with his language. But  in "Dog" there is a long and brilliant survey, broken up into choruses, of  Britain and Europe during the Depression, "barns falling, fences broken." There  is elsewhere a handful of Auden's loveliest songs in the tradition of Thomas  Campion and Tennyson: for example, "O lurcher loving collier black as night"  from a documentary movie called "Coal Face" (a lurcher was a dog much bred as a  hobby by British coal miners). And there are "Happy the hare at morning" and  "Doom is darker, deeper than any sea-dingle," originally choruses from plays,  later independent poems, which seem to me a valid and effective public poetry  for the '30s rather as Ginsberg's poetry of oration was for the '50s and '60s.  </P> <P> Auden was always a virtuoso, something of a showoff -- and it is a pleasure to  watch him showing off.  </P> <P> </P></p>

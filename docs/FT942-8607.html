			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley reveals 41% fall Morgan Stanley, the securities house, yesterday became the latest Wall Street casualty of rising US interest rates and volatile international bond and currency markets. It revealed a 41 per cent decline in first-quarter profits to Dollars 199m, or Dollars 2.40 a share. Mr Richard Fisher, chairman, said that 'a rising interest rate environment in the US and difficult conditions in both the foreign exchange and European fixed income markets contributed to an overall decline in client activity' during the quarter, which ran from February to the end of April. Total net revenues fell 16 per cent to Dollars 888m. Although the drop in Morgan Stanley's earnings tallies with results from other Wall Street firms, it suffered slightly in comparison with its rivals. This was because its fiscal quarter excluded January, a busy month for the industry, and included April, when securities underwriting business tailed off sharply amid continued turmoil on US debt and equity markets. The biggest downturn in business at the firm was reported by the investment banking division, where a fall in demand for debt underwriting services and a drop in the number of advisory assignments contributed to a 31 per cent decline in revenues, to Dollars 260m. The firm said the decline would have been larger were it not for its equity underwriting calendar, which remained busy during the quarter. Morgan Stanley's principal transactions business also suffered. Amid hostile debt and foreign exchange markets, earnings from the trading of the firm's own capital fell from Dollars 370m a year ago to Dollars 258m, in spite of an increase in revenues from the trading of equities and commodities. On a more positive note, revenues from brokerage commissions climbed 31 per cent to Dollars 119m, and revenues from asset management, global custody and clearing businesses increased from Dollars 52m a year ago to Dollars 81m. These figures reflect growth in customer assets under management and administration, to Dollars 52bn and Dollars 80bn respectively. Non-interest expenses fell slightly during the quarter, blamed on a 16 per cent drop in performance-related compensation payments to Dollars 440m.</p>

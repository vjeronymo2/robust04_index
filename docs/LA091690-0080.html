			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOULD A HANDGUN BAN REALLY HAVE AVERTED DANA POINT DEATH?  </P> <P> One Dana Point teen-ager is dead and his alleged 16-year-old assailant in jail,  largely because of the lack of strict gun-control laws.  </P> <P> Teens might normally settle severe arguments with a fistfight, perhaps ending  with a couple of black eyes or, at worst, a few broken teeth.  </P> <P> A gun-control law with real teeth in it might result in some lost teeth for  teens, but not death and incarceration.  </P> <P> FRANCIS RAYMOND LINE  </P> <P> Capistrano Beach  </P></p>

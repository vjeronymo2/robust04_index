			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Survey of Cheshire (5): Dairy farming turns sour / A look at the country's agricultural problems AROUND 170,000 hectares (408,000 acres), or 75 per cent of the rural areas, of Cheshire are farmed in some way. The predominant agricultural activity is dairy farming. Of the county's 4,500 farms, 53 per cent are dairy, compared with a national average of 18 per cent. The county has a cattle and calf population of 270,000, compared with 94,500 breeding ewes. Of the other 47 per cent many are mixed farms, some of which have an element of dairying. In 1989 Cheshire produced 756m litres of milk, making it the third largest dairy county in Britain after Devon (917m litres) and Somerset (796m). According to Mr Robert Llewellyn at the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (Adas), the Cheshire plain is ideal dairying country. 'It is bit like Ireland; grass grows very easily.' Like other farming activities, dairying has been hit in recent years by the slump in agriculture (though cereals have fared worse). Dairy farms have suffered from a combination of EC quotas since the mid-1980s and a continuing upward pressure on costs - high interest for any debt on land and high input costs. Figures supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food office in Crewe show that, using 1982 as a base year of 100, incomes on dairy farms in the county fell to 66 in 1985. They recovered a bit in 1987 and 1988 but were down to 60 in 1990. They are expected to be lower this year, and could fall further if EC proposals for new price cuts are accepted. The ministry estimates that average farm incomes in Cheshire are Pounds 790 a hectare. With the average size of a dairy farm in the county at 50 hectares, this gives an income of just under Pounds 40,000 a year. But net incomes would vary considerably, of course, depending on the level of debt and the number of employees. Around 11,000 people are employed in farming in the county. Inevitably, there is talk of diversification by farmers into other activities such as tourism. Farmers are also looking at how they can add value to their products - producing cheeses and yoghurt and so on. There has been a squeeze on incomes. But there have not been significant set-aside programmes. This is the government sponsored programme where farmers receive compensation for taking land out of food production. The ministry's figures show a total of 42 farmers from Cheshire have applied for set-aside since 1988, either under the five-year programme or the one-year scheme. The total land involved amounts to 877 hectares (2,104 acres). Nationally, a total of 807 farmers are in the five-year set-aside scheme, involving 29,000 hectares of land. It is possible to opt out of the five-year programme after three years. In 1991, a total of 890 farmers applied to be part of the one-year set-aside scheme, involving 13,000 hectares. Mr John Ford, public relations officer for the north-west region of the National Farmers Union (which includes Cheshire, Lancashire and Cumbria) says: 'Farmers in Cheshire, because of the emphasis on dairying, have done rather better than our members elsewhere. The quotas meant that production was cut but also that prices were stabilised. The numbers of farmers have fallen in the past five years, but not greatly. However, to farmers' existing woes a new worry has been added - the costs of controlling agricultural pollution. Agricultural pollution has become a particular issue in Cheshire, because, although there are many many forms of waste creeping into the watercourses - sheep dip, insecticides, herbicides, oil and diesel - some of the worst pollutants are associated with dairying. Milk itself is a very concentrated substance, and slurry and silage effluent are particularly noxious pollutants. All three remove oxygen from the water which means fish and other aquatic animals cannot survive. The water becomes dead. Cheshire comes within the catchment of the Mersey basin campaign. This is a partly government-funded drive to clean up the watercourses in the Mersey basin. The basin has been deemed the most badly polluted river in Britain and one of the worst in Europe. The National Rivers Authority was set up in 1989, when it was hived off from the old water boards as a separate regulatory body. Its regional headquarters are in Cheshire and it is active in the Mersey basin campaign. It has brought a number of successful prosecutions against pollution offenders. Some farmers have been prosecuted and this has tended to emphasise agricultural pollution as an environmental issue in the area. The NRA has been working with Adas to advise farmers on working methods. In the 1960s and 1970s dairy herds were increased and farming practices changed from keeping stock in cowsheds to the loose housing system of milking parlours. This increased the dangers of liquid run-off entering drainage systems, many of which had outlets to ditches and other watercourses. Apart from advice on working practices, the ministry is also empowered to give grants to farmers who want to set up waste handling schemes. The local authorities in Cheshire, at county and district level are also involved in environmental improvements. Officers at the county council estimate that 15 per cent of farms in the county are now involved in waste handling schemes. The problem for the individual farmer is that - even with a grant - setting up an effective treatment system can cost Pounds 60,000. At time when incomes are being eroded, this can mean a considerable extra burden.</p>

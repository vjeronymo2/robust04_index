			<p>BFN     [Text] Regarding the Arab stand vis-a-vis the Yemeni  southerners' secession declaration and the proclamation of an  independent state, 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the  Yemeni Presidential Council, told told our radio correspondent  Ahmad Birru:    [Begin 'Abd-al-Ghani recording] In fact, we do not believe  that the United Arab Emirates [UAE] has recognized the  secessionist state or the secession declaration announced by  'Ali Salim al-Bid. The UAE has always been with unity,  particularly Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, who supported Yemen unity.  We do not believe any Arab or foreign state will recognize this  secession declaration announced by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, because it  is unconstitutional.    We do not want to impose unity by force, but (?through  peaceful means). The whole Yemeni people in the southern,  eastern, northern, and western governorates support unity.  Those who are imposing state authority in the southern  governorates are government forces. These forces are not from  the northern governorates, but from northern and southern  governorates. The northern governorates are not imposing unity  on the southern governorates. There is readiness for unity. As  it was achieved peacefully, it will continue so. All the Yemeni  people support unity. [end recording]</p>

From 2.9 percent in  autumn to the much-awaited whopping ending -- 5.9 percent growth  in the fourth quarter.    The leap of last year's U.S. economy is a bit like crazy,  casting the shadow of recession far and away.    But is such a progress sustainable or is it heading toward a  nose dive?    "The last quarter is often supercharged, with Christmas  shopping and everything," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist  for PNC Bank Corp. based in Pittsburgh. "This year is a  different thing."    The Commerce Department reported today that the U.S. gross  domestic product, the total goods and services produced in the  country, grew by 2.9 percent last year, the biggest climb since  1988.    Earlier, it was reported that the country's industrial  production was up 4.2 percent last year, the biggest gain since  1988, housing starts and home resales reached four-year and  14-year high respectively, with consumer price gaining the  smallest in seven years.    President Clinton is taking credit for the economic  successes  in 1993, especially with his respectable assault on the budget  deficit. The deficit is expected to decline by another 40  percent in fiscal 1995.    The 20-year low interest rates, the direct result of budget  cuts, is becoming a potent tool for pulling the economy out of  recession, observers said.    But the upturn, as most observers see it, is mostly a  product  of the normal business cycle.    Last year, the strong productivity-enhancing investment was  coupled with strong pent-up consumer demands, especially in  automobiles and home furnishings.    In recent months, retail sales, sales of business equipment,  home building, especially the single-family housing starts, and  the long- in-the-doldrums merchandise export all turned for the  better.    But the recovery has skipped some regions, California in  particular, and left many workers still without jobs. The newly  added jobs are mostly part time and substandard in earnings,  observers here said.    There are four sectors remaining what economists described  as  "truly weak": defense production, civilian aircraft making,  business spending for commercial real estate, and multi-family  housing.    Some economists predicted the growth in 1994 will slow down  because of the declining bank reserves, a key indicator for  trading of bank loans, and consumer spending which they said has  been out of line with real consumer income.    "There were numerous straws in the wind suggesting that the  increase will not be sustainable in 1994," said Erich  Herinemann, chief economist of New York-based investment company  Ladernburg, Thalman &amp; Co.. "Indeed, there are signs a  slowdown  may already be underway."    Another impediments is the danger of inflation. American  Bankers Association (ABA) predicted on Thursday the consumer  price index, the most common measure of inflation, will rise  from 2.7 percent last year to 3.0 percent in 1994.    "While inflation has come down, underlying inflationary  pressure cannot be counted out," ABA's economic advisory  committee said in its semi-annual report. "Decisive action in  the coming months would keep inflation on the ropes."    Some private forecasters, meanwhile, are worried about the  tax hikes on the rich individuals who are resources for most new  investments, and more government regulations in the health care  industry.    "It's too early to tell how tax hikes will reduce potential  economic growth," said Paul Merski, an economist with "citizens  for a sound economy" in the nation's capital. "But it will be  felt by hundreds of small businesses and their workers," he said.</p>

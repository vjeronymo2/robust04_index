			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has described the  plan to converge the Greek economy with the economies of the  European countries as achievable and one that takes into account  social circumstances. Papandreou made his statement upon  arrival at Corfu Airport. The direction of the economy does not  concern me, he said. We are not magicians but we have a  convergence plan that can be achieved and that takes into  account social circumstances, Papandreou stressed. The prime  minister said there will be an amendment to the Maastricht  Treaty in 1996 and that perhaps we will see significant changes  in the direction of the economies of many European countries.</p>

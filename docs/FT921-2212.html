			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Observer: Hong Kong exit The Americans have finally conquered another Far Eastern outpost. Five years after buying control of the Far Eastern Economic Review, Dow Jones has put its own man in as editor of the respected Hong Kong-based weekly magazine. Out goes Philip Bowring, prickly in temperament but respected throughout Asia for his knowledge, and feared for his acerbic, iconoclastic coverage of economies and companies. (He was once the FT's Hong Kong correspondent.) In comes L Gordon Crovitz, a senior member of the Wall Street Journal's editorial board, but a bit thin on Asian experience. Under Bowring and his predecessor, the long-serving Derek Davies, the Review has remained mercifully free of the right-wing dogma which might be expected of a Dow Jones publication. But there has been increasing friction between the American owners' management style and the quirky British traditions of the magazine. This may be because the Review has run into lean times financially while the countries it reports on have been surging. Devotees who have seen the magazine's coverage, especially of business, becoming more incisive are fearful of possible changes. But if the move leads to shorter and better subbed articles, it will be an improvement.</p>

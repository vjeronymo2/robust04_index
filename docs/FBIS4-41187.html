			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Sergey Tereshchenko  told parliament on Thursday [23 Jun] that Kazakhstan had run out  of money to continue the economic restructuring program.    He said that economic restructuring was unthinkable without  foreign loans and that a preparatory period of about 15 months  was needed to secure them.    The government is proposing a three-stage program, said  Tereshchenko. In June to December 1995, the main accent will be  put on domestic resources, the rate of inflation will be lowered  to about 10 percent and relative stabilization of the national  currency will be attained.    From January to September 1995, the government intends to  secure a medium-term credit, accelerate integration with Russia  and the CIS countries, and receive loans from the G7.    The third stage will mark the beginning of a new economic  course, he said. Foundations for enhancing the population's  living standards and promoting industrial production will be  laid. The government will continue to pursue a tough  anti-inflation policy, lower taxes, carry out a banking reform  and accelerate privatization.    Tereshchenko said that "one could no longer implement reform  without financing the social sphere." "Otherwise, reforms will  be resisted," he said.    He also said that the national funds must be spent with care  and urged the parliament to support the government-proposed  budget. "If we manage to implement a tough budget, the task of  securing foreign loans will be much easier," he said.</p>

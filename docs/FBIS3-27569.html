The delegation, headed by Carlos Alberto Gonzalez, chairman  of the Foreign Affairs Committee, are here as guests of the  Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese National People's  Congress (NPC).    Paraguay is the only country in South America that has so  far  no diplomatic ties with China.    In a meeting with Zhu Liang, chairman of the NPC's Foreign  Affairs Committee, Gonzalez said the delegation, composed of  members of the main political parties in the senate, was here to  learn about China's economic, cultural and other developments  and for its members to deepen their knowledge of the country.    He noted that Paraguay received with pleasure a NPC  delegation last year and that the contact laid a basis for the  development of relations between the two countries.    He expressed the belief that the current visit would help to  promote the development of these ties.    Zhu voiced his satisfaction with the increasing contacts  between the two countries in recent years, adding that China  attaches importance to the development of its ties with Paraguay.    Both China and Paraguay are developing countries and faced  with the common task of maintaining world peace and developing  national economies, Zhu said.    He expressed the hope that the current visit would be  conducive to the development of the relations between the two  parliaments and the two countries.</p>

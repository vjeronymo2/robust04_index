			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Report on the attack by the people and the National  Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK-Khmer Rouge] to destroy the  Vietnamese communist puppets' invading forces around Bavel  District in Battambang Province.    It is worth recalling that the people and the NADK had  routed  the Vietnamese communist puppets' military offensives in the  Bavel region of Battambang Province in early January. However,  the Vietnamese puppets continued to massacre their fellow  countrymen, plunder their cattle, and burn their rice crops and  homes. This made the people extremely furious. So, between 24  and 26 January, they joined forces with the NADK to attack and  destroy the Vietnamese communist puppets' troops around Bavel  District. The following are the results of the onslaught  against the Vietnamese puppet forces:    1. On 26 January, a group of our forces attacked and  completely destroyed the position of the 24th regiment from  Division 6 stationed at Ampel Pram Daeum, the position of the  8th battalion at Boeng Sangke, and the position of a company at  (Siem) village. We killed 30 invaders, including a regiment  commander and a deputy commander of the 6th division, and  wounded many others. The remaining enemy soldiers were forced  to beat a hasty retreat to Bavel. The people also captured two  enemy soldiers, seized 20 assorted firearms -- including DK-75,  80-mm, DK-82, 12.7-mm, and 60-mm guns; B-40 rocket launchers,  and AK rifles -- and destroyed some armaments. They also  liberated many thousands of villagers in Ampel commune.    2. On 26 January, over 200 people closely cooperated with  the NADK to attack the Vietnamese communist puppets' invading  troops in the areas of S'tha Po, Prey Khpuos, (Dei S'at), and  Kbal Krabei. We killed 15 enemy soldiers and wounded many  others. We also liberated many hundreds of families in S'tha Po  village.    3. On 25 January, a battalion of the Vietnamese communist  puppets planned to attack us from behind. But we ambushed it,  killed seven enemy soldiers and wounded five others. The  remaining troops were forced to retreat to Lvea.    4. On 24 January, the people and NADK attacked and routed  invading enemy troops along Route 5 in the area between Chroy  M'teh and (Ta Pi). We killed five enemy soldiers and wounded 10  others, and we dismantled the Vietnamese communist puppets'  state authorities in the following five villages: Chroy M'teh,  Am, Ta Ping Toch, Ta Ping Thom, and Tuol Neakru. We also seized  more than 10 assorted guns.    These were the counterattacks mounted by the people to  prevent the Vietnamese communist puppets from mobilizing their  troops for offensives. These are attacks made in self-defense  to protect the people's lives and their property, cattle, carts,  plows, and rice crops.    The people say the only way to defend their lives is to  cooperate closely with the NADK. They also say that the entire  Cambodian nation and people, both in the urban and rural areas,  are now rising up. They add that they can no longer allow the  Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese puppets, and their  alliance to continue inflaming the war to kill Cambodians at  will.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Management: Quantum leaps in a dangerous game - Keeping up with the pace of change Hard on the heels of General Motors, Philips, IBM, Kodak and Volkswagen, Daimler-Benz revealed last weekend how deeply it, too, is in the mire. With disasters at such mega-companies mounting by the month, are commentators right when they argue that the days of the large corporation are numbered? Or is the western business world simply going through an unusually intense phase of its natural cycle of life and death? Either way, what can large companies do to postpone the evil day or - just possibly - avoid it entirely? These seminal questions towered above a thousand lesser puzzles about corporate strategy and organisation last week in Chicago, where 600 business academics, consultants and executives gathered at this year's annual meeting of the international Strategic Management Society. It was pure but painful coincidence that several top speakers threw the same statistic at the audience: that almost 40 per cent of the companies which comprised the Fortune 500 a decade ago no longer exist. Of the 1970 Fortune list, 60 per cent have gone, either acquired or out of business, the conference was told. And of the 12 companies which comprised the Dow Jones Industrial index at the turn of the century, only General Electric survives as a giant. As one senior manager put it: 'Very few organisations last the lifetime of an individual and still fewer lead their industry for more than 20 or 30 years.' He was understating the problem. The average corporate survival rate for large companies a decade ago was only about half as long as the life of a human being, according to a well-publicised study of the time by the Shell oil giant. Yet some companies last well over 75 years. The phenomenon of rapid corporate decline and fall has two traditional explanations: first, the inability of most companies to 'learn' and adapt at least as rapidly as their environment changes; and second, the tendency of companies in certain industries to be disrupted severely by technological innovation. Since the Shell study was done, the pace of change in the business environment has accelerated on every front: capital and trade barriers have been lowered, industrial competition has become global, technology has cut the cost of breaking into new geographic and product markets, and companies have recognised the benefits of collaboration rather than all-out merger or acquisition. As a result, many large companies are experiencing unprecedented pressure. Contrary to fashionable wisdom, this is not only coming from smaller, upstart companies taking advantage of the new competitive importance of flexibility, but also from large companies which have been better able than most of their peers to revitalise themselves. Thus Kodak is reeling partly from Fuji and 3M, Sears from WalMart, and IBM partly from Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. In these circumstances, the old 'success strategy' of continuously improving one's performance is no longer adequate, the Chicago conference was told by the managing partner of Arthur Andersen Consulting, George Shaheen. Instead, companies in all sectors must focus on becoming 'not only better but radically different'. They must take quantum leaps in order to reshape their industries. Roger Stone, the president and chief executive of his family's 67-year-old corrugated packaging company, Stone Container Corporation of Chicago, described how it is now revitalising itself after growing profitably 15-fold in the 1980s, to annual sales of Dollars 5.5bn. The keys to modern corporate 'learning' and transformation, said Stone, were: to become even more 'customer-driven' and quality-focused; to stimulate innovation throughout the company; to measure corporate and individual performance on every possible dimension; to 'manage backwards from the future, rather than short-term'; to simplify structures and processes; and, above all, to foster a process of 'creative discontent' within the company. In his down-to-earth Midwest language, Stone concluded to loud applause that 'if you want to be content you should be a dog'.</p>

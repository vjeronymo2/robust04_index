			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Dounreay rocket site mooted The Dounreay nuclear plant on the north coast of Scotland is considering whether to become a site for launching space rockets to put communications satellites into orbit. AEA Technology, the offshoot of the UK Atomic Energy Agency which operates the plant, will decide early in the new year whether to carry out a full-scale feasibility study of the launch site proposal. Dounreay, where the experimental fast-breeder reactor is to close next year, could be suitable for launching small rockets carrying satellites into polar orbits, which circle the earth passing over the poles. A requisite for polar orbit launches is to be able to launch missiles over the sea in a northerly direction. Dounreay's position on the north coast of Caithness is ideal. Western Europe has no commercial space rocket launch site. The European Space Agency launches its Ariane space rockets from French Guyana in South America. Dounreay believes there is a need for sites from which to put small communications satellites into polar orbit, as opposed to orbit around the Equator. Both Norway and Canada are considering developing launch sites. Dounreay said the scheme was in its early stages but AEA Technology is understood to have had preliminary talks with potential partners. To go ahead the project would need to be commercially viable and would need the support of the local community. It would probably employ scores rather than hundreds of people at the start. Dounreay is seeking ways to reduce its dependence on the nuclear industry. The plant is shedding staff, with 240 of its 1,400 jobs due to go in April.</p>

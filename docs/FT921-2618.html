			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: US economy The latest evidence of US economic recovery is not as decisive as Mr Bush would like at this stage of the election process. Housing starts began to pick up in the fourth quarter of last year, so the further improvement in February, although welcome, is of limited value until there are additional signs that consumer confidence is recovering. Hence yesterday's reversal of an over-hasty jump in Treasury bond yields. All the same, the trend is worrying for Wall Street. At their present high levels, the last thing US equities need is a bond market in which yields rise every time recovery moves a little closer.</p>

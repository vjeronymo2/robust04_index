			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kim Hyon-ik] </F>   [Text] On 22 March President Kim Yong-sam discussed  countermeasures for North Korea's military provocation with top  military leaders, including Yi Pyong-tae, minister of National  Defense; Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and  chiefs of staff of the ROK Army, Navy and Air Force, and decided  to maintain a posture capable of immediately responding to any  provocation.    Chu Ton-sik, Chongwadae [presidential office] spokesman  said:  "The government has established meticulous countermeasures that  could deter in advance any North Korean provocation and is  impeccably and fully prepared."    Prior to the policy meeting with top military leaders,  during  a breakfast meeting with 21 Democratic Liberal Party postholders  President Kim stressed that there is absolutely no problem in  military countermeasures, saying: "Our equipment is far  superior to North Korea's." He explained: "We are not only in  close coordination with the United States, but also have  sufficient surveillance and countermeasures with the UN Command."    President Kim Yong-sam said: "We have notified the United  States of the decision to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK and  they will arrive within the shortest time possible since U.S.  President Bill Clinton made an immediate order."    It has been learned that a reinforced battalion of Patriot  missiles will be deployed to the ROK with enough fire power to  gain supremacy over North Korean Air Force capabilities. It  will take more than one month to deploy them for actual combat  purposes.    President Kim said that "the resumption of the Team Spirit  exercise has been agreed to in principle" and that the timing  will be decided after his return from Japan and the PRC.    President Kim implied that a perfect early warning system is  in operation by saying: "North Korea's military moves can never  be made in secret."</p>

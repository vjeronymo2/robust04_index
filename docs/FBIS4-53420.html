			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand will support South Korea's candidacy for  non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council, Foreign  Minister Prasong Sunsiri said yesterday.    Ambassador Nit Phibunsongkhram in New York will be asked to  consult with other ASEAN members about the issue, Prasong told  reporters after meeting with visiting South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu.    The visiting minister had been granted an audience with His  Majesty the King before meeting with Prasong.    The UN membership issue has also raised at a meeting between  Han Sung-chu and Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, along with  Chuan's planned visit to South Korea between June 23 and 26 at  the invitation of President Kim Yong-sam.    Chuan asked South Korea to open its markets to more Thai  agricultural products, including tapioca and frozen chicken, to  reduce the trade deficit, Prasong said. He quoted Chuan as  saying Thai imports from South Korea were mostly high-cost  industrial goods while Thai exports were mainly agricultural  products.    Han Sung-chu, who arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday from the  Philippines, is on a three-day official visit to Thailand to  promote bilateral relations. He will leave for Vietnam and  Indonesia today.    The South Korean minister discussed with Thai leaders  tension  over the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula. Thailand, a  member of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a party to  the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, has good ties with the  both North and South Korea.    Other topics included Cambodia, Burma and the upcoming ASEAN  Regional Forum which South Korea will be attending along with 16  other countries in the Asia Pacific region. The forum is the  first of its kind for ASEAN.    Prasong said North Korea could join the forum only after the  Korean Peninsula issue is solved. North Korea has canvassed  ASEAN governments for support to attend, claiming that they  should not be excluded because they are part of the Asia Pacific  region.    Fearing that the forum could turn into a "boxing match"  between the two Koreas, ASEAN officials viewed North Korea's  participation as a prospect for the "longer term", when there  are positive signs in the dialogues between North Korea and the  United States.    "South Korea thinks that in order to resolve the nuclear  issue and also deal with the problems we have with the North,  dialogue is essential. Unfortunately right now there is no  dialogue. We hope North Korea will open dialogue so we can  improve relations and also resolve the nuclear problem," Han  told reporters. He said South Korea was ready for talks  anywhere, at any level, and as soon as possible. He noted that  at present the response from the North was negative.    Han said that dialogue between the U.S. and North Korea  depended on the outcome of the International Atomic Energy  Agency inspection, expected in the next two weeks.</p>

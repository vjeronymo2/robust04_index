			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Technology: New TV for the masses What is it going to take to turn long-promised multimedia technologies into mass market products and new sources of profit for the ailing computer and consumer electronics industries? The latest move to unlock demand for multimedia comes from a group of companies that have formed a joint venture called First Cities with the goal of bringing interactive multimedia services to homes and schools throughout the US. The group is led by Microelectronics and Computer Technology, a computer-industry consortium based in Austin, Texas. Members include Apple Computer, Eastman Kodak, Corning, North American Philips and two regional telephone companies. First Cities demonstrates the converging interests of consumer electronics, computer, communications and entertainment industries that could ultimately lead to the formation of a trillion-dollar industry, according to John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive. Initially the group will study the potential markets for multimedia services. Starting late next year, it aims to set up a demonstration of interactive multimedia and by early 1995 to create an interactive multimedia service available throughout the US. These might include 'movies on demand' and access to information services via TV. Interactive TV is seen by many as the most promising application of multimedia technology in the consumer sector and it is being pursued in various forms by companies including Hewlett-Packard and IBM as well as the First Cities group. To date, however, television information services have not been successful in the US and it is hard to know whether adding better-quality sound and pictures will change the trend. 'The big problem is that it is difficult to describe and explain the benefits of multipurpose multimedia systems,' says Andrew Webber, a consultant with Arthur D Little.</p>

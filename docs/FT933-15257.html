			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Greene King 'very unlikely' to make new Morland bid MR SIMON Redman, chairman of Greene King, the brewer which failed to take over its rival Morland last year, said he was 'very unlikely' to make another hostile bid for that target. He said Greene King would retain its 29.3 per cent stake in Morland, for 'the time being'. The remark was interpreted by analysts as signalling Greene King's intention to sell its Morland stake. The Pounds 1.7m net cost of carrying the stake raised the brewer's interest charges from Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 7.3m contributing to a small fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 20.3m to Pounds 20.1m. Borrowings rose to Pounds 79m (Pounds 48.8m). Since Greene King acquired its stake, Morland's shares have risen from 450p to yesterday's closing price of 543p. Greene King's shares yesterday rose 5p to 455p. Mr Redman said analysts would be wrong to infer anything from his remarks other than he had decided to keep all options open. He explained, however, that he was very unlikely to make another hostile bid since the price for success could prove too expensive. He described the Pounds 214.3n paid for JA Devenish, the west country pubs group, by Greenalls, the UK pubs and hotels group, as 'high'. The recent move outflanked rival pubs group, Boddington, which had been considering another offer for Devenish after an unsuccessful Pounds 120m hostile bid two years ago. Boddington accepted the cash offer for its 19.2 per cent stake it had acquired in Devenish. Mr Redman said there was more logic in a link-up between Morland and Greene King than in the Greenalls merger with Devenish. There was a Pounds 2.6m extraordinary charge for underwriting costs and professional fees for the failed Morland bid. Taxable profits were also affected by lower property disposals following last year's property revaluation. There was an exceptional loss of Pounds 80,000 compared to a profit of Pounds 625,000. The impact of the recession continues to adversely affect the pub trade. Mr Redman said there were only small signs of improvement. During the year Greene King IPA was given strong advertising support, which is planned to increase over the next six months. Details, page 24</p>

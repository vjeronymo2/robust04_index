			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTERS HURT AS BUILDING COLLAPSES  </P> <P> A burning storefront collapsed and fell onto several firefighters as they  battled a tire fire, authorities said. Five firefighters suffered minor  injuries in the fire, which gutted the B.F. Goodrich tire store, firefighters  said.  </P> <P> The blaze caused firefighters trouble because it kept reigniting, said Santa  Ana Fire Department Battalion Chief Jim Dalton. One firefighter suffered a  burned neck and broken ankle, two received minor injuries and two others  suffered smoke inhalation when the building's facade collapsed. "A couple of  the officers who were directing saw the facade weakening and starting to come  down and as they moved . . . within voice range, the facade started falling  from the south end," Dalton said. "It fell so fast that it hit the men before  the officers could even get to them. They had to pull a couple of the guys out  from underneath."  </P></p>

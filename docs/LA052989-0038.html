			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COSTS TO SOCIETY;  </P> <P> DROPOUT NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO PAYS  </P> <P> At 15, Robert LeBlanc didn't know exactly what he wanted to be when he grew up,  but like many youngsters his age, he figured he would be something special.  </P> <P> Maybe he would be a musician, he thought. He liked the piano and organ, and he  practiced them both diligently. Friends, relatives and instructors who admired  his drawing skills thought he might become a commercial artist, a draftsman or  even an architect.  </P> <P> What LeBlanc never guessed was that two years later he would drop out of high  school. Nor did he suspect that shortly after he left school he would spend 25  months behind bars for burglary and trespassing. But most of all, LeBlanc never  imagined that when he reached manhood at 21, he would be lucky just to get a  job as a sacker at a New Orleans area supermarket at $3.75 an hour.  </P> <P> "I don't know what to do. I'm lost. I'm a nobody -- that's what everybody  thinks, anyway," LeBlanc said.  </P> <P> Every day, government officials, business leaders and sociologists say,  millions upon millions of high school dropouts stand just where LeBlanc is now,  struggling for a toehold in a changing society while the room for them grows  smaller and smaller.  </P> <P> Theirs are personal stories of bleak prospects. Like LeBlanc, government  studies show, these dropouts will shuffle between low-paying jobs and  unemployment. They will be twice as likely as graduates to end up behind bars.  For female dropouts -- mostly unwed mothers -- welfare dependency awaits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nation's Future  </P> <P> But sociologists, academicians and business leaders warn that the story of  Robert LeBlanc and his peers is far more than individual tragedy. Their future  is the nation's future, they say.  </P> <P> As its dropout rate continues to hover at 30%, the United States is reaping a  labor pool in which nearly half of its new work force is educationally  deficient. At the same time, a changing economy is putting a premium on  reading, math and thinking skills.  </P> <P> Consequently, business leaders are hard pressed to find workers, and American  business is spending $30 billion a year training employees in reading and math  skills that they should have received in high school.  </P> <P> There are monetary costs to society as well. Experts estimate that the dropouts  in each year's class represent both an increasing welfare burden and, over  their lifetimes, $240 billion in lost tax revenues. Meanwhile, prison  incarcerations have shot up dramatically, nearly doubling in 10 years.  </P> <P> If the problem of high school dropouts and a faltering educational system is  not met head on, it is not just individuals but the entire nation that is at  risk, said David P. Gardner, president of the University of California system  and head of a blue-ribbon panel studying the issue.  </P> <P> "The task must be faced and the price must be paid," Gardner said. "We are out  of alternatives."  </P> <P> Robert LeBlanc's troubles and the dilemma he presents for New Orleans and  Louisiana represent a drama being played out across America.  </P> <P> LeBlanc left high school in the 12th grade with a spotty academic record.  </P> <P> "I dropped out because I was doing terrible in school," he said. "I was  sleeping in class. I used to hardly ever study."  </P> <P> His biggest problem was reading -- the school system never succeeded in  teaching him to master it.  </P> <P> "I can't understand what I'm reading," he said. "I don't remember it. Just to  get my driver's license I had to read the book about 15 times."  </P> <P> Consequently, he failed English five years in a row, and three times he went to  summer school to make up credit.  </P> <P> Before he left school, LeBlanc also got into trouble with the law. When he was  17, a girl he knew let him into her uncle's house and suggested that he take  $170 in cash and give her a share later. He was caught two days later and  charged with burglary. Already doing poorly in school and now facing a trial  with the possibility of spending two years in prison, he decided that trying to  go on was pointless.  </P> <P> Like dropouts across the country, LeBlanc waded into the work force with few  skills. He was already working at a fast-food restaurant as a short order cook  for minimum wage, but shortly after he left school the job disappeared when the  company was sold. He landed a job at McDonald's but, after a week, he quit. He  had made only $8 in his first week because of short hours, he said, and the  manager couldn't promise much more.  </P> <P> In court, LeBlanc got some good news. He was given three years probation. But  as he applied for job after job, he discovered that almost nobody wanted him.  </P> <P> Across the nation, business and government leaders say that as the nation moves  toward a more technical society, there is little room for high school dropouts.  </P> <P> "The problem now is that we have a greater need for graduates than we ever had  before," said Sally Hayes, head of the education committee for the New Orleans  Chamber of Commerce. "In order to be able to function competitively, they have  to be able to think, they have to be able to problem solve. This is a different  set of skills."  </P> <P> In a recent report, the Hudson Institute, an Indianapolis-based think tank  specializing in public policy issues, forecast that by the 1990s, more than  half of all new jobs will require some education beyond high school.  </P> <P> Business leaders are already complaining that today even those who are  graduated from high school are deficient in the skills needed in the new  economy. High school dropouts, they say, are so far off the mark as to drop  almost totally from consideration.  </P> <P> One example of just how far off the mark those graduates are is the National  Education Assessment Test given last year to 21- to 25-year-olds. A score of  300 on the literacy portion indicates an ability to follow directions to travel  from one location to another. Seventy-eight percent of dropouts failed. A score  of 300 on the math portion indicates the ability to enter deposits and checks  and balance a checkbook. Seventy-nine percent of dropouts failed.  </P> <P> "It's tough for these kids," said Karen Evans, acting supervisor at the West  Bank Training Center, a federally funded job training operation just outside of  New Orleans. "They come in reading at the fifth- and sixth-grade level and  they're competing with adults who are out of work. And there aren't enough  blue-collar jobs that pay $7, $8, $10 an hour. They just don't exist. They're  looking at jobs that pay minimum wage, and sometimes they are part-time jobs.  </P> <P> "A lot of time, our time is spent in 'reality therapy.' They say: 'I want a job  making $5 an hour.' Kids tell us: 'Nobody can live on $3.35 an hour.' Our  response is: 'Take a look: this is what the real world is like.' We say: 'What  can you do that somebody is going to pay you more than $3.35 an hour for?'  </P> <P> "At first, they're shocked. They look at us like 'what are you talking about?'  The kids come in and think that -- they've worked on their cars at home -- they  can get a job as a mechanic. They discover that even to do minor tuneups, you  have to be able to read a computer printout. It takes more literacy. Nobody is  going to let you work on their $15,000 car if you haven't had some experience  and training."  </P> <P> Before many of those dropouts get to Evans, they have been to the office of  Regina Roat, employment manager for Hyatt Regency in New Orleans.  </P> <P> "Seventy percent of the people who come through this office haven't graduated  from high school," said Roat, whose office hires hourly employees -- the  reservation clerks, PBX operators, housekeepers, stewards, cooks, waiters,  waitresses, and cashiers who make up 90% of the hotel's staff.  </P> <P> "It's frustrating. I have people come in and fill out a job application and  they have someone with them to help them fill it out. I spend a lot of time  when I'm interviewing just filling in the blanks. I expect that, to a degree,  because these are low-paying, hourly jobs, but not to the severity that it is  here. I can't hire someone who can't speak and who can't read and write, and I  get a lot of those."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Applications  </P> <P> Consequently, Roat said she finds herself wading through a stack of applicants  to fill one simple job.  </P> <P> "I probably interview at least 30 people for one desk position, probably 15 for  a housekeeper. I had a lady who came in who was perfect for a waitress position  in our deli. She was bubbly, she was clean. She had to be able to read to take  orders and ring things up. She told me she couldn't work in the deli because  she couldn't read and write."  </P> <P> Other New Orleans companies report similar situations. Chevron, for instance,  is looking for operations and maintenance personnel at its New Orleans  facility.  </P> <P> "A lot of them have a hard time passing the basic reading, writing and  arithmetic test," said Chris Lardge, manager of employment in Chevron's San  Francisco headquarters. "They have a lot of people lined up per job, but they  whittle them down quickly because a lot of them can't read instructions clearly  and understand what they're reading, and write things, and they have some  problems with basic mathematics. It's true across the country, in our Richmond  refinery, our Philadelphia refinery. I was down in Pascagoula, Miss., and they  were saying the same thing."  </P> <P> New York Telephone Co. reports that in a six-month period in 1987, 84% of its  job applicants failed the entry-level examination. Only 20% of job applicants  at Motorola could pass a simple seventh-grade test of English comprehension or  fifth-grade mathematics test.  </P> <P> Aside from skills, dropouts present "an attitudinal problem," said Hugh  Farrabaugh, human resources director for Martin Marietta in New Orleans.  </P> <P> "They lack the discipline and commitment to operate within a structure," he  said. "They have difficulty assimilating into an industrial structural  environment."  </P> <P> And as industry moves toward high technology, even workers now on the job seem  to lack the educational skills to handle more automated tasks. What many  companies are finding is what Motorola Inc. Vice President Carlton Braun told  the congressional Joint Economic Committee last April.  </P> <P> "We have found to our disappointment that many workers are not prepared to  operate the factory of the present, much less of the future," he said.  </P> <P> At Martin Marietta, makers of booster rockets for the space shuttle, officials  are wrestling with how to move a work force toward more advanced technology.  </P> <P> "Our intent is to get more automated," Farrabaugh said. "As we become more  automated and upgrade our capability . . . we may have to get training in  computer literacy. Technical vocabulary is a problem. Computation skills are  not what we like them to be. Presently, the company is trying to figure out at  what grade level should it write new training and instruction material.  </P> <P> "We want to write the documents to an acceptable level, but not to a  third-grade level," he said.  </P> <P> Robert LeBlanc eventually landed a job at a Burger King. That lasted three  days. He was arrested atop a building near his home one night after work and  charged with burglary. Already on probation, he spent six months in jail before  pleading guilty to a reduced charge of criminal trespassing -- a misdemeanor.  After his release, he found a job as a busboy at a local country club. But, on  the day before he got his first paycheck, his probation on the original  burglary charge was revoked because of the misdemeanor conviction. He was sent  to Jefferson Parish Prison for 19 months.  </P> <P> There he found lots of people like himself.  </P> <P> "From what we're seeing, they drop out of school and end up in juvenile  institutions and in prison," said Martha Jumonville, communications director  for the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections. "Many of them  don't have the ability to read or write above the fifth-grade level, can't fill  out a job application."  </P> <P> According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 62% of the nation's prison  inmates in 1986 were high school dropouts. That was up from 53% just seven  years earlier. The median education level has declined from 11 years of  schooling in 1979 to 10 years in 1986.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Incarcerations Up  </P> <P> Meanwhile, incarcerations have shot up. In California, for example, in 1980,  103 people out of every 100,000 were behind bars. Last year, the figure had  more than doubled to 239 out of 100,000.  </P> <P> Prison was a rude awakening for LeBlanc.  </P> <P> "I don't want to go back there," he said. "That's why I need to get a job to  keep my mind on work." In prison, he found, "You don't do nothing, you don't  see nothing, you don't go nowhere. It's just nothing. They feed you cold food.  They treat you like dogs. I got into a lot of fights. You have to fight to  survive. I thought I'd never get out."  </P> <P> When most inmates finally make it out, they end up back on the streets with the  same educational inadequacies. It is little surprise to prison officials that  they soon return to jail.  </P> <P> "If, by reason of not having the ability or having a skill and education, an  inmate cannot go out and sell himself, then he can't find a job -- that is, a  non-skilled, non-reading job," said Tony Travisano, executive director of  American Correctional Assn., the professional organization that represents  various correctional groups around the United States. In that case, Travisano  said, he is likely to return to crime -- "He's going to get his bread from some  place."  </P> <P> Nationally, 63% of prison inmates are back behind bars within six months after  release. In an attempt to deal with that problem in Louisiana, state  legislation has been introduced that would require inmates to be able to read  and write before becoming eligible for parole.  </P> <P> "If you do get out, what are you going to do if you don't have the skills to  get a job?" Jumonville asked. "You need to have something to keep you from  going back to the crime that you committed. If you can't read, can't write,  chances are you're going to wind up back in prison."  </P> <P> New Orleans Judge Miriam Waltzer has watched them trudge through her courtroom.  A year ago, she said: "I just got sick and tired of seeing people who can't  read." So she instituted a program of sentencing people to earn their high  school graduation equivalency degree.  </P> <P> Once a week her courtroom is turned into a classroom. The rule is simple: show  up for class or go to jail.  </P> <P> "They would plead guilty and there is a form they have to fill out," Waltzer  said. "I'd ask them to read the first paragraph of a form they have to fill out  and they would say I forgot my glasses. I'd ask them what 'waive your rights'  means and they would say waive would mean wave your hand.  </P> <P> "It got to me how many were out there who were not able to read anything, not  even the instructions on a box. I think if we're successful with what we're  trying to do, that we save the state a lot of money."  </P> <P> LeBlanc got his general equivalency degree while in prison. After his release,  he headed for the West Bank Training Center and, with the help of a job  placement agency, landed a job at minimum wage, 25 miles from his home. That  lasted one day. Without a car or transportation, he says, he couldn't get  there.  </P> <P> For the three weeks after that, he looked for jobs sporadically, sometimes  staying at his mother's home, sometimes at his father's house, and occasionally  spending the night with a cousin who owns a local lounge. During the day, he  idled away his time.  </P> <P> One day recently, LeBlanc sat at his mother's kitchen table bemoaning his fate.  </P> <P> "I sit around. I straighten up around the house for a while. I go talk to my  father. I go talk to my grandma or just hang around with one of my brothers.  Shoot pool on Wednesday nights and sometimes I go to my cousin's lounge.  </P> <P> "Seems like every step I take I run into a locked door. Now my girlfriend is  starting to talk trash -- her daddy says she shouldn't be with me because I'm a  nobody, because I don't have a job. I'm in a mood like I don't want to do  nothing no more.  </P> <P> "Most of the people, they don't want nobody like me. They want a dependable  person with a car, somebody they can call any time of the day. I've got a  record, you know.  </P> <P> "I just want to find a job and stay with it and learn things about it. I just  want to stay with something and work my way up to be a somebody. I don't want  to be a nobody."  </P> <P> The very next day, LeBlanc landed his part-time job as a sacker at a local  grocery store. But there is a hitch. Because of his prison record, he can't  start work until he produces a letter from the court that says there are no  other pending charges against him. In the interim, a family friend has hired  him at $25 a day to clean up and help out around his tuxedo shop.  </P> <P> For now, LeBlanc is pleased.  </P> <P> "He's happy," his mother, Lynn James, said. "He's got a little money and he  fixed his brother's car and he's got that."  </P> <P> Still it's a long way from being a musician or a draftsman.  </P> <P> "I'm just hoping that working and getting in a job situation and making money  he'll think about doing something more with his life," his mother said.  </P></p>

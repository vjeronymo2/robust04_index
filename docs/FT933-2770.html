			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Cuba announces farm reforms The Cuban government has announced farm reforms to reduce state control over agriculture, AP reports from Mexico City. In the Communist Party daily Granma, the government said it would set up co  -operatives on state land and allowing farmers to share in their profits. The co-operatives, to be set up for an indefinite period, would still sell all their output to the state, but farmers would now split the profits among themselves, handle their banking and buy their own materials on credit.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Isakov "Parliamentary Diary": "Budget Drama--Act </F> Two"]    [Excerpt] "Givi Is Seriously Ill"    I called last year's report on the examination of the budget  message the "Budget Drama." Has anything changed since then?  The answer is in the headline of this piece.    As a participant in the adoption of the state budget for a  fourth time through the voters' will I cannot fail to see how  time after time its content is emasculated and the budget  process is degraded and turned into a mockery.    It makes sense to begin the discussion of the 1994 budget  with certain results. The official account of the previous year  has not been submitted by the government and no wonder -- there  is little comfort in it. But there are some unofficial  statistics, which are:    Fall in industrial production:    Prediction in the president's message: 7 percent;    Actual figure for the year: 16.2 percent.    Rise in Prices:    Prediction in the president's message: Threefold;    Actual figure for the year: Tenfold.    Federal Budget Deficit (as a percentage of GDP):    Prediction in the president's message: 5 percent;    Actual figure for the year: 10.6 percent.    According to the main socioeconomic indicators, this is a  two- to three-fold discrepancy! Can that really be true? Yes,  it can.    The new program presented by the government looks no more  realistic either. The prediction for the fall in production in  1994 is around 8 percent. But in the first quarter alone it was  25 percent and over the year, according to the specialists'  estimates, it could be at a level of 30 percent. The budget has  been calculated on the basis of an inflation rate of 490-510  percent (whereas in fact it was 730 percent in the first  quarter).    There is a further increase in taxes built into the budget:  a 6 percent increase in profit tax, 3 percent in value-added  tax, 2 percent in property tax, and so forth. The government  intends to use the taxation system to gather into the budget a  sum equal to 16.6 percent of GDP. But last year it managed to  collect only 10.6 perecent of GDP and in the first quarter of  this year the figure was even less -- 8 percent. So there you  have it, the first result of the move toward the "market": Over  90 percent of created public wealth is bypassing the budget and  being distributed outside state control. Have you felt the  difference?    It is obvious to the naked eye that the economic slump is  assuming the character of chronic stagnation: State investments  in the development of the economy are a token sum in terms of  the budget -- around 2 percent of GDP -- and have fallen even  when compared with last year's clearly understated level. The  agrarian sector, science, education, and culture are being  underfunded. While budget spending is rising by an average of  fivefold, spending on social programs is rising by 4.1 times....  On the other hand, spending on the state apparatus is rising  eightfold!    Gaping holes are appearing in the revenue section of the  budget, too. The planned transition from a voucher-based  privatization to cash is being accompanied by...a sharp  reduction in that item of revenue. In that case, where will the  funds go? Into the pockets of brazen privatizers? It will cost  hundreds of billions of rubles to maintain the tax benefits  granted by the president and the government to individual,  selected "favorites," in crude violation of the existing  legislation.    The conclusion: This discredited economic course is  continuing in an even clearer and more overt form. Let us ask  ourselves: Can such a budget be the basis of social accord?    The budget is not just a mirror of the economy but a  continuation of policy. Despite all the talk about the  significance and importance of the budget, neither the president  nor the chairman of the government turned up for the discussion  of it. Acting Foreign Minister Dubinin "carried the can" for  them all.    The document which bears the solemn title "the budget" can  only be called a budget if you really stretch a point: It  contains no account of the execution of the budget for 1992 or  preliminary results of the execution of the budget in 1993, it  does not offer indicators forecasting the development of the  economy in 1994, it has no list of state targeted programs,  there is no explanation of the majority of budget items....  Essentially it is not a budget at all but a set of departmental  items of expenditure linked by a single demand that unites them  all: "Give us the money and clear off!"    One can understand that there is no money in the state  today,  and that the threadbare Russian budget cannot satisfy everyone's  needs. What is harder to understand is why the government  cannot present even this budget on time? Why it is presented in  an incomplete form without accounting documents and each time  using a new methodology which prevents a comparison with the  previous year's results?    However, there is a most direct link between the first and  second points: The present political leadership, which has led  the country into the quagmire of the economic crisis, cannot  stand being monitored and has no intention of answering to  anyone, least of all to the deputies. You will not give us the  money? We will take it without asking. And if you demand an  account -- we will mislead you. And we will forbid you in the  future from interfering in the executive's affairs.    Well, what about the Duma? Two opposing standpoints clashed  at the Duma session during the discussion of the budget:  "Reject the budget and send it back to the government for  revision," and "adopt the budget on first reading." I consider  the former option correct. But in present conditions, when the  Duma has been cut off from the mass media, it will find it  difficult even to convey its view to the people, let alone  explain it. And, conversely, it is very easy to become a target  for those who are seeking scapegoats for their own mistakes  (remember how last year the Supreme Soviet was castigated for  the budget). That is why they could have accepted the moderate  compromise proposed by the Duma's Budget and Finance Committee:  "To consider the budget presented."    But such a compromise did not suit the government -- it  needed a "more soothing" formula. So the Duma committees headed  by the chairman of the chamber looked for one. Eventually they  found one: The budget is totally unsuitable and needs a  fundamental revision but "is adopted as a basis." There was  laughter and irritation: "Givi is sick, come and bury him," was  how one Duma wag commented on the decision adopted.    However, no verbal trickery can hide the unpleasant fact  that  Russia does not have a budget and is not going to get one in the  near future. The government cannot produce one, the Duma is in  no position to do so.... [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by reporter Manny Cuenca from Silvio Petirossi </F> International Airport -- live]    [Text] Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy has arrived  at the international airport's military base and soon will board  the plane that will take him to Brazil. He is traveling with  his wife and some of his ministers. Wasmosy will fly to  Uberaba, Brazil, where he will be decorated for his work with  the International Federation of Zebu Cattle Breeders. He will  also meet Brazilian President Itamar Franco on 3 May, although  there was initially some doubt about this meeting given the  official mourning declared in Brazil over the death of car  racing champion Ayrton Senna. Sources close to the president  have confirmed that the meeting will take place.    The president was actually supposed to leave for Brazil on 1  May but he is leaving today. The plane is ready and the  president is saying goodbye to ministers, high-ranking military  officers, and Colorado Party leaders.    [Begin Wasmosy recording] Messrs. journalists, as I have  told  you before, we are respecting and will continue to respect the  rights of the strikers and will protect them, but they do not  have the right to close streets, highways, set tires on fire,  and other things. We will not allow this because both strikers  and those who do not want to participate in the strike have the  same rights. It is the government's duty to keep streets and  highways open to traffic. This is our duty and we will do it.  Thank you. [end recording]    This was President Wasmosy on his way to the plane,  reiterating the position that several ministers stated a few  minutes ago at Government House. The president now is boarding  the plane with his wife, Teresa Carrasco, and the agriculture  and livestock minister. As you have seen on the screen,  President Wasmosy's plane has started rolling and this is the  end of our report.</p>

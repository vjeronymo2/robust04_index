			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Gold price fails to hold gains The gold market was left treading water this week after a buying surge proved insufficient to buoy the metal's price to the Dollars 400-a-troy-ounce level. Having begun the new year with a Dollars 3.50 jump, aided by a strong rise in silver, the gold price added another Dollars 2.35 on Wednesday to reach a five-month peak of Dollars 396.60 an ounce. But the two-day advance was wiped out on Thursday as computer programmes used by some US institutional investors sent out almost unanimous 'sell' signals. The fall, which took the price to Dollars 385.25 an ounce at one point, was seen by some analysts as representing merely a badly-needed pause for breath before a fresh assault on the Dollars 400 barrier. However, Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, warned that physical demand for gold was 'dropping like a stone'. The price recovered to close yesterday at Dollars 388.25 an ounce, down Dollars 2.50 on the week, but dealers told the Reuter news agency that stiff resistance was building in the Dollars 390s. 'What we are seeing now is the difference between dealers' ambitions for the new year and what the market can actually do,' said one. The silver market, which had been pushed sharply higher on concern over the risings in Mexico, also surrendered its gains, the cash price in London ending at Dollars 5.05 1/2 an ounce, down six cents on the week. News of big rises in London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks pushed copper and zinc prices still lower yesterday, after both metals had already sustained substantial falls earlier in the week. Last week's end-year profit-taking in the copper market spilled over into Tuesday's trading, when the three months price fell Dollars 36 to Dollars 1,752.25 a tonne. A Dollars 17 bounce on the following day had been wiped out by yesterday's close. Defying the downtrend was aluminium, which shrugged off news of another LME stocks increase to rise Dollars 3 yesterday to Dollars 1,149.50 a tonne in the three months position, up Dollars 24.25 on the week. Dealers explained that buyers were being encouraged by hopes of progress at the next multilateral meeting on stemming the Russian aluminium supply glut, which is scheduled to be held in Brussels later this month. A depressed week for cocoa prices ended with further losses yesterday in response to rumours of an imminent devaluation of the CFA franc, the currency of, among others, the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer. At the London Commodity Exchange the May futures price dipped to Pounds 893 a tonne at one stage, before ending the day at Pounds 906, down Pounds 23 on the week and Dollars 40 below Tuesday's peak. LCE coffee futures fared somewhat better, the March position closing yesterday at Dollars 1,194 a tonne, down Pounds 5 on the day and Pounds 4 on the week, after trading between Dollars 1,181 and Dollars 1,209. Seasonal cheer came late to the oil market, which had ended 1993 near 5-year lows. A change of sentiment this week saw the London International Petroleum Exchange's March Brent blend futures position climb to a high of Dollars 14.51 a barrel before easing to Dollars 14.33 in late trading yesterday, still up 93 cents the week. Mr Nauman Barakat, a vice-president for energy futures with Merrill Lynch in New York, told Reuter that market psychology had changed in the short-term and speculators were 'buying dips rather than selling rallies'.  ---------------------------------------          LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  --------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close)  --------------------------------------- tonnes  --------------------------------------- Aluminium         +3,525 to 2,491,900 Aluminium alloy     -380 to    48,880 Copper           +10,850 to   610,350 Lead              -2,175 to   301,475 Nickel            +1,188 to   125,292 Zinc             +20,300 to   927,000 Tin                 +845 to    20,895  ---------------------------------------</p>

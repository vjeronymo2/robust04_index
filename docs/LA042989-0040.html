			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN LONGDEN MADE HIS LAST RIDE PAY OFF  </P> <P> Conspicuous by its absence among Earl Gustkey's examples of sports figures who  retired "the right way" was John Longden.  </P> <P> In the final race of his great riding career, Longden won Santa Anita's San  Juan Capistrano Handicap by a nose while aboard George Royal on March 12, 1966.  </P> <P> George Royal was not the favorite, either. He was given only a so-so chance,  going off at odds of 6-1. Yet, Longden ended his riding career with a win in  fairy-tale fasion, providing thoroughbred racing with one of its most emotional  moments ever.  </P> <P> Longden retired as winningest jockey in history with 6,032 victories. It was a  record that stood until Bill Shoemaker broke it in 1970.  </P> <P> The win by Longden on George Royal will be a difficult act to top for Shoemaker  when he rides in his final race sometimes in the not too distant future.  </P> <P> JON WHITE  </P> <P> Duarte  </P></p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Doubts about the hard ERM YESTERDAY, Mr John Major insisted that the ERM would continue to be successful, 'whatever happens to the Maastricht treaty'. In this the prime minister echoed the European Community's finance ministers at their weekend meeting in Bath. But they all protest too much. How can the prime minister be so confident of the future of the ERM? 'Changes in economic and monetary arrangements must,' he claims, 'reflect real changes in economic behaviour in the marketplace and must work with the grain of the market and not against it.' The ERM meets this criterion, he asserts. This is a noteworthy proposition. Compare, for example, his predecessor's view that 'you can't buck the markets'. Consider also the notion that official foreign exchange speculation, to the tune of at least Pounds 7.3bn this financial year alone, is in 'the grain of the market'. The proposition is more than noteworthy. The economic merit of ERM, by comparison with Emu, is only its flexibility. As a fixed exchange rate system the ERM is half-baked, because of the price it imposes for a flexibility governments say they do not want. Ministers insist they will not realign, but only one thing is believed for certain: that the D-Mark will never be realigned downwards. D-Mark interest rates are the floor, therefore, with all other currencies paying an interest rate premium, its size depending on the credibility of the commitment not to realign. In some cases - Italy's today, for example - that premium is so large that it damages credibility itself. In Emu, by contrast, there would be no premia, because only then could the pre-commitment to fixed parities be credible. Half-baked Emu Nor is this all. German policy oriented towards German conditions sets the floor in the ERM. This is partly because of the ERM's rules on exchange rate intervention, partly because of Germany's muscle in the EC and partly because of German sensitivity over inflation. The Bath meeting merely underlined the point. The Bundesbank was begged to promise not to raise interest rates. But its representatives cannot make such a promise. EC ministers reaffirmed their commitment to fixed exchange rates, but Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president, declined to add full support. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, refused to accept criticism of German fiscal policy. The hard ERM is, in short, a half-baked Emu under German management. It is also unlikely to endure. As the gold standard showed, fixed exchange rates can be sustained among open economies without exchange rate controls. But a system like the ERM, with theoretical flexibility, can never enjoy the same credibility. Exchange rates will be under pressure again and again. Sooner or later one is bound to give. With it will go the credibility of the hard version of the ERM. Imperfectly credible Ministers must know this well enough. But they cannot say so, because they are caught in the logic of an imperfectly credible fixed exchange rate system. The more doubtful the commitment, the more it must be reasserted. But the costlier the commitment, the more it must be doubted. Interest rates of 15 per cent in Italy, borrowings of Ecu10bn in the UK are not only ways of demonstrating commitment. They are also signs of how deep doubts already are. The hard ERM is not a permanent solution to Europe's monetary problem. Without early Emu, it will have to be redesigned. Those who wish to stay in a fixed relationship with the D-Mark, will need to tie themselves more closely. For them abolition of the fluctuation bands would be the obvious route. Those who feel that the exchange rate flexibility of an adjustable peg system is useful need to consider how flexibility might be used without destroying credibility. Part of the solution would be changes in domestic policy arrangements, including an independent central bank. Ministers have to say that exchange rates will never be realigned. But they cannot say it credibly, because markets know they have to say it. Mere assertion, even along with high interest rates and sustained intervention, will not preserve the hard ERM in the long run.</p>

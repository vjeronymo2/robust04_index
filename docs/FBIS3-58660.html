			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Norwegian Prime Minister Gro </F> Harlem Brundtland by Egil Knudsen; place and not given]    [Text] "Norway does not want to say `no' to future NATO  membership for the countries of Eastern Europe, but is offering  a process toward ever increasing cooperation. Today  `Partnership for Peace' is the best response, because it does  not also create uncertainty in other countries."    This is Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's summing up of  the situation on the eve of Monday's and Tuesday's important  NATO summit in Brussels where she will head the Norwegian  delegation. Several former Warsaw Pact (WP) countries want rapid  membership of NATO and many people are calling the meeting the  organization's most important meeting for years.    The prime minister agrees with this description: "The  previous summit in Rome a couple of years ago was also  important. It decided NATO's position after the fall of the  Wall. Now developments have moved on with new challenges which  need constructive responses. The meeting is therefore of  crucial importance."    [Knudsen] Why is Norway negative toward the possibility of  the former East bloc countries becoming members?    [Harlem Brundtland] I think that it is wrong to put the  question in those terms. For a long time there have been talks  among all the NATO nations and there have been gradual  developments. After the last summit the NACC (North Atlantic  Cooperation Council) was the concrete response for increased  cooperation between NATO countries and the former WP countries.  Now we are building further on our experiences and are entering  into even closer cooperation. Norway wants openness, in future  developments too.    [Knudsen] So former East bloc countries could become members  in the longer term?    [Harlem Brundtland] Yes, that is possible. We are offering  a process toward ever increasing cooperation.    [Knudsen] Would new members and an extension of NATO's  borders toward the East have a destabilizing effect in the  present situation?    [Harlem Brundtland] Yes, membership for a few selected  countries would be a less satisfactory solution. The new  proposal for cooperation, "Partnership for Peace," is a concrete  and good response. Nor will such a response create uncertainty  in other countries. [Harlem Brundtland ends]    The prime minister stressed that this response is flexible  and adapted to individual countries: "NATO is offering similar  bilateral agreements with interested countries, and also  additional agreements for each individual country adapted to its  cooperation needs."    [Knudsen] Could Russia also join "Partnership for Peace?"    [Harlem Brundtland] Russia will also receive an invitation.  We are not creating divisions, but are aiming at developments  involving democratic controls over and structures for the  military forces.    [Knudsen] What will NATO's main future role be in this  scenario?    [Harlem Brundtland] NATO will continue to build on what was  contained in the original 1949 package: Looking after the  territorial integrity of member nations. Now that we are  extending cooperation to the east, we must not throw out the  baby with the bath water. The responsibility NATO has had must  continue to exist; new cooperation with other states is  something additional.    [Knudsen] But NATO's traditional enemy image no longer  applies?    [Harlem Brundtland] That is correct, but nor do we have any  guarantee that we could not be attack by other countries. We  still need mutually committed cooperation.    [Knudsen] The United States is scaling down in Europe. Will  not the Western European Union assume a larger part of the  burden?    [Harlem Brundtland] The Western European Union will be given  the additional role of NATO's European pillar. But this will  not mean that the original role underlying NATO will disappear.  [Harlem Brundtland ends]    Gro Harlem Brundtland also stressed that the government has  broad support in the Storting for its future NATO course.</p>

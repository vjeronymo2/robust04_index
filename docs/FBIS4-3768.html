			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 23 Apr (XINHUA)--The Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] today sent a letter  to Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] to exchange views  on the incidents that caused the loss of lives and property of  mainland and Taiwan compatriots.    The letter noted: On 12 April, a person in charge of the  ARATS said the ARATS agreed in principle that after the ARATS  and SEF have made the necessary preparations, both sides can  exchange views on the incidents--incidents that caused the loss  of lives and property of mainland and Taiwan compatriots--that  had occurred in the course of cross-strait contacts and  exchanges over the past two years. The ARATS believes at  present that both sides should decide on the topics and contents  for their exchange of views through consultations before  considering the level of personnel, the time, and the place [for  a meeting]. If both sides cannot reach a consensus on the  topics and contents, they will not be able to find common ground  when they exchange views. That is not the type of negotiations  sought by any of our compatriots on either side of the Taiwan  Strait.    The ARATS believes that the contents for the exchange of  views should include the following: 1) Both sides should  exchange views on the issue of cross-strait tourism contacts,  including the safety of mainland and Taiwan compatriots when  they are traveling. It was as early as the end of August 1993  when the ARATS and the SEF held their first working negotiations  on the implementation of the Wang-Gu meeting that the ARATS  proposed in the "timetable for negotiations on the  implementation of the relevant agreements reached during the  Wang-Gu meeting" that both the ARATS and the SEF hold special  negotiations on the issue of "improving cross-strait tourism  contacts." However, to date, the ARATS still has not received a  reply from the SEF. 2) The ARATS has always called for carrying  out all the negotiations on routine, economic, scientific, and  technological topics stipulated by the "common agreements  reached during the Wang-Gu meeting," and it has more than once  suggested to the SEF that the negotiation on "the rights and  interests of Taiwan businessmen's investments on the mainland  and relevant issues" be started as soon as possible. The ARATS  believes that the personal safety of Taiwan businessmen who have  invested on the mainland as well as the safety of their property  is protected by the laws. If the SEF thinks it necessary, both  sides may exchange views [on the topic] when they negotiate "the  rights and interests of Taiwan businessmen's investments on the  mainland and relevant issues." 3) The ARATS has repeatedly  demanded that the ARATS and the SEF hold consultations on the  issue of the Taiwan military's killing and wounding in recent  years mainland fishermen operating in coastal areas and the  resulting serious losses of lives and property. After the ARATS  was established, it has continued pointing out to the SEF such  inhuman acts which hurt the feelings of our compatriots on both  sides of the Taiwan Strait and damage the cross-strait  harmonious atmosphere, in the hope that Taiwan's relevant  departments will attach importance to the issue, compensate  [victims for their] losses, find out who is responsible, and  sternly punish the killers. Meanwhile, it has called for  putting an end once and for all to such violence through  ARATS-SEF consultations. However, to date, the ARATS still has  not received a reply from the SEF.    The letter clearly and definitely pointed out that the  delays  and failure to begin negotiations on the aforementioned rights  and interests of mainland and Taiwan compatriots in their  contacts and exchanges, including the issue of their personal  safety, are not the responsibility of our side.    The letter noted: The present ARATS-SEF contacts and the  methods of their cooperation should be conducted strictly in  accordance with the "ARATS-SEF agreement on the system for their  contact and talks" signed last year. After the "Qiandao Lake  incident" took place, the ARATS briefed the SEF on the  situation, gave answers to several questions raised by the  latter, and responded to its several requests in accordance with  the agreement. However, the SEF repeatedly made requests that  exceeded the scope of the ARATS-SEF agreement mentioned above.  Although the ARATS pointed this out, the SEF still insisted on  its requests. This is a practice that does not respect the  ARATS-SEF agreement. It is our sincerest hope that ARATS-SEF  contacts and cooperation can be carried out in accordance with  the existing agreement.    The letter pointed out: As far as the "Qiandao Lake  incident" is concerned, the pressing matter of the moment is to  investigate and deal with the case according to the law.  Meanwhile, to show further goodwill, the ARATS took the  initiative in inviting the SEF and relevant experts to visit  Zhejiang and to make arrangements for the experts to give a  briefing on the specific state of the case and to answer  questions. If the SEF was willing to understand the details of  the case and truly showed understanding and sympathy for the  feelings of the victims' families, why did it set preconditions?  This is hard for people to understand. The ARATS reiterates its  invitation mentioned above and hopes that the SEF soon will  propose its name list and itinerary. It has been learned from  the relevant department that three suspects were arrested and  that they will soon stand trial in accordance with judicial  procedures.</p>

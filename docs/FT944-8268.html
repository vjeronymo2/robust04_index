			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Tokyo markets Aggressive overseas buyers of the Tokyo stock market in the first quarter have been disappointed by the Nikkei's progress. Foreign investors had hoped the market would move forward sharply on the back of an expected strong recovery in corporate earnings. The interim earnings reported by manufacturers this month have indeed been strong. But the Nikkei has moved sideways. Admittedly, US investors are sitting on 5 per cent profits since March, but that is due to the dollar's depreciation against the yen. Domestic shareholders have enjoyed no improvement whatsoever. The reason for investors' frustration is that the earnings recovery among manufacturers has already been discounted. Sectors such as steel and paper have outperformed the market by about 10 per cent this year. But the Nikkei has been held back by sectors such as construction and banking which have fallen 18 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. Overseas investors have neither the weight nor confidence to create a market recovery. For the market to move forward decisively, it must be driven by domestic buyers. But Japanese institutions view equities, which yield less than 1 per cent, as expensive compared with bonds which yield 4.75 per cent. Moreover, the banks, troubled by poorly performing loans, still own 20 per cent of the market. Whenever the Nikkei picks up, they sell into strength. If the market breaks out from its recent trading range soon, the move is likely to be down.</p>

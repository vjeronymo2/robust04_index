			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Linda Sherzer video report; italicized passages in English] </F>   [Excerpts] Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, the Palestinian Islamic  Jihad leader, maintains that navigator Ron Arad is the only IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] soldier missing in Lebanon who is still  alive. Al-Shaqaqi made this observation in an interview with  Linda Sherzer in Damascus last week. He contends that he does  not know where Ron Arad is being held today. Here is Linda  Sherzer's report from Syria:    [Begin recording] [Sherzer] Before Fathi al-Shaqaqi was  expelled from the Gaza Strip, he was considered one of the most  dangerous people there. In his office in Damascus, he proudly  explains the reason:    [Al-Shaqaqi] From October '86 to October '87, we  killed from the Israeli soldiers more than all the other  factions inside Palestine.    [Sherzer] [passage omitted] You have travelled  through the Arab world. Do you know anything about the fate of  the missing Israeli servicemen?    [Al-Shaqaqi] You know, I think all the Israeli  soldiers, except Ron Arad, are dead.    [Sherzer] Do you know that for a fact?    [Al-Shaqaqi] Yes, for a fact.    [Sherzer] Nowadays he and his wife and two children live in  Damascus. He teaches his four-year-old daughter about the  Palestinian cause. In his opinion, the Gaza-Jericho agreement  is a disaster.

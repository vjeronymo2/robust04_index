Toshiba envisioning this market growth is going to  strategize the business largely by employing 2 kinds of MCM  semicustom products. When the LSI design rule reaches less than  0.5 m level, it will become difficult to lower the cost of  LSI in order to produce a single chip on Si. On the other hand,  Toshiba sees that the price of MCM which has a strong market  demand will fall, its development time will be shortened, and  the market will expand steadily. Customization will allow for  the reduction of cost and development time.    The packaging and wiring will be partially regulated by the  company, and the chip will be used like design methods seen in a  semicustom LSI. Of the two types of chips, one will be made on a  ceramic baseboard in consideration of low cost, and the other  will be made by deposition of thin film in consideration of  performance. The design kit was developed jointly with CAD  vendors following the method of development seen in ASIC. As for  testing at this time, although the issue must be resolved in the  future, the bare chip on board was interfaced by using a special  socket.    The MCM market is expected to grow and the sales of MCM  employing a semicustom design and manufacturing method have  started. The demand for MCM is projected to grow to &yen;3-4  trillion in the year 2000. In order to accommodate the demand,  low cost and short development time are essential (figure 1).  For this reason, the shape of baseboard and the part of wiring  inside the baseboard were regulated, and two types of MCM  employing a design and manufacturing method following the idea  of semicustom LSIs were realized. The importance of price  constraints was emphasized with one type of MCM which started  selling in October, 1993. The importance of the performance  constraint was emphasized in the other type of the MCM which  will start selling in April, 1994. Active promotion will take  place starting from April, 1994.      In design rule before 0.5 m level, a single chip had a  cost advantage for compact high speed functions requiring  multiple chips. However, in LSI with high end logic on board  when less than 0.5 m level reached, it is viewed that MCM  may  be advantageous in cost in many areas. Furthermore, because of  system integration, various kinds of processors will be placed  on board and then MCM will become more advantageous. Before 0.5  m level is reached, in terms of cost and characteristics, a  single chip had an advantage by employing next generation   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-40A>           Figure 1. &yen;3-4 Trillion MCM Market Growth By Year 2000. </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-41A>           Figure 2. Increase of Cost in Single Chip After 0.5m Level. </FIG>  processing technology. After about 3 years, cost and performance  were improved, and products using MCM were never created. In  leading edge high tech devices seeking high speed, the ratio of  preprocessing cost was rather high, and packaging costs could be  ignored, and were not included.    <H5>  &yen;3-4 Trillion Market Expansion In Year 2000 </H5>   The size of MCM market is doubling every year. Aside from  the  demand from military and supercomputer makers, the reason for  this demand is: (a) a need for MCM is found in high performance  WS (work stations); (b) the lower cost of MCM is seen instead of  using LSIs with high end logic on board after the 0.5 m  level  is reached in large scale logic.    The reason for (a) is because of the demand for small  computer systems in which high speed, large scale, and short  development time are increasing. A typical example is the WS,  which plays a key role in the MCM market growth. Because of the  requirement of high speed over 100 MHz, it is difficult to  interface with the chips on board due to the wiring delay. On  the other hand, because of the desirability of incorporating  MPU, which is leading edge technology, in the system, business  can not afford to wait for progress in the development of single  chip on board such as catch SRAM. Competition in product  development is fierce, and a half year delay will be caught by  other competitors resulting in a profit loss of fifty percent.    Also because communication devices such as ATM will need  high  speed, MCM will dominate the market. Even in an inexpensive  commercial product, if the device is used like a computer game  with a RISC processor and high speed graphics accelerator on  board, MCM will be necessary. For example, screen compression  expansion chips used for multimedia need 50M - 200 MHz,  10[.sup]6[/] - 10[.sup]7[/] transistors.  <H5>  Difficulty Of Producing Lower Cost Single Chip </H5>   Furthermore, when design rule reaches the 0.5 m level,  large scale circuits such as high end logic on board will not be  cost effective and the use of MCM will become more advantageous  in some areas. In order to clarify this relationship, take the  example of a system which consists of A, B, C, &amp; D chips of  some  generation (see figure 2). Simply making single chips by  employing the same generation technology becomes expensive. That  is to say, a single chip needs a certain chip area and system  scale.    After 0.5 m level, the relationship between cost and  chip  area will cause the parallel shift to an upward (rising)  direction. For example, in the era of future microprocessors in  0.35 m level, there will be four layers of wiring.  Presently,  LSI makers are studying low cost processing, but the process  needed to obtain high performance makes it increasingly  difficult to reduce the cost. In large scale chips, even if the  next generation minute processing is used, there are cases in  which a single chip will not yield a low cost.  <H5>  Realization Of Low Cost And Short Development Time </H5>   In order to respond to the MCM market, the characteristics  of  low cost and short development time which were not found in  previous MCM needed to be realized in addition to high speed,  large scale, and compactness. Here a general classification of  MCM technology is described: (1) Manufacturing technology such  as a baseboard; (2) Design and CAD technology; and (3) Testing  (table 1). Mainly the technology of manufacturing and testing  will influence cost, and technology of manufacturing and design  and CAD will influence the development time.       Table 1.

In addition to a low price baseboard, if the  same baseboard is used in various areas by customizing, low cost  will be realized for mass production. The manufacturing time is  shortened by already prepared baseboards that are regulated. In  design and CAD technology (2), a tool was developed jointly with  CAD makers to be used by system designers with no previous  experience in MCM development. By using this tool, system  designers can design MCM in a short period of time. In testing  (3), common socket and test equipment were semi-customized in  order to test a bare chip in which MCM on board will be placed.  Therefore testing cost was reduced.  <H5>  Two Types Prepared Using Ceramic Baseboard </H5>   In manufacturing technology (1), the reason ceramic  baseboard  is more advantageous in terms of cost than a printed circuit  board or thin film baseboard is because of remarkable price drop  in multi-layer ceramic baseboards. Ceramic is also suitable for  the high speed and high integration demanded by the market.    For a low cost product, ``TAM10C Series'' (figure 3) using  alumina (Al[.sup]2[/]0[.sub]3[/]) ceramic multi-layer  baseboard, and for high speed products over 100 M Hz, ``TAM10Z  Series'' (figure 4) combining ceramic and deposit of thin film  of Cu/Polyimide were developed. In reality, MCM-L using printed  circuit board is cheaper, but the wiring rule is difficult.  Also, MCM-D using thin film technology is high in performance  but it is expensive. The big gap in the difference in cost and  wiring density is quite extreme, and a feeling of Rtoo short for  a sash but too long for a beltS reflects the demand (table 2).       Table 2.

By doing  this, the experimental product was manufactured in about four  weeks which shortened the time needed for traditional products  by half. In MCM-D/C in which Cu/Polyimide thin film is  deposited, the ceramic part is standardized, and can be prepared  ahead of time. Because ceramic baking time is eliminated,  manufacturing time is greatly shortened.  <H5>  Prepare For Design Environment Following ASIC </H5>   In design and CAD technology (2), in order to effectively  promote MCM, a design environment which is easy to use and needs  less time was built. From input of design information to  analysis of heat and delay, total flows of design are integrated.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-44A>           Figure 3. MCM-C Using Ceramic Baseboard... </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-44B>           Figure 4. MCM-D/C Thin Film of Cu/Polydimide Is Deposited On Ceramic Baseboard... </FIG>    MCM design flow can analyze system design, baseboard design,  wiring, and verification. Following the pattern of ASIC, a  development support tool, ``MCM Design Kit'' was developed  jointly with Cadence Design Systems, Inc. in US, Mentor Graphics  Corporation, and CAD vendors. MCM is designed by using a wiring  tool which CAD vendors have, a transmission line analysis tool,  and a heat analysis tool. The design kit has a library which has  design rules and chip heat and delay information, functions to  allocate terminals automatically, and functions to estimate heat  and delay easily.    The future topic in design is to form a model of chip  function. The product this time interfaces with gate level, but  in the future if large scale interface is considered, a  functional model will be desirable. However, although the  functional model of main processor and peripheral chips has  started its sales quite recently, it will require a long time  and a great deal of labor to realize the goal. Already some  companies have produced a functional model, but the product is  quite expensive and it will take 2 to 3 years to penetrate the  market.  <H5>  Prepared Special Socket For Bare Chip </H5>   In testing (3), the special socket will be used for the  testing of the bare chip. The bare chip test will influence the  cost of MCM. Because if the production of MCM is idled due to  bad quality, then the production of other chips will be idled,  which propagates the production idling problems. Employing a  burn-in test using a special socket, will reduce idling time  caused by failure.    Considering the promotion of products, there is a limit for  one company to supply several kinds of chips, and we wish to  produce MCM which incorporates several chips on board supplied  by multiple LSI makers. To do this, multiple semiconductor  makerUs KGD (known good die) will be necessary. In the US, a few  companies such as Intel Corporation and Micro Technology  Incorporated have just started to supply these. Looking at the  chip, it appears more expensive than a sealed packaged chip, and  the problem of KGD is more severe. It will take two-three years  to gain wide recognition for the bare chip.    In module testing, different types of necessary sockets are  eliminated and because of semicustomization cost increases are  controlled. Designated test patterns will be necessary to check  chip failures from certain pins at assembly after MCM is made.  On the other hand, if a chip which has a boundary scan circuit  on board is used, the problem will be solved. The report on the  automatic tool which generates a boundary scan test pattern that  was standardized as IEEE 1149.1 at JTAG (Joint Test Action  Group) has already been announced.    In the case of placing chips which do not have a boundary  scan, the method of testing will be a future topic to study. In  reality, test patterns performed by users or machines verify  pass or fail tests. Furthermore, in order to interface to high  speed chips, the development of testers for high precision  multiple pin devices will be critical.</p>

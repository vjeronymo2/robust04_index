			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UK tries to defuse China's claim of secret HK deal THE release yesterday of British correspondence with China over arrangements for Hong Kong elections in 1995 is the latest twist in an increasingly bitter confrontation between London and Beijing. Mr Lu Ping, the Chinese official concerned with Hong Kong affairs, accused Governor Chris Patten on Friday of breaking an understanding between China and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. Lu's furious assault was China's response to Mr Patten's proposals to make the 1995 Legislative Council elections more democratic, only two years before Hong Kong comes under Chinese control. Beijing's accusations of bad faith over the future of Hong Kong were dangerous to Britain because they threatened to undermine popular support in Hong Kong for the robust and open approach of Mr Patten. That support is Mr Patten's biggest weapon in his confrontation with Beijing. China's communists, determined to hang on to power and maintain political stability, do not want to inherit 6m disgruntled people, upset at having recently acquired democratic rights reversed, as China is threatening to dowhen it assumes control. British officials say Lu, in less than cordial talks with Mr Patten last week in Beijing, suggested Britain publish the documents which, he said, revealed agreement over the composition of an election committee due to elect 10 seats to the Legislative Council in 1995. He is unlikely to have expected that Britain would rise to the challenge. The decision to publish them is clearly an attempt by London to maintain the diplomatic advantage created by Mr Patten's announcement of the proposals. The documents, all from January and February 1990, show Mr Hurd repeatedly pressing China to increase the number of directly elected seats to the Legislative Council and making little progress except for a Chinese proposal which, according to the Chinese, was a significant concession. Mr Hurd's recommendations are backed up to a large extent by his assessments of popular feeling in Hong Kong as to what would be acceptable. If the number of directly elected members in 1997 were 24, or 40 per cent of the total, Mr Hurd says, 'we would then be enabled to give active support to those provisions.' China rejected this, insisting that the number should be 20, but agreed to Mr Hurd's suggestion that the number directly elected in 1991 should be 18 instead of 15 suggested previously by the Chinese. When Mr Hurd repeated his position, Mr Qian Qichen, Chinese foreign minister, responded with a terse message regretting that Britain had 'failed to make any concession on the relevant specific proposals, at which I cannot but feel very much disappointed.' He rejected Mr Hurd's offer to send a senior official for further talks and coldly remarked: 'I believe the Foreign Secretary is well aware of the fact that the drafting of the Basic Law is entirely China's internal affair.' The Basic Law will provide Hong Kong's constitution after 1997. The election committee at the heart of the current dispute was, British officials say, a minor issue at the time by comparison with that of direct elections. Mr Patten now proposes that the committee should be elected and a widening of the franchise of some of the 'functional constituencies' which elect additional seats. He says this makes the election more democratic without contravening the Basic Law. Though the documents show a measure of agreement on the election committee, the exchange on this topic is inconclusive. They do not provide evidence of anything that could be called a 'secret deal'. British officials say the exchange has to be seen in the context of the unsuccessful attempt to agree on directly-elected seats and on the overall Basic Law. The Basic Law, when published, made no mention of the 'five principles' apparently agreed, and specifically excluded the Legislative Council of 1997  -which will be elected in 1995 - from its stipulations about the composition of an election committee which will not only appoint Legislative Council members but also the territory's chief executive. British officials have no explanation for this exclusion. But they say China has made it clear in subsequent statements that it did not believe that the composition of the 1995 election committee had been agreed. In September, Lu told visiting Legislative Council members in Beijing that China had not yet reached a decision on the composition. Britain hopes that publication of the exchanges will neutralise Chinese allegations of a secret deal and encourage Beijing to discuss Mr Patten's proposals more constructively. There is no sign yet that it will do so. A complete failure to discuss them would put Mr Patten, despite his bravado, in a difficult position.</p>

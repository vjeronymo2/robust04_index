			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> First, the Agency examined whether the test should include a minimum net worth requirement. Second, the Agency developed various financial tests and analyzed their performance in discriminating between bankrupt and viable firms. Finally, the Agency evaluated those tests that best discriminated between viable and bankrupt firms according to a ``least cost'' criterion, and selected a financial test. Each of these analytical steps is described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Minimum Net Worth Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In developing the subtitle C corporate financial test, the Agency determined that a minimum net worth requirement was an important element of the test. First, the Agency was concerned that, because of their magnitude, the costs of closure and post-closure care could themselves cause smaller firms to go bankrupt. In addition, the need for a minimum net worth requirement was supported by analysis. The Agency found significantly higher bankruptcy rates for firms with a net worth less than $10 million. For example, firms with less than $10 million in net worth failed four times more frequently than firms with greater than $10 million in net worth. Based on the above, the Agency decided to propose a minimum net worth requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To determine the threshold for this minimum net worth requirement, the Agency analyzed public and private costs associated with different thresholds. The Agency chose $10 million as the threshold because the analysis demonstrated that although a higher threshold would result in savings in public costs, those savings would not offset the additional costs to the regulated community of obtaining alternative financial assurance mechanisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Develop and Analyze Alternative Financial Tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Agency first conducted a search of financial literature and identified possible financial ratios typically used for bankruptcy prediction. In addition to financial ratios, the Agency selected a variety of other financial measures, such as multiples requirements for net worth and net working capital (i.e., one through six times the size of the financial obligation) and ``additive'' requirements, which required firms to have a certain level of net worth (in addition to the minimum net worth requirement of $10 million) based on the amount of costs they wished to cover with the test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency then evaluated the performance of these individual financial measures in discriminating between viable and bankrupt firms. Using samples of bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms, the Agency evaluated their ability to ``pass'' non-bankrupt firms capable of meeting their financial assurance obligations, and, at the same time, ``fail'' bankrupt firms that would enter bankruptcy without the means to meet those obligations. Each financial measure was evaluated using two performance measures: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Availability <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (A): Measured as the percentage of total financial assurance obligations facing non-bankrupt firms with over $10 million in net worth that can be covered using a particular financial measure or financial test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Misprediction <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (M): Measured as the percentage of total financial assurance obligations facing bankrupt firms that can be covered by bankrupt firms using the financial test. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Those individual financial measures that performed relatively well at differentiating between the two samples had a high differential between the availability (A) and misprediction (M) measures; i.e., they allow viable firms to cover a relatively large percentage of obligations and, at the same time, screen out a large share of obligations of bankrupt firms. Those measures that performed relatively poorly had about the same availability to viable firms and bankrupt firms; i.e., they allowed bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms to cover a similar percentage of obligations. In some cases, poorly-performing measures had a negative differential_they allowed bankrupt firms to cover a higher percentage of obligations than non-bankrupt firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency's analysis of ratio measures found that profitability ratios, which measure a firm's net income or cash flow in relation to firm size (e.g., cash flow/total liabilities) and leverage ratios, which measure a firm's debt in relation to firm size (i.e., total liabilities/net worth) were particularly good at discriminating between bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency then combined various profitability and leverage ratios, which had performed well at distinguishing between bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms, to form alternative financial tests. A variety of possible multiple and additive requirements for net worth were then added to each combination of financial ratios.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

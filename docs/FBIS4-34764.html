			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Armando Torres] </F>   [Text] Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, 21 Jun -- Monterrey's Vitro  Group is planning to make investments in Cuba and is thus  considering buying a Cuban glass-manufacturing company,  according to the company's director general, Ernesto Martens  Rebolledo.    The Vitro Group plans to invest $300 million in 1994 to  modernize and expand its plants' capacity. It is also willing  to invest in Mexico's telecommunications sector if there are  attractive projects, Martens Rebolledo added.    As for the sale of Cuban companies, Martens Rebolledo  pointed  out that the National Foreign Trade Bank [Bancomext] will offer  Mexican investors the factories' assets, which the Cuban  Government will use to pay some of its debt to Mexico. In that  sense, Vitro might sign a purchase agreement with Bancomext in  the short run and thus extend its presence in international  markets. Thus far, Monterrey businessmen Mauricio Fernandez,  Danny Tafich, and Javier Garcia Sepulveda have been heavily  investing in Cuba through the establishment of the International  Textile Corporation, which consists of 15 plants which employ  33,000 Cubans.    Meanwhile, Martens Rebolledo noted that Vitro's annual sales  amount to 10.9 billion new pesos, and its annual exports amount  to some $500 million. At the end of 1993, Vitro's total assets  were approximately 17.159 billion new pesos, and its total  liabilities reached 9.638 billion new pesos. Martens Rebolledo  emphasized that in the past few years, Vitro has made  investments in fixed assets amounting to approximately 1 billion  new pesos a year. In 1992, Vitro invested 1.106 billion, while  in 1993 it invested 802 million new pesos in this type of  investment.    Since it generates 38,538 jobs, the Vitro Group constitutes  a  key source of jobs at the national level. It is worth noting,  however, that in the past years the economic slowdown adversely  affected Vitro's operational results. This is reflected in its  annual sales, which grew by a measly 0.4 percent in 1993, while  its total assets decreased 1.8 percent in contrast with its  total liabilities, which increased 1.9 percent.    According to its latest annual reports sent to the Mexican  Stock Exchange, Vitro's staff was reduced 14 percent, while its  investment in fixed assets were reduced 27 percent. Both  reductions took place during the 1992-93 period.</p>

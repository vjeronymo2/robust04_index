			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 5 (XINHUA) -- ARATS and SEF today  published a joint news release listing five understandings on  Taiwan Straits matters, reached in their five days of talks here.    Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of the Association of  Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) on the mainland, and  Chiao Jen-ho, vice-chairman and secretary general of the  Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), signed the  release today after five days of discussions.    The five understandings listed by the news release were:    First, both sides agreed that sensitive political issues  should be avoided in a pragmatic manner in discussing routine  matters.    They discussed three routine issues, including the  repatriation of personnel who cross the Taiwan Straits in  violation of relevant regulations and related issues, and have  reached deep common understanding on them, the news release said.    However, they will step up efforts to solve some remaining  differences so as to reach a written agreement as soon as  possible, the release said.    They have agreed to hold their fourth talks on routine  matters in late March in Beijing and sign an agreement in  Taipei, if an agreement is reached. During the fourth talks,  they will discuss jointly fighting against maritime smuggling,  piracy and other criminal activities, the protection of  intellectual property rights on the two sides of the Taiwan  Straits, contacts and mutual aid between courts on both sides of  the straits, and some economic, scientific and technological  issues included in an agreement between ARATS President Wang  Daohan and SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu last year.    Second, the two organisations agreed on methods to  facilitate  entrance and exit of personnel across the Taiwan Straits, which  will be enforced in the form of an exchange of letters.    Third, both sides agreed to increase the variety of  duplicates of legal deeds to be sent to the other side of the  Taiwan Straits. Details will be discussed later.    Fourth, both sides agreed to provide mutual help to resolve  issues concerning inheritance.    Fifth, the two organisations agreed to promote mutual visits  between news media officials, journalists, youth, and scientific  and technological personnel.    They also said that they would thoroughly carry out various  agreements reached during the Wang-Koo talks last year, keep in  contact with each other and keep a smooth channel of talks to  create favorable conditions for the second Wang-Koo meeting.    The news release was drafted by two vice-secretary generals  appointed by ARATS and SEF last night. Tang Shubei and Chiao  Jen-ho signed it after a discussion this morning.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The wait still wages on whether or not to lift  sanctions imposed on Iraq following the Gulf war. The UN  Security Council imposed the sanctions in 1991 until the country  met all demands of Resolution 687. To date, Iraq has entered  into the last phase of its destruction program. If by initial  difficulties it has cooperated with the UN inspectors over its  nuclear arsenal site. The majority of the Security Council  members and nonmembers are in favor of lifting sanctions. These  countries are satisfied that Iraq had met all the conditions.  But the United States and Britain want to impose political  conditions before the sanctions were lifted. This is beyond what  was agreed to originally under Resolution 687. It is unfair to  impose new conditions. After all, the sanctions were imposed to  punish Iraq for invading Kuwait in August 1990. By now, the  Iraqis would have learned their lesson. They know very well  that having designs of future invasions would be met with tough  retaliatory military measures.    Therefore, those obstructing the lifting of sanctions are  not  being fair to Iraq. Questions are being raised over the  discrimination and policy selectivity with regards to Iraq's  vis-a-vis UN's policies on Bosnia, Somalia, and the Israeli  occupation of Palestine. So, is the Security Council fair in  continuing to impose the trade and arms embargo on Iraq? Also,  are the council's decisions dominated by the one or two  countries and not the majority?    By now, the sanctions will have served their purpose.  Continuing to punish Iraq will merely cause further hardship on  its people. Through the sanctions, the people of Iraq have been  facing an acute shortage of food and medicine. Although the  sanctions do not include food and medicine, the inability to  trade means the lack of financial resources. So, it does not  have enough money to buy the much required supplies. The  country is also lacking humanitarian aid. Thousands of people  will die if the sanctions are not lifted. Besides this, the  country plunged into an economic doom since the Gulf war for  which it finds difficulty to recover.    It is about time some of the permanent members realize that  the embargo is no longer justified. Only then will Iraq be able  to put back its economy on the road to recovery.    However, for Iraq, the lifting of the sanctions must not  mean  going back to old ways. Malaysia, along with the majority of  the UN members, did not condone its invasion of Kuwait. This is  more so since Iraq along with Kuwait and Malaysia are Muslim  countries and members of the Organization of Islamic Countries,  OIC. At the same time, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and certain Arab  countries say that Iraq is still a threat to region's security.    Three years after the Gulf war, Iraq still does not  recognize  the borders with Kuwait and refuses to free Kuwaitis it holds.  Iraq, therefore, needs to be more forthcoming in meeting the  demands of Resolution 687. It also needs to show sincere  peaceful gestures to its neighbors in the Gulf. This is because  Iraq's good ties with the OIC members will be crucial to ensure  its survival in world trade. Also, Arab countries do not want a  repeat of the invasion of Kuwait.</p>

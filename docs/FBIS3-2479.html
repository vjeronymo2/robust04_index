			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One  Network in Mandarin at 0605 GMT on 23 February broadcasts the  70-minute 7th of a 10-part series consisting of nine lectures,  and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV Lecture  Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming the  Economic System."    The 7th lecture, entitled "(Reform of the) Investment and  Loan Accommodation System," is presented by Guo Shuyan, vice  minister of the State Planning Commission.    Guo begins by explaining why it is necessary to reform the  investment and loan accommodation system. He says: Though it  should be pointed out that profound changes have taken place in  the system after 14 years of reform and opening up, the  requirement raised by the 14th national party congress to  establish a socialist market economy set an even higher demand  on us. Three conspicuous problems exist in the system at  present. They are:    (1) The scale of investment and loan accommodation has  expanded too rapidly. For instance, the scale of investment in  fixed assets in 1993 increased nearly 49 percent from that of  1992; state enterprises carried out nearly 78,000 technical  transformation projects costing a total investment amount of 450  billion yuan in 1993, up 51.8 percent from that of 1992. They  caused more inflationary pressure.    (2) The investment structure is irrational. Most funds were  committed to low-level construction projects which produced low  economic returns, to real estate development, and to development  zones.    (3) Investments produced low economic returns and resulted  in  tremendous waste.    Preliminary analysis shows the above problems were caused by  the following four reasons.    (1) An effective investment risks supervision and  restrictive  mechanism has yet to be established and the system of giving  equal treatment to enterprises and individuals regardless of  their performances has not been really abolished. This made  "some enterprises and localities blindly carry out new projects  to pursue unrealistic, excessively high growth rate regardless  of the availability of funds and materials." It may be said  that this is a fundamental reason leading to the current  expansion of our investment scale.    (2) As the authority for examining and approving investment  projects was delegated to localities, a system for appropriate  macroeconomic regulation and control of investment still has not  been established. As a result, it is hard to bring the total  investment scale under effective control.    (3) The market system serving investment and construction is  still imperfect; protectionism barriers exists in localities and  different departments.    (4) Formulation of laws and regulations cannot catch up with  the pace of economic development. As we are in the process of  shifting from a planned economy to a socialist market economy,  many old measures for management of investment are no longer  applicable, while new measures have yet to be drawn up. If the  above problems are to be solved once and for all, we must carry  out reform to establish an investment and loan accommodation  system suited to a socialist market economy.    Guo then discusses the seven main points of reform of the  investment and loan accommodation system. They are:    (1) Reform the methods of investment and loan accommodation  system for different investment projects. Guo generally divides  investment projects into the following three categories:  competitive projects which include mainly those investment  projects that produce higher returns and are more responsive to  market regulation and more competitive on the market, such as  textile mills, processing industries, and so forth; basic  industries and infrastructure projects which require longer  construction period and bigger investments but produce lower  economic returns than competitive projects; and public welfare  projects which include scientific and technological,  educational, cultural, public health, sports, and environmental  protection projects, office buildings for government and mass  organizations, and national defense facilities. Guo discusses  appropriate management systems for investment and loan  accommodations for the above three categories of projects. He  says the establishment of these three categories constitutes a  main aspect of current reform and is suited to the need of  establishing a socialist market economy. He stresses: Current  reform of the investment and loan accommodation system has  decided that enterprises will gradually replace the governments  as the major investors in the future.    (2) Improve a restrictive mechanism for investment risks by  accelerating the implementation of a legal person responsibility  system among enterprises. Construction projects will not be  approved until after the legal persons mainly responsible for  them are organized. The implementation of a legal person  responsibility system "converges with the PRC Company Law, which  was recently promulgated." "It will expedite enterprises'  transformation of operating mechanisms and accelerate the  establishment of a modern enterprise system."    (3) Establish and improve a macroeconomic regulation and  control system for investments. The central government will be  responsible for deciding on the scale of total investment in  fixed assets, the total amount of shares issued nationwide, and  so forth; the targets, laws, and regulations governing  macroeconomic regulation and control of investments nationwide  shall be decided by the State Council. The provincial people's  governments will be responsible for regulation and control of  the structure and total amount of investments in their  respective regions, for ensuring the smooth progress of key  state projects in their respective regions, and for creating a  favorable investment environment. Guo also discusses measures  for regulating and controlling total investment amount and for  readjusting investment structure through price and taxation  reforms. In this connection, efforts will be made to improve a  system for examining and approving investment projects and to  establish a system for the feedback of investment information.    (4) The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee decided to establish a national development bank to  raise and guide funds from society to ensure key state projects  and to facilitate loans for basic industries and infrastructure  projects. "It will be conducive to readjusting our overall  investment structure, to increasing investment returns, and to  promoting rapid and healthy national economic development."    (5) Concentrate financial and material resources on key  construction projects to ensure their smooth progress. Guo says  successfully carrying out the job will directly expedite rapid  national economic development.    (6) Expedite development of a system that serves the  investment market.    (7) Improve the formulation of relevant laws and  regulations.    The lecture concludes at 0715 GMT.</p>

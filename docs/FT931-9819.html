			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Steadier day as technology issues bought Wall Street ALTHOUGH shares in blue chip industrial companies traded in a narrow range yesterday, secondary stocks posted gains amid selective buying of technology issues, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.16 at 3,412.42, well above its low for the day of 3,394.32. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended a slight 0.90 up at 446.23, while the American SE composite was 1.10 firmer at 416.10 and the Nasdaq composite 2.81 higher at 695.02. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 248m shares. After Tuesday's losses, the markets settled down as investors awaited the next big move. There was no lead from the economy, and the failure of the Treasury market to hang on to its early gains also left equities rudderless. Dealers and investors, however, were pleased that trading volume has been relatively light during the recent sell-off - an indication that the downward move in prices was a consolidatory move, and not a major shift in sentiment. Trading in Eastman Kodak was delayed due to an early order imbalance on the sell side. When business finally opened, the stock tumbled Dollars 3 to Dollars 50 1/2 on heavy selling, before rallying to end with a net loss of Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 52 after volume of 3.7m shares. The market was reacting to a downgrade from Mr Eugene Glazer, the sector analyst at broking house Dean Witter Reynolds. Mr Glazer said he had lowered his rating on Kodak from 'buy' to 'neutral' because he believed that the stock had become overpriced following its recent gains, and that investor expectations may have been driven too high. Ford eased early on, but rallied to end Dollars  7/8 higher at Dollars 49 3/4 on news of a big fourth quarter and full year loss that was roughly in line with market expectations. The other members of the Big Three were firmer, with Chrysler up Dollars 1 at Dollars 40 1/4 and General Motors Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 39 1/4 . The latter was helped by news that the television network NBC had publicly apologised for rigging tests that purported to show a GM truck bursting into flame after a collision. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 51 3/4 and Travelers eased Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 28 1/8 after the two composite insurers unveiled big fourth quarter losses incurred in the wake of a variety of special charges. On the Nasdaq market, a selection of technology stocks were strong, with Intel Dollars 4 ahead at Dollars 114 3/4 in volume of 4.6m shares and Microsoft Dollars 1 5/8 firmer at Dollars 85 1/2 , but Apple fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 55 3/4 . Canada TORONTO stock prices extended their February rally in continued heavy trading, closing solidly higher with the help of strong gold and real estate shares. The TSE 300 index advanced 28.9 to 3,443.0 and rises led falls by 397 to 276 after volume of 60.7m shares. Thirteen of 14 stock groups gained ground, led by the golds sector, up 4.3 per cent, as the spot price for gold in New York added USDollars 3 at USDollars 332.50 an ounce.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: 2.9 QUAKE CAN'T JOLT CALTECH INTO ACTION  </P> <P> Scientists don't know exactly which fault was responsible for this week's 2.9  earthquake, a Caltech spokesman said Friday.  </P> <P> That's because the temblor was too puny to investigate.  </P> <P> "They would have to actually go out and break ground" to determine if the  temblor was along the Newport-Inglewood Fault, the county's largest, said  Robert Finn.  </P> <P> Caltech generally does not investigate a quake unless it measures at least  magnitude 4 or 5, he said.  </P> <P> The temblor was centered near the junction of the Costa Mesa and San Diego  freeways, where the cities of Irvine, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa converge.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Letter from Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Britain </F> Should Not Attempt To Extend Its Colonial Rule"]    [Text] Dear Brother:    The Sino-British talks on the 1994/1995 election issue have  become totally bankrupt because of the British side's deliberate  sabotage. This was an outcome the Chinese side did not wish to  see. However, just like a popular saying goes: "The rain must  fall from the sky, and one's own mother must remarry." There  are things in the world that are independent of people's good  wishes, and cannot be changed.    The many tricks the British side has played since China set  out the demand to restore its sovereignty over Hong Kong are  still fresh in people's memories! In the talks between the  Chinese and British Governments on settling the Hong Kong issue,  the British side continuously set out all sorts of ideas that  ran counter to its promise, and the most famous ones were  "exchanging sovereignty for the right to rule," and the demand  on the Chinese side to refrain from stationing the PLA in Hong  Kong, and so forth. All this naturally met solemn rejection  from China. The talks lasted 22 rounds and two years, and  eventually the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed.    China hoped that the British side would abide by the  Sino-British Joint Declaration like its Chinese counterpart  during the transition period, but now it seems that the true  nature of the colonialists will never change. Whenever there  are some changes in the world situation, they will do everything  they can to essentially prolong their rule in Hong Kong. Hong  Kong Governor Chris Patten has dished up his "constitutional  reform package" under the pretext that it would give "democracy"  to Hong Kong residents. However, he forget that the very title  and power of Hong Kong governor is none other than a symbol of  colonialism. Would it not be the greatest joke on earth for a  Hong Kong governor to give democracy to people of the colony?!  Only if he removes himself from office first. No wonder some  public opinion in Hong Kong hit the nail on the head by saying:  There is no democracy to speak of in a colony. Should there be  democracy, it would not be a colony.    Therefore, it is not difficult to explain why Chris Patten  was in a hurry to change the existing system and pursue his  so-called "constitutional reform" as soon as he arrived in Hong  Kong. His objective was obvious enough, namely, to make  arrangements for those people who could act on the order of  their British masters in the three-tier framework. The funnier  thing was that this Hong Kong governor should have forced such a  body on the SAR [Special Administration Region] Government after  1997. Again, he forgot that this body of his, namely, the  Legislative Council, the Executive Council, and the two  municipal councils, are all components in the constitutional  framework of the British Hong Kong Authorities. Naturally, they  must be disbanded with the termination of British rights in  administration and control over Hong Kong on 30 June 1997. That  will be the inevitable outcome of China restoring its  sovereignty over Hong Kong and Britain terminating its rule over  Hong Kong. By then, Hong Kong's three-tier framework will be  reorganized according to the stipulation in the Basic Law and  the National People's Congress decision. That is the Chinese  Government's solemn position, and it is not at all vague!    Some British politicians like Chris Patten have continued  their colonialist daydreaming. Regretfully, it is the end of  the 20th century, not the 19th Century, and the sun of "Great  Britain" has long set. The Chinese Government is no longer the  government of the late Qing Dynasty. China has joined the ranks  of world powers. It is precisely to redress national shame and  to end the ugliest phenomena of colonial rule in modern history  that China recovers Hong Kong. The world's peace-loving people  support the Chinese Government's position. It is in vain for  Chris Patten and his ilk to attempt to maintain their rule on  the last colony no matter what tricks they play.    Deng Xiaoping has longed foreseen how the British Hong Kong  Government would act, and set out five issues that "the Chinese  side does not hope to see surface" during the transition period,  of which the fourth point was that it was hoped that the British  Hong Kong Government would refrain from organizing a body on its  own and force it on the Hong Kong SAR Government in the future.  We should like to advise the British Hong Kong Government to  return to the track of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the  Basic Law, the Sino-British understanding and agreement on the  Hong Kong issue, and stop doing foolish things. The only way  out is to cooperate in sincerity to ensure Hong Kong's  prosperity, stability, and steady transition.    In actual fact, the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong  residents do not agree to the ways of British politicians  including Chris Patten. Even some figures with vision in  British political circles and British entrepreneurs and  businessmen have criticized those politicians, saying that those  politicians were not thinking of Hong Kong's prosperity and  stability, but of dusting their political cloaks with gold, and  dressing themselves as "heroes." They do not know that such  "heroes" are actually laughingstocks.    You also know that it was the British side who first set  out the "through train" issue. However, because the British  side has set up hurdles one after another and it tabled part of  the "constitutional reform package" in the Hong Kong Legislative  Council when no Sino-British agreement had been reached, it  thoroughly soured the talks. That being the case, the  convergence of the constitutional system will be impossible, and  there will be no "through train" for the three-tier framework.  The stable transition of Hong Kong Government will be affected  and the responsibility totally rests with the British side.    Britain has ruled Hong Kong for some 150 years, and seized  tremendous wealth from the island. Thus Hong Kong is where the  great interest of Britain lies. That being the case, some  British politicians are becoming somewhat muddleheaded, and  believe that the merits of Hong Kong's prosperity today should  go to them, which really is taking the merits that belong to  Heaven as their own. Hong Kong's prosperity relies on the  diligence and hard work of Hong Kong residents through all the  generations, and the all-out support of all the Chinese people  in the hinterland, especially in the dozen or so years since  reform and opening up began. The economies of the two places  are mutually beneficial, and are so close that they cannot be  separated. China has already promised that it will continue to  maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. China has always  been good to its word! If the British side is able to  cooperate, that is fine, and we can ensure that its interests in  Hong Kong will remain intact. Should it be otherwise, China  will have confidence and ability, too, to maintain Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability.    China will not change its mind in recovering its sovereignty  over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. Neither will China change its  mind in implementing the Basic Law, "one country, two system,"  and "Hong Kong residents ruling Hong Kong" after that date. By  then, all things incompatible with the Basic Law will have to be  overthrown, and British colonialism will disappear from Hong  Kong. This is a historical inevitability!

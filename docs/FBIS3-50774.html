			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Diosdado Maso] </F>   [Text] I have just returned from San Rafael Boulevard in  Havana. I went there because a comrade who was in Angola with  me told me that the boulevard in Havana was worse than the  Angolan alleyways (candongas). I felt insulted. I had an  exchange of words with him, harsh words, but I do have to admit  that he was right.    At the boulevard in Havana, I found a mixture of the legal  and the irritably illegal. On the boulevard there are dozens of  persons who have been authorized and have permits, as  established in Decree No. 141 that allows self-employment, to  sell the products they make with their own two hands. But the  people who visit the boulevard are attacked, to use a word, by a  dirty band of peddlers, unscrupulous people who have nothing to  do with the measure adopted by the Revolution. What is worse,  they seem to be acting without a worry of punishment in their  minds and filling their pockets with illegally earned money. No  one seems to want to stop these people.    Decree No. 141 that allows self-employment was discussed at  length during the last session of the National Assembly of the  People's Government. The discussions made it clear that this  measure adopted by the Revolution needs to be controlled and  supervised. The absence of control and supervision lets  unscrupulous people, enemies of honest work, to mix with those  authorized by Decree No. 141 to peddle their goods. The San  Rafael Boulevard in Havana is possibly the worst example for the  country.    I will repeat that there are dozens of people on the  boulevard who have permits to sell the products they make. But  for every one of these people, there are five who, without  permits, sell bread and cheese or ham, hot pizza, and candy,  which is not homemade and which they sell for 20 pesos. This  kind of candy is sold at stores and their brand, shape, and size  of the candy makes us believe that they were all taken out of  the same container or box. They, of course, are selling this at  an astronomical price. If you want to buy a pair of pants you  are charged 1,500 pesos. A chocolate bar costs you 20 pesos,  and so forth.    There is something else, something that make a real  revolutionary stop and think. These people are old enough to  work or young enough to be in school. I can truly tell you that  my visit to the San Rafael Boulevard was an eye opener. There  are some there who are authorized to sell on the boulevard, but  who are also violating the law. Why? Well, their permit says  that they are authorized to sell ceramics, but they are also  selling plastic, aluminum and other products. It is not  possible for one person to make all those articles. They have  their stands there and nothing happens.    Now, regarding food, except for the peanut candy and the  paper cones filled with 10 peanuts being sold at two pesos, the  rest of the so-called fast foods established in Decree 141 are  not being respected. Furthermore, if you are to look over  Havana, you will see that many people are violating Decree 141.  If you visit the diplomatic store in Miramar, you will see that  right outside the fence the people are selling the products they  bought earlier inside. The taxis are charging whatever they  want and are also accepting dollars. We have been told in the  past that we should not compare between what is happening in  Havana and other areas of the country; however, I believe that  it would be worthwhile to see if the decree is being respected  in other provinces. Holguin comes to mind. I believe this  would be the best comparison.    During the last ANPP session, it was agreed to appoint a  group of inspectors to ensure that Decree 141 was being  respected. I believe this will have to be done as soon as  possible. It is very important that this be done. The people  agree with self-employment but they are upset when we do not do  something to perfect the law. For example, the people cannot  understand how come a policeman enforces the law sometimes, and  overlooks problems at other times. While on the boulevard I  talked to a policeman. He told me that he felt that what was  happening at the boulevard was wrong but that he worked for  Havana Vieja Municipality and that in his municipality the  people could not do what was being done on San Rafael Boulevard.  When I asked him who was responsible, he told me that Zapata  and Dragones Unit was responsible. But I found no policeman  from the Zapata and Dragones Unit there.    I also believe the people's councils could do something  about  this. I repeat, the people approve of the self-employment  measure because it contributes to solving some of our current  problems; however, they want it to be a good measure. Our own  Commander in Chief Fidel Castro said it at the ANPP session. It  is a good and useful measure. Self-employment solves a problem  today and will continue to solve problems in the future. I do  believe it is worthwhile that every municipality or  administrative council, in this case, the Havana Municipality,  act immediately to solve this problem.</p>

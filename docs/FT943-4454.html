			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japan Telecom drop depresses confidence A plunge in Japan Telecom shares depressed confidence, and the Nikkei 225 average lost 1.8 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index ended 370.18 down at the day's low of 20,023.80. It opened at the session's best of 20,364.47 and slid as the fall in JT prompted selling of other telecommunications stocks. Buying by public pension and insurance funds supported the index above the 20,000 level, but traders expected a further decline in JT to weigh on prices this week. Volume rose from 222m to 315m shares. The Topix index of all first section issues fell 27.09, or 1.7 per cent, to 1,586.06, closing below 1,600 for the first time since May. The Nikkei 300 retreated 4.72 to 289.15. Losers outnumbered gainers by 1,007 to 59, with 116 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was off 0.57 at 1,291.99. Investors were also refraining from trading ahead of the futures and options settlements on Friday, while worries over US-Japan framework talks on trade and its effects on the currency market also weighed on confidence. On the second section, JT dropped Y220,000, or 4.7 per cent, to Y4.43m. Traders said the stock, now 5.7 per cent lower than its public offer price, was considered too expensive. Telecommunications linked shares, bought by dealers and individuals ahead of the JT listing, were dragged down. DDI dipped Y45,000 to Y903,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y10,000 to Y883,000. East Japan Railway, a privatised stock and a shareholder of JT, receded Y8,000 to Y505,000 on foreign selling. Arbitrage unwinding linked to the Topix index depressed banks, which are heavily weighted in the average. Sumitomo Bank declined Y50 to Y1,840 and Mitsubishi Bank Y60 to Y2,440. Steels lost ground in busy trading. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, slipped Y5 to Y367. High-technology issues were lower on profit-taking. Sony lost Y100 at Y5,850 and NEC Y10 at Y1,200. Automakers also declined, with Nissan Motor closing Y23 down at Y739. In Osaka, the OSE average weakened 335.67 to 22,299.62 in volume of 85.7m shares. Roundup Company news moved shares, and markets, around the Pacific Rim. HONG KONG noted active switching from expensive blue chips to second liners, particularly China-owned stocks, for the second day in a row, but continued fund buying still took the Hang Seng index up 129.90, or 1.3 per cent, to 10,165.87, in turnover more than doubled at HKDollars 7.7bn. The H share index soared 51 points, or 3.6 per cent, to 1,450.49. Meanwhile, the China-backed vitamin C maker China Pharmaceutical rose 11 cents, or 10.7 per cent, to a year's high of HKDollars 1.135 in late trade as analysts said rotational buying of China-linked laggards had boosted demand for the stock. TAIPEI was lifted by last minute, heavy buying in financials which took the weighted index up 65.46 to 6,895.93, as turnover increased from TDollars 57bn to TDollars 77.8bn. Speculative buying focused on the Big Three banks before their shareholders' meetings scheduled for October, Hua Nan soaring by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 205. KARACHI saw buying of cement stocks by overseas investors on the new account day, and the KSE 100 index advanced 10.35 to 2,186.18. COLOMBO closed higher for the fourth day in a row and, in spite of profit-taking, the all-share index moved ahead 15.61 to 1,130.36. MANILA tumbled at the close as Petron, the oil refiner making its debut on the Philipine Stock Exchange, drew investors away from declining blue chips. The composite index shed 46.16 to 3,040.32. Petron hit a high of 22.75 pesos before finishing at 21.25 pesos, 136 per cent above its offer price of 9 pesos a share. Because of the Petron euphoria the index heavyweight PLDT slid by 4 per cent to 1,655 pesos. KUALA LUMPUR absorbed a sharp fall in its big utility Telekom Malaysia as the KLSE index reversed an early gain to finish 9.09 down at 1,163.15, after a high of 1,181.30. Telekom fell 80 cents to MDollars 21.60 while Tenaga dropped 30 cents to MDollars 14.40. SHANGHAI and Shenzhen's A shares fell back after their recent rocket-powered climb, with respective falls of 78.94, or 7.6 per cent, to 962.68 and 16.94, or 7.3 per cent, to 214.33; but the B shares indices rose by 0.9 and 2.3 per cent respectively.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] The Arab League Council's unanimous support for  Sudan's stand against foreign plots aimed at separating the  south and fragmenting the country's territorial integrity  reflects the spirit of solidarity, fraternity, and unity which  ought to prevail in the Arab nation. This spirit saw in these  threats to an Afro-Arab country not only a danger to this  state's security and territorial integrity, but also a danger to  the security, future, and stability of the Arab region as a  whole. The decision, adopted during the 101st session which  just met in Cairo, expressed great concern about the foreign  plots aimed at separating the south and the support for the  secessionist rebels, as well as the open incitement of the  rebels to demand self-determination as a pretext to divide a  sovereign state. The Arab states' concern arises from a  recognition of the danger of breaking up a state which is a  member of the Arab League, not only for the effect such  secession would have on the state concerned, but also for the  encouragement this gives other separatist movements. This would  fragment Arab unity and provide room for foreign interference in  the internal affairs of other states. [passage omitted]    The current obstacles to the march of peace in Sudan will  not  affect the determination of its sons and will not thwart their  efforts. Indeed, these obstacles will add strength to their  strength, through the unanimity of all Arab states to work to  preserve the territorial integrity of Sudan and to confront any  threat to it. All this was confirmed by the speeches of the  foreign ministers of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Egypt, Syria,  Yemen, Jordan, Morocco, and Iraq at the Arab League session.  They all stressed that Sudan's territorial integrity and  security were that of the entire Arab nation and any threat to  this integrity and security was a threat to all Arab states.  [passage omitted]    As Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih has confirmed,  the government and people of Sudan are working with  determination and sincerity to find a peaceful solution to the  southern problem based on just and comprehensive acceptable to  all parties and have responded to all the initiatives of  brothers and friends. These initiatives, however, will not bear  fruit unless there is an end to the interference by some states  and circles in Sudan's internal affairs, as well as their  plotting to separate the south. Sudan is well able to resist  these plots, supported as it is by the solidarity of the Arab  states and other brothers and friends. Success comes from God.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Germany's giant driven off course: A look at the impact of recession at Daimler-Benz, the country's flagship group For decades the three-cornered star on the bonnet of every Mercedes-Benz car has symbolised the success of Germany's postwar economy. More recently, the star has come to symbolise something different: the difficulties experienced by German manufacturing industry in the country's deepest recession since 1945. The Daimler-Benz group, of which the Mercedes-Benz car and commercial vehicle operations are the core, is suffering badly in the current downturn. On Friday the group disclosed losses of DM949m (Pounds 380m) in the first six months of 1993, a DM1.9bn swing into the red. The figures were calculated for the first time under the much more revealing US accounting rules ahead of Daimler-Benz's listing, next month, on the New York Stock Exchange. Yet even this reversal does not represent the low-point for Germany's flagship industrial group: that is yet to come. Mr Gerhard Liener, finance director, warned that losses would be 'considerably worse' after the third quarter. The deficit reflects the problems afflicting German manufacturing industry as a whole: collapsing demand in its main markets compounded by the impact of a strong D-Mark on exports and high domestic manufacturing costs. After a slow initial recognition of the intensity of the downturn, Daimler-Benz has responded to the crisis with increasingly far-reaching measures. These include: Job cuts. On Friday Mr Edzard Reuter, Daimler-Benz's chief executive, announced plans to cut a total of 43,900 jobs this year and next, taking the total number of jobs shed in 1992-94 to 60,000. A fifth of the group's domestic workforce will disappear by 1995. The group aims to achieve cost savings of DM8bn between 1992 and 1997. An unprecedented willingness to manufacture at low-cost centres outside Germany. 'There is no room for protected species and taboos if production locations in Germany are to remain competitive,' said Mr Reuter. Daimler-Benz is expanding its manufacturing in the US, Mexico and east and south-east Asia. A transformation of product strategy at Mercedes-Benz aimed at taking one of the world's top luxury carmakers into new sectors of the international automobile market. By the late-1990s Mercedes-Benz will have added small cars, four-wheel drive sports/utility and multi-purpose vehicles to its traditional range of luxury cars. A new approach to capital markets. The most obvious reflection of this is Daimler-Benz's decision to seek a full New York listing. As the first and only German company to be listed on the NYSE, Daimler-Benz will enjoy direct access to the world's largest equity market. Collectively, these measures amount to a corporate revolution, testimony to how the depth of the recession has jolted complacent German management into action. In sectors throughout Germany, companies are in the throes of restructuring and rationalisation. But is this enough? Mr Reuter says he is confident about Daimler-Benz's future in the medium term; once the world economy revives, he says, Daimler-Benz will be lean and poised to generate suitable profits for a group with a turnover of nearly DM100bn. The problem is that Mr Reuter has always pointed to the medium-term when talking about profitability: but Daimler-Benz's problem is making profits today rather than always tomorrow. The process of turning Daimler-Benz into a leaner machine is under way. The car business, for instance, is undergoing a cultural upheaval - a shift into the small car market. The centrepiece of the Mercedes-Benz stand at the Frankfurt motor show over the past two weeks has been a concept small car. At 3.35m in length it is shorter than a Ford Fiesta or a Renault Clio, and a far cry from Mercedes-Benz's two-tonne S-Class luxury car launched two years ago. Mr Helmut Werner, the new chief executive at Mercedes-Benz, insists a small car will be in production by '1997 at the latest. The S-Class was our premium profit producer, but this has changed and we must act accordingly. Our customers are on the move into segments they have not been in before. They are also buying small cars. We have to be sure we follow our customers.' Mercedes-Benz's plan to enter the small car market is being accompanied by the development of other 'lifestyle' vehicles, such as the MPV or 'people carrier', to challenge the likes of the Renault Espace, and a sports/utility vehicle to rival the Land Rover Discovery. The MPV, due for launch in 1995, will be built in Spain. At the end of this month Mercedes-Benz will announce the US location of its new plant to build the four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicle. At the same time, Mercedes-Benz is looking for a site in Europe to build its planned small-car plant with a production capacity of 200,000 vehicles a year; the search has narrowed down to the UK, the Czech Republic, France and Germany itself. The company is also forming alliances to break into fresh markets. In South Korea, for instance, it has reached a co-operation deal with Ssangyong Motor, enabling the South Korean vehicle maker to begin car production in Korea based on Mercedes-Benz technology. However, the brave new world is not going to be won without pain. Mr Werner accepts that Mercedes-Benz still lags way behind its rivals in costs and productivity. Fixed costs are 'still appreciably too high', layers of management are being removed and a 'rigorous pruning' of the white collar central staff is under way. Some 13,000 jobs were cut last year in Germany. In the 12 months to June the Mercedes-Benz workforce was cut from 233,000 to 215,000. About 27,000 jobs are being cut this year and next. Mercedes-Benz's change of strategic direction - from luxury executive cars to downmarket vehicles - is brave, but is by no means assured of success. Similar doubts clouded Daimler-Benz's move four years ago into the aerospace business. At the time critics warned that its new aerospace subsidiary, Deutsche Aerospace (DASA), would be a financial drain and divert management attention away from the group's traditional motor vehicle operations. But supporters of the diversification argued that the move was the best way of restructuring the faltering domestic aerospace industry and, under the Daimler-Benz umbrella, re-positioning Germany at the top of the world aerospace league. However, the ambitious diversification, which has seen Daimler-Benz absorb disparate components of the German aerospace industry, launch several international partnerships and acquire control of the Dutch Fokker aircraft group, has been undermined by a slump in civil aviation, defence cuts and the slowdown in the domestic economy. But Mr Reuter remains convinced the strategy will pay off in the longer term: the aerospace diversification has already expanded the group's industrial base and helped instil a more aggressive US-type management style in other parts of the group. Under the leadership of Mr Jurgen Schrempp, who is tipped to succeed Mr Reuter when he retires next year, DASA has led the way among the Daimler-Benz subsidiaries in cutting costs. Last year, Mr Schrempp slashed two layers of senior management and announced a package of job cuts totalling 7,500 over a three-year period to 1995. This summer, having already put some 24,000 workers on short time, DASA said it would cut a further 2,800 jobs linked to its activities on the European Airbus programme. Mr Reuter says the restructuring at DASA is now 'mainly completed' and that it is in an 'outstanding strategic situation'. Although DASA is expected to lose money again this year and next after running up losses of DM341m in 1992, Mr Schrempp insists DASA will start making a contribution to group profits by 1995. That will provide some relief to a group whose misfortunes mirror those of the German economy as a whole, and which show few signs of easing. The Mercedes-Benz star may take some time to shine again.  ------------------------------------------------ DAIMLER-BENZ: GERMANY'S LACK-LUSTRE STAR  ------------------------------------------------ MERCEDES-BENZ  ------------------------------------------------ DM millions                June 92        June 93  ------------------------------------------------ Sales                       34,629         29,075 Employees                  233,086        215,315 Passenger cars Sales                       20,972         17,232 Production                 284,466        209,351 Employees                  101,753         93,336 Commercial vehicles Sales                       13,657         11,843 Production                 150,448        116,462 Employees                   94,670         86,862  ------------------------------------------------ DEUTSCHE AEROSPACE  ------------------------------------------------ DM millions               June 92*        June 93  ------------------------------------------------ Sales                        7,039          6,307 Orders received              6,412          6,330 Employees                   83,564         78,522  ------------------------------------------------ * Adjusted to take account of significant changes in consolidation  ------------------------------------------------ DAIMLER-BENZ GROUP  ------------------------------------------------ DM millions                June 92        June 93  ------------------------------------------------ Sales                     48,092**         41,638 EC                          31,857         25,197 Germany                     21,007         16,168 EC excluding Germany        10,850          9,029 US                           6,398          6,903 Other markets                9,837          9,538 Employees                389,370**        365,027 Germany                    315,581        293,861 Foreign                     73,789         71,166 Results after tax            1,020            168  ------------------------------------------------ ** For comparability, adjusted to take account of siginificant changes in consolidation at AEG and DASA  ------------------------------------------------ Source: Daimler-Benz  ------------------------------------------------</p>

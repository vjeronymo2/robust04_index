			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Mackler] </F>   [Text] Brussels, Feb 7 (AFP) -- The European Community  sought Monday [7 February] to turn up the heat on Bosnia's Serbs  with the threat of NATO airstrikes looming larger after the  bloody weekend mortar attack in Sarajevo.    The shelling Saturday that killed 68 people and wounded some  200 in Sarajevo's crowded market, the single worst incident of  the conflict, topped the agenda for a two-day meeting of EC  foreign ministers.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe urged giving the Serbs  an  ultimatum to pull back their heavy guns and lift the siege of  the Moslem-dominated capital or face the wrath of NATO warplanes.    He told his colleagues here that the 22-month-old war in the  former Yugoslav republic was "a test of our honour and capacity  for action, a test of the European Union itself."    Britain, which had been reluctant to back air operations  around Sarajevo, seemed more disposed after three rounds of  telephone talks Sunday between Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd  and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.    "The case is very strong for airstrikes as long as it  produces more good than harm," Hurd said. Other countries were  more cautious, and stressed the need to keep the peace  negotiations alive.    UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has asked NATO to  confirm its authorization of the use of its warplanes for  airstrikes on artillery positions around the Serb-besieged city.    North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ambassadors were meeting  Monday and Dutch officials spoke of an emergency ministerial  session of the 16-member alliance, possibly Tuesday.    Diplomats here said the EC ministers would do little more  than issue a statement which might refer to Juppe's proposals,  and then wait for the U.S.-dominated NATO to decide its action.    The market massacre aroused indignation to a pitch  unprecedented in the Bosnian conflict which has left more than  200,000 people dead and the West's credibility in tatters after  a string of empty threats.    NATO has offered its air power to break the strangulation of  the capital and other Moslem areas, to protect UN troops on the  ground and to reopen Tuzla airport to relief flights. But it  has yet to receive the green light from Boutros-Ghali.    The Serbs deny responsibility for Saturday's mortar attack  and UN experts say it is impossible to determine from where the  shell came. But a British spokesman said the carnage had  "increased the collective willingness to consider military  action around Sarajevo."    Hurd told reporters that any airstrikes must take in account  the humanitarian operations and need to safeguard UN forces from  reprisals. They must also advance peace prospects, he said.    "That is not to rule out the use of air power...in principle  we are willing to use it," the chief British diplomat said.    Italy and Belgium strongly backed the French call for action  if the Serbs do not withdraw their big guns more than 30  kilometeres (19 miles) from the city and put them under UN  control.    "I believe this time our dignity and credibility are at  stake," said Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. "I am  convinced that this time we are not in a position to step back."    Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino called for use of all  political and military means to avert looming spring offensives  in Bosnia. "Without the use of force it would be impossible to  resolve differences between Serbs and Moslems," he said.    But other countries such as Spain, Denmark, Portugual and  Greece were more cautious on the possibility on using military  force in the Bosnian conflict.    "The soution will be a negotiated solution, a non-military  solution, so that a durable peace can be achieved," Spanish  Foreign Minister Javier Solana said.    U.S. President Bill Clinton said Sunday that airstrikes  would  have to wait until U.S. allies reached a consensus. He also put  the accent on achieving a negotiated peace settlement.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UN orders Croats to pull back: Two French peacekeepers killed, Yugoslav army on alert THE United Nations Security Council early today demanded the withdrawal of Croatian troops which have conducted a four-day offensive across peace-keeping lines into Serb-held territory. The council strongly condemned Croatian attacks against the UN Protection Force and called for the return of heavy weapons which the defending Serbs have taken from UN bases. Yesterday the Yugoslav army, which is dominated by Serbs, placed its forces on a higher state of combat readiness because of the Croatian advance near the Adriatic port of Zadar. This is aimed at capturing territory enabling the Croats to rebuild the Maslenica bridge linking the north and south Croatian coastlines. In advance of the Security Council statement, Croatia said it sought a new ceasefire line 20km south-east of the previous one. This would be within the UN protected area in Krajina, the disputed Serb enclave. The Croatian demand, spelled out by Admiral Sveto Letica, a Croatian commander liaising with the UN Protection Force, is likely to exacerbate tensions in Krajina. Two French UN peacekeepers were killed yesterday in crossfire in Karin Placa, near Zadar, and Croatia said its forces had overrun Zemunik airport, a strategic base. At the same time, fighting intensified between Serbs and Moslem forces in eastern Bosnia, along its border with Serbia. The Bosnian peace conference in Geneva continued to be overshadowed by the fighting between Serbs and Croats and made no progress towards agreement on a map of the provincial boundaries of the future state of Bosnia-Hercegovina. In Belgrade, a statement issued by the Supreme Defence Council, chaired by president Dobrica Cosic of Yugoslavia which comprises Serbia and Montenegro, said 'the latest Croatian and Moslem offensives have worsened the security situation in the region and threatened the Geneva negotiations and the UN peace plan', Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug reported. Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister, said Moscow might press for international sanctions against Zagreb if the Croatian attacks persisted. The latest Croatian advance contradicted an announcement on Sunday night by Croatian president Franjo Tudjman that the offensive was over because the country had achieved its strategic goals. Surprisingly, Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic appeared to be playing down the fighting in Croatia. He declined to stir up nationalist passions as he has done in the past. Instead, in a parliamentary address, he said Serbia had three priorities: 'Peace, economic development and the fight against crime.' But Mr Vojislav Seselj, the ultra-nationalist Serb leader and a favourite of Mr Milosevic, accused Mr Cosic of striking a secret deal with Mr Tudjman. Independent analysts also speculated that the Serb and Yugoslav presidents had secretly agreed to Croatia taking control of the Maslenica region in exchange for the corridor linking Serb-controlled territories in Bosnia to Serbia.

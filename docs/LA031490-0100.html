			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS SET DEADLINE OF MAY 4 FOR REFUNDS ON SEASON TICKETS  </P> <P> Raider season-ticket holders have until May 4 to request in writing a refund on  their deposits for the 1990 season, a staff member in the club's ticket office  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Those who plan to renew their season tickets must send in a 25% deposit by  March 23 and full payment must be received by April 27 to guarantee renewal of  seating.  </P> <P> According to the season-ticket form, a full refund must be requested, in  writing, no later than seven days after the deadline for final payment.  </P> <P> The Raiders said they had received few phone calls requesting information about  refunds for season tickets in the wake of owner Al Davis' announcement that he  intends to return the team to Oakland.  </P> <P> "Actually, we've been getting calls from the Bay Area wondering about buying  season tickets," said Peter Eiges of the ticket office. "We have to tell them  that until everything is finalized, we don't have a plan for that. As Mr. Davis  said, we are waiting for the whole process to take place."  </P> <P> And the Los Angeles-area fans who call?  </P> <P> "We tell them that our lease with the Coliseum runs two more years and we  expect to be playing our games here the next two years."  </P> <P> And if the Coliseum Commission releases Davis from the lease?  </P> <P> "We can only go by what we know," Eiges said. "We plan to play here two more  years." JIM COLONNA  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 26 January -- Vladimir Shumeyko, Chairman of  the Federation Council of the Russian Federation Federal  Assembly, sees nothing dramatic in the changes in the  composition of the government and believes that they will not  affect the course of radical reforms. He told journalists this  today.    One should not speak about a "new cabinet", Vladimir  Shumeyko  believes. "It's the same government, only minus Gaydar, Fedorov,  and Shumeyko", he said. As a result of the reshuffle, the  government "has become more compact and has started to address  more the tasks facing the executive," and "presidential power  has become more solid," Shumeyko is convinced.    He categorically denies that the new composition of the  cabinet is the outcome of a difficult compromise between the  government, which favours a continuation of the radical reforms,  and the premier, who is insisting on a correction of the course.  "All the radical reforms have been set out in the government's  plan of action for 1993-1995. It was adopted jointly with the  president and all the corrections of the course were fully  agreed with him".    An extended session of the government will take place in  February, which will be attended by the president and the heads  of administration, of executive power, and the components of the  Federation, which will sum up the results of 1993 and discuss  tasks for this year. Some kind of correction of the course is  inevitable at this session, Shumeyko said. But "no one intends  to tamper with the reforms based on the removal from or arrival  of anyone into the government."    The speaker of the upper chamber believes the government's  first task at the present stage to be measures to support the  country's producers. "The commodity market is 75 percent full,  and one must talk about developing our industry and our  agriculture, and it is here where the main corrections of the  cabinet's moves must be".    Regarding the work of parliament, Vladimir Shumeyko noted  that at the moment there was nothing to indicate that there  would not be any cooperation between the two chambers or that  the work of the State Duma would not be constructive. He  reaffirmed that the Federation Council, according to the  Constitution, has legislative initiative and may in extreme  cases adopt laws independently. "Nevertheless, we must avoid  such extremes", he added.    The speaker said that one of the main issues facing the  parliamentarians was the adoption of the Russian state budget  for 1994.    Next Monday the session of the Federation Council plans to  discuss the question of the Russian socio-economic situation and  Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin will present a report. "Such  preliminary counsel with the members of the Federation Council  will, I believe, influence the type of budget which the  government will present to the Duma, and we will be able to  adopt it much quicker".</p>

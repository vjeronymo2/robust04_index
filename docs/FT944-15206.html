			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Securities business holds back Travelers Travelers, the broad-based US financial services group, was held back by difficult conditions in the financial markets in the three months to the end of September. The company reported a marginal advance in earn-ings per share to 97 cents, up from 96 cents a year before. Profit growth was dampened by a fall in operating earnings at Smith Barney, the group's securities business. Smith Barney reported earnings of Dollars 72.9m, down from Dollars 118.8m, even though the year-ago period included only a two-month contribution from Shearson, the retail broker Travelers bought from American Express. Mr Sanford Weill, chairman and chief executive, said the stability of the group's consumer lending and life assurance businesses had enabled it to withstand the difficult conditions in the brokerage business. Earnings from consumer finance rose 10 per cent to Dollars 56m, while operating profits from life assurance were 13 per cent higher, at Dollars 50m. Overall, Travelers reported net income for the period of Dollars 331m, compared with Dollars 242m the year before. In the 1993 period, the group, then known as Primerica, had yet to buy out the whole of the Travelers insurance company.</p>

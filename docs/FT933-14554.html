			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Surge in early teacher retirements THE NUMBER of teachers in England and Wales retiring early through ill health each year has almost tripled since 1979, Teachers' Pension Agency figures released today by the National Association of Head Teachers show. The association blamed government reforms and increasing workloads. Mr David Hart, general secretary, said: 'Teachers are leaving early because they are suffering from stress-related illnesses, or because they are being made redundant.' The pace of reform and the strain on school budgets was taking far too heavy a toll of 'experienced staff that schools could ill-afford to lose', he said. The pension agency, was said the number of early retirements through ill health had risen from 1,617 to 4,775 since the educational year of 1979-80, although the population's health had improved. The numbers made redundant before 60 rose from 2,295 to 10,293. The association said budget problems led to the employment of younger, 'cheaper' teachers at the expense of older, more experienced staff. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the statistics provided 'an alarming confirmation of what we all know from personal experience'. She added: 'Some of our most conscientious teachers are leaving education and the confrontational government's failure to listen to the concerns of parents, governors and teachers only makes matters worse.'</p>

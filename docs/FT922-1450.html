			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / French Maastricht vote today FRANCE will today take a decisive stride towards ratifying the Maastricht Treaty on European Union, when it completes the requisite revision of the French constitution. After six weeks of high-intensity debates in the National Assembly and the Senate, the two houses of Parliament meet today in a special joint sitting in the Palace of Versailles, amid general expectations that they will vote heavily in favour. Despite fierce resistance from a large section of the RPR Gaullist party, and total opposition from the Communists, the constitutional amendments last week secured large majorities in both houses. The Senate voted 192 to 117, and the National Assembly 388 to 43. The addition of these votes suggests the government should have no difficulty in securing the necessary three-fifths majority in today's joint session of 895 parliamentarians. Coming on top of the big majority in last week's Irish referendum, a successful vote in the French congress will be an important morale booster for this week's European Community summit in Lisbon. But even a comfortable majority in today's congress will still give no guarantee that the treaty itself will be ratified when it is put to a popular referendum in the autumn. All recent public opinion polls have shown regular popular support for Maastricht; the most recent survey, published over the weekend, gave 51 per cent in favour and only 18 per cent against. This is a wider margin of support than in previous polls, and should augur well for the referendum. Government officials are acutely aware, however, that support for the treaty could yet be jeopardised by the deep personal unpopularity of President Francois Mitterrand. A weekend poll showed a further drop in Mr Mitterrand's rating, with only 28 per cent approving of him and 58 per cent disapproving. The only consolation for the government is that the Maastricht debate has driven a deep split between the Gaullists and their regular conservative partners in the Centrist and UDF parties. These parties last week voted overwhelmingly in favour of the constitutional revision, and their leaders have undertaken to campaign in favour of the ratification of the treaty. By contrast, the Gaullists are divided between those who are ambivalent over the Maastricht Treaty, and those who are openly hostile; last week they either voted against the constitutional revision (in the Senate) or abstained (in the National Assembly). This disagreement over the European Community, in which the Gaullists have denounced their putative partners for 'collaborating' with the government, is bound to continue at least until the referendum, and may handicap the conservative parties in the run-up to the general elections next March.</p>

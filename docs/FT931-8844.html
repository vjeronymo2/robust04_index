			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG 'unprepared' for mining boom IF RECENT events such as the dispute over ownership of the giant Porgera gold mine caused international investors to turn their backs on Papua New Guinea for a while, it might be a blessing in disguise, Mr Noel Levi, PNG's high commissioner in London, said yesterday. He pointed out that PNG became independent only 17 years ago and in the past few years had attracted well over Dollars 2bn of foreign investment in mining and oil projects while exploration expenditure by foreign companies was running at an annual Dollars 100m. The country had been 'thrown into the mining boom with no preparation' and might benefit from some breathing space. 'Perhaps we need time to reflect on the past decade and to put in place mining laws that are more up-to-date. Perhaps the present laws are not entirely to our benefit.' Mr Levi made it clear, however, that he, personally, wanted the USDollars 760m Lihir island gold project, which aims to develop one of the world's biggest and lowest-cost deposits of the precious metal, to go ahead as quickly as possible. Start-up of this project, in which RTZ, the world's biggest mining company has an 80 per cent stake, had already been delayed from 1992-93 to 1995, he said. 'But if RTZ wants it to happen, it will happen.' Mr Levi also pointed out his government's official policy was to welcome foreign investment 'because the international business community offers technical expertise and financial resources needed to develop our natural resources responsibly to build national prosperity.' At a meeting with institutional investors organised by Prudential-Bache Securities, the financial services organisation, Mr Levi was closely questioned about the Porgera mine. PNG has a 10 per cent stake in Porgera but both the new prime minister, Mr Paias Wingti, and the mining minister, Mr Masket Iangalio, have indicated this should be raised to 30 per cent, suggestions that created a bitter dispute with the Australian partners in the venture: Placer Pacific; Renison Goldfields; and a subsidiary of MIM Holdings. It was suggested by Mr Iangalio on Monday that the dispute would be settled by the end of this week but Mr Levi pointed out that so far the PNG cabinet had not been asked to approve any move to raise the Porgera stake or to allocate money to pay for it.  -----------------------------------       LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ----------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  -----------------------------------   Aluminium  +9,150 to 1,648,450   Copper       +550 to   319,425   Lead         -125 to   235,075   Nickel       +684 to    80,988   Zinc       +1,775 to   539,000   Tin          +190 to    17,120  -----------------------------------</p>

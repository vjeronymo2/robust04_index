			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Order of the Commander in Chief of the Republic of Georgia </F> Armed Forces on the Introduction of Partial Organizational  Changes to the Structure of the Republic of Georgia Ministry of  Defense"; place and date not given]    [Text] The process of the organizational development of  the Republic of Georgia Armed Forces has shown us that the  "special purpose," "rapid reaction," "mobile," and other  battalions that were created in their time as part of the  Republic of Georgia Ministry of Defense Armed Forces are at  present having a negative effect on the formation of regular  Armed Forces and are creating difficulties regarding the  formation of a unified system of commanding and controlling  troops. These subunits were brought up to strength mainly by  means of enlisting reservists and volunteers.    The structure of the Ministry of Defense Military Police  does  not correspond to contemporary needs. Military Police subunits  are carrying out the same activities as the law enforcement  bodies.    In order to create a unified system of commanding and  controlling single armed forces, organize effective control over  the activities of troops, and form and strengthen the principles  of unity of command, I order:    1. Republic of Georgia Ministry of Defense individual  military units and subunits, in addition to fulfilling functions  prescribed in accordance with the organizational and authorized  structure of the Armed Forces, to be incorporated into the motor  rifle brigades.    2. The Military Police Directorate existing in the Republic  of Georgia Ministry of Defense system to be abolished and those  subunits subordinate to it to be disbanded. The personnel  making up these subunits and their combat weapons and equipment  to be used in order to bring up to strength other army combined  units, units, and military commandant's offices at military  garrisons.    3. It to be pointed out that Military Police personnel  fulfilled an important role in carrying out the orders of the  commander in chief and the Ministry of Defense and in fighting  for Georgia's state interests for which I express my gratitude  to all officers and combat soldiers.    4. Town and rayon [administrative] heads to be entrusted  with resolving the question of finding employment for those  serving in the Military Police who do not wish to continue to  serve in the Republic of Georgia Armed Forces. They are to  report the execution of this order directly to me.    5. Military garrisons and commandant's offices to be created  in all towns and rayons where military combined units and units  are based; they are to be entrusted with establishing strict  military discipline and order among military servicemen.    6. Armed groups and formations located on the republic's  territory that do not form part of the Armed Forces to be  disbanded and their personnel, weapons, combat equipment, and  military property to be used in order to bring up to strength  the motorized rifle brigades .    7. The heads of the Republic of Georgia Ministry of Defense,  Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the State Security Service to  be entrusted with implementing those measures stipulated in the  order.    They are to report the execution of this order to me by 15  June 1994.    8. The order to be communicated to the ranking personnel of  the Armed Forces.    [Signed] E. Shevardnadze.</p>

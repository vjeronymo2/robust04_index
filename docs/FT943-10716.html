			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Hugo Boss advances 17% in first half Net earnings at the Hugo Boss male fashion group rose 17 per cent to DM26.4m (Dollars 16.5m) in the first half of the current year, the company said yesterday. The result, bolstered by increased income from licences, was achieved in spite of a 4 per cent decline in turnover to DM395m. Margins have been helped by increased production outside Germany. The company recently closed one of its three remaining German plants, moving production to cheaper suppliers, mainly in eastern Europe. German sales, affected by shrinking real incomes, fell 8 per cent to DM160m, and there was a similar fall elsewhere in Europe to DM128m. However, the Americas saw turnover rise 6 per cent to DM85m, and there was a marked increase in Asia, the company said. Boss, which last year recorded record earnings of DM76.5m due to exceptional items and a one-off tax break worth a total of about DM28m, said full-year earnings this time would be slightly under 1993's underlying profits of DM48.6m. The company said it expected turnover to increase slightly as international economic prospects brightened, and to end the year at around the DM846m recorded in 1993.</p>

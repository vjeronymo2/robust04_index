Semenov,  Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, under the rubric  ``Investigation of the Sequelae of the Chernobyl Disaster''; UDC  [577.2+576]:539.1.04]    [Abstract]Changes in radiosensitivity were studied in  experiments onvarious lines of mice: (CBAxC57BL6)F[.sub]1[/],  (DBAxC57Bl)F[.sub]1[/] and DBA2, kept in metal cages (wire  mesh, sheltered from rain and direct UV light) in the village of  Yanovo, on the border of the "brown forest" in the zone of the  Chernobyl disaster. Feed and water were brought in from  Chernobyl, with a control group of intact mice in clean zones.  Exposure time ranged from 1 to 14 days, and dose rate was 100  mR/h, after which experimental and control animals were taken to  Moscow and exposed to acute radiation in doses of 3.0, 5.0, 7.0  and 9.0 Gy, at a dose rate of 2.32 Gy/min,after 2, 7 and 30  days. Effects were evaluated using the  _k_[.sup]2[/]statistical criterion of reliability. Figures  illustrate comparative survival rates of control and  experimental animals as a function of time after acute  irradiation. Radiosensitivity to subsequent acute exposure was  modified in animals exposed to radiation in the disaster zone,  the direction and intensity of this effect were a function of  interval between exposure in this zone and acute irradiation. It  is suggested that there are additional factors in the disaster  zone that are involved in altering animal sensitivity to  subsequent exposure to radiation. Figures 10, tables 1.

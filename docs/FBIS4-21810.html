			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich (DPA) -- According to the news magazine  FOCUS, four RAF [Red Army Faction] members obviously escaped the  police during the operation in Bad Kleinen. It is said that two  so far unidentified persons -- a man and a woman -- whom police  filmed in Bad Kleinen on 24 June, are two suspected terrorists.  Police meanwhile assume that the couple was involved in the  assassination of Trust Agency chief Detlef Karsten Rohwedder on  1 April 1991. The magazine points to an internal paper of the  Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA], according to  which the man might be the unknown person who was seen during  the attack on Rohwedder.    A few hours before the operation on 27 June, police filmed  another couple with a hidden camera in Bad Kleinen. BKA experts  realized only later that these two people were suspected RAF  members Daniela Klette and Ernst-Volker Staub.</p>

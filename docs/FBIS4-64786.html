			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Martin Halusa report: "Industry Warns Against Euphoria"] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Although industrial  associations expect a 2-percent increase in productivity this  year, they also warn against undue euphoria. The labor market,  they say, is a late indicator of economic trends, and provides  few conclusions about the overall economic situation. The 20  largest German industrial enterprises will shed a total of  50,000 jobs in 1994, compared to more than 100,000 jobs shed in  1993. Most of the jobs will disappear through earlier  retirement or natural fluctuations.    The Automobile Industry Association says: "Regardless of the  economic recovery, the negative trend is continuing, although a  slight improvement can be noted."    The Association of German Machinery and Equipment Producers  says: "The situation is still deteriorating. The reduction of  jobs in some enterprises is greater than the demand for jobs in  others."    The Central Electrical Industry Association says: "The fall  in employment is gradually slowing down, but a total stop is not  expected until the middle of the year." The planned reduction  of jobs in this sector until the end of the year is 10,000.    The Metal Industry Employers Association says: "We still  have a surplus of jobs, but the restructuring is continuing.  One-third of our firms wants to transfer a part of their  production to more cost-effective foreign territories."    The Chemical Employers Association says: "The personnel  reduction is continuing, though not as much as in 1993."</p>

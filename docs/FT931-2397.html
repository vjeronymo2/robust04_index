			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Election 93: Industrial output in France picks up slightly FRENCH industrial output rose slightly in January, showing an increase of 0.4 per cent against the previous month, according to the latest figures from Insee, the state statistics institute. The small rise suggests the economy may have stabilised, after a fall in gross domestic product in the final quarter of 1992, the first decline since the Gulf War. A further fall in the current quarter would put France technically in recession. This means the ruling socialists, who are expected next weekend to be replaced by the conservatives in the final round of the parliamentary elections, may be able to leave office without taking France into recession. January's industrial output was still 4.7 per cent lower than that of January last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Semen Matrosov in the "Dniester Region" column: </F> "The Scandal Around the Local `Cheka' Chief Is Growing"]    [Text] Colonel Mikhail Bergman, commandant of the Tiraspol  garrison of the 14th Russian Army, appeared on the local  commercial Asket TV channel with charges against General Vadim  Shevtsov, former security minister and currently chief of the  Dniester Republic Security Committee. In particular Bergman  presented a copy of a document on service investigation into the  case of Major Antyufeyev (Vadim Shevtsov's real name --  SEGODNYA) as an officer of the Riga OMON special police force.  This document, signed by Shteynbrik, then head of the Latvian  Internal Affairs Ministry, attributes a number of official  misdemeanors to Antyufeyev. In addition, Colonel Bergman showed  TV viewers a documentary film about the involvement of the  Dniester Moldovan Republic's security officers, including  Shevtsov, in the October 1993 events in Moscow.    The reaction from the authorities of the unrecognized  Dniester Moldovan Republic to the attack by Mr. Bergman, who is  engaged in a protracted propaganda war with the "corrupt top" in  Tiraspol, was like lightning. The local press published letters  by Antyufeyev-Shevtsov's co-officers, including the above  mentioned Gen. Shteynbrik and former Riga OMON commander Sergey  Parfenov. Addressing Dniester Moldovan Republic President Igor  Smirnov, they unanimously defended the honor and dignity of  their colleague, who was awarded an order in 1990.    Observers believe that a new peak of confrontation between  the Dniester Moldovan Republic leadership and Mr. Bergman, who  is seen to be a front man for 14th Army Commander Lieutenant  General Lebed, is the result of a recent reorganization in the  Dniester Moldovan Republic's power structures. The State  Security Ministry and the Internal Affairs Ministry were merged  into a single superstructure -- the Committee for Republican  Security headed by Vadim Shevtsov (Antyufeyev), former Riga OMON  officer and chief of the Dniester state security service. Such  an obvious consolidation in the positions of a person who is  considered to be a personal enemy of Army commander Lebed and  Col. Bergman (the latter have been working for the last year and  a half to get Shevtsov removed from his post and put on trial --  SEGODNYA), could not but evoke corresponding reaction from the  14th Army.    Mr. Shevtsov and his structure are the most solid base for  the current Dniester Moldovan Republic leadership. Shevtsov's  removal will create favorable conditions for a reshuffle in the  Tiraspol top echelon and for its penetration by people amenable  to General Lebed and those standing behind him.</p>

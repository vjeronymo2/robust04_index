			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Arts: Britain's best kept secret hews to his own line - Sculpture PETER Randall-Page's public career as a sculptor began about a decade ago, and now, in his thirties, he is established as one of the most distinguished artists of a not unremarkable generation. Yet in terms of the public vaunting of a reputation, his might almost appear to be a career hardly begun. This is in marked contradistinction to what certain of his peers and near contemporaries have enjoyed, including Kapoor, Deacon, Cragg or Nash, Wilding, Mach or Goldsworthy, to say nothing of such younger luminaries as Hurst - of the shark in formaldehyde - or Whiteread - of the cast baths and mattresses. In international terms, his reputation does not exist. Where others have enjoyed British Council tours abroad and the concomitant international interest and support of dealers, critics and collectors, Randall-Page has stayed emphatically at home. It is not as though he has not achieved a considerable success after his own fashion, being ever ready to participate in group schemes and exhibitions, and having a string of public commissions around the country to his credit. Yet he is represented by no major dealer; the Arts Council has barely noticed him; the Tate has yet to acquire any of his work. Indeed the commentator who lately described him, in the light of this current touring retrospective, as British art's best-kept secret, got it just about right. Randall-Page stands, in short, somewhat apart from the system, and if the nature and practice of his work of themselves have contributed to such official indifference, he, for his part, deep in the Dorset countryside, seems content enough that it should be so. Indeed, it could hardly be otherwise, for we have only to consider the work as it is for a moment to recognise the difficulties it lays before current curatorial orthodoxy of expectation and prejudice. For, sophisticated as it is in the formal vocabulary of modernism it employs, and up-to-the-minute in its evident ecological and environmental sympathies and preoccupations, it is work that is all too significantly old-fashioned. Here is a young sculptor who is before all else a carver and a modeller. Everything is made directly under his own hand. He is no re-arranger of found material, no collagist or assembler, no scene-builder, installation-maker or window-dresser. His work is justified by no programme of material transformation or extraneous polemic, no idea or theory to be propounded before the event. It makes no comment on society, enters into no debate on the nature of art, makes no fashionable proposition on process or status. It is about nothing at all but itself, in its material form and imagery. We may take it or leave it - and the poor curator is left with nothing to put in his catalogue but his own physical and imaginative response. We can see his difficulty. Randall-Page carves not merely to demonstrate or exploit the character of his material, in the way that Kapoor hollows out his impressive lumps of rock, or Long sets them out across the floor, but to put it at the service of an image which, in its turn, repays the compliment. He stands firmly in the earlier modernist tradition of direct carving and truth to material, direct heir to Brancusi, Gaudier and Modigliani, Epstein, Gill and Dobson, Barbara Hepworth and, most obviously of all, Henry Moore. The image is stated and carried through to a full resolution, yet always accepting and celebrating the determining, particular qualities of the stone, whether it is the hard smoothness of marble or Kilkenny limestone, or the softer roughness of Hopton stone. The imagery itself is often obviously representational and, when abstract, more abstracted than abstract in the purest sense. The weighty simplicity and surface finish may owe much to Barbara Hepworth, but it is in this quality of particular suggestion, no matter how ambiguous, that he is always closer to Moore. Like him, the reference is to natural and organic forms, but where Moore's fundamental imaginative resource was the human, most especially the female figure, Randall-Page looks more generally to nature. The reference is to seeds and pods, fruit and cones, shells and fossils, visceral and serpentine coils and extrusions, lips and pudenda. The sexual connotations are inescapable, but more ambiguous than explicit and entirely unprurient, the implicit celebration one more of generalised fertility and growth than of any active sexuality. It is rather to the archaic fertility fetish of the Willendorf Venus that the nod is given, than to any Hellenistic or Renaissance image of perfection. This oddly sacerdotal function of the work, overlaid with a sense of ritual or purpose, albeit ambiguous and unspoken, is its strongest character. We think at once of ancient standing-stones, of tombs and temples, and the legends that accrue to them, of the hearths and thresholds, altars and anvils of the gods, as it might be Wayland's Smithy or the Hele Stone. It is by no mere opportunism that Randall-Page was a notable contributor to that admirable organisation, Common Ground's 'New Milestones' project of a year or two ago, nor that more recent monumental carvings should carry such names as 'Font', 'Vessel', 'New Touchstone'. He was a carver before ever he was a modeller, steeped in the craft, and is, again like Moore, never so assured and consummate an artist as when working directly on the stone. His carved objects, large and small alike, singly and groups, are quite extraordinary, visitations from another imaginative world that are yet deeply, unsuspectedly familiar - fruit of long-forgotten trees. And they are very beautiful. Peter Randall-Page - Sculpture and Drawings 1980-1992: Arnolfini Gallery, Narrow Quay, and the Temple Church, Victoria Street, Bristol, until October 4.

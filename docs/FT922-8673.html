			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Poland offers bonds to foreign investors A POLISH government bond issue is for the first time to be available to foreign investors. The bonds, maturing after three years, go on sale on August 3. Interest will be linked to the yield on three-month Polish treasury bills plus 10 per cent. This would mean 51 per cent compared to the expected year-end inflation rate of 45 per cent. Officials said foreign investors would be able to repatriate their earnings although final regulations providing for this have yet to be signed. Interest on the bonds is to be paid quarterly and they are to be traded on Warsaw's computerised stock exchange. The total value of the three-year bond issue is 7,000bn zlotys (Dollars 512m). This issue is to be accompanied by one-year bonds, available only to Poles and linked to inflation plus 5 per cent. This issue, on sale on June 1, has a value of 8,000bn zlotys. The two issues, are designed to finance partially Poland's budget deficit which is expected to reach 65,500bn zlotys this year.</p>

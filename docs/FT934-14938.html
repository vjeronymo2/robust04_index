			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / National Grid plans discounts scheme HOUSEHOLDS could reduce their electricity bills by opting to install special meters that cut off some domestic appliances during periods of peak demand, according to proposals put forward by the National Grid yesterday. The National Grid, which runs the electricity transmission system in England and Wales, also asked large industrial users to consider signing up to be cut off at short notice in return for savings on their annual bills of about 10 per cent. The proposals mark the latest move to increase the flexibility of the electricity supply system where power generation is in the hands of the National Power and PowerGen duopoly. National Grid pays Pounds 310m a year to the two generators for a series of back-up services required to run a safe, and economic electricity supply. These costs are, in turn, passed on to consumers. If large users, and eventually, domestic customers, agree to be cut off during peak periods, the National Grid will not require certain back-up services such as plant held in reserve (by the generators) to meet surges in demand. 'By securing an alternative supply for these vital services, we are expanding competition into this area,' Mr Charles Davis, National Grid's commercial manager, said at a seminar for 100 representatives of the UK's largest electricity-using businesses. National Power welcomed the proposals, but said the room for cost savings was limited.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Smith Corona halves income in second term SMITH Corona, the US maker of portable typewriters which is 48 per cent owned by Britain's Hanson group, yesterday posted second-quarter operating income of Dollars 5.2m, compared with Dollars 10.8m a year earlier. Net income stood at Dollars 4m, or 13 cents a share, compared with Dollars 7m, or 23 cents, the previous year, while sales fell 22 per cent to Dollars 86.7m from Dollars 111.7m. Mr Lee Thompson, chairman and chief executive, said the company was encouraged by signs of improving US retail sales and reduced retailer inventory levels in spite of the decline in sales during the quarter. 'While it is too early to determine if the recent improvement in retail activity will be sustained, we are encouraged by these recent trends as well as the enthusiasm and upbeat mood at the recent Winter Consumer Electronics Show,' he said. For the six months to December 31, the company suffered an operating loss of Dollars 1.8m, compared with operating income of Dollars 17.3m the previous year. In the first half, it recorded a net deficit of Dollars 1.1m, or 4 cents, including restructuring charges of Dollars 9.5m largely related to moving its manufacturing facilities to Mexico. A year earlier, the company had no restructuring costs and net income stood at Dollars 11.1m, or 37 cents. Sales for the first half slid to Dollars 168m from Dollars 198.9m.</p>

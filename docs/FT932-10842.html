			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Drivers oppose road fee scheme THE GOVERNMENT faces severe public hostility to its plans to impose an extra charge on motorists for the use of motorways, the results of an opinion poll published today show. The poll suggests that 86 per cent of motorists are opposed to the idea of paying an extra charge. Of these, 65 per cent say they are paying enough in taxes already. Later this month the government is due to publish a green paper setting out its plans for using motorway and trunk road charges as a means of raising cash to fund its programme of road building. It is understood that ministers have ruled out the possibility of installing toll collection points on existing motorways because these would take up too much land and slow traffic. Instead the government seems likely to suggest that drivers wishing to use motorways should be required to buy an annual supplementary licence fee until electronic technology makes it possible to charge for use of the roads on a pay-as-you-go basis. The poll of 1,079 motorists was carried out for the Royal Automobile Club by Research Surveys of Great Britain in March. It shows that 37 per cent of motorists say they will use motorways less often if charges are introduced. Nearly all of those - 97 per cent - say they will not drive less often but use other roads instead. This will increase fears that pay-as-you-go charges might divert traffic on to unsuitable city streets and country lanes, with unacceptable consequences for the environment. The RAC said the survey showed that extra charges would only be acceptable if they were accompanied by a package of measures that gave a fair deal to motorists, such as more by-passes and better main roads.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pavel Shinkarenko under the "Human Rights" </F> rubric: "Open Challenge to Humanitarian Principles"]    [Text] On 21 June the Republic of Latvia Saeima adopted a  law on citizenship. This is a legal act of unprecedented  content which essentially deprives the vast majority of ethnic  Russians permanently resident in the country of any realistic  possibility of obtaining Latvian citizenship.    "The law contains elements of ethnic discrimination and  enshrines a principle rejected by international experts --  quotas for the naturalization of permanent residents of Latvia,  which in general terms will not begin until the year 2000,"  Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Federation Foreign  Ministry Information and Press Department, told ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI. "This means that on the threshold of the 21st century, a  state which considers itself democratic and governed by the rule  of law has taken another step aimed at legal discrimination  against hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of the republic and  the formation of a multiethnic state."    The diplomat believes that official Riga embarked on this  path long before the adoption of the present law. Immediately  after acquiring independence it stripped non-indigenous  residents of citizenship and began to discriminate specifically  against them in the political, social, economic, and other  spheres. To this end a whole series of state decisions has been  adopted. They include the law on elections to the central and  local organs of power, the law on state service, the law on  languages, the law on election campaigning, and additions to the  laws on the entry and residence of foreigners and on the police  which seriously worsen the situation of hundreds of thousands of  non-Latvian residents.    It goes without saying that this step by the Latvian  authorities did not go unnoticed elsewhere, especially not in  Russia. The day after the vote, statements condemning Riga's  actions were issued by the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry  and other state organs and public organizations and on Friday  the Federation Council appealed to the parliaments of the CSCE  member states. The deputies' appeal notes, among other things,  that the law was adopted "despite the many protests of the  international community and regardless of the recommendations of  the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and a number of international  experts." Thus, the senators stress, the Latvian authorities  have "flouted public standards in the human rights sphere."    Moscow believes that the governments and public of the  European countries must prevent Latvia's slide toward aggressive  nationalism and the emergence of a center of tension in the  Baltic region. For its part Russia will approach the further  development of relations with Latvia in the light of the  situation developing in Latvia over the law on citizenship.</p>

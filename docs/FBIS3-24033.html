			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Myroslav Levytskyy: "Kiev's Optimists!? A </F> Political Commentary"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted]    Official Kiev's optimism manifested itself in yet another  aspect. In the leading circles of the Ukrainian Supreme Council  a RESPUBLIKA correspondent was informed that the question of  Ukraine's becoming a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty (DNYaZ) would not be taken up by the Ukrainian parliament  in the immediate future. Consideration of this question has to  be postponed until such time as Ukraine is accorded specific  security guarantees. Would this take place any more rapidly than  the dismantling of our technically obsolete missiles?    The president of Ukraine has also said already that this  question will not be brought up for consideration by the present  parliament. He did not, however, indicate the reasons why this  was being postponed.    Could it be that the United States, changing its attitude  toward Ukraine, has come to understand that the retention of  nuclear warheads and the ratification of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty constitutes a logical and political  absurdity? However, there is little hope of such a change in  attitude. During the telephone conversation which took place  between the presidents of Ukraine and the United States on 18  February Clinton again insisted upon Ukraine's becoming a party  to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.    But what then about the promises of security guarantees? Is  anybody in a hurry to accord them to Ukraine? All the more so  when it would involve making uniquivocal moves in international  policy? It was important for Ukraine to be made a part of the  program entitled "Partnership for Peace": this was a display of  trust in Ukraine on the part of the NATO members. As a member of  this partnership, Ukraine adopted the Russian viewpoint with  regard to the Serbian problem. Nowadays, after the withdrawal of  Serbian troops from the frontline, it is still too early to  assess the correctness or incorrectness of the Ukrainian stance  on this matter. The Russian peace initiatives and actions in  Abkhazia ended with the drama of the Georgian state. Ukrainian  politicians are seeking answers to the question of what lies  behind the fact that the Serbs believed only the Russians. All  the more so in that Russia's presidential adviser--on the  occasion of the new situation in the Balkans--made the following  statement: "We need to be able to persuade people and know how  to take advantage of the opportune moment."    In this situation Western commentators traditionally  consider  the Russians' diplomatic mission as a triumph, while expressing  great surprise at the stance taken by Ukraine. The latter's  democratic politicians have emphatically proclaimed that in  foreign policy we must uneqivocally pose the matter as follows:  "Either national interests or old-time sentiments!"    This matter has gained new urgency since the reasons for the  "Russian diplomatic triumph" have been figured out. Situations  sometimes occur whereby military people reveal that which the  diplomats have striven so zealously and long to conceal. On 19  February a certain Russian general in an interview for the  Ostankino Televison Company said the following straight out: "If  NATO intervenes in a sphere of influence which is not theirs,  unforeseen consequences could result." He thereby emphatically  asserted for the umpteenth time that the world is divided into  zones of influence.    And so it turns out that the prolonged war in the Balkans is  a consequence of the above-mentioned division. If decisiveness  and determination had been shown, this military conflagration on  the territory of the former Yugoslavia could have been  extinguished long ago. When matters started to turn threatening  for certain NATO members (Greece and Turkey), this organization  showed firmness. Tens of thousands of victime did not constitute  a sufficient argument to intervene in someone else's zone.    All this sheds new light on the question of according  security guarantees to Ukraine. At one of his November 1993  press conferences former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma said that  Ukraine belongs to the Russian zone. Therefore, the doubts of  certain Western journalists regarding the genuineness of the  security guarantees intended for Ukraine are not groundless or  unjustified.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN CANYON FIRE TELLS A MUDDLED STORY;  </P> <P> ARSON: IN JAILHOUSE INTERVIEW, TRANSIENT SAYS HE WAS TRYING 'TO GET HIGH OR  SOMETHING. . . . THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO OUT THERE.'  </P> <P> A disturbed transient arrested on suspicion of starting a brush fire that  charred more than 6,600 acres in Orange and San Bernardino counties offered  conflicting and often apologetic accounts Wednesday as to how the fire started.  </P> <P> During a jailhouse interview, Peter Diaz Reyes initially said he started the  fire accidentally while trying to boil some coffee in the dry hills of Carbon  Canyon near Brea. He gave fire investigators a similar version of events after  his arrest Wednesday night.  </P> <P> But he went on to give a markedly different, and sometimes confused, account,  saying that he lit the blaze out of boredom and frustration.  </P> <P> "I was trying, you know, to get high or something. There was nothing to do out  there," he said. At one point, the husky, unshaven 29-year-old man said he  hoped that starting the fire might get him some attention from his parents so  that "maybe they'll take me to a restaurant or something and buy me some food."  </P> <P> Later, Reyes said he lit a stack of leaves afire because "I was upset and  angry, depressed."  </P> <P> The fire was set about 11 a.m. Wednesday in two locations, a quarter-mile  apart, on the north side of Carbon Canyon Road across from Carbon Canyon  Regional Park in Brea.  </P> <P> Reyes, a homeless man from Blythe, near the Arizona border, appeared shocked  when told that the fire had raged out of control for hours and destroyed or  damaged 14 homes in its path.  </P> <P> "God. Did the people panic about the fire -- they turned it off, the Fire  Department, didn't they? They should have," Reyes said, fidgeting nervously in  the medical ward of the Orange County Jail, used to house inmates with mental  or physical problems.  </P> <P> "Do I have to pay for the damage?" he asked repeatedly. Then he added: "I would  have paid for all that stuff. If I find a job, I'll go out and pay for all the  damage."  </P> <P> Reyes said he had been wandering in Orange County for several weeks before he  came across a "gas company" -- the Santa Fe Energy Co. building -- and decided  to take a nap under a nearby tree Wednesday.  </P> <P> When he awoke, Reyes said, someone at the gas company told him to leave the  premises and, some time later, he broke some windows at the building. Asked why  he broke the windows, he said the breaking of the glass "had a pretty noise to  it, like chandeliers."  </P> <P> Then, Reyes said, he lit a stack of dry leaves on fire with some matches he had  found at a local grocery store and, a few minutes later, lit a second fire  nearby. "I knew what I was doing -- lighting a fire. . . . I lit the gas  company on fire," he said.  </P> <P> "The whole place set on fire. The wind was blowing and the fire went really  quickly. Everything was on fire, the grass, the leaves. . . . It looked like  somebody dropped a bomb on the place."  </P> <P> Although disoriented as to times and details, Reyes said he had spent some time  behind bars for what he described as petty thefts in the Blythe area, probation  violations and assault with a deadly weapon after he attacked his father with a  steak knife.  </P> <P> Court and police officials in Blythe and Riverside County did not provide  specifics on Reyes' convictions, but Lt. Bob Grady, head of investigations in  the Blythe Police Department, confirmed Reyes' general account of his criminal  history. He said Reyes was never implicated in any arson as far as he knew.  "It's a small town, and I remember him as a kid on the streets. I wouldn't say  he was a real good kid, but he wasn't real bad either."  </P> <P> Orange County Jail psychiatric officials, citing confidentiality restrictions,  declined to discuss their examination of Reyes or whether he has any history of  mental health problems. But some fire officials have already formed their own  impressions from having talked to him.  </P> <P> "He doesn't seem to be extremely reliable," said Orange County Fire Capt. Dan  Young. "I don't think he's entirely with the program."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ted Johnson contributed to this report.  </P></p>

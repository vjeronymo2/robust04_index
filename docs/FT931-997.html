			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Competition policy doubted THE LACK of a cohesive approach by the competition authorities to defining markets is producing inconsistencies in the vetting of monopolies and mergers, research published yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading shows. The research, carried out for the OFT by economic consultants Nera, says a company's 'market share' is invariably quoted by the OFT and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to justify a decision to block a merger on competition grounds or to infer that a company enjoys a dominant market position. But the question of how the particular market is defined is rarely addressed explicitly and there are inconsistencies in approach between one case and another, the report says. The MMC's approach to defining markets in cases involving secondary products (spare parts) has varied considerably, it says. In two photocopier inquiries the MMC concluded that the secondary products for toner and maintenance formed part of the same product market as the photocopiers themselves. In a Ford inquiry, however, the commission defined Ford body panels as a separate relevant market. Nera says that in an attempt to iron out such inconsistencies the OFT and MMC should be obliged to define the relevant market as an explicit stage in their analysis before using market shares to support their conclusions. This would bring UK competition policy into line with EC competition law. Nera notes that many different concepts of the term 'the market' exist. It says the most useful concept of the relevant market identifies it according to whether a single supplier of a particular product (or hypothetical monopolist) would find it profitable to raise the price of that product. If it would, the product represents a separate market. If not, the product is part of a wider market. It suggests an economic approach to market definition, including checklists for dealing with specific problems such as deciding whether a market is national or international, and assessing how similar two products need to be in order to be classified in the same market.

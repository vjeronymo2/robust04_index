			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Arts: An invitation to loiter with intent - Patricia Morison talks to Neil MacGregor, director of London's National Gallery AT LEAST there remains one issue on which the Germans look to Britain for advice. Three years after reunification, the future of Berlin's museums is still being bitterly debated. Key speaker at a recent conference in Berlin was Neil MacGregor, director of London's National Gallery. MacGregor explained to the Financial Times his belief that the same fundamental question now confronts those in charge of great public art-collections, whether in Berlin or Buenos Aires. 'What kind of relationship is possible between the public and their collections?' 'In most European countries, there has been a fundamental shift from providing for the local public to the international tourist'. MacGregor's strongly held view is that this is a betrayal, tantamount to whoring after false gods. Great collections which were in so many cases creations of the 19th century to benefit the local citizenry, should not at the end of the 20th century degenerate into 'revenue earners from tourists.' MacGregor instances the Uffizi Gallery and the Pitti Palace in Florence as two museums which are now shrines to international tourism. Every visitor pays a L10,000 entry fee irrespective of whether they are students or residents. 'Effectively, and allowing for hyperbole, Florence has been expropriated. Those collections could quite as well be anywhere else.' MacGregor is almost as critical of developments in Paris where he sees the Musee d'Orsay and the Louvre as 'supreme examples of museums adapted to an international public'. The public for which they cater is the average tourist with only three days in hand. As in all tourist museums, the emphasis is on fast 'through-put' - and high expenditure. At the Orsay, the former railway station now the museum of the 19th century, a parcours keeps the typical visitor running smoothly along the rails from circa 1800 to 1900. MacGregor sees poor labelling and lack of additional sources of information at the Uffizi, the Louvre and Rijksmuseum, as further proof of a stratagem aimed principally at 'a world public'. An opposite philosophy governs at the National Gallery. 'We set out to privilege the local population, which is to say, the frequent visitor.' The ideal visitor is the loiterer with intent, obedient to the MacGregor scheme of making visitors slow down, sit rather than walk - and to come back. The hang of the pictures is more spacious than in most continental museums; labels have become markedly more fulsome. A policy of small, popular exhibitions in the 'Paintings in Focus' and 'Brief Encounters' series has proved extraordinarily popular and is being copied by museums abroad. Then there is all the back-up available to the inquisitive visitor. Computer terminals in the Sainsbury Wing's Micro Gallery 'make the wilder shores of mythology and iconography accessible'. There is a free monthly News Letter, free daily lunchtime lectures, evening debates, and weekend study-days. Warders are invited to early morning art-history talks to keep them mentally on their toes. Central to MacGregor's concept of the Gallery's public is his resolute opposition to entry-charges. Interestingly, MacGregor and his trustees have also rejected the idea of introducing charges via the back-door by creating a 'Friends' organisation, the marketting ploy now so popular even with non-charging museums such as the British Museum and the Tate. MacGregor may talk of 'privileging' the locals but eschews talk which smacks any more strongly of elitism. But there must always be a question whether the NG is, even so, really user-friendly? Ironically, in this month's Gallery newsletter playwright Alan Bennett uses an invitation to enthuse about a painting (Mantegna's Agony in the Garden) to rehearse his doubts about the foot-aching experience of gallery-going. 'In a museum I am informed and instructed. But with art . . . I don't know. What am I supposed to think? What am I supposed to feel?' These are lines spoken by Chubb, the MI5 man in Bennet's play, A Question of Attribution. How would MacGregor reassure the curious yet aesthetically insecure Chubbs among his public? Give the pictures time, is his key advice to the naive visitor whom he likes to imagine strolling unhurriedly through the galleries and then, arrested by a picture, sitting down to look - or to draw, a process he particularly recommends to parents introducing children to the collection. MacGregor quotes a favourite passage in Iris Murdoch's The Bell, in which a character feeling wretched goes to the Gallery for the thousandth time. Walking past familiar pictures 'as through a well-loved grove' Dora feels calm descending on her. She looks pityingly at visitors peering at masterpieces, guidebook in hand. 'Dora did not need to peer. She could look, as one can at last when one knows a great thing very well, confronting it with a dignity which it has itself conferred.' MacGregor's deeply-held belief is that 'the pictures at Trafalgar Square are of such quality that they will speak, and say something which matters, if given time. Saturated as we are by the moving image, it has to be a conscious effort to look at, to relax into, one image for minutes at a time. MacGregor again refers admiringly to the 19th century, when museums were intended to change visitors. 'There's no point in reading Shakespeare's sonnets without bringing to it your own experience of love and rejection. It's just the same with Titian's 'Bacchus and Ariadne', as most people realise if you sit them down to look.' Great art will speak, even change the viewer, if he or she has the confidence to bring to it their own emotional experience. 'The dignity of the thing can be taken on by the looker. People take themselves seriously when they look at something of supreme quality. That, I think, is the key job of the reactionary art gallery - or traditional, if you prefer. All museums are the product of the Enlightenment. The end of enlightenment is a L10,000 fee at the Uffizi.'</p>

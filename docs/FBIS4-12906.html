			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 13 Apr (MENA)--Zuhdi al-Qidrah, alternate  Palestinian ambassador and representative of the Fatah Movement  in Cairo, has stated that the PLO will not sign a final  agreement with Israel before an implementable solution regarding  the geographical jurisdiction is reached.    In a statement made today, al-Qidrah said that although an  agreement was reached during the recent Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations concerning the establishment of the Palestinian  police and its number, weapons, and deployment areas, it would  be difficult to sign a final agreement without resolving certain  problems.    Al-Qidrah expressed the hope that the next round of  negotiations between the two delegations next week will be  decisive and achieve the desired positive results.    He called on Israel to demonstrate its seriousness and  credibility by quickly implementing its commitments under the  Oslo and Cairo agreements, noting that the Palestinian  delegation is abiding by Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's  instructions to work for the establishment of a just peace to  ensure the life and future of the peoples in the area.    Al-Qidrah affirmed the importance of the Egyptian role under  the leadership of President Husni Mubarak and Foreign Minister  'Amr Musa in tackling the causes of any possible collapse in the  talks from time to time.    Al-Qidrah called for reviving bilateral Arab coordination  among the five Arab parties taking part in the negotiations with  Israel in accordance with the Arab League Council's decision.</p>

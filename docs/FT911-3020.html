			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Natural gas emerges as Europe's fuel for the 1990s - Investment opportunities in an industry where de-regulation is overdue THE EMERGENCE of natural gas as the fuel of choice in Europe presents a promising investment theme for the 1990s. The main competitors to gas - oil, coal and nuclear power - have become less attractive in recent years to West European governments and consumers alike on environmental and inflationary grounds. On a longer term view, the market for gas supply could become more competitive as the European Commission attempts to liberalise the industry by loosening the grip of entrenched monopoly suppliers. Kleinwort Benson, the London stockbroker, estimates that West European gas demand will rise from a current 25bn cubic feet a day to 36.3bn cubic feet by 2,000 and 48bn cubic feet by 2,010. Much of this increase will be met by Europe's main producers - the UK, the Netherlands and Norway - but imports from Algeria and the Soviet Union are also likely to rise. Investors wanting exposure to the growing demand for gas in Europe have various options, says Mr Philip Lambert, the author of Kleinwort Benson's gas review. Royal Dutch/Shell's position in European gas is second to none and it has a strong presence in most of the transmission companies in Europe. Norsk Hydro is an obvious beneficiary of the increase in Norwegian gas value. Not only is it likely that Norsk Hydro's gas production will nearly triple to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day (boe/d) over the next 10 years, but its 6.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of proven or probable gas reserves - until recently regarded as uncommercial  - could soon become its most valuable asset. Norway's Saga Petroleum is an even purer play than Norsk Hydro, which also has aluminium, fertiliser and petrochemical interests. Italy's gas market should be viewed as the most bullish in Europe, in spite of the 24 per cent market share that natural gas already has of the primary energy market. Kleinwort Benson forecasts that this will rise to 30 per cent by 2,000, since Italy has abandoned nuclear power and is under pressure to reduce dependence on oil, which accounts for 58.2 per cent of the energy market. Italgas, a quoted distribution company, looks attractive on a three-year view, during which the dividend should begin to rise in line with the growth of its gas business. The jump in demand could help small independent suppliers and gas traders trying to break into the European Community market, but for this to happen the Commission would have to pass legislation to further open up the gas market. Europe's gas market is controlled by a small group of monopoly suppliers which control production, transmission and distribution. Gaz de France, SNAM, in Italy, British Gas, in the UK, Ruhrgas, in Germany, and Gasunie, in the Netherlands, are very large players. Where a statutory monopoly is not in place many countries allow a major supplier to retain its dominance. But the Commission has challenged the entrenched monopolies that exist in three EC countries for the import and export of gas by initiating legal proceedings against France, Denmark and Belgium. In spite of deep opposition from the gas suppliers, the Commission wants to institute a policy of open access in the EC, whereby independent suppliers would be allowed access to existing pipelines for gas transport to customers. Elf Aquitaine is a major oil producer trying to gain greater access to the EC gas market. Natural gas already accounts for around one-seventh of Elf's earnings per share, and Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, its chairman, has said recently that the monopoly gas suppliers will have to face more competition in future. Elf has gas reserves of some 1,500bn cubic feet in its Lacq deposit in south-west France, and has tried to gather more gas by taking a 50 per cent stake in Agas, the UK independent gas company, and a link with Wintershall, in Germany. A partial privatisation of Gaz de France is possible over the coming years, and both Elf and Total are known to be interested. After the UK, Germany probably operates one of the most open gas markets in Europe; but Ruhrgas, owned by a consortium of oil companies, dominates transmission and owns a large chunk of the pipeline system. Wintershall, the energy subsidiary of the BASF chemicals group, is challenging this stranglehold with plans to build its own distribution system and allow other companies, such as Elf and Austria's OMV, to transport their gas through it. It is the leading chemical companies such as BASF and Dow Chemical - large users of gas - which are pushing strongly for a policy of open access in gas since they argue that this will reduce gas prices. The gas companies say it will take away the incentive to invest in long-term projects in an industry with extremely long lead times. This, says the suppliers, will reduce the security of supply for consumers.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 20, 1993, Dr. Bodian responded to the Demand for Information stating that (1) on infrequent occasions a precalibrated dose of radioiodine was administered without prior use of dose calibrator; (2) a request for termination of his license (No. 29&hyph;12417&hyph;01) was made on January 25, 1993; and (3) his listing (as an authorized user) on the Englewood Hospital license (No. 29&hyph;08519&hyph;01) was a carry over from years ago, and that any administration of radiopharmaceuticals to his patients at Englewood hospital was done under the supervision of the hospital radiology department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC OI report issued July 26, 1993 determined that notwithstanding Dr. Bodian's statements to the NRC, the doses, with a few exceptions, were not assayed with a dose calibrator prior to administration, even though Dr. Bodian was aware that such assays were required. This finding is based on the fact that although the Licensee's records indicate that 30 iodine&hyph;131 doses were provided to patients between January 1990 and April 1992, the NRC has found that most doses were not assayed for the Licensee in the Hospital's dose calibrator during that time. This willful failure to adhere to this requirement, as well as the willful false statements to the NRC during the inspection on April 6, 1992 and the April 7, 1992 telephone conversation, constitute violations of 10 CFR 35.53, 10 CFR 30.9, and 10 CFR 30.10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above, it appears that Dr. Bodian, the Licensee, engaged in deliberate misconduct that constitutes a violation of 10 CFR 30.10(a)(1) and that has caused the Licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR 35.53. It further appears that Dr. Bodian deliberately provided to NRC inspectors information that he knew to be incomplete or inaccurate in some respect material to the NRC, in violation of 10 CFR 30.09 and CFR 30.10(a)(2). Dr. Bodian has demonstrated an unwillingness to comply with Commission requirements. NRC must be able to rely on its licensees to comply with NRC requirements, including the requirement to provide complete and accurate information. Willful violations are of particular concern to the Commission because they undermine the Commission's reasonable assurance that licensed activities will be conducted in accordance with NRC requirements. Dr. Bodian's actions have raised serious doubt as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC. Consequently, protection of the public health, safety and interest require that Dr. Bodian be prohibited from engaging in NRC-licensed activities for a period of 5 years and to notify the NRC prior to resumption of any NRC-licensed activities at any facility after termination of the five year prohibition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In telephone conversations on July 18, 19, and 20, 1994, with Dr. Ronald R. Bellamy of the NRC Region I office, Dr. Bodian agreed not to be involved in any NRC-licensed activities for a period of five years, and to notify the NRC prior to resumption of any licensed activities at any facility after that five year prohibition. I find that the Dr. Bodian's commitments as set forth in that conversation are acceptable and necessary and conclude that with these commitments the protection of the public health and safety is reasonably assured. In view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health and safety require that the Dr. Bodian's commitments in the telephone conversations of July 18, 19, and 20, 1994 be confirmed by this Order. Dr. Bodian has agreed to this action. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I have also determined that the significance of the violations described above is such that the public health and safety require that this Order be immediately effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to section 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 30 and 35, It is hereby ordered that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. For a period of five years from the date of this Confirmatory Order, Jerome E. Bodian, M.D., shall not engage in any NRC-licensed activities. NRC-licensed activities are those activities which are conducted pursuant to a specific or general license issued by the NRC, including, but not limited to, those activities of Agreement State licenses conducted pursuant to the authority granted by 10 CFR 150.20. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. When, for the first time, Dr. Bodian is employed in NRC-licensed activities following the five year prohibition, he shall notify the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, 475 Allendale Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, within 20 days prior to engaging in NRC-licensed activities, including activities under an Agreement State license when activities under that license are conducted in areas of NRC jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20. The notice shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the NRC or Agreement State licensee and the location where licensed activities will be performed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director, Office of Enforcement, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon a showing by Dr. Bodian of good cause. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person adversely affected by this Confirmatory Order (Effective Immediately), other than Dr. Bodian, may request a hearing within 20 days of its issuance. Any request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, D.C. 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington D.C. 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, 475 Allendale Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, and to Dr. Bodian. If such a person requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his or her interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a hearing is requested by a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this Confirmatory Order (Effective Immediately) should be sustained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), any person adversely affected by this Order, other than Dr. Bodian, may, in addition to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness is not based on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or request for a hearing shall not stay the immediate effectiveness of this order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 8th day of September 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For The Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Hugh L.

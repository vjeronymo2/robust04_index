			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Warning on plan to buy N-arms THE UK needs to reassess its nuclear strategy in the light of new US nuclear non-proliferation policies, but the British government is not giving policy-makers enough information to evaluate the options. This is the conclusion of a report by the British American Security Information Council, an independent research organisation which analyses defence policy in Europe and North America, George Graham writes. The report warns that the UK's plans to upgrade its nuclear arsenal with modified US-built Trident II missiles, fitted with British warheads, are a hostage of the US nuclear debate. Planned British purchases of Trident II missiles could be called into question as a result of pressure in the US Congress to end production of unneeded Cold War weapons, while the UK's production of warheads remains heavily dependent on the US both for design and testing, the council says.</p>

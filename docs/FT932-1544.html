			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Zeneca By any standards, the 86 per cent take-up of Zeneca's rights issue must be judged a success. This is all the more so, given the sagging share price during the underwriting period. Since the underwriters and shareholders were much the same institutions, the issue was always an all-or-nothing affair. The overlap also left the company to sell the Pounds 1.3bn issue twice over. That may ultimately limit the capacity of the London market to handle large issues in the traditional way. A US-style book building might relieve the problem of capacity created by such a large issue, but is difficult to square with investors' pre-emption rights. As GPA might testify, book building does not offer much certainty as to the proceeds of the issue. But the success of Zeneca's issue does not hide the limitations of traditional underwriting. If rights issues get much bigger, the system may require refining.</p>

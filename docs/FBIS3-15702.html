In an  exclusive interview he told Interfax that by using its  constitutional right to declare an amnesty the Duma "hit Russian  society where it hurts. This will obviously stir up  confrontation processes in Russia."    In his words, "without legally evaluating the activities of  state criminals who were guilty of organizing the shelling of  the former Supreme Soviet, the Duma members and some senior  officials wanted to be rehabilitated in order to escape  responsibility. This action makes more confrontation and  destabilization possible with a view to removing the leading  political figures, Rutskoy, Khasbulatov and Makashov, with  simultaneous threat of retribution if these men stage a  comeback."    He forecast that "the next step will be an all-out assault  on  the Presidency. When nearly everybody tries to unseat him, the  Russian president will find it hard to stay in power. The  scenario of these activities includes neutralizing Premier  Viktor Chernomyrdin to be followed by discrediting and removing  him from the political scene."    The Chechen leader appreciated the stance of former  prosecutor general Aleksey Kazannik as that of a "courageous and  honest man who cannot trifle with the law even once."</p>

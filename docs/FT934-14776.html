			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Lufthansa employees win 2.5% pay rise THE first significant pay settlement in west Germany's 1994 wages round has resulted in an estimated annual increase of around 2.5 per cent for 49,000 Lufthansa employees. Following a 12-month freeze, during which prices rose by 4 per cent, the agreement signalled further real losses of earning power among the airline's workforce. The cost-of-living index is expected to rise 3.5 per cent during 1994. The deal, negotiated by the oTV public service union, increased expectations of a non-inflationary award for the country's 2.3m other public-sector workers. Negotiations are due to begin next month. Main elements of the Lufthansa package were a one-off payment of DM870 (Pounds 353.60) for the six months to the end of next March, followed by a general 2.7 per cent rise covering the period until September 31 1994. The agreement, reached quickly without any sign of conflict, prompted one analyst to forecast that settlements for the whole of west German industry would average less than 3 per cent. Meanwhile, chemicals industry employers yesterday continued their propaganda campaign, hammering home the message of severe difficulties and continuing job losses.</p>

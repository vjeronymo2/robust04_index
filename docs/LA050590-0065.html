			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REMOVING LENNON PHOTO FROM EXHIBIT A HUGE MISTAKE  </P> <P> Like a mythological Hydra -- cut off one head and two more grow -- censorship  is increasing apace. The most recent local example (at least in appearance but  contradicted by a museum spokeswoman) is the removal, and subsequent return, of  a photo depicting a naked, fetal-curled John Lennon lying next to a clothed  Yoko Ono, which had been selected for an art exhibit at the Muckenthaler  Cultural Center in Fullerton. ("Nude Photo of Lennon Removed in Fullerton,"  April 25.)  </P> <P> While I am indifferent toward the photo itself, and whether the cultural center  displays it or not, I am concerned about the museum trustees' usurped decision  of "perceived community concerns," which led to the photo's removal.  </P> <P> I am also disturbed about the local arts community's silence, except for a few  perfunctory squeaks.  </P> <P> Where were the public comments from Orange County's artists, performers and  writers? The dearth of reaction from professionals, arts organizations and  museums only serves to reinforce the "little ado in Orange County" attitude  that accompanied a recent Times article about the lack of local response to the  controversy surrounding artistic content and funding for the National Endowment  for the Arts.  </P> <P> In contrast to arts organizations across the United States that are picking up  the gauntlet against the encroachment of subtle restrictions and outright  censorship, members of Orange County's arts community were quoted as being "too  busy," among other things, to be actively involved in the issue.  </P> <P> Can we afford the portent of such complacency?  </P> <P> No. Waiting until we aren't too busy (which never happens), or until we have a  reason to act (i.e., when we are finally directly affected by censorship) is  dangerous and shortsighted.  </P> <P> Dangerous because our apathy allows others to make choices for us. Shortsighted  because through our inaction we have permitted the self-appointed monitors of  morality and taste to lay a foundation for future restraints in other areas of  our lives.  </P> <P> Tacit approval clings to silence that is maintained in the face of decisions  made by "guardians" of what we will see, hear or read.  </P> <P> The point has been made more than once in recent months that as the countries  of Eastern Europe and Latin America approach greater freedom of movement and  free expression, we in the United States are, paradoxically, tightening  (through evermore refined means) the restrictions on our own rights.  </P> <P> The incidents at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center reflect more than just the  removal of a photograph in a moment of poor judgment. It mirrors growing forces  that are determined to curtail personal choice, and not just in the arts.  </P> <P> We should all be more aware and more engaged in issues affecting our right to  exercise freedom of choice. If not us, who? If not now, when?  </P> <P> JANET E. GRAEBNER, Santa Ana  </P></p>

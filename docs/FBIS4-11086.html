			<p>BFN     [Text] During the provincial meeting to summarize the  workers parliaments in Matanzas Province, Ricardo Alarcon de  Quesada, president of the National Assembly of the People's  Government, stated that only the people can work economic  miracles. Alarcon stated that no law can accomplish the miracles  that the people can with their resistance and popular struggle  toward the established objectives, and predicted that practice  will show how the Cuban people are capable of overcoming this  difficult period.    The attendants at the meeting learned about the main  measures  presented by the workers of Matanzas Province, which include the  reorganization of the domestic economy, profitability of the  industrial sector, elimination of inappropriate subsidies, and  generalized efficiency.</p>

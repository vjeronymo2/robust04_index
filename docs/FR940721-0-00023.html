Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> a. Statutory Origins of This Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule regarding child booster seats responds to the NHTSA Authorization Act of 1991 (sections 2500&hyph;2509 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (``ISTEA''), Pub. L. 102&hyph;240), which directed the agency to initiate rulemaking on child booster seat safety and other issues. This rule was preceded by an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) published on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22682), and an NPRM published on September 3, 1993 (58 FR 46928).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ISTEA directive on booster seats originated in S. 1012, a bill reported by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and added verbatim to the Senate's surface transportation bill (S. 1204). The Senate Commerce Committee report on S. 1012 expressed concern about suggestions that booster seats, ``depending on their design, can be easily misused or are otherwise harmful,'' and that some child booster seats ``may not restrain adequately a child in a crash.'' The Committee's concerns grew out of a study <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  performed by Calspan Corporation. Calspan found that then-manufactured booster seats could adequately restrain the 3-year-old (33 pound) test dummy that is used to test the seats for compliance with Standard 213. However, Calspan also found that when the booster seats were tested with a 9-month-old and a 6-year-old test dummy, the booster seats could not adequately restrain those dummies. Yet, the booster seats were recommended by their manufacturers as being suitable for children in the 9-month-old and 6-year-old weight ranges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Evaluation of the Performance of Child Restraint Systems'' (DOT HS 807 297, May 1988). NHTSA's follow-up testing to the Calspan study is discussed in ``Evaluation of Booster Seat Suitability for Children of Different Ages and Comparison of Standard and Modified SA103C and SA106C Child Dummies,'' VRTC&hyph;89&hyph;0074, February 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Calspan study indicated that booster seat safety could be improved if booster seats were capable of properly restraining the wide range of manufacturers' recommended child sizes. Belt-positioning booster seats are capable of accommodating a wider range of child sizes than currently manufactured shield-type booster seats. Moreover, belt-positioning seats used with vehicle lap/shoulder belts appear to perform better than shield booster seats used with vehicle lap/shoulder belts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the ISTEA directive, NHTSA issued two notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRM's). The first addressed booster seat performance and labeling requirements; the second, dummies for use in testing booster seats and other child restraint systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> b. Booster NPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA proposed to amend Standard No. 213,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Child Restraint Systems,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to facilitate the manufacture of ``belt-positioning'' child seats (boosters designed to be used with the vehicle's lap/shoulder belts). The NPRM would add a definition of ``belt-positioning seat'' to the standard, and amend the definition of ``booster seat'' to include belt-positioning booster seats. Standard 213's compliance test procedures would be amended to specify that belt-positioning seats are dynamically tested when restrained to the test apparatus with a lap/shoulder belt. The NPRM described the test apparatus in detail to ensure that the test would be carefully controlled. NHTSA also proposed to amend labeling and informational requirements to decrease the likelihood that belt-positioning booster seats would be misused. The agency believed that the proposed performance and labeling requirements would be more appropriate than Standard 213's current criteria for these boosters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> c. Dummy NPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA also issued an NPRM to add additional child compliance test dummies to Standard 213. (59 FR 12225, March 16, 1994.) The NPRM tentatively selected three new child dummies to add to Standard 213. These dummies are the newborn infant dummy described in subpart K of 49 CFR part 572 (NHTSA's regulation on anthropomorphic test dummies), the 9-month-old dummy in subpart J, and the instrumented 6-year-old dummy in subpart I. Subjecting booster seats and other child restraint systems to more thorough compliance testing with additional dummies better ensures that each child restraint safely restrains the range of children for whom the restraint is recommended. (Readers should note that, if proposals from the March 1994 NPRM are adopted, those amendments could modify some of the requirements adopted today, such as the labeling specified for booster seats.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> d. Overview of Comments on Booster NPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The response to the NPRM was very favorable. Commenters included vehicle and child seat manufacturers (Volvo, Ford, Chrysler and Cosco) and child passenger groups and consultants (Tarrant County Child Car Safety Coalition, Solutions Unlimited, the University of Michigan-Child Passenger Protection Program (UM&hyph;CPP), Ms. Deborah Davis Stewart, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety). Commenters also included the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Air Transport Association and the National Transportation Safety Board. All commenters supported permitting the manufacture of belt-positioning booster seats. Many suggested changes about specific proposals, and several had suggestions for or commented on future work on belt-positioning and other booster seats. All comments were fully considered and the significant ones are addressed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

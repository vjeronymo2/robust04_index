			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Observer: Berlin exeat One has to commend Britain's diplomatic corps on its timing. Just in time for the Queen's visit to Berlin today, the British embassy is downgrading the importance of its Berlin outpost. It has announced that it intends to stop issuing visas and passports from its Berlin office from the start of November. In future all applications will be handled by the British consulate-general in Dusseldorf, who resides 460km from Berlin as the crow flies. Somehow that does not conform with the official German position that Berlin is to become the working capital of Germany within the next five to seven years. It sounds more as though the Foreign Office is convinced, along with a good many German politicians in the Rhineland, that parliament and the German government will remain in Bonn until well into the next decade. Dusseldorf is only 70 km down the Rhine from Bonn.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Macintosh licensing scheme from Apple Apple Computer plans an expansion through the phased licensing of its Macintosh personal computer software to other PC companies. Initially, Apple will license its core 'Mac OS' and elements of its PowerPC hardware design which until now has been unique to its own PC products, to companies that are not direct competitors. These will include companies where Apple has limited distribution; and those whose technical expertise can add value, such as making computers for specific applications. Already 'about six companies' have signed licensing agreements, Apple said, but refused to identify the licensees other than to say that they are equally divided between the US, Europe and Asia. Industry analysts have speculated that some of Apple's direct competitors, including IBM, might be interested in licensing the Macintosh software if the terms were favourable. Apple's failure to license the Macintosh software in the late 1980s is seen by critics as a serious strategic blunder because it allowed Microsoft, the world's largest software company, to establish its Windows PC operating system as the industry standard, and industry analysts said Apple's move now is 'too little, too late'. Apple's share of the PC market has slipped to about 10 per cent in the face of intense competition from companies such as Compaq Computer offering PCs with Windows software.</p>

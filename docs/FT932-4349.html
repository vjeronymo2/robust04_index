			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Survey of Sheffield (4): Restructured steel industry cuts costs - The city's traditional manufacturing sector has greatly improved productivity AS befits the director of marketing and product development of British Steel, Raymond Douglas is fierce advocate of his industry. 'Contrary to popular belief,' he growls, 'the steel industry has not, and I repeat not, collapsed in Sheffield.' He is also Master Cutler this year - for ceremonial purposes the symbolic embodiment of Sheffield manufacturing. 'The last peak in steel production here was 1942. There were 176 furnaces and they produced 1.9m tonnes. Last year we made 2.25m tonnes out of seven furnaces,' he says. Why people think steelmaking collapsed was because of the loss of jobs from 1974 as the industry restructured. In 12 years of turmoil, eight large companies closed, creating instant dereliction in a third of the Lower Don Valley, a seven-mile stretch of industrial history. At least 18,000 jobs were lost in the valley alone and Sheffield's unemployment rate was more than quadrupled to 18 per cent. Small wonder people thought Sheffield's steel industry had gone the way of Corby's, Scunthorpe's or Consett's. Last year's production proves otherwise, but tells only half the story, for the 2.25m tonnes from seven furnaces were produced with only one-eighth of the labour force it would have taken 20 years ago. Reconstruction continues. In the last 12 months, British Steel Stainless has merged with Avesta, the Swedish producer, to form Avesta Sheffield. The new company is bidding for European leadership, claiming a wider range of grades and products than any competitor. Meanwhile, United Engineering Steels, with plant at Stocksbridge and nearby Rotherham, is larger than Thyssen and Krupp in this sector, producing high integrity steels for the aerospace, power generation and automotive industries. Inevitably, recession is hurting. Mr Douglas says: 'Everyone is going flat out, but prices have dropped 30 per cent in two years. We are surviving only because we are now the lowest-cost steel producers in the world.' There is a large element of vertical integration in Sheffield's steel industry, with steel makers supplying local steel processors. Restructuring has ensured their survival, despite uncontrollable outside economic factors. Mr William Cook, chairman of Andrew Cook, which makes steel castings, adds: 'Had it not been for our ejection from the ERM we would have been in desperate trouble. 'About 80 per cent of my products are exported, either directly or indirectly in things like construction or mining equipment, power generation plant, offshore oil equipment, fork lift trucks or general engineering products.' Sales have gone from Pounds 135m at their 1980s peak down to Pounds 100m now. Cook's jobs peak was 3,300 in 1989-90. It now employs 1,900. 'We are down from 15 plant to seven and looking at reducing to five. And we are definitely getting rid of another 500 jobs in the next 18 months,' Mr Cook warns. Sheffield Forgemasters, which was bought by its management five years ago and now has 400-employee shareholders but no debts, has invested more since 1988 than it did in the previous ten years. The effect has been startling. The company has 1,700 people now, compared with 7,500 in 1982, but it produces up to 30 per cent more. Wages were 50 per cent of total turnover in 1982, but are under 25 per cent now. Despite job losses, however, Forgemasters has never stopped taking on apprentices. As one of few companies left in the world which can cast 300-tonne pieces and produce huge machined components weighing 120 tonnes, Forgemasters is also scoring in export markets, despite 200 per cent overcapacity in its sector. Mr Philip Wright, chief executive, says: 'On exports, you have to be accepted technically before you can get further. 'The first order is critical. It's why we have put so much into improving manufacturing. We now simulate and rehearse manufacturing before we actually do it. We try to eliminate variability in processing. 'We have a 90-point check list now, where there was no check list at all previously. Defects cost us Pounds 5m a year in the past and are probably under Pounds 1m a year now.' The payoff is showing most in Germany, where the company now has 50 per cent of the ingots market, having started from zero four years ago. Aurora, now owned by Australian National Industries, also exemplifies Sheffield's metamorphosis. It takes billets from Stocksbridge and turns then into specialised forgings which are now economically priced because of a Pounds 27m investment programme over the last four years. Mr Eric Brightmore, managing director, says Aurora has slimmed down to a core business of forgings and castings in steel and superalloys, distribution, metal melting, processing and specialist engineering. 'We shed construction-related companies and pulled back from Pounds 156m turnover to Pounds 70m, but we created units with bigger critical mass,' he says. Sales are now running at Pounds 80m a year, with profits at Pounds 7m  -the same as in 1978 when the group was bigger. Exports have doubled to Pounds 20m in six years. The human cost, however, has been about 1,800 jobs since peak, with only 1,200 employed now. Among these big players, however, Sheffield still has room for the small, niche-market specialist. Mr Noel Edwards, chairman of Barworth Flockton, is typical. His family company - his son Richard has just succeeded him as managing director - makes high-value special steels and does hire work for others, turning their ingots into billets and billets into bars. It turns over Pounds 8m but employs 350 people. The 200 in the main factory been working round the clock in three shifts, flat out, throughout the recession. Mr Edwards' only concession to downturn was to postpone a new Pounds 4m rolling mill from GFM of Austria, but it is now being installed. He sold on quality before Britain left the ERM, but can now undercut foreign competitors as well, so he is exporting 30 per cent of output. Only one thing concerns him - downturn in Germany. In that, however, he is not alone. Every single one of his bigger brethren is at least equally worried. Their industry has put Sheffield through a terrible ordeal to become internationally competitive - only to find its most crucial European export market heading for trouble.</p>

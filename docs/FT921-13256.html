			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clark advises on private hearing for MoD expert - Trade and Industry Committee THE Ministry of Defence was yesterday believed to be insisting that an official who interviewed suppliers of parts for the Iraqi 'supergun', due to appear before the Commons trade and industry committee today, be allowed to give evidence in private. Mr Alan Clark, defence procurement minister, was summoned before the committee yesterday to discuss the testimony of Mr Bill Weir, an MoD materials expert. A decision would not be made until this morning, Mr Ken Warren (C Hastings and Rye), chairman of the committee, said. Mr Warren said he was taking Mr Clark's advice on whether the inquiry risked straying into areas of 'classified information'. Officials of Walter Somers, the Midlands-based metallurgical company, yesterday admitted to the committee that the company had had two separate contracts with Iraq for the supply of 10-metre tubes, and not one as previously thought. The company believed both were for a petrochemical project, but it now appears the first tubes were for a scaled-down prototype of the Iraqi supergun, codenamed Project Babylon, designed to launch satellites into space. The second was for an artillery adaptation. The two phases of the project were described to the committee last week by Dr Christopher Cowley, a metallurgist who worked with Canadian arms expert Dr Gerald Bull on the design of the supergun.</p>

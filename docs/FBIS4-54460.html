			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Gregor Martin Papucsek from </F> Budapest]    [Excerpts] Last night's dialogue between the Slovak and  Hungarian prime ministers was not in vain. At least they  established which of the problems were of greater importance.  One of these problems is the so-called basic treaty, which  contains a clause on the unalterability of the border. This is  what Peter Boross said when responding to my question about  whether the Hungarian side allowed itself be convinced by Jozef  Moravcik's arguments:    [Begin Boross recording, in Hungarian with superimposed  translation into Slovak] Given the complexity of this issue and  the type of talks we have had, we were unable to reach a final  agreement. This, of course, does not counter our intention to  examine all the issues, systematically and as a part of a  consistent dialogue. But that requires a lot of time. We must  adopt a realistic attitude when solving difficult issues. [end  recording]    Since we want to adopt a realistic attitude, the first thing  we could agree on is the opening of new border crossings. True,  the prime ministers failed both to define specific crossings and  to set specific dates. But the Slovak side does not link this  issue with the readmission agreement, as was the case until the  recent past. Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik said:    [Begin Moravcik recording] We discussed the readmission  agreement (?before). We do not link the conclusion of this  agreement with border crossings. We indicated the ways in which  existing differences in views on both sides can be overcome.  There is a need for more talks with other states, so that the  stream of people coming from other countries, particularly from  Germany, would not be halted in either country. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ascension Reyes R.] </F>   [Excerpts] Consistent with the constitutional norm,  Comptroller General of the Republic Ramon Escovar Salom has  submitted the annual report of the operations of the Office of  the Comptroller General of the Republic to the officers of the  Congress. He noted on this occasion that during his first year  in office, he had said that a true state of law had not  developed in Venezuela and that the citizens remained  vulnerable, lacking efficient institutions to protect them.    He emphasized that while reorganizing his department,  autonomy for the Office of the Attorney General was achieved,  and now neither the executive branch, the political parties, nor  economic pressure groups are able to exert any influence upon it.    In connection with the battle against corruption, he said  that pioneering work was done. The results achieved included the  prosecution of a president of the Republic in office and his  consequent removal from government office. In this connection,  the courts issued about 700 arrest warrants between 1989 and  1993, and they ordered civil prosecution in cases involving  crimes against public property amounting to more than a billion  bolivares.    In connection with the Recadi case and the export bonds  alone, about 6,000 prosecutions were initiated by the Office of  the Comptroller, and a total of 228 arrest warrants were  obtained.    On this point, this official said that "it is absolutely  essential to encourage the proper participation on the part of  each of the sectors and bodies involved in the decisive battle  being waged against the scourge of corruption. The task is not a  simple one. It is possible to combat this evil. It can be  reduced to much smaller dimensions if this problem is approached  on an integral basis, with sincerity, and with an iron  determination on the part of all to reduce it." [passage omitted]    The defense of human rights as a factor limiting the  exercise  of power, and in particular, the civil and political rights  whose enjoyment and exercise are basic to the survival of the  state, merit separate consideration.    The comptroller general pointed out that defense of the  civil  and political rights of the citizens is vital to the maintenance  of a solid democratic system.    He believes that reflection upon the two military uprisings  in 1992 is necessary, since it has been a consistent requirement  of the administration that the military authorities allow  inspectors access to the military penal establishments so that  they can verify that the human rights of the citizens subject to  this jurisdiction are being respected.    It has been established that there have been violations of  the laws pertaining to citizens' rights by agents of the various  police bodies. This official did not fail to note the actions of  the agents of state security against the journalists  investigating the origins of these incidents, and it was for  this reason that he appealed to the MRI [Ministry of the  Interior] to ensure respect for the right to free information.    On the penitentiary issue, it was noted that the level of  external and internal security at penal establishments has a  direct effect on the exercise by the inmates of their human  rights. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Economic Rights </H5>   It is the opinion of the comptroller general that the Office  of the Attorney General should be expanded with a view to  undertaking the defense of the economic rights of the citizens.  He emphasized that this need has become more obvious in view of  the government intervention in the Banco Latino.    "This shows how basic it is for an institution like the  Office of the Attorney General to be concerned with the defense  and oversight of the economic rights of the citizens."    The comptroller general warned that the intensity of the  battle against corruption must be maintained, because in large  part the progress that has been made has to do with public  opinion and the role played by the media, since they have joined  as allies in this struggle.    He believes that it is necessary to undertake more profound  actions to recover the illicit funds that are located outside  the national territory. These actions should include civil suits  for the recovery of more than a billion bolivares in order to  effect restitution for the losses caused to the public assets.    This can be done, he said, if the actions and legal  mechanisms for pursuing investigations abroad are coordinated.</p>

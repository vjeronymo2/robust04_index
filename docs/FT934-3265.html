			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Matsushita Electric to move 6,000 staff in restructuring Matsushita Electric yesterday announced a big restructuring in which it plans to transfer 6,000 employees from administrative jobs to those directly related to production, sales and new business development. Matsushita said 30 per cent of its administrative workforce, or about 20,000 employees, would be transferred out of their current jobs during the next three years. They will go to sales and new business development. At a year-end gathering with the press yesterday, Mr Yoichi Morishita, president, said the restructuring was essential to revitalise the company in the face of a severe economic climate. Under the restructuring, to be implemented in February, the functions and structure of the company's headquarters in Osaka will also be revamped. Development divisions will be restructured to find and develop new technologies more efficiently. The move by the world's largest consumer electronics group is aimed at trimming its administrative operations and using its workforce more effectively. It comes as the consumer electronics industry faces one of the worst downturns in its history, compounded by growing pressures to move a larger part of manufacturing overseas to cope with the sharp rise of the yen. Matsushita's restructuring plan also highlights the difficulty the group is having in coming up with innovative products to stimulate sluggish consumer demand. While a large number of Japanese companies are struggling to adapt their corporate structures to a tougher new era, Matsushita, in particular, has been widely criticised for being bloated and bureaucratic. The company employs 90,000 people in Japan and 250,000 worldwide. Earlier this year, Mr Akio Tanii suddenly resigned as president following a financial scandal. The event was seen by many in the industry as stemming from Matsushita's excessively large and complex organisational structure. Profits have also been poor. In the year ended March, Matsushita reported a 54 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, to Y168.4bn (Dollars 1.6bn), the second year of a sharp decline. Following a cool summer, which hit sales of air conditioning equipment, the economy has remained flat.</p>

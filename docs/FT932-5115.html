			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: GBE makes the market at its second attempt  -Richard Gourlay on Robert Newman's latest deal GBE International, which this week secured passage to a stock exchange listing through the reverse takeover of Downiebrae, a shell company, was within a whisker of floating four years ago. At that time it had more than half its sales in China and was almost totally dependent on tobacco companies buying leaf processing equipment. Then GBE, a management buy-out from AMF International in 1986, had a rude shock. Within a matter of months the Tiananmen Square massacre decimated its Chinese market. At the same time RJR Nabisco, under Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, slashed capital spending and BAT, under attack from Sir James Goldsmith's Hoylake, also tightened its grip on the purse strings. The issue was pulled. Venture capitalists who had been pressing for an exit through a trade sale, were therefore delighted this week with the arrival of Downiebrae and its largest shareholder, Mr Robert Newman. The deal involves the sale of GBE to Downiebrae for Pounds 22m, satisfied by the issue to the vendors of 36.7m shares of which 24.9m are being placed and a further 7.78m offered to existing Downiebrae shareholders in a 4-for-9 rights issue. The new company will have a stock market valuation of not less than Pounds 31m when its shares resume trading after the June 28 annual meeting. Mr Newman, an acquisitions specialist and former colleague of Sir Edward du Cann at Keyser Ullman, the failed merchant bank, has been making a name for himself recently. Last year he and a partner bought The Sanctuary, the women's health club in London's Covent Garden. And he has recently become managing director and part owner of Thomas Goode, the prestigious glassware and antiques shop in South Audley Street, London. Of GBE, he says that unlike some professional investors in shell companies he has no intention of taking an active management role. A self-proclaimed dealer in, rather than manager of, businesses, Mr Newman will act as a consultant and hopes to bring further acquisitions to GBE. It is not Mr Newman's first involvement in Downiebrae. Just before the 1987 stock market crash he was part of a consortium that injected Pounds 2.5m to take a 48 per cent stake and seek similar deals. The stake was sold after the crash but it is unlikely he could have found a company quite like GBE, which last year made Pounds 2.25m from sales of Pounds 34.7m. In addition to selling tobacco processing equipment from its base in Andover, Hampshire, GBE has a foothold in the potentially lucrative market for environmental control equipment. Under licence from Wheelabrator, now part of Waste Management Inc of the US, GBE sells two processes which treat acid gases emitted from the incineration of liquid sewage. Severn Trent, the water company, is installing the equipment and Mr Gerald Edwards, GBE chairman before and after this takeover, says the company has quoted for 12 contracts worth Pounds 50m. EC regulations restricting the dumping of sewage at sea should mean 12m tonnes needs to be disposed of, Mr Edwards says. Incineration is a way of reducing the amount of landfill required for this disposal.</p>

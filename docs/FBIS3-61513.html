Ye. Kiriyenkov, and N. V. </F> Gerasimovich, Institute of Radiobiology, Belarus Academy of  Sciences, Minsk, under the rubric ``Investigation of the  Sequelae of the Chernobyl Disaster''; UDC 574:538.1.04]    [Abstract]Experiments were carried out on rats kept in the  10-km zone of the Chernobyl disaster (flood plain of the Pripyat  River) for one month, exposed at dose rates of 20 mR/h.  Radionuclides were assayed in the perfused isolated heart right  after the exposure period and 6 months later, and findings were  compared to control rats that were not exposed to radioactivity.  Records were kept of heart rate, systolic, diastolic pressure,  rate of rise and drop of pressure, and volumetric blood flow  rate. The membrane filtration method, with [.sup]3[/]  H-alprenol hydrochloride and propranolol  antagonists, was used to test _b_-adrenoreceptors, with  determination of specificity, binding sites and hormone affinity  of the receptor. The experimental group of rats showed changes  in amount, structural and functional properties of  _b_-adrenoreceptors of the myocardium. Rate of contraction of  the isolated heart and volumetric coronary flow diminished 6  months after exposure. It can be assumed that restoration of  _b_-receptor density after 6 months and their affinity for  agonists is related to impaired interaction of  _b_-adrenoreceptors and N protein. The functional state of the  heart did not change with 30-day exposure to the contaminated  zone, but there was alteration of mechanisms of its adrenergic  regulation.

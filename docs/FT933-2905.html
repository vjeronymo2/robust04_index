			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Select Industries heads for USM with Pounds 13m price tag SELECT Industries is seeking to have all of its issued fully paid ordinary shares introduced to the USM. The introduction of the 84.4m such shares at about 8p will value Select at about Pounds 12.5m. This includes the group's partly paid shares. Select's main operating subsidiary, AirBoss Ground Engagement, makes a puncture-proof wheel and tyre system for use in the construction equipment market. It has exclusive rights to distribute in Europe, Israel, Turkey and former Warsaw Pact countries, including Russia. Mr Edward Vandyk, Select's chief executive, said the group's shares had been traded under Rule 535 (2) on a matched bargain basis since mid-1991. In early 1992 various institutions had underwritten a Pounds 5.3m rights issue and the group had pledged a move to a more senior market when it was practicable. A full listing, at any rate only possible after three years' trading, is planned for January 31 1995. This is when the 143m partly paid shares the group has issued will become fully paid. These shares of 7.5p are paid as to 2.5p. The 5p balance is payable in two equal parts on January 31 1994 and January 31 1995. The payments on the partly paid shares - about Pounds 7.1m - will finance the development and marketing of the range of AirBoss wheel sizes. Turnover in the first half of 1993 was Pounds 311,000, up 45 per cent on the corresponding period.</p>

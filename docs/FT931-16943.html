			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Observer: Yesterday's man Ever since Bob Heller gave up running Management Today, the flagship magazine in Michael Heseltine's Haymarket Publishing Group, Britain's top management magazine has been turning over its editors faster than most companies change finance directors. However, Tom Lloyd's tenure in the editorial chair - a mere 10 weeks - must set some sort of record for short service. Lloyd, who has written several management books and edited the now defunct Financial Weekly, told the UK Press Gazette that he didn't feel that he 'had a mandate to edit'. Admittedly, the recession has taken a heavy toll on business magazines, but Lloyd's departure doesn't seem to have been linked to poor financial performance. Rather it sounds as if he was slow in making the sort of changes that his new masters wanted. Dennis Hackett, the new editor, is a veteran magazine man rather than management guru.

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Technology: Offices follow the factory's example Gains in office productivity could rival those achieved in manufacturing if a new approach, known as business process redesign (BPR), succeeds. The rationale behind BPR is that concepts like Japan's 'best manufacturing practice', which uses just-in-time techniques, can be applied to the office as well as the factory. In manufacturing, physical layout is important because moving materials around can be costly. In the office, delays in dealing with important documents occur because they pass between too many people, departments or offices. 'BPR looks at the targets which the business wants to reach and works backwards to design the processes necessary to achieve them,' says Judith Wainwright of the London-based consultancy Pagoda. 'It is a way of simplifying the workflow, by reducing the number of stages involved in a procedure.' Western Provident Association (WPA), the UK's third largest health insurer, has made productivity improvements of 38 per cent from BPR. 'Processing an application for health insurance used to involve seven staff and take 28 days,' says Julian Stainton, managing director. It now takes one person only four days. This includes reviewing the medical history, setting up the policy and arranging to collect the money from the customer's bank account. In addition, the file was only worked on for 45 minutes during the 28 days (the rest of the time it was in transit). Now it is held on a computer and takes just minutes to be processed. Like many companies which opt for business process redesign, WPA uses a combination of image processing and workflow software to speed up re- engineered procedures. Image processing involves capturing a complete image of a document (including signatures and graphics) on a computer. Workflow software automatically forwards the document image on to the relevant worker when it is time for the next action to be carried out. BPR is gaining respect as companies look for new ways of raising productivity and cutting costs. Delegates to a recent conference on the subject attracted companies such as BP, Thomas Cook, Abbey National, Glaxo, and Midland Bank. According to US researchers International Data Corporation (IDC), BPR will be 'the next high-growth frontier for information technology service companies,' with a compound annual growth rate of 46 per cent a year. One attraction of BPR is that it makes IT subordinate to business objectives. 'The most mature processes take a lot of IT investment to improve, but in most cases 80 per cent of the value of BPR comes out of examining the way things are organised. Only 20 per cent comes from IT,' says Paul Chapman, director of business and organisation at the National &amp; Provincial building society. BPR often evolves out of a 'total quality management' initiative. Rank Xerox, a UK pioneer in business process redesign, took TQM as far as it could but found that it still was not meeting customer needs. Rob Walker, Rank Xerox's director of business management systems and quality, started to apply techniques similar to BPR which he had come across in Japan in the 1980s. As a result, many of the company's processes now take substantially less time. Specialised individual contracts (for customers requiring, say, special payment or leasing terms) take less than two days to process instead of 100. George Newman, IDC's US director of services research, estimates that the worldwide market for BPR will be worth Dollars 2.2bn by 1996. 'BPR is the high ground where the expertise of IT supplier, management and consultancies overlap,' he says.</p>

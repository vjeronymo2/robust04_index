			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME AWAY FROM HOME;  </P> <P> A QUIET BEACH  </P> <P> The sea laps endlessly onto the rock-bound beaches of Kobe, Japan, where Nobuko  Nabeshima was born -- and lived until she was 20.  </P> <P> "The water had a strong power; it soothed me as I grew up and I walked close to  it all the time," Nabeshima says.  </P> <P> Even now, 10 years after she left, Nabeshima thinks of those rocky,  seaweed-filled beaches whenever she longs for home.  </P> <P> Especially at New Year's, which she says is "a very big family-get-together day  in Japan, just like Thanksgiving and Christmas in America."  </P> <P> When she moved to West Los Angeles, just minutes from the shore, Nabeshima said  she realized the beaches weren't at all like home. "At Santa Monica or Venice,  the beaches are just sand. It doesn't even smell like the ocean."  </P> <P> Then she discovered Zuma, where "there are rocks and seaweed and an ocean  smell. And the configuration is more like home."  </P> <P> Nabeshima, a linguistics student and part-time intern at a sound studio, says  she has "very many good friends in Los Angeles," and always gets more holiday  invitations than she can handle. "But somehow, I would rather be alone at Zuma  Beach.  </P> <P> "I like that it's the Pacific Ocean. So at the end of it is Japan. I sometimes  think I can almost see my homeland on a clear day. And just to think that this  water may have touched my beach at home, that it goes back and forth to my  land" makes her feel less homesick and more "in touch" with home.  </P> <P> Nabeshima says, "When I feel the need, I usually go (to Zuma) at early morning  or twilight. And I just sit. I bring a pot of hot coffee and my radio so I can  listen to my favorite baroque music."  </P> <P> At New Year's, especially, she gets up early in the morning and "it's just me  and my car all alone on the Pacific Coast Highway. There's no traffic at that  hour on New Year's Day. In Japan right now, it's the snowy season. But here it  is the most beautiful time of year."  </P> <P> Late afternoon at Zuma, she says, offers "the most beautiful sunsets you will  ever see. The sun goes down right over the ocean. A lot of people in Los  Angeles don't even notice; they say Los Angeles has no seasons. But they're  wrong. You can see the change of season by the sunset. In summer, it goes down  over a totally different place."  </P> <P> Nabeshima says she "really appreciates" the beauty of Zuma. "When you're very  upset, it's fabulous medicine. When you're homesick, it energizes you and makes  you feel whole. That repetition, the come-and-go of the tides, gives you power,  because that is basically our lives. A day comes and it goes. It is not a  boring thing at all. Uniqueness can be found in common things."  </P> <P> And a trip to Kobe can be found on the Zuma strand. BETTIJANE LEVINE  </P></p>

They spent a long time preparing to catch the drugs  manufacturers. A KRIM-PRESS correspondent was told by Vasiliy  Varlamov, a staffer at the Tatarstan Internal Affairs Ministry  press center, that, having developed an original method, with no  analogue abroad, for obtaining a very powerful  narcotic--trimetilfentonil [as transliterated] (China white),  the criminals shipped it from Russia to Azerbaijan and beyond.    During the investigation new facts are continuing to be  uncovered and additional arrests made.    A new type of crime is on the rise in Tatarstan: Over the  past year 300 people have been arrested in the republic.  Confiscated from them were 400 kg of poppy stems, 10 kg of  grass [zelenaya massa konopli], 15 kg of marijuana, 90 kg of  opium, and medicines containing narcotic substances. The most  terrible aspect of crime of this type is the participation of  juveniles, who make up one tenth of those arrested.</p>

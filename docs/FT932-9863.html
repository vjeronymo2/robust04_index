A third umpire in a box at the Oval cricket ground in south London had the sound of leather against willow, synonymous with the summer sport, relayed to him by two-way radio while he watched the match on a TV monitor. The on-field umpires at yesterday's match between Surrey and Lancashire could refer close run-out or stumping decisions to Mr Allan Jones, their colleague in the stand.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAMBLING'S FALL: YOU CAN BET ON IT;  </P> <P> AS LEGAL GAMES BURROW INTO OUR LIVES, PUBLIC WILL CALL A HALT  </P> <P> It was a lemonade stand of the '90s: In a suburb of San Diego, the little girl  had set up her sidewalk card table with a pitcher, glasses and a box filled  with numbered slips. "Cold lemonade, only $1, " she said, adding, "buy one and  get a chance to win our big prize -- $25."  </P> <P> The only thing missing was the sign "Void where prohibited by law."  </P> <P> Oregon and Kentucky will begin taking bets on National Football League games  this fall. No one in either state lottery commission sees the irony, or the  danger, in basing the games on point spreads set by Nevada oddsmakers.  </P> <P> A third wave of legal gambling is sweeping the country. Twice before in  American history, gambling was legal virtually everywhere, only to come  crashing down.  </P> <P> The American colonies were awash in legal gambling. Lotteries were more common  than today. But by the 1820s and '30s, well-publicized scandals and a surge of  moral crusading brought lotteries into such disrepute that they were outlawed  virtually everywhere.  </P> <P> The second wave came with the Civil War and the expansion of the Western  frontier. Licensed casinos dominated the heart of Gold Rush San Francisco and  tickets for the infamous Louisiana Lottery were sold in every city. Again,  scandals and Victorian morality spelled the end. In 1910, New York closed its  race tracks. Even Nevada outlawed all forms of gambling.  </P> <P> The third wave began with the Depression. In the 1930s, Nevada re-legalized  casinos and 21 states opened race tracks. New Hampshire rediscovered the state  lottery in 1963.  </P> <P> Today, 27 states have off-track betting. Mailboxes are stuffed with "You May  Already Be a Winner" sweepstakes.  </P> <P> Gambling has come back to the stock market for the first time since the Great  Crash of 1929, with similar results, when Congress overrode state laws to  legalize trading in stock index futures.  </P> <P> Small-stakes charity bingo has grown into million-dollar Indian satellite  bingo, vending machines selling pull-tabs and, in states like Maryland,  three-reel slot machines. In 14 states, charities run full-scale casinos.  </P> <P> And then there are the state lotteries.  </P> <P> Lottery tickets are the only consumer products actively promoted and sold by  the state. The state does not sell toothpaste, or even promote brushing your  teeth. But it tells people they should gamble. The main marketing concern is  how to attract new players, who otherwise wouldn't gamble.  </P> <P> Lotteries were made legal because of the old argument: "People are going to  gamble anyway -- better for government to get the money than organized crime."  Why, then, is any form of gambling allowed to advertise, particularly one run  by the state? If making money is the goal, why doesn't the state own  restaurants, or open its own brothels?  </P> <P> Legal gambling's problem is that it has become too respectable. The state with  the most forms of legal gambling is Iowa, not exactly a bastion of hedonism.  Iowa already has a state lottery and on- and off-track betting on both dogs and  horses, and has legalized, beginning in 1990, riverboat casinos with slot  machines.  </P> <P> But the pendulum will swing back; in America, gambling eventually  self-destructs.  </P> <P> It is difficult to predict the exact scenario of the coming boom and bust, but  the short-term prediction is easy: more gambling.  </P> <P> Gambling begets gambling. Once the churches and states started their own games  they lost the right to say that gambling is immoral. Everything became a  cost/benefit analysis, and gambling makes money.  </P> <P> Most people buy lottery tickets only for a while. States are constantly forced  to come up with more promotions and new games. Competition for the gambling  dollar is fierce and players always want games that are faster and easier, with  at least the illusion of player participation. Eventually we will see video  poker machines and lottery terminals in every store.  </P> <P> The end will come when the general population says, "This is too much." We like  our gambling isolated to tourist areas like Las Vegas, not infringing on our  "real" life.  </P> <P> The crash will be triggered by scandals, inevitable given the cash involved.  State lotteries, the most heavily regulated, honest businesses in America, have  already been rigged by insiders.  </P> <P> Sports betting will speed the fall. Think of the message that the state as  bookie is giving our children: "It's not whether you win or lose but if you  beat the spread." Other factors include gambling by children, suicides and  embezzlements; simply too much hard sell. Add in a national desire to return to  traditional values, and everything we see about us will once again be outlawed.  </P> <P> The 1990s and the first decade of the 21st Century will be the final gambling  boom. By 2029 it will all be outlawed again -- for a while.  </P></p>

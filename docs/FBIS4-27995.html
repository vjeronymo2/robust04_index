			<p>BFN     [Text] The visiting premier of South Australia, Mr. Dean  Brown, today called on Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and  Environment and Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan. During the  meeting, Mr. Brown discussed opportunities for Australian and  Singapore companies to go regional together, especially in China.    Earlier, at the Singapore-Australian Business Council  luncheon, he said South Australia wants to offer business  opportunities to Singapore investors. They are in the area of  computer software development, biotechnology, and tourism  infrastructure. Some 23 billion Australian dollars worth of  government assets are offered for sale, including commercial  buildings in central Adelaide. On China, Mr. Brown said with  South Australia's engineering skill and Singapore's commercial  link, both sides can work on infrastructural development  projects.</p>

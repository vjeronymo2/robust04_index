			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / People: Finance moves The integration of the Midland and Hongkong Bank investment banking businesses looks likely to be accelerated following the news of a new chairman for Samuel Montagu. Bernard Asher has been appointed to the board and will take over as chairman on April 9, succeeding Sir Michael Palliser, the 70-year-old former permanent secretary at the Foreign Office who has chaired Montagu since 1984. Asher, who started out running Hongkong Bank's Wardley investment banking business, has already pushed through mergers between some parts of Wardley with James Capel, the UK-based broker which he has also chaired for the past two years. Samuel Montagu remains, legally, a subsidiary of Midland, but in management terms now falls squarely within the HSBC group's investment banking operation. Sir Michael is to remain on the board as vice chairman.</p>

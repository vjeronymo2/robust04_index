			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Jose Luis Garcia, deputy director </F> in charge of economic affairs at the Cienfuegos Oil Refinery, by  Barbara Betancur; place and date not given; from the "Evening  Information Review" newscast]    [Text] Officials from the Cienfuegos Oil Refinery, a  modern-technology plant that has been in operation since 1989,  are currently engaged in negotiations with a Mexican enterprise.  As in other Cuban industries, refinery officials are trying to  find a partner with whom they can jointly operate the  enterprise. This would lead to the securing of adequate amounts  of crude oil, to stable production, and to a market for that  production. This was confirmed to Radio Havana Cuba by Jose  Luis Garcia, the refinery's deputy director in charge of  economic affairs.    Garcia said the Mexican side, along with Cuba, would make  investments needed to help the plant improve its efficiency.    [Begin recording] [Garcia] This is a primary refining plant.  We need a secondary process -- in other words, heavy processing  -- to guarantee higher percentages of clear derivatives which  garner higher prices on the world market. This would make the  plant more competitive.    [Betancur] On our way here, we noticed that smoke was coming  out of the chimney. Obviously you are refining oil. I would  like to know what kind of oil you are refining right now and how  the operation is going.    [Garcia] Right now, during the first four months of the  year,  we have had fairly stable refining of crude oil and a stable  yield of oil byproducts for national use.    [Betancur] When you say crude oil, you are not talking about  national crude oil, but about the crude oil we import, right?  Do you refine Cuban crude oil here also?    [Garcia] So far we have been refining imported crude oil,  not  national crude oil.    [Betancur] How many derivatives can this refinery produce?    [Garcia] We have the ability to produce 3 million tons of  refined fuel annually. We also produce the following  derivatives: GLP, or normal liquid gas; naphtha; regular and  premium gasoline; kerosene; diesel; and fuel oil. These are the  derivatives. We also can produce elemental sulfur in our sulfur  plant.    [Betancur] I understand you have two oil pipelines. What are  these for?    [Garcia] At this plant we have two oil pipelines. One  guarantees the stability of crude oil supplies from the Matanzas  supertanker station. This is a 182 km-long pipeline. This  pipeline links us to the port of Matanzas, a supertanker port, a  port for deep-draft ships. We also receive crude oil at our  docks. This is the oil we are using right now.    [Betancur] But this does not get here through an oil  pipeline, does it? This is brought here from the local docks.    [Garcia] The other pipeline we have is for moving fuel oil  to  the Thermoelectric Central Plant next to our enterprise.    [Betancur] The smaller pipeline is for taking refined  products to the Cienfuegos Thermoelectric Central Plant?    [Garcia] That is right. This pipeline was built to reduce  fuel transportation costs from here to the Thermoelectric  Central Plant.    [Betancur] How much savings does this pipeline represents?    [Garcia] More than $2 million annually because of the  reduction in transportation costs and in the time ships spend  unloading the product. It also contributes to protect the bay.  We have a clean bay. This is possible because we have a very  efficient plant for processing residuals. It keeps petroleum  residuals at internationally acceptable levels. [end recording]    I want to report that in addition to the oil pipeline and  the  plant for treating residuals, the Cienfuegos Oil Refinery hosts  the country's largest chimney, which is 192 meters tall -- tall  enough to keep gases expelled by the furnaces from polluting the  environment.</p>

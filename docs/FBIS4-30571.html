			<p>BFN     [Text] Panmunjom, June 28 (YONHAP) -- A burst of camera  flashes greeted the North Korean delegation to Tuesday's  inter-Korean summit preliminary contact on the Southern side of  the truce village.    Chief delegate Kim Yong-sun and his team of An Pyong-su and  Paek Nam-chun arrived at Peace House [Tongilgak] from the  Northern side three minutes before the meeting hour in sedans  provided by Seoul.    South Korea's chief delegate, Deputy Premier Yi Hong-ku,  wearing a tight smile, came down the stairs from the second  floor waiting room to welcome the North Korean team.    "Just call me Kim Yong-sun," the North Korean team leader  said, raising a round of laughter. "Then just call me Yi  Hong-ku," the Southern delegate replied.    Kim and Yi waved at reporters and cameramen before ascending  to the conference room on the second floor.    -- Both sides opened the conference with boasts about who  had  built the better road to Panmunjom, apparently intended to  demonstrate who is more fit to host the summit.    "It was only a two-hour drive from Pyongyang to here, and  the  scenery was just fabulous with clean homes and ripe crops," Kim  Yong-sun said. "I thought it would be nice if you could travel  the same road."    Yi Hong-ku, not about to lose out, said it had taken him  only  one hour to travel from his office to the truce village.    "The highway was recently widened to eight lanes," he  explained. "I thought it would be nice if the highway was  connected with the Northern side."    -- North Korean reporters and delegation assistants arrived  earlier, crossing the demarcation line on foot.    About 25 reporters came, more than double the usual 10 seen  at past contacts, reflecting the degree of interest in the  outcome.    They avoided a flurry of questions from their South Korean  counterparts, advising patience in response to queries about  Pyongyang's proposal on the date and site of the summit.    One question touched a raw nerve: "Nonsense," one North  Korean snapped when asked if Kim Yong-sun was related to  President Kim Il-song.    Rumor has it that the chief North Korean delegate, an  influential figure within the inner circle of power, is related  by blood to the "great leader."    -- North Korea's free trade zones came up when Yi Hong-ku  mentioned the subject.    "I received many phone calls telling me to find out about  the  free trade zones in Najin and Sonbong," he told North Korea's  Kim.    Kim said he, too, had received many calls asking about the  zones but withheld any new disclosures, simply saying "Let's  just wait for the results."    --Tuesday's conference continued in three different forms as  the two sides tried various ways to reach an agreement.    Seoul's delegates asked for a 10-minute break at 11:30 AM  when the morning session appeared to be a fruitless exercise.    The meeting was then convened between only the chief  delegates before breaking up again at 1 PM.    They were in virtual agreement on holding the first summit  in  Pyongyang on July 25, but North Korean officials objected to  Seoul's condition that the summit be arranged through exchange  visits between the two sides to guarantee reciprocity.    The North Koreans instead made a new demand during the  morning session, asking that a clause be inserted in the  agreement that neither side could take any provocative actions  that might cancel the summit talks.    They parted for lunch with a promise to meet again  afterwards. An Pyong-su returned by himself around 2:30 PM and  met separately with Yun Ye-chun to go over the minutes of the  morning session.    -- Security officials were unusually strict toward  reporters,  blocking the staircase to the conference room and placing  security agents on site.    One official explained the extreme caution was needed to  prevent repetition of past incidents where press coverage placed  too much emphasis on differences of opinion between the two  sides and influenced the inter-Korean talks in a negative way.    Nevertheless, the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) had  presidential instructions and permission to provide thorough  coverage of the conference.    President Kim Yong-sam is said to have specially requested  the state-invested TV network to cover the conference live [for  broadcast on closed-circuit television] so that he could watch  it from his office.    -- The Panmunjom preparatory contact was telecast live to  the  top leaders of South and North Korea who, based on their viewing  of it, handed down instructions to their negotiators at  Panmunjom from time to time.    In an advance agreement, a 20-member KBS Television crew  covered the conference in its entirety for beaming to both sides.    Conference scenes caught by television cameras were sent to  Tongilgak in the Northern sector of Panmunjom by an optical  cable connecting the two areas of the joint security area via a  relay van outside the peace house.    At Tongilgak, the television picture of the South's NTSC  scanning method was converted to the North's PAL method before  being beamed directly to Kim Il-song's Palace in Pyongyang.    Instructions from the two presidents were promptly conveyed  over telephone to respective liaison officials at Panmunjom,  which were handed to the chief negotiators in notes.    An official who was present at the conference said white  pieces of paper were relayed to North Korea's chief delegate Kim  Yong-sun at several minutes' interval around 11 AM when the two  sides did not back down from their respective ideas.    Shortly after the delivery of the memos, Kim Yong-sun backed  down and tentatively agreed to the South's idea of holding a  summit on July 25, the official said.</p>

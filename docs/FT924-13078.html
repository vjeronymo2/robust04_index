			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / International Company News: GM to trim third quarter loss by 20% GENERAL Motors, the troubled US automobile group, said yesterday it expected to cut losses in the third quarter by at least 20 per cent compared with the Dollars 1.06bn deficit it suffered in the July-September period of 1991. It added, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that the losses would be within the range of the leading securities analysts. Wall Street has been predicting losses of between Dollars 550m and Dollars 1bn, with serious red ink in the group's North American automotive operations outweighing profits in European vehicles and its finance, information services and aerospace divisions. The company said said earnings from its information subsidiary, Electronic Data Systems, should be 'consistent with the year-to-year earnings trend' previously reported. In the second quarter, the business recorded a 12 per cent rise in net income. Earnings from the aerospace group GM Hughes would be 'substantially improved' from the year-ago level. Ford Motor, the second largest US auto manufacturer, is also expected to report third quarter losses while Chrysler, the smallest of the Big Three, has indicated it will be in the black.</p>

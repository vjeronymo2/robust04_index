			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS AND AUTHORS: MYSTERY THEATER AUDIENCE WILL HIT STREETS TO SOLVE WHODUNIT  </P> <P> Upchurch-Brown Booksellers in Laguna Beach, which regularly hosts book signings  and other literary events, has embarked on its most ambitious project yet.  </P> <P> Co-owners Mary Upchurch and Robert Brown have teamed with Laguna restaurateur  Jules Swimmer to create Laguna Mysteries Inc., a mystery dinner theater in  which the audience will literally take to the streets in the course of  attempting to find out who-done-it.  </P> <P> The first play in the audience-participation series, which will be presented on  the last Saturday of each month, is "The Laguna Baron," written by Los Angeles  playwright Julio Martinez. The debut performance on April 29 is sold out.  </P> <P> As scripted, the mystery begins at the bookstore with an "author signing  party." To search for clues, guests move on to several Laguna locations,  stopping at Swimmer's Le Petit Gourmet Cafe for dinner. After dinner, it's back  to the bookstore for the resolution of the crime.  </P> <P> The play's 6-member cast is from the Comedy Company of Newport Beach. Despite  the acting company's name, Brown emphasizes that the play is not a comedy.  </P> <P> "Although it's set in 1989, it's more a 1930s-style mystery, and we use Laguna  landmarks, history and architecture," he said. "It's a Laguna experience."  </P> <P> Tickets are $48 per person and each performance, which lasts about 2 1/2 hours,  is limited to 40 people. For reservations and information, call (714) 497-9742.  </P> <P> Editing Workshop: The Editorial Department, a Los Angeles and New York-based  book manuscript editing service, will conduct a 1-day workshop on "How to Edit  Your Own Manuscript" at 9:30 a.m. today at the Huntington Beach Inn, 21112  Pacific Coast Highway, Huntington Beach.

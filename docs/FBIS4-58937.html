			<p>BFN     [Text] The Muslim Brotherhood has appealed to the parties  to the conflict in Yemen to safeguard the public interest and  settle their differences within the framework of a constructive  dialogue based on God's shari'ah and to place Yemeni unity above  any other consideration. In a statement released by the Muslim  Brotherhood, it called on the Arab and Muslim rulers and all  Arab and Muslim organizations to play the required role to close  the Yemeni ranks and stop the bloodshed.    The Muslim Brotherhood expressed its worry about the  deterioration of the situation in Yemen and the threat to Yemeni  unity. It noted that the fraternal Yemeni people's property and  resources are threatened. It stressed the need to pool efforts  and resources to heal the rift in Yemen and bring the parties  together in the interest of that country and its unity and its  people's security, freedom, lives, and generation's resources.</p>

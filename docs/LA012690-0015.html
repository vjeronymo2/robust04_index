			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY'S NOT GUILTY VERDICT IN MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL CASE  </P> <P> Now that jury has finally rendered a verdict, it is clear that jurors found the  whole thing to be a debacle.  </P> <P> This case was mishandled by the police, the so-called child abuse "experts"  and, above all, by Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. Do we dare elect the principal  architect of this debacle to be the chief law enforcement officer of  California? I say no.  </P> <P> I further believe that the remaining counts should be dismissed forthwith so  that the children (who were almost certainly molested) can rebuild their lives  and to give the beleaguered taxpayers who paid the bill for this fiasco a  well-deserved rest.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER BLAKE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Clearly, any limits imposed will depend on the risks involved and the substitute and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application in question. To provide adequate opportunity for comment by the regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community, EPA will complete notice-and-comment rulemaking before promulgating any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding that a substitute is acceptable only subject to a narrowed use limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In implementing narrowed use limitations, the Agency has sought to allow agents for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific uses that would otherwise be deemed unacceptable. This policy serves the larger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goal of facilitating the fastest possible transition from ozone-depleting compounds by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanding the list of alternatives available to all applications within a sector end-use category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that certain sector end-uses encompass a broad range of applications,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing processes and products. Under the acceptable for narrow use category, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will accept a substitute for use only in certain specialized uses within the broader end-use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of the narrowed use limitation is to restrict the use of a substitute that the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deems unacceptable for the full range of applications or products within a sector end-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category. Where a substitute is found acceptable subject to narrowed use limits, general use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the relevant end-use is prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before users adopt a restricted agent within the narrowed use limits category, they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must make a reasonable effort to ascertain that other substitutes or alternatives are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technically feasible. Users are expected to undertake a thorough technical investigation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives before implementing the otherwise restricted substitute. The Agency expects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> users to contact vendors of alternatives to explore with experts whether or not other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable substitutes are technically feasible for the process, product or system in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To further assist users in their evaluation, EPA has prepared a list of vendors manufacturing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other substitutes. Although users are not required to report the results of their investigation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA, companies must document these results, and retain them in company files for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of demonstrating compliance. Both the Vendor List and the Guidance Manual are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available from the SNAP program, or through EPA's Stratospheric Ozone Protection Hotline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In October 1993, the President directed EPA through the Climate Change Action Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (CCAP) to use its authority under section 612 of the Clean Air Act to narrow the uses of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFC substitutes with high global warming potential. Because EPA is simultaneously also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested in promoting the broader shift away from ozone-depleting compounds, EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make every effort to assure that these limits on use will be imposed in ways that preserve as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much flexibility as possible for those trying to move to alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this final rule, EPA has imposed narrowed use limitations on the acceptability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perfluorocarbon (PFC) substitutes when used in solvent cleaning, and fire suppression. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has imposed these limitations because of the high global warming potential and long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> atmospheric lifetimes of the PFC compounds as compared with other alternatives available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same end-uses. Comparable limitations on the use of refrigerants and aerosols containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PFCs are also likely to be proposed shortly. In the case of fire suppression and explosion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection, EPA has taken the approach of narrowing uses to prevent or delay emissions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> global warming gases. This is preferable to the outright prohibitions EPA would otherwise be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized to impose where other alternatives are available, because in these limited cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> users may have no other feasible alternatives to continued reliance on ozone-depleters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Through the notice and comment rulemaking process, other companies or vendors will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be able to scrutinize the proposed narrowed use limits. This may bring to light new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives or processes of which the user and EPA are unaware, and these new alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may pose lower overall risks than the substances which have been the subject of the narrowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use designation. If an acceptable listing is revoked based on the availability of a new, lower-risk alternative, companies that have made investments in technology which was earlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deemed as having no alternatives available may be granted permission to extend their use for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a limited period of time, consistent with EPA's grandfathering approach described above in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section VI.B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has prepared guidance describing additional documentation users should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include for narrowed use applications. This information includes descriptions of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Process or product in which the substitute is needed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Substitutes examined and rejected;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Reason for rejection of other alternatives, e.g., performance, technical or safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards; and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Anticipated date other substitutes will be available and projected time for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> switching.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to this basic information, the guidance includes specific data for end-uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in each sector. The guidance is available from the SNAP program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unacceptable. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has the authority under section 612(c) to prohibit the use of a substitute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed to present adverse effects to human health and the environment where alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that reduce overall risk are available. The Agency will only use this provision where it has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified other substitutes that are currently or potentially available and that pose lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall risks. Substitutes will be listed as unacceptable through the rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pending. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency will describe submissions for which the 90-day review period is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underway and for which EPA has not yet reached a final decision as pending. For all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes in the pending category, the Agency will contact the submitter to determine a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule for providing the missing information if the Agency needs to extend the 90-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review period. EPA will use the authority under section 114 to gather this information, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary. Again, a delay of the review period will not affect a manufacturer's ability to sell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a product 90 days after notification of the Agency as described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

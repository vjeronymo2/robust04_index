			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Centregold share gift transaction Centregold, the publisher and distributor of video games and computer software, has set a new trend in Christmas share dealings by disclosing a gift transaction between its chief executive and managing director. Shortly after the stock market closed on Christmas Eve the Birmingham-based company announced that Mr Geoff Brown, the former mathematics teacher who floated the company in October, was giving 200,000 shares to Mr Martyn Savage, the managing director. The gift, worth about Pounds 330,000 at Friday's closing price of 165p, reduces Mr Brown's holding to 13.9m shares - representing 25 per cent of the capital. Mr Savage said he would be retaining the shares, which took his holding to 3.6 per cent. 'It was a personal gift reflecting Mr Brown's view that I deserved more than I got out of the company. We were the driving force behind the flotation,' he said. The gift, supplementing Mr Savage's Pounds 90,000 basic annual salary and performance-related bonuses, was a one-off gesture, he added. Since the flotation Centregold shares have jumped sharply from the issue price of 125p. The company's performance has been boosted by strong demand in the run up to the holiday period. Mr Savage said earnings next year would be boosted by new products and revenue from exclusive video game rights for the Winter Olympics and the World Cup.</p>

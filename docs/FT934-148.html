			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Madrid depressed by Banesto upheaval Bourses had a mixed day, writes Our Markets Staff. MADRID fell another 1.5 per cent, dragged down by negative sentiment after the Bank of Spain's decision to take control of the management in Banesto. Banks suffered again, with BCH Pta195, or 6.1 per cent, lower at Pta3,105 and BBV down Pta190, or 5.8 per cent, at Pta3,075. Turnover was an active Pta43.4bn. PARIS climbed to a new closing high with the CAC-40 index up 17.25 at 2,281.89 in turnover of FFr4.35bn. Euro Disney recovered FFr2.85, or 9.8 per cent, to FFr31.90 on short covering after a two-day fall of FFr4.15. FRANKFURT continued to be dominated by DTB-originated trading, following a mini-crash in the DAX futures index on Tuesday. In the cash market, the DAX fell another 28.12, or 1.3 per cent, to 2,214.70 yesterday, recovering to 2,229.62 in the post bourse. Very little of this was investment business, emphasised Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf. The fall in the market, he said, was merely a correction after Tuesday's intra-day high of 2,284.56 - and the post bourse 'recovery', again, was a matter of traders covering their short positions. Turnover fell from DM10.5bn to DM7.9bn. Banks were relatively weak again, Bayernverein losing DM15 at DM570 and Commerzbank DM9 at DM382. ZURICH overcame an early continuation of Tuesday's consolidation to finish marginally firmer with late demand sparked by Wall Street's firm opening. The SMI indexfinished 3.3 higher at 2,934.2. Banks remained neglected although CS Holding recovered from Tuesday's 3 per cent fall after the share was split, the bearers adding SFr7 to SFr735. AMSTERDAM spent a quiet session although most internationals took their lead from London's bullish tone. The CBS Tendency index added 0.2 at 148.3. A slightly stronger bond market cushioned a downward drift in financials, while VNU, 30 cents ahead at Fl 174.20, was the only one of the major publishers to escape a second day of profit-taking. MILAN eased on profit-taking in continuing low volume and the Comit index shed 4.10 to 613.83. STOCKHOLM came back to life after two listless sessions, the the Affarsvarlden index adding 21.7, or 1.6 per cent, to 1405.3. Astra A shares rose SKr6 to a record SKr192 on the strength of technical factors and positive press comment. Ericsson Bs rose SKr8 to SKr339 and Asea As gained SKr11 to SKr586. COPENHAGEN continued its steady ascent, KFX index adding 1.54 to at 108.19, for a cumulative 4.3 per cent rise since the Christmas break. Industrial and shipping shares did well. Three per cent rises were recorded by AP Moeller's D/S 1912, up DKr4,000 at DKr132,000, and Sand Svendborg B, DKr6,000 higher at DKr191,000, both supported by press reports of the sale of Maersk's shareholding in a Hong Kong shipping terminal. OSLO rose almost 1 per cent, helped by higher North Sea oil prices and a stronger dollar. The all-share index added 5.70 to 615.13, with the central bank's announcement of a rise from today in key interest rates coming after the market closed. HELSINKI moved firmly ahead in strong demand linked both to year-end book squaring and to the continuing fall in interest rates. The Hex index closed 25.4, or 1.6 per cent higher, at 1,588.2. ATHENS rose 1.6 per cent to a new high for the year, the general index closing 14.84 higher at 950.01, mostly on news that prime lending rates will drop by a percentage point on January 1. TEL AVIV recovered on positive developments in talks between Israel and the PLO in Cairo, the Mishtanim index gaining 2.31 at 248.54.

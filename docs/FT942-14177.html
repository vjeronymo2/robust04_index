			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Leading Article: Hard cop, soft cop On Tuesday Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, warned the Bosnian Serbs 'not to test the patience of the world community'. The remark is significant, since where Serbs are concerned Russia until now has been easily the most patient member of the UN Security Council. Mr Kozyrev did not go so far, however, as to accept the advice of his special envoy Mr Vitaly Churkin, who said on Monday that he was now ready to support the use of force against the Serbs. The considered view of the Russian government, issued after a meeting chaired by President Boris Yeltsin yesterday, is that 'the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the conflict remains realistic'. Meanwhile in Brussels, the North Atlantic Council gave a favourable but cautious response to the request from the UN secretary general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, that Nato should make its air power available for the protection of the UN-proclaimed 'safe areas' in Bosnia. So far Nato air power has been used only to enforce the no-fly zone, and to defend UN personnel under direct attack on the ground. But last February Nato used the threat of air strikes to get the Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons from a 20km zone around Sarajevo, or place them under UN supervision. The plan now put forward by Mr Boutros Ghali  - and emphatically backed by US President Bill Clinton - proposes to use the same formula for Gorazde and the other four 'safe areas'. Nato ultimatum This could be presented as even-handed in that, as in Sarajevo, the same terms would be applied to heavy weapons in the hands of the the Bosnian government. But the Serbs are bound to see the threat as directed primarily against them, and after their successful defiance of the UN and Nato in the last 10 days it cannot be taken for granted that they will comply with a new ultimatum. If Nato issues a new ultimatum, therefore, it may well have to act on it; and since it would be doing so at the UN's request, this would bring both organisations into direct confrontation with the Serbs. As last week's events showed, it is no good imagining that in that event the Serbs would respect the 'neutrality' of UN forces ('Unprofor') on the ground. A policy of wider air strikes is therefore incompatible with the maintenance of Unprofor in its present configuration. Either it would have to be regrouped, reinforced and re-equipped as a combat force ready to fight the Serbs (presumably in alliance with the Bosnian army); or it would have to be withdrawn. Unprofor withdrawal It is not hard to guess which option the contributing governments would prefer. None of them has even begun to prepare its domestic public for the use of its national armed forces to intervene on one side in the Bosnian war. If the US now expects the UN operation to be turned into such an intervention, the least it should do is to contribute forces of its own. Failing that, all concerned must accept that the inescapable corollary of a wider use of air strikes is the withdrawal of Unprofor; and Nato should insist that arrangements for withdrawing it as quickly and smoothly as possible (it will not be easy) are included in Mr Boutros Ghali's plan. At the same time the UN should lift its embargo on arms supplies to the Bosnian government. The logic of this embargo, which prevents a member state from exercising its fundamental right of self-defence, has never been easy to follow. But once the UN itself has accepted the need to use force against the Serbs, it would be absurd to continue denying that right to the very people it is trying to help. Air power alone, it has been said often enough, will not decide this war. To be effective, it would have to be co-ordinated with the action of well-equipped Bosnian forces on the ground. Although such a radical shift in the UN's position would not be easy for Russia to accept, the remarks of Mr Churkin and Mr Kozyrev show that they are close to understanding the need for it. They should be given one more chance to play 'soft cop' to Nato's 'hard cop', as they did so effectively in February. But that will only work if Nato is seen to be a real hard cop, not the blundering Dogberry of last week. Moves to withdraw Unprofor, lift the embargo and prepare for wider air strikes should begin now.</p>

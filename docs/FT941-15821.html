			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Drop in jobless beats forecasts: Government believes fall shows success of labour market reforms December's drop of almost 47,000 to 2,766,000 in the seasonally adjusted jobless total was higher than even the most optimistic of forecasts; the average expectation had been 20,000. The drop was the ninth monthly fall in 1993, and the fourth consecutive decrease. The November figure was also revised to show a larger fall - 39,000 compared with 36,000 - than had previously been announced. The average decline in the three months to December is 46,000. The unexpectedly speedy fall in unemployment appears to give weight to government arguments that the labour market reforms of the 1980s have encouraged employers to be more willing to take on new workers. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said: 'The UK with its flexible, de-regulated labour market is showing Europe that economic growth can feed through into more jobs and falling unemployment.' Many of the jobs being created are part-time, with Department of Employment figures showing that the number of part-timers increased over the year to September 1993, while those in full-time employment fell. The proportion of the workforce in part-time employment in September 1993 was 28 per cent, compared with 21 per cent in 1983. After seasonal adjustments, 341,600 joined the unemployment count in December, down from a revised 341,800 in November. The number of people who left the register was 376,400, down from 377,200 in the previous month. The encouraging trend in headline unemployment was backed up by other encouraging jobs statistics. Figures for the total workforce in employment in September were revised upwards by 5,000 to 25,005,000, representing a third quarter rise of 91,000. The number of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres rose by 4,500 last month to 145,400, on a seasonally adjusted basis, reaching the highest level since October 1990. Vacancies have been rising by an average of 6,000 per month over the last three months. New vacancies totalled 202,900, the highest number for 3 1/2 years. The service sector is still the main engine for job growth, with the manufacturing sector shedding a further 7,000 jobs in November. However the decline is slowing.  ----------------------------------------------      UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HIGHEST IN ULSTER  ---------------------------------------------- December, seasonally adjusted  ---------------------------------------------- 1  Northern Ireland        13.6 per cent 2  North                   11.8 per cent 3  West Midlands           10.4 per cent 4  North-west              10.2 per cent 5  Wales                    9.9 per cent 6  Yorks &amp; Humber           9.9 per cent 7  South-east               9.7 per cent 8  Scotland                 9.2 per cent 9  South-west               9.1 per cent 10 East Midlands            9.1 per cent 11 East Anglia              7.9 per cent 12 UK                       9.8 per cent  ---------------------------------------------- Source: Department of Employment  ----------------------------------------------</p>

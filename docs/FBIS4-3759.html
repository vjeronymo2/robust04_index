			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Zhirong (1728 2784 2837), member of the Department </F> of International Politics at Beijing University: "Xinjiang  Comes Under the Onslaught of Various Foreign Forces"--first  paragraph is TANGTAI introduction]    [Text] Muslim fundamentalism, which began emerging in the  1990's after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, is now  rocking both the East and the West, as well as China's Xinjiang  region. The Organization of East Turkistan has staged a  comeback and has demanded the independence of Xinjiang. The  United States has also made some new moves along the Chinese  border. Xinjiang is tumultuous.    According to a report carried by China's RENMIN GONGAN BAO  on  25 January 1994, in Urumqi, Xinjiang's regional capital, public  security police found many reactionary slogans from outside the  border, and the main idea of them was: "No communist party, no  Han people; we want only Muslims and independence." In recent  years, similar anticommunist and anti-Han slogans could often be  found in Xinjiang. This is a reflection of the attempts by some  major powers to strengthen penetration into China's frontier  regions, where ethnic minorities live, since the disintegration  of the Soviet Union.    Since the threat from the Soviet Union disappeared, Iran,  Turkey, and other big powers in Central Asia have become very  ambitious; they want to use their religious and cultural  influences to control the regions of Central Asia, whereas the  United States also wants to use its world-class hegemonic  strength to fill the political vacuum in Central Asia. The  Republic of Kazakhstan, which has just become independent and  possesses nuclear weapons, also wants to ask the Chinese  Government to return its territories and people. Under such  complicated circumstances, China's Xinjiang region is enduring  both open strifes and veiled struggles among various foreign  forces.  <H5>  Iran and Turkey Step Up Offensives Against Xinjiang </H5>   The rejuvenation of Islamic fundamentalism takes place  mainly  in Central Asia. The disintegration of the Soviet Union enabled  Islam, which was suppressed for several decades in Central Asian  nations, to rapidly grow. The rejuvenation of fundamentalism in  Central Asia has affected the security of China's frontier  regions.    China has 17 million Muslims, of whom over 6 million live in  Xinjiang, which borders Central Asia. They have close  historical, ethnic, and religious links to Central Asia. After  the liberation of Xinjiang, the activists who had fought for  Xinjiang's independence fled to Central Asia, waited for a  chance to come back, and continued to carry out pro-independence  activities.    The rejuvenation of fundamentalism in Central Asia is  inseparable from the efforts by the major Muslim countries, such  as Turkey and Iran, to expand their influence in the former  Soviet republics and the six countries in Central Asia.  Historically, Turkey has been linguistically and culturally  linked to Central Asian nations such as Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan,  and Kazakhstan. It preaches "Greater Turkism" in Central Asia  and attempts to establish a federation spanning from Turkey to  Xinjiang.    Iran also has religious links to Central Asian nations such  as Azerbaijan and Tajikistan, and has many Shiites. Iran thinks  that since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, a vacuum has  emerged in Central Asia which ought to be filled by  fundamentalism. For this reason, Iran has sent government  officials and religious scholars there, with their Koran, to  launch diplomatic and cultural offensives against Central Asia.  China's Xinjiang has naturally felt the repercussions of the  Muslim offensive.  <H5>  East Turkey Group Once Again Becomes Active </H5>   In the 1930's and 1940's, Xinjiang had a force for  independence. A short-lived East Turkistan Republic was founded  in 1933. At the end of the 1940's a group of Muslims who  advocated Xinjiang's independence and were led by Aisha [5337  3097] attempted to grasp the political power of Xinjiang  Province; they also preached Turkism. After the liberation of  the whole country, the Aisha group fled to the Republic of  Turkey and carried out pro-independence activities outside the  border.    Since the great changes in the Soviet Union and East Europe,  the Aisha group has become more active in carrying out  pro-independence activities. They strengthened ideological  propaganda toward the Xinjiang region, established publication  organs, and compiled books and magazines, which they secretly  brought to Xinjiang to preach the theory of "independence" among  Xinjiang youths. In west Asia and Turkey, the activists  advocating Xinjiang independence also took the opportunities  arising from pilgrimages, tours, and homecoming trips to enter  and leave Xinjiang and support the masses in confrontation with  the government, so as to "drive the Han people out." When Usupu  Aisha Alpertgene [you su pu ai sha a er pa te jin 1429 4790 2528  5337 3097 7093 1422 1584 3676 6855], leader of the former East  Turkistan, expounded on the Koran in Istanbul at the age of over  90, he often advocated that Xinjiang's Muslims should stand up  for resistance. Shortly before he died, he handed to Turkish  prime minister Ozal a banner symbolizing independence.    Aisha also fostered links with activists advocating the  independence of Tibet, and published articles in TIBET REVIEW,  which was headed by the Dalai Lama. The articles encouraged the  followers of the Dalai Lama and Aisha to unite for the cause of  confronting the Han people and realizing the independence of  Xinjiang and Tibet.    Kazakhstan's Influence Quietly Taking Shape    The Republic of Kazakhstan, a former republic in the Soviet  Union, is a big country in Central Asia. After its  independence, nationalism in the country has increased. Last  year, in Alma Ata, its capital, a grand world meeting of  representatives of Kazakhs was held to preach greater Kazakh  nationalism and unity of Kazakhs.    China shares 1,724 km of borders with Kazakhstan. Within  China there are 1.12 million Kazakhs, among whom 99 percent live  in Xinjiang, with a small number in Gansu and Qinghai. They are  linguistically and culturally linked to Kazakhstan.    Last year, a delegation of Chinese scholars visited  Kazakhstan. Several Kazakh writers talked lavishly about greater  Kazakh nationalism to the Chinese scholars. They thought that  Kazakhstan may abandon territorial claims from China, but the  Chinese Government must let the Kazakhs living in Xinjiang  return to their mother nation of Kazakhstan. Although the  Sino-Kazakh border was already fixed in the Qing dynasty, most  boundary tablets have collapsed or become blurred over the  years. Kazakhstan has used this as an excuse to raise several  territorial claims from China, but the Chinese Government has  always suspected that those claims are attempts to swallow up  the areas inhabited by the Kazakhs in Xinjiang.  <H5>  Kazakhstan's Nuclear Weapons Pose a Threat to China </H5>   In addition, the Republic of Kazakhstan's nuclear weapons  also pose a threat to the security of northwest China. The  Soviet Union built nuclear weapons factories in Kazakhstan.  Brezhnev once threatened to use the nuclear weapons there to  perform a surgery on the bases in northwest China. It cannot  but make people worry that once nuclear proliferation occurs and  nuclear weapons fall into the hands of the fundamentalists,  China's national security will be threatened.    The disintegration of the Soviet Union has caused a power  vacuum in Central Asia, and this is a stimulus for the  rejuvenation of Islam. The United States wants to fill the  vacuum, so as to offset the influences of Iran and  fundamentalism.    Early last year, former U.S. Secretary of State Baker twice  visited Central Asia as Iran launched a large-scale diplomatic  offensive in Central Asia. He said he hoped that the nations  there could establish governments after the Western model;  otherwise, the United States would not establish diplomatic  relations with them. The United States also carried out  penetrations through the pro-U.S. moderate Islamic countries  such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to resist Iran and restrain the  swelling fundamentalism.  <H5>  The United States Fills Vacuum, Posing Threats to Chinese </H5> Frontier Regions    The United States is stepping up efforts to fill the power  vacuum in Central Asia, and in so doing, it tries to kill two  birds with one stone. First, as mentioned above, to check Iran  and fundamentalism; and second, in the areas north and west of  China, to strengthen the mechanisms restraining China. In fact,  after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the most powerful  ideological enemy left to the United States is China. China has  become the main target of the "peaceful evolution" which is  being carried out by the United States. It seems that it is not  strange to see the United States launching a thorough  encirclement against China's border security.    Since 1987 the United States has harbored the intention to  intervene in China's southwest frontier and Tibet, and the U.S.  Congress has more than once deliberated a "Tibet Human Rights  Bill," to support the Dalai Lama's activities for Tibetan  independence. The Voice of America has newly launched a  Tibetan-language broadcast, and people believe that this is to  coordinate with the relevant policy of the United States.    In April 1993 the U.S. and Russian sides conducted the first  air exercise in Siberia since World War II. U.S. planes  appeared for the first time in the areas north of China, causing  concern in China. Yeltsin tried to join the NATO grouping.  Will there be a scenario in which the United States and Russia  join forces in the areas north of China to jointly deal with  China's defense in the north?    What is more important is that Mongolia has shown some signs  that it is becoming an arena for competition among the major  powers in the international community. Against such a  background, will Xinjiang, which is under the influence of the  rapid changes in the situation of Central Asia, become another  "arena"?</p>

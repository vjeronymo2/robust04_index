Kozyrev is  expected to help promote the existing Sino-Russian relations,  said Igor A. Rogachev, Russian ambassador to China, here this  afternoon.    Rogachev, in an interview with XINHUA, said that Kozyrev's  China tour, which will take place from January 26 to 29, is the  first visit made by the Russian foreign minister outside the  Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) after the re-shuffle of  the Russian Government.    He revealed that Kozyrev and the Chinese side will discuss  bilateral relations.    Meanwhile, he said, the two sides will also confer on  regional and international issues of mutual concern as well as  briefing each other on the respective domestic situations.    Facts over the past years show that the two countries can  conduct very good cooperation in many major international  issues, he recalled.    The ambassador noted that both countries are carrying out  reforms. And the Russian foreign minister will travel to the  Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in south China's Guangdong  Province during his stay in China.    He went on to say that Russian-Chinese relations in all  fields have enjoyed smooth development since Russian President  Boris Yeltsin visited China in December 1992.    In the economic and trade field, he said, the total trade  volume of the two countries last year hit 7.7 billion U.S.  dollars, an increase of 30 percent over 1992.    About 80 percent of the trade were conducted through over 20  ports along the Sino-Russian border, and the two governments  would sign an agreement concerning ports during Kozyrev's trip  to China, he said.    Moreover, the two countries also have conducted good  cooperation in science and technology, the ambassador noted.</p>

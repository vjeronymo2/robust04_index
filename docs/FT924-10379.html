			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: Sterling falters as base rate rumours grow - At a glance Those who managed to switch from sterling into dollars in August, when the rate was Dollars 2/Pounds , will have made a profit of more than 20 per cent by now. The pound continued its decline this week as the markets speculated that further interest rate cuts were on the way. Yesterday afternoon, the pound had fallen to around Dollars 1.56. The bad news is that those planning a US holiday will find that prices are no longer quite such a bargain.</p>

Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> REAGAN LEAVES MAYO CLINIC AFTER SKULL SURGERY, FLIES BACK TO L.A.  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan left the hospital today, tipping his hat to  well-wishers and revealing a shaved spot on his head where Mayo Clinic  physicians performed skull surgery a week ago.  </P> <P> Reagan, 78, and his wife, Nancy, flew back home to Los Angeles aboard a  privately owned DC-9 jet.  </P> <P> About 100 people, many of them travelers at the Rochester airport, gathered as  the Rochester Lourdes High School marching band played while Reagan said goodby  to Mayo Clinic officials and to retired Mayo physician, Dr. Oliver Beahrs.  </P> <P> Beahrs, a friend of Nancy Reagan's late father, who also was a physician, said  Reagan was returning home in good health. Doctors last Friday drained fluid  that had built up on Reagan's brain after he was thrown from a horse on July 4.  </P></p>

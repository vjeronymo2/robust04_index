			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: The Budget burden for equities FT-SE Index: 2,476.0 (-17.3) With attention focused on the election, it is easy to forget that the Budget carried a message of lasting change in the fundamental background for equities. The public sector borrowing requirement will be much higher than originally expected, not only in 1992-93 but for several years to come. The chancellor admitted that it would still be 3 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product two years hence. Even that assumption is made on the optimistic basis that real growth will then be running at 3 3/4 per cent. The sum total is a burden for the capital markets, which will necessitate a substantial shift of investment funds from equities into gilts. Ultimately this requires an increase in the real yield on gilts. That should happen naturally as inflation declines, however. So, assuming that the election result does not increase the risk of devaluation, the impact on actual prices may be more limited than the market currently fears. Eventually gilt yields would look particularly attractive compared with equities, especially since low cover ratios mean dividend growth is likely to be restrained for several years. At the very least the chances are that equities will respond more sluggishly than usual to economic upturn. The government's heavy financing programme may also make the equity market less receptive to rights issues, whether for balance sheet or acquisition purposes. Some might take comfort from the thought that this has been discounted in the steep falls since the Budget. In fact, the FT-SE is down by only just over 2 per cent over the week as a whole and is still more than 130 points above last December's low. If the weekend polls bring a fresh bout of political nerves, the market may have further to fall.</p>

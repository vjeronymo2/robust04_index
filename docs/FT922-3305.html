			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / US interest rate hopes hit by price rises RISING wholesale prices in the US last month have reopened the possibility that inflation will revive, and have helped to dampen expectations of further cuts in interest rates. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said producer prices rose 0.4 per cent last month, the sharpest rise in the past 18 months. The rise took the year-on-year wholesale inflation rate from 0.9 per cent in April to 1.1 per cent in May. While this is still a low increase, it sounds a note of caution to those who have been urging the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further in order to help along the faltering US recovery. Advocates of a reduction in interest rates might otherwise have drawn encouragement from the disappointingly weak level of retail sales last month. The Commerce Department said its advance estimates put May retail sales at Dollars 158.8bn (Pounds 87.2bn), just 0.2 per cent higher than April's Dollars 158.5bn - itself revised down from an earlier estimate. Economists have been expecting indicators of consumption such as retail sales to show slower growth in the second quarter than in the first, but they had still hoped for a more robust performance than yesterday's statistics indicate. Some analysts, however, commented that the apparent surge in producer prices presented little threat of a rise in inflation. They pointed out that much of the rise could be attributed to increases last month of 3 per cent in civilian aircraft prices and 7.3 per cent in tobacco products. But others noted that May's statistics showed the core inflation rate, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose to 2.8 per cent year on year, after months of stability at 2.4 per cent.</p>

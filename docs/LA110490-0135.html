			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: WHITNEY HOUSTON'S DARING NEW MOVE?;  </P> <P> ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> ** 1/2 WHITNEY HOUSTON "I'm Your Baby Tonight" Arista  </P> <P> Houston has always liked to dance -- with somebody who loves her, if we  remember correctly -- but until now even her most upbeat numbers had more of a  light-handed pop touch than a hard-core R&amp;B jackhammer attack. No more.  </P> <P> For three key selections on her third album, Houston has hired hot producing  team L.A. Reid &amp; Babyface to pump up her formerly less-than-formidable  dance tracks. Houston's last album sold so well and produced such a phenomenal  string of hit singles that any tampering with the formula has to be considered  much more daring than desperate, to the extent that it pushes some of the  "adult contemporary" pop aside.  </P> <P> How does it work? With the lead track and first single, "I'm Your Baby  Tonight," just swimmingly. It's a swooning ballad of complete romantic  acquiescence, with the beat magnified to dance-floor level -- a memorable song  charming enough to click arranged in any number of genres, but especially  seductive done up with that energy.  </P> <P> Nothing else on the album quite approaches that immediate peak -- not the other  Reid &amp; Babyface numbers, and especially not the standard ballads. The irony  is that the dance tunes are most exciting, but could just as easily be backing  tracks for En Vogue; the ballads show her talent off to greater effect, yet are  written with foremost banal anonymity. Star contributions by Stevie Wonder  (singing a duet) and Luther Vandross are engaging, if far from classic. The  question still remains: Is Houston a great empty vessel? CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Irada Gurbanova: "Russian Parliamentarians' </F> Visit"]    [Text] On 28 May, Russian parliamentarians met with  representatives of the Russian-speaking population of  Azerbaijan. The meeting, which was held last Saturday in the  Gyulistan Palace, was attended by A. Dzhalilov, deputy chairman  of the Azerbaijani Supreme Council. M. Zabelin, an Azerbaijani  Supreme Council deputy and the chairman of the Russian  community, delivered the introductory address. Having introduced  the guests, he described the purpose of their visit--to learn  the truth about the sociopolitical situation in the republic so  that they could later bring to every Russian the truth about the  Karabakh conflict, the everyday life of the Russians living  here. The meeting proceeded on a very friendly note.    The Russian parliamentarians came to this meeting straight  from the reception by the republic's president, G. Aliyev. The  prominent theme in the meeting was that the main pain for the  Russians in Azerbaijan is the same as for all Azerbaijani  people--the six-year-old Armenian aggression and its terrible  consequences, as well as one-sided, and often distorted,  coverage of it by Russian mass media.    We all know what broad activities members of the Russian  community (created at the initiative of Azerbaijan-Russia  Society) and the Sodruzhestvo Slavic Culture Center have  launched outside of the republic for the purpose of breaking  through the information blockade and establishing connections  with Russia. And this is very understandable: Those for whom  Azerbaijan is home, regardless of their ethnic identification,  cannot help but be concerned over everything that is happening  to their homeland. And do not members of other ethnic groups,  first and foremost Russians, fight together with sons of  Azerbaijani people for the independence and territorial  integrity of their republic? In the Alley of Martyrs, next to  National Heroes of Azerbaijan E. Yakhyayev and H. Hasanov, also  lie National Heroes of Azerbaijan Yu. Kovalenko (his mother was  present at the meeting) and V. Plotnikov.    Both Russian parliamentarians and meeting participants said  that Armenians actively use Russian arms and mercenaries, and  that the fact of aggression has not yet been recognized by any  international document because the war is conducted not by  regular troops but by gangster formations.    L. Morozova, a deputy chairman of Azerbaijan's Russian  community, said that as a head of the Azerbaijani delegation she  had traveled through all the North Caucasus, meeting with  Cossack atamans and heads of oblasts and krays, and through them  she learned that Armenians, taking advantage of privatization,  buy up real estate literally for peanuts. In addition, she  presented a newspaper, which published a report that a deputy  minister of the Armenian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] had  issued a decree on placing settlers in all these oblasts. In a  couple of years, she warned, a new Karabakh may quite easily  emerge in the North Caucasus. And for some reason, Armenian  genocide toward the Azerbaijani people still has not been  recognized. While at the same time life in Shusha is vibrant,  tourists are invited to visit, enterprises are being built, and  landmarks of cultural history are entered in registers as  Armenian.    Having angrily denounced Armenian aggression against  Azerbaijan and supporting the course taken by the farsighted  politician G. Aliyev, the Russians living in Azerbaijan called  on their compatriots to support the protest, to take a stand  against Armenian occupiers seizing the territory of others,  against brutality perpetrated upon the Azerbaijani civilian  population. To this Russian parliamentarians said that they will  resolutely support the efforts to achieve the quickest possible  peace and accord on the soil of Azerbaijan.    It was also noted that Azerbaijan is a motherland for all  its  inhabitants, and regardless of their nationality all its  citizens enjoy equal rights.    Among other issues brought up in the course of the meeting  was education in the Russian language. In particular, it was  said that although Russian classes in schools and Russian groups  in institutes are now smaller in numbers, none of the Russian  schools have been closed to this day. This can happen soon,  however, since Russia now sells Russian-language textbooks for  hard currency, which we cannot afford.    Most questions asked by journalists revolved around bringing  Russian forces into Azerbaijan with the status of peacekeeping  forces.    Naturally, the lack of continuous information is capable of  inflaming passions around one or another event. People in the  republic have long stopped reading Russian newspapers. And those  that occasionally are available for sale do not add much  clarity. Plus, opposition press reports sometimes are quite  arguable, and quite often are unsubstantiated.    Apparently, this has prompted such an interest in the  question of bringing in peacekeeping forces, to which the  concrete answer was given that Russian troops are not going to  be brought here.    At the end of the meeting Supreme Council Deputy Chairman A.  Dzhalilov congratulated everyone on the occasion of the  holiday--Republic Day--and thanked Russian parliamentarians for  mutual understanding and the Russians for participation in the  meeting, and promised that all the issues raised by them will be  resolved at state level.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Growth slows at Bangkok Bank BANGKOK Bank has reported third-quarter results which confirm that deregulation has yet to make a significant impact on the country's 15 listed banks, although profits growth is slowing. South-east Asia's biggest bank lifted unconsolidated net profits to Bt3.31bn (Dollars 133m) from Bt2.8bn in the same period last year. Mr George Huebsch, Union Securities' head of research, said Bangkok Bank's profits, like those of the whole sector, were feeling the affects of slower loan growth and a narrower spread between lending and deposit rates. 'The economy is coasting and some banks' clients have been lost to foreign banks or used debt instruments to raise money,' according to Mr Huebsch. However the latest results from Bangkok Bank are in line with his full-year forecast of a 23 per cent rise in profits to Bt13.36bn, compared with Bt10.54bn in 1992. Thailand's other leading banks have also reported third-quarter results: Siam Commercial Bank's net profits climbed by 9.2 per cent to Bt1.21bn: Thai Farmers Bank's profits rose 10 per cent to Bt1.67bn; Krung Thai Bank showed a 27 per cent gain to Bt1.35bn; Bank of Ayudha saw a modest 0.9 per cent advance to Bt706m and Thai Military Bank reported a 78 per cent increase to Bt681m. Mr Graheame Catterwell, country manager for Crosby Research, said new lending income from the recently introduced Bangkok International Banking Facility should come through in the next quarter. 'Some people say Thai banks are going to fade - that's nonsense as these figures show. Thirty per cent growth may be slower but they are still extraordinarily profitable,' said Mr Catterwell. The slowdown in lending was most apparent in the Siam Commercial Bank where loan growth slipped to only 2.6 per cent in the quarter.</p>

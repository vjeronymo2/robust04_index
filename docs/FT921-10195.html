			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading TRADING in stock index futures was characterised by two-way business with little in the way of features, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 2,561, at a premium of 26 to the cash market, the March FT-SE contract ran into sellers early on and soon fell to 2,550, the low of the day, as the underlying cash market attempted a rally. Strong two-way business prevented further falls in the contracts, though County NatWest was reported to have been the big seller before Wall Street's opening. A modest recovery in March was curtailed by the poor Wall Street opening. Dealers reported an increase in spread trading. March eventually closed at 2,567 unchanged on Wednesday's close and 17 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 16. Turnover reached 7,224 lots. In traded options, volume rose to 25,380 contracts, up from Wednesday's meagre 18,099. The FT-SE 100 Index traded 7,322 contracts while the Euro FT-SE traded 1,988. BT was the busiest stock option trading 1,365 lots with the February 330 calls the busiest series. This was followed by Cable and Wireless. It traded 1,261 contracts with the April 600 calls active.</p>

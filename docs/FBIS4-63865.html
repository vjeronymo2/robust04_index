			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kuzmin] </F>   [Text] Vienna 25 May TASS -- The situation in the Crimea  was discussed at a session of the standing committee of the  Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe here on  Wednesday [25 May].    According to diplomatic circles, it was acting chairman of  the standing committee -- the main CSCE body for holding  political consultations -- who proposed to consider the issue at  the session.    Representatives of 17 countries took part in the discussion  on the Crimean issue. According to a Russian delegate, the  Russian position in respect of the sovereign republic of Crimea,  a constituent part of Ukraine, has not changed. Such legal  principles of CSCE, as territorial integrity and inviolability  of existing borders, should be observed when trying to settle  the problem. It is necessary to exclude resorting to force or  threats to resort to forceful methods in attempt to solve  emerging political problems.    The participants also discussed a draft resolution of the  CSCE standing committee and decided to postpone its adoption on  Thursday.    The draft resolution focusses attention on the role CSCE may  play in preventing further aggravation of the conflict in view  of the current situation in Crimea and available opportunities  for a peaceful settlement of disputable issues.</p>

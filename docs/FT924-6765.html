			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Hungary moves to broaden debt market HUNGARY is poised to broaden significantly its government debt market by issuing the country's first state bonds to have a maturity of five years and be accessible to foreign investors. Finance ministry officials and underwriters were still finalising terms yesterday evening, but participants said they expected the issue to be of the order of Ft7bn (Dollars 84m), to bear a coupon of 16 per cent and to be priced at or just below par. The issue, if the two sides reach agreement, will be only the second fixed-rate government bond issue. The authorities launched the market in October with a three-year bond with a step-down coupon of 21, 17 and 14 per cent. The government also placed 10-year paper with AB-Aegon, Hungary's largest insurer, but this issue is not traded. Treasury bills are issued regularly for maturities of one to 12 months. Brokers had hoped that the forthcoming five-year bond would flesh out the debt market and allow the construction of a genuine yield curve. But some said that the government's aggressive pricing is likely to distort and depress the yield, to leave it lower than that for both shorter-term and longer-term debt. The prospective government debt instrument is also the first which foreign investors can buy directly, and so participate in Hungary's most active and liquid securities market. Banque Indosuez Hungary, the local subsidiary of France's Banque Indosuez, is part of the underwriting consortium handling the international tranche. International institutions were previously restricted to indirect investment in government debt through locally-based funds such as that set up earlier this year by CA Securities, the investment banking arm of Austria's Creditanstalt. The authorities also restricted non-Hungarians to 20 per cent in any such fund.</p>

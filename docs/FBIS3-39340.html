Madrid says the four applicants are all likely net  contributors to the EU budget and that the resulting cash  payments should go to the poorer member states, including  Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.    The intervention has dismayed other EU states who fear a  budget row might sink the chance of meeting the March 1 deadline  required for enlargement to go ahead in January 1995.    The accession negotiations in Brussels are finely poised,  with hard bargaining taking place over regional aid and special  assistance to Nordic farmers. An internal budget row could  wreck an early conclusion of the talks.    Estimates of how much the Swedes, Finns, Austrians and  Norwegians are likely to contribute to the EU's ECU70bn budget  are still preliminary. Some figures suggest cash transfers  might range between ECU2bn and ECU4bn a year, depending on their  economic output.    The UK and Germany are already restive about the amount of  money the EU sends to southern Europe. British estimates range  from ECU7m daily to Greece and Portugal, and ECU13m a day to  Spain.    In December 1992, Spain withheld its support for early  enlargement negotiations until it won backing from its partners  for a "cohesion fund" for special transfers to the EU budget  from the rich north and centre to be funnelled to the south.    Last week in Brussels, Spain indicated it would like its  partners to agree on the principle that all net contributions  from applicant states should be used to "top up" the cohesion  fund.    Some EU delegations were left with the impression that Spain  wants an agreement on the exact level of individual  contributions from Nordic and Alpine states. "That would  scupper any chance of meeting the March 1 deadline," said one  Brussels official.    A Spanish official declined to confirm or deny the country's  position on the applicant countries' net budget payments.    Spain has taken a consistently tough line in the enlargement  negotiations, partly because it is worried that the momentum  toward European integration is moving decisively northward.    Last year, Spain insisted that the applicants be left out of  the Maastricht treaty's mechanisms for setting up a single  European currency. It still says only the 12 should be  considered eligible for European monetary union.</p>

The investigation is being carried out by researchers from  various institutes under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and  some universities.    Scientists on the investigation team say that they have  completed the first-phase work of outdoor collection of data and  samples for the "systematic research of the formation,  evolution, environmental changes and ecology of the  Qinghai-Tibet Plateau". The scheme has been listed into the  state's Eighth Five-Year-Plan period (1991- 1995).    The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau starts from the Kunlun mountain  range in the north and ends at the Himalaya mountain range in  the south. The plateau has a total area of 2.5 million sq km and  an average elevation of 4,000 m.    Initial surveys started last year, and latest scientific  research reveals that conditions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau  have a great impact on the climate and environment of the entire  globe, especially the direction of monsoons and the climate of  the hinterland of the Asian Continent.</p>

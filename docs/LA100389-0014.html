			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> "NBC Nightly News" is experimenting with ways to improve the mix and pace of  stories in the nightly newscast. News executives have been looking at various  sample versions of a newscast that would include re-edited versions of pieces  that have appeared on "Nightly News." Some stories have been shortened, while  other investigative pieces have been lengthened in the experimental versions.  "This is normal fine-tuning," says executive producer Bill Wheatley. "There are  no radical changes afoot." With increased competition from other TV news  sources, the three network newscasts in recent years have been promoting  issue-oriented series on suchsubjects as the environment, drugs and education.  Although "Nightly News" recently ranked No. 2 in the nightly news ratings, it  has been in third place against newscasts on ABC and CBS. NBC has been No. 1 in  prime time for many months.

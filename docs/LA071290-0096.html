			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER MEDFLY IN MUCH-SPRAYED ROSEMEAD;  </P> <P> INFESTATION: DISCOVERY TRIGGERS FEARS OF A SUMMER POPULATION EXPLOSION. A NEW  ROUND OF MALATHION APPLICATIONS IS LIKELY.  </P> <P> Agriculture officials reported Wednesday that another Mediterranean fruit fly  has been trapped in Rosemead, virtually assuring a new round of aerial  malathion applications in what was one of the most heavily sprayed sectors in a  yearlong eradication effort across Southern California.  </P> <P> The discovery reinforced fears among scientists and community activists that  the state's strategy in fighting the pest has failed.  </P> <P> It was the second fly trapped in Rosemead in a week. Moreover, officials  announced late Wednesday that what was tentatively identified as a Medfly had  been discovered in Central Los Angeles. Entomologists hypothesize that every  Medfly trapped signals the presence of hundreds more of the insects.  </P> <P> Some of the state's scientific advisers said that the latest Rosemead discovery  is a distressing sign that the pest may be on the verge of a summer population  boom. A similar explosion last summer eventually led to widespread spraying  across the region.  </P> <P> James R. Carey, one of five members of the state's Medfly Science Advisory  Panel, has said that over the last 15 years the vast majority of Medflies found  in California were trapped in August, September and October, when warm  temperatures and an abundance of ripe fruit offer ideal breeding conditions.  </P> <P> "We're only in the foothills," Carey said Wednesday. "The peak is in September  and October. It's very possible this could grow as large as before."  </P> <P> Carey and the four other members of the state's advisory panel, which oversees  the eradication effort, participated Wednesday in a telephone conference to  discuss a new battle plan to combat the pest. They were unavailable for comment  afterward.  </P> <P> But state Department of Food and Agriculture Director Henry J. Voss said the  panel recommended that the Rosemead neighborhood be sprayed twice and then  treated with the release of sterile flies intended to breed the pest out of  existence.  </P> <P> Voss said plans already were being laid to spray malathion in the area on  Monday, although he said his final decision will come today after a related  court hearing in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Our concern is that with the hot weather and with these flies popping up now,  we need to be right on them," Voss said. "It's not a very satisfying situation,  that's for sure."  </P> <P> Carey said: "This is the beginning of Round 2."  </P> <P> Just hours after announcement of the Rosemead discovery, state officials said  they had found yet another Medfly about three miles north of where a single fly  was in Echo Park two weeks ago. Officials said identification of the fly was  not completely certain, so no decision has yet been made on what action to  take.  </P> <P> In Rosemead, the single mated female Medfly was trapped in a nectarine tree  just north of Interstate 10, three blocks from where a fly was trapped last  week. The first Medfly normally would have prompted an order for spraying, but  a decision was delayed because scientists were unable to make a complete  identification of the specimen.  </P> <P> Complicating the Rosemead situation is an ongoing attempt by the city of Los  Angeles to obtain a court order to block spraying over a 14-square-mile sector  of downtown, including Echo Park, Silver Lake, Chinatown, Bunker Hill and Skid  Row. That spraying is scheduled to begin tonight and continue every Thursday  night for at least three weeks.  </P> <P> The city has asked a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge to block the  spraying. It contends that recent laboratory tests have shown excessive  quantities of lead, nickel and chromium in the sticky mixture of malathion and  fly bait sprayed by state-chartered helicopters.  </P> <P> State health officials say the amounts are minor and pose no significant health  risks.  </P> <P> Voss said that a ruling by Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski could influence  his decision on what to do in the Rosemead outbreak.  </P> <P> The new discoveries came just as it appeared Southern California was on verge  of victory over the stubborn infestation. At the height of the yearlong siege,  helicopters rumbled over 536 square miles of Los Angeles, Orange, San  Bernardino and Riverside counties. The malathion treatment zone had shrunk to  nothing over the last two weeks, after spraying was completed in San Bernardino  and Riverside counties on June 26.  </P> <P> For residents of Los Angeles and Rosemead living near the latest discoveries,  the possibility of more spraying brought frustration.  </P> <P> The neighborhood near Dodger Stadium where a Medfly was found June 27 was the  first one sprayed when the infestation began last year.  </P> <P> Rosemead -- along with parts of Pasadena, El Monte and Arcadia -- was sprayed  10 times from November through May -- still a record in the current  infestation.  </P> <P> "There's no question now that this program doesn't work," said Patty Prickett,  who chairs a community group called Residents Against Spraying Pesticides. "All  it's done is taken millions of dollars of taxpayers' money and exposed people  to a toxic chemical. It's a disaster."  </P> <P> Carrol Calkins, a federal entomologist who serves on the advisory panel, said  scientists had expected to find more flies this summer, but the hope was that  they would be limited to new areas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> They're Back  </P> <P> Two Mediterranean fruit flies have been discovered in the past two weeks in  Rosemead. The Medflies were trapped within the old Rosemead spray zone, which  was sprayed 10 times from November, 1989, to May. Spraying was halted in the  zone on May 9 after the pest was supposedly eradicated from the area.  </P> <P> Medfly Spraying Map, B2  </P></p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Senator on bribe charge A lawyer for Mr Maurice Arreckx, the Riviera senator detained on Monday on a charge of soliciting a FFr1.5m (Pounds 180,000) bribe to award a public contract, said yesterday his 76-year-old client had prostate cancer and should not be confined to prison, adding that government ministers facing more serious charges remained free. But Mr Arreckx's detention has been approved by his fellow senators, who heeded the warning of the Toulon investigating magistrate that, if left free during the inquiry, the veteran politician might seek to intimidate witnesses or tamper with evidence. The case against Mr Arreckx arose out of an investigation into corruption in the Var, following the assassination there last spring of deputy Mrs Yann Piat.</p>

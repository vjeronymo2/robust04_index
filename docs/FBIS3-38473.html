			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "HB": "Economic Upturn in West Assumes </F> Sharper Contours"]    [Text] In February, the HANDESLBLATT economic barometer  registered a further improvement, although there was some  variation between the individual indicators making up the  overall reading. As was the case in January, there was an  improvement of 0.3 percent compared to the previous month. Now,  at -0.2 percent, it is just below zero. Thus, the figure for  February of last year, -1 percent, has been markedly exceeded.  Since September, the barometer reading has been improving from  month to month. The latest developments indicate that the  economy was at its lowest point in the final quarter of 1993.    The upturn is also in no small way due to a shift toward a  more positive mood in the west German economy. The Ifo  economics institute business climate index for manufacturing  industry has been on a course pointing to recovery for the past  eight months. What is also important from the point of view of  the economic climate is that business expectations for the  coming six months have also improved once again.    There was a sharp rise in demand for construction industry  services in October, and such demand rose highest in the  non-housing construction sector. By contrast, demand for  manufacturing, which is sensitive to price and seasonal factors,  was slack in November. Both domestic and foreign orders were  somewhat lower than in October. Nevertheless, demand from  abroad is continuing on an upward trend.    The retail sector remained on its low October level in  November. Thus, in real terms, sales were significantly lower  than a year ago. This trend was to some extent offset by the gap  between short and long-term interest rates closing to -0.51  percent in December. However, the structure of interest rates  was still inverse at the end of 1993.    So, positive and negative tendencies exist side by side in  the current economic situation -- that is, if one concentrates  solely on the latest data. However, in the medium term,  positive factors prevail in the overall picture. The shift  toward a feeling of greater optimism, which has been apparent  for some months, has exercised a strong influence in this  respect. Ultimately, how investors and consumers view the  future can, above all, lead the economy out of the recession.    Currently, export orders appear to be providing the greatest  anti-recessionary stimulus, but with low interest rates and  declining inflation, the economy also seems set on a positive  course in domestic terms. Thus, the increase in optimism in the  economy is not only a matter of psychology but also has a very  real basis.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Miroslaw Usidus: "Church Well-Wishing but Also </F> Cautious"]    [Text] To win the trust of the church, it is not enough to  show up in a cathedral a few times and take a picture of oneself  with a cardinal. That is the opinion of right-wing politicians.  Such is also, more or less, the conclusion expressed in a  statement by Primate Jozef Glemp upon his return from a visit to  Germany.    The right word here is trust because the church protested  against the word "support." The Christian-National Union [ZChN]  won the sympathy of priests with their firm fight for issues  that party activists, judging from the statements of hierarchy  representatives, consider important. The ZChN was accused of  blindly following the church of defending everything that was  said to be its stance or in its interest. Common are opinions  that this devotion paid off to the party of Jurek and  Niesiolowski. In the 1991 elections, many representatives of  the clergy portrayed to believers the election list of the  Electoral Catholic Action, established by the ZChN, as the right  list to choose.    The celebration of the 100th anniversary of the peasant  movement in the Warsaw cathedral, declarations (in the  statements of leaders, at least) of the desire to defend the  Concordat, statements protecting money collected at church  Masses from tax, references to the image of a traditionally  religious peasant who is tied to the belief of his forefathers  as much as he is to his land--as a result of all this...  <H5>  A Faint Odor of Incense </H5>   ...has began to surround the Polish Peasant Party [PSL].    It is difficult to say how many representatives of the  clergy  have been influenced by it. There are priests, such as the  well-known Boguslaw Bijak, who have been engaged in the policy  of improving relations with the peasants for a long time. Many  examples of contacts between peasant activists and rural priests  are no secret. All the same, it is not very likely that the  church will get really involved in the coming self-governmental  elections, or in any other elections in the near future.    Representatives of the hierarchy are rather cautious. "I do  not know whether this is merely a demonstration or the real and  true attachment of a great number of people--of farmers or  people linked to farming--which is tied to the church," says  Cardinal Jozef Glemp.    Caution as well as friendliness is also recommended by  rightist politicians, traditionally linked to the church. "It  is a very good thing that the PSL is willing to defend Catholic  interests," says Marek Jurek. "However, we must wait and see  how it will react to really important issues, such as the  defense of the unborn."    He believes that neither the members of the party, where one  can come across "former members of the Polish United Workers'  Party," nor the roots of Pawlak's party, "which stems from SL  Wola [not further identified] or from PSL-Liberation," nor the  behavior of the PSL Deputies' Club when the antiabortion bill  was being considered, guarantee that the PSL will defend  Catholic tenets in politics.  <H5>  We Do Not Envy, We Are Not Surprised </H5>   Rightist politicians give assurances that the increasingly  closer relations between the PSL and the church are not a cause  of envy or surprise for them. "The church cannot afford to be  in conflict with the establishment [preceding word in English];  it has certain things to see through, such as the Concordat; the  PSL may become a supporter of the church. In the doctrinal  sense, it is enough to broaden the peasants' economic  antiliberalism with philosophical antiliberalism--to transform  from a party of young Boryna [a peasant character in Polish  literature] to a party of old Boryna," explains one of the  coalition politicians.    More radical PSL activists, such as Jacek Soska, do not like  the party's gravitation toward Christian-national positions.  This is not only because they differ as far as the diagnosis  concerning the party's electorate's expectations is concerned;  they also first of all ask what their party will gain if it  develops closer relations with the church. The question that is  frequently asked is whether the PSL, in fact, needs the special  favors of the church. As is often recalled, this party won  voters with its criticism of the economic policy of the  Solidarity governments. It did not really get very deep into the  philosophical side of things.</p>

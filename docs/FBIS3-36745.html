			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Latvian Foreign Ministry issued a statement  today concerning the claims made by Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev in an interview with the U.S. journal NEWSWEEK.  As the Foreign Ministry statement says, in the interview  Kozyrev reported that Latvia is attempting to deport thousands  of people to Russia, which he called ethnic cleansing. In this  connection, the Latvian Foreign Ministry states that these  claims are baseless. The Latvian Government, reacting to  statements of this kind from Russian officials, has repeatedly  pointed out that allegations of ethnic cleansing do not  correspond to the truth, the document emphasizes. The Latvian  Foreign Ministry believes that the attitude expressed by the  Russian Foreign Ministry proves that senior Russian officials  are blatantly ignoring the conclusions of international  institutions at several levels regarding the real human rights  situation in Latvia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Summary of interview with Yi Chong-kok, defector from North </F> Korea, by SANKEI SHIMBUN correspondent Katsuhiro Kuroda in  Seoul; date not given]    [Text] Seoul, 29 April -- Yi Chong-kok, 25, a defector  from North Korea, recently granted an interview to SANKEI  SHIMBUN. Yi used to belong to the Nuclear and Chemical Defense  Bureau within the Korean People's Armed Forces General Staff  (defense ministry). Explaining recent military and social  affairs in North Korea, he said: "Money has begun to rule  society." Yi is an unmarried "middle-class officer," which is  equivalent to a noncommissioned officer. While he was posted to  the "Antinuclear and Antiatom Analysis Institute" [name as  published] in Pyongyang, he crossed the PRC-North Korean border  and entered South Korea via the PRC in March this year. The  following are questions and answers from the interview.    [Kuroda] Are there any recent changes in North Korean  society?    [Yi] The people have begun to think money is everything. In  the past, party members and university graduates were considered  as ideal partners for marriage. Now people care whether or not  he has money. If you have money, you can do everything. You  can get promoted and obtain a job. The people have begun to  have a keen interest in money. Everybody, including senior  party and government officials as well as farmers, hopes to  conduct black-marketeering. Black-marketeering is called "yami"  in North Korea. It has been rumored that former Prime Minister  Yon Hyong-muk was dismissed from his post because his wife  committed irregularities when she exchanged old currencies for  new.    [Kuroda] How is the food and energy situation?    [Yi] Rice had been rationed in Pyongyang until 1990. Since  1991, there has been no rice rationing during the May-June  off-season. Another event shows the North's poverty. After  inspecting a front-line unit in October 1992, Vice Premier Kim  Pok-sin told President Kim Il-song that the guards in the unit  wore shoes made of tree bark; he appealed to the president with  tears in his eyes that the unit was in need of food.  Immediately after this, military shoes and rice were sent to  the unit.    Last July, Pyongyang celebrated the 40th anniversary of the  Korean war armistice, but without the usual large parade of  military vehicles such as tanks. This was due to the oil  shortage.    [Kuroda] Do you know anything about the DPRK's nuclear  development?    [Yi] Judging from the atmosphere within the military, I  firmly believe nuclear weapons have already been developed.  Encouraged by the fact that Iraq secretly promoted the  development of nuclear weapons while accepting nuclear  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency,  high-ranking officers in my unit said: "We can also deceive the  international community."    I also heard that, after a U.S. satellite spotted a nuclear  facility in Yongbyon around the autumn of 1992, the facility was  covered with trees.    [Kuroda] What about the "combat readiness" assumed by North  Korea after it declared its withdrawal from the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty last March?    [Yi] At that time, the military held a large rally with  President Kim (supreme commander of the Korean People's Army)  attending. During the rally they sang "There Will Be No  Homeland Without You" and "The People Will Continue To Believe  in General Kim Chong-il Even If the World Changes 100 Times"  while shedding tears. They said they could believe neither  Russia nor China.    The general opinion is that "waging a war may not be a bad  idea" to pull the nation out of poverty. But I often heard  military officers questioning "if we really can win a war."  Nobody believes the government's propaganda about South Korea,  which Pyongyang says is prepared to wage an aggressive war  against the North.    [Kuroda] It is said the Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau  was engaged in research on chemical (poison-gas) weapons.    [Yi] The bureau is engaged in research and production of  almost all kinds of poison gas, including yperite. It can load  poison gas on shells, bombs, and missiles.    [Kuroda] Do you know anything about these missiles?    [Yi] We call them "SKUD's (he meant SCUD's)." Those SKUD's  exported during the Iran-Iraq war caused trouble because of the  missile's low probability of hitting targets. There are missile  bases at Hamchun and Hwadae in North Hamgyong Province on the  east coast, and at Chongchu in North Pyongan Province on the  west coast. It is said the missiles from these bases can reach  Okinawa and even Guam. I heard the missiles at a base in  Chagang Province, which is located along the China-North Korea  border, are targeted on China.    [Kuroda] Is there a possibility the structure of the DPRK  will change?    [Yi] North Koreans know China has become affluent. Thus,  many have voiced their strong hope that Pyongyang will adopt an  open-door policy like China. Nevertheless, President Kim and  his son will not open up the country because they give priority  to maintaining the current structure. In view of the close and  constant watch system in the North, I believe the current  structure will be maintained for at least another three years.</p>

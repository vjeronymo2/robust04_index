			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / China's economic tsar quick to assert authority IT IS LESS than a week since Mr Zhu Rongji was invested with the responsibility of taming China's runaway economy, but in keeping with a reputation for decisiveness he has wasted little time in outlining his strategy. In a tough speech yesterday to government officials, Mr Zhu, senior vice-premier and newly appointed governor of the central bank, said: 'China must rectify financial order and strengthen financial discipline.' While China's official media gave only sketchy details of Mr Zhu's remarks, he has indicated there will be further increases in interest rates, cuts in government spending, a tighter squeeze on new credit, stricter controls on non-bank financial intermediaries, and a crackdown on dubious fund-raising schemes such as enterprise bonds. China's leaders have been panicked by a series of financial scandals and signs of chaos in the banking system. Mr Zhu's main tasks will be to restore order to the financial sector, while preserving market reforms that are the basis of China's opening to the outside world. China is also planning to overhaul its tax system in an effort to boost receipts. Tax authorities have failed to keep pace with the explosion of activity in the past year, with the economy continuing to surge ahead at rates exceeding 13 per cent in the first five months of this year. Mr Zhu, 65, has expressed particular concern about rampant speculation in real estate, and lax controls over China's fledgling stock markets. He is certain to add his weight to efforts to strengthen the regulatory environment. He would know that, with inflation spiralling towards 20 per cent in the cities and amid signs of increasing unrest among hard-pressed farmers, that he has little time to waste. He would also be aware that he has been handed something of a poisoned chalice in his efforts to cure China's economic ills. Success would confirm his status in the front rank of Chinese leaders, and strengthen his claims to the premiership. Failure would be penalised. Among China's ruling seven-man standing committee of the politburo, Mr Zhu is almost certainly best-qualified for the task of bringing order to the economy. But it is also a measure of the paucity of talent at the top that one man is being invested with such broad responsibilities. Not least of his problems are the high expectations attached to confirmation of his role as China's economic tsar. Indeed, Beijing's propaganda mill wasted little time trumpeting his qualities. Xinhua, the New China news agency, hailed his appointment and said he was noted for his 'decisive handling of affairs'. His official biography speaks of a 'learned man' who excels in economics and technological matters. Mr Zhu, who was born in Changsha near Mao Zedong's birthplace, would not need reminding of the fickleness of Chinese politics, having spent years in the wilderness in the 1960s and 1970s after criticising government economic policy. China's new central bank governor is a former mayor and party boss of Shanghai, where he earned a reputation as a bold reformist. An engineering graduate from Qinghua University, one of China's leading institutions, he has also served as a vice-minister of the State Economic Commission. Fluent in English, he has impressed foreign visitors. He has also travelled extensively - for a Chinese leader - and has visited Europe, North and South America and Australia in the past few years. He is a protege of Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, who launched the country's latest economic spurt last year with instructions to officials to speed reform. But Mr Zhu is also known to have been urging for some time tougher action to restrain the economy. He is now being given the opportunity, belatedly perhaps, to assert the control he has been advocating.</p>

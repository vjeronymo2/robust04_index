			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE COVER  </P> <P> Prime time is of the essence for Diane Sawyer.  </P> <P> The former "60 Minutes" correspondent, who signed a reported $1.6-million  annual pact with ABC in February, joins Sam Donaldson as co-anchor of the  network's new "PrimeTime Live," a news magazine that debuts Thursday at 10 p.m.  on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42.  </P> <P> Sawyer and Donaldson will host the series in front of a studio audience in New  York. They will offer a mix of topical stories, investigative pieces and live  reporting. As the title suggests, the programs will be live broadcasts, though  viewers on the West Coast will see them on a tape-delay basis.  </P> <P> And with NBC's "L.A. Law" and CBS' "Knots Landing" as competition come fall,  ABC has done no favors for Sawyer and Donaldson. But who knows? Perhaps their  time has come. . . . STEVEN LINAN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Colombo, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Sri Lanka's main  opposition leader Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike will soon decide  whether she or her daughter Chandrika should run as Freedom  Party (SLFP) candidate at the next presidential election, party  sources here said today.    Bandaranaike was unanimously named party presidential  candidate few months ago but the 78-year old leader who was  twice premier in the island country is under increasing pressure  to step down in favor of her 47-year old daughter Chandrika who  is now the chief minister of Western Province.    But no one in the decision making Central Committee of the  party will openly ask Mrs. Bandaranake to withdraw from the  candidacy, and it is very much at her discretion to continue as  party presidential candidate or to step down in favor of her  daughter, a party insider told XINHUA.    Chandrika's chances as potential leader of the main  opposition freedom party received a new boost when she led her  party into a sweeping win at the March 23 southern provincial  election, the SLFP's only formidable election success against  the ruling United National Party (UNP) for last seventeen years.    Her chances in the party to succeed the mother also  increased  greatly since brother Anura Bandaranaike, her only challenger  crossed over to the government after much infighting, and  accepted higher education portfolio few months ago.    A national level meeting of SLFP's different organizational  bodies and elected members to be convened next week is expected  to discuss party strategy for next presidential election due  before December this year, and Mrs. Bandaranaike is likely to  make an important speech there, the sources said.</p>

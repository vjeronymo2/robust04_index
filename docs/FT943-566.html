			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Rail union leaders on brink of backing peace plan Rail union leaders were locked in discussion early this morning on the final details of a deal to end the four-month dispute which had been hammered out in seven days of talks at the conciliation service Acas. After many hours, the executive committee of the RMT transport union had still not been able to agree on whether to accept a complex productivity package presented to it by its negotiators. It was still expected that a deal could be put to the 4,600 Railtrack signal workers, possibly averting the further 48-hour stoppage planned to start at midnight tonight. The package would give the signal workers a substantial increase in their basic rates of pay, as well as improved benefits. In return, they would have to accept sweeping new working practices. If the union's executive backed the deal, it would be put to an immediate referendum of the signal workers, with the result expected within a few days. Railtrack, which operates the network's infrastructure, is believed to have required that the 48-hour strike should be called off as part of a settlement. Last night Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, was called in during the final hours of the marathon talks along with his 21-strong executive to approve the negotiated package. The left-dominated executive, which has remained united during the dispute, demanded that any deal for the signal workers should meet all their grievances, including a pay rise for past efficiencies. Meanwhile, as the signal workers' dispute appeared to be coming to an end, the RMT executive will turn its attention to the looming conflict on London Underground. This begins on Friday with a 24-hour stoppage that seems likely to paralyse a large part of the network. There are no immediate plans for a resumption of talks over the pay issue.

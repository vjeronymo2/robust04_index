			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT;  </P> <P> NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> New Park -- Plans for a county regional park bordering the Bolsa Chica wetlands  are scheduled to come up for discussion at Monday's 7 p.m. meeting of the  Huntington Beach City Council.  </P> <P> As proposed, the Huntington Beach Linear Park, as it is being called, would be  situated on 113 acres bounded by Pacific Coast Highway, Edwards Street, the  Garfield Avenue extension and the wetlands.  </P> <P> A 450-acre park was once envisioned, but plans have been pared down over the  years. Ralph Bauer, who heads a citizens committee on the park as part of the  Bolsa Chica Coalition, has expressed concern that the current calls for too  small a park, arguing that it should be increased to at least 154 acres, the  size targeted in a 1986 City Council resolution.  </P> <P> The park would serve as a place for hikers, joggers, bicyclists and horses, and  as a buffer between high-density housing and the wetlands, which would be  restored under a compromise reached this year. The park would also include  limited facilities such as picnic tables and a nature center for the adjacent  wetlands.  </P> <P> Also on the agenda Monday are plans for the neighboring Holly-Seacliff  development, which could bring as many as 5,000 homes into the area. According  to the plans, land owners the Huntington Beach Co., would donate 36 acres for  the park, a number Bauer would like to see increased.  </P></p>

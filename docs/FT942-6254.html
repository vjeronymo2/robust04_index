			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Europeans back enlargement despite doubts on Maastricht Europeans are doubtful that there will be a single currency by the end of the century, but favour EU enlargement by a wide margin, according to an FT opinion poll across all 12 EU members. The survey underlines how German voters seem to be joining traditionally Euro-sceptic electorates in Denmark and the UK in their antipathy towards closer integration along the lines of the Maastricht treaty. The poll was commissioned by the Financial Times and seven other European newspapers in advance of the European elections, to be held later this month. It was carried out last month through telephone interviews among a sample of 6,439 people by Harris Research. Only 8 per cent of respondents in western Germany, and 7 per cent of those in eastern Germany, believed that a single currency was 'very likely' in at least three EU member countries by the end of the century. Overall, 47 per cent of Europeans thought a single currency was likely by 2000, with 46 per cent saying it was unlikely. Revealingly, voters in Britain, who appear least in favour of the Maastricht treaty, hold the strongest belief that a single currency will be established by 2000. A total of 64 per cent of British respondents said a single currency was either 'very likely' or 'fairly likely' by then, compared with figures below 40 per cent in Germany, Denmark, Spain and Italy. The survey reveals a deep split on the desirability of fulfilling the Maastricht plan for European union. Respondents in the UK, Denmark and east and west Germany said by a roughly 2 to 1 margin that they were against the Maastricht arrangements, supporting a 'looser' Europe. Firmest support for Maastricht came from Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands, all in favour of closer integration by margins of 2 to 1 or more. On enlargement, 79 per cent of the EU electorate favoured the planned extension of the EU to Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria on January 1, with 9 per cent voicing opposition. Fifty per cent, with 30 per cent against, backed membership by former communist countries, with support greatest in Italy and east Germany. The poll indicates how years of powerfully voiced British doubts about European integration may have cost the UK influence. A large proportion of Europeans - 27 per cent of the French, 21 per cent of west Germans, 20 per cent of the Spanish and 19 per cent of Belgians - label Britain as the EU country they least trust. Britons also show considerable suspicion of other important EU partners, with 44 per cent and 24 per cent of Britons describing respectively France and Germany as the nations they least trust.

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / European airlines see recovery in business EUROPEAN AIRLINES have recovered from the collapse in business caused a year ago by the Gulf War. January saw 12.6 per cent more passenger traffic than a year earlier, when the Gulf War began, and a 6 per cent improvement on 1990, according to the Association of European Airlines (AEA). 'A measure of real market growth has resumed,' it said. The news follows figures from the International Air Transport Association, which showed a 14 per cent improvement in world air traffic over the depressed levels of January 1991. Apart from links to the Middle East, which jumped almost 80 per cent from a low level, the AEA said that links with Latin America remained the fastest growing area. This was the best performing sector during 1991 and January showed a 20.8 improvement over the same month of 1991. On the North Atlantic, the world's busiest long-haul route, traffic was 10 per cent up on 1991 and 8.6 per cent higher over two years. While the figures for passenger travel encouraged the AEA, the outlook for air freight was less favourable. January freight traffic was still 3 per cent below its level of two years earlier.</p>

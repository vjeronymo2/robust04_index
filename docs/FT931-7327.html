			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Ministers warned over Pounds 1bn EC aid MR BRUCE Millan, EC regional policy commissioner, yesterday confirmed the UK risked losing 'large' sums of Community aid for depressed regions unless it conformed to rules obliging member states to match Community funds. The commissioner has written to the British government seeking urgent talks following complaints from local authorities in the nine UK regions eligible for regional aid grants. Senior commission officials confirmed that up to Pounds 1bn earmarked for the UK has still to be disbursed - and could be lost if not committed to regional development schemes by the end of this year. 'If they don't want to lose the money they will have to do something about it,' Mr Millan said, although he added: 'Nobody is suggesting that they're going to lose everything.' The Department of Trade and Industry sought to play down the row saying funds would be matched - although final details have still to be agreed. The government came under attack, however, from Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour industry spokesman. In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, he said: 'It would be beyond the comprehension of the British public if, at a time of mounting unemployment, the actions of the British government deprived some of our most disadvantaged regions of EC regional aid.' The UK was assigned Ecu2.6bn (Pounds 2.14bn) in 1989-93 for the for the nine 'industrially declining' regions, ranging from Merseyside to Tyneside. At the end of last year Ecu1.91bn had been committed to development programmes in these regions, leaving Ecu691m for 1993. But by the end of last year only Ecu1.37bn had been distributed by Brussels, partly, a commission official confirmed, because of the 'matching funds' dispute. A total of Ecu1.23bn is still outstanding. Under EC rules community help for depressed regions must be matched by funding to local authorities provided by governments. Under UK practice all EC money is channelled through the Treasury. Brussels insists this means ineligible regions get some of it, and those which are eligible do not get their entitlement. The EC funds 'cannot just go into a Treasury pot,' Mr Millan said yesterday.</p>

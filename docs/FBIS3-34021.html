			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "On Wrong Track Again"] </F>   [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has effectively closed  the door on lifting or even relaxing the sanctions imposed on  Baghdad when he told U.S. congress Monday [31 January] that  Iraqi President Saddam Husayn is still determined to develop  nuclear weapons. This assessment came in spite of President  Clinton's assurance to his nation that Iraq's nuclear weapons  programme is "out of business" and Baghdad's official commitment  to put its entire weapons programme including its nuclear  capabilities, if any, under long-term international supervision.    Why then Washington still clings to its conviction that Iraq  continues to covet nuclear and other mass destruction arsenal  and therefore must be denied any relaxing of the punitive  measures is something that goes beyond reasonable comprehension.  State behaviour cannot be judged on metaphysical basis but  rather on hard evidence unless of course there is no intention  whatsoever to treat the Arab Gulf country differently no matter  how far it goes to meet its obligations under U.N. Security  Council resolutions. Since Iraq's mass destruction capabilities  are for all intents and purposes "out of business," and will be  monitored for as long as one can see, one fails to understand  how Washington or anybody else for that matter can rightly guess  the Iraqi intentions and find sinister plans in them.    The White House is also wrong in apportioning blame for the  suffering of the Iraqi masses as a result of the sanctions  solely on the Iraqi regime. Such a view is of little relief to  the greater majority of Iraqis who have not been able to find or  afford to buy basic medicines and food staples for over three  years now, given the fact that the regime in Baghdad is solidly  entrenched and has an effective grip on power, telling the  people that they have only their leadership to blame is of no  practical comfort. If pressure must continue to be applied  against the Iraqi regime under all circumstances there is a good  case for applying it in such a way as to minimise damage to the  innocent people. Such a distinction between ruler and ruled  could and should be made, and ways and means to give it effect  is obviously not beyond the ingenuity of the western nations  which still spearhead the hostile campaign against the country.    President Clinton was on stronger grounds when he called for  the introduction of pluralistic democracy to the country as a  condition for its full rehabilitation with the international  community. Baghdad has yet to make significant movement in the  direction of democracy and this is a source of alarm not only to  Washington but also to the entire region, not to mention its own  people. There is clearly no long-term solution to the problem  in that country as long as its people are denied democracy and  basic human rights. Meanwhile, however, no matter where the  responsibility lies, the Iraqi people themselves must enjoy the  right to feed themselves properly and find the necessary  medicines to treat the sick among them.</p>

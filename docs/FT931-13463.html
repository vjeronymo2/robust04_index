			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / US flying public unperturbed IF MR Richard Branson and his Virgin Atlantic airline have won a moral battle against British Airways' 'dirty tricks' campaign, the US flying public and media have taken little notice, Laurie Morse in New York writes. While the story is a drama of corporate sabotage and discovery, the US popular press has barely noticed the tiff. US business newspapers reported Virgin's January 11 court victory straight, with no moralising, and barely noted BA's second apology this week. Travel agents in New York said there was no sign of mass defections from BA in an exhibition of moral outrage. 'My clients all know it (the airline industry) is cut-throat,' said one Manhattan travel broker. 'This doesn't surprise any of them.' Not only is it not a surprise, other travel agents added, the court battle is largely irrelevant to travellers, who care more about price and service than moral rectitude when choosing an airline.</p>

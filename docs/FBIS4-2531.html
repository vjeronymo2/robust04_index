			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Ren Kan: "BOC's Arm in Britain Adds </F> Brawn"]    [Text] The Bank of China's London branch is seeking to  expand its merchant banking business to intensify its activities  in the world financial centre.    The branch has decided to set up a merchant banking division  and it is expected to play an important role in BOC's global  business, said Li Zhuangfei, assistant general manager of the  branch.    One focus of the new division will be structured financing,  including syndicated loans and aircraft leasing.    The branch has been engaged in this business for several  years. It has completed two major aircraft leasing deals, one  for Xiamen Airline and the other for Southern China Airlines.    Both of these entailed complicated structured financing  involving commercial lending, U.S. export credits, equity and  leasing.    The other area the branch is to concentrate on is corporate  financing, including advising European companies on doing  business with China and helping Chinese companies invest in  Europe.    Li said the branch is also interested in underwriting  China-related shares.    "We hope to help list Chinese shares on the London Stock  Exchange in the future," he said.    China has selected 22 domestic firms for possible listing  overseas this year.    Although most will be listed in Hong Kong, State securities  authorities have indicated that some will be listed in New York  and London.    Li said the Bank of China's London branch is now recruiting  staff in London and is applying for licensing.    "We know that our path will have many twists and turns, but  we are confident that we will reach our destination," he said.    The London branch was set up in November 1929, the first  overseas branch of the Bank of China.    The branch was originally staffed by only three English  bankers but has been expanding steadily and now employs 200  people.    It conducts a comprehensive range of businesses, including  savings and lending for the Chinese community in the United  Kingdom, trade settlement between China and Europe, foreign  exchange trading, inter-bank borrowing and interest rate swaps.    The branch has become an important member of London's  banking  community.    "Although we have achieved a great deal in London, we still  have a lot to learn and many new goals to be realized," he said.    The unprecedented structural changes in China's economy  impose a duty on the branch to explore new businesses to support  the reform, Li said.    He said his bank is seeking to better use the advantages of  London which he called the most international, flexible and  advanced financial centre in the world.    The city has the world's largest foreign exchange market,  with an average daily turnover of $300 billion. It has the  biggest foreign banking community, with offices of over 600  banks. Of the top 100 banks in the world, 99 have offices in  London.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Sculley unveils expansion strategy for Spectrum MR JOHN Sculley, the former chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, who last month joined Spectrum Information Technologies, a small technology development company, yesterday unveiled aggressive expansion plans. Spectrum said its founder and two other executives had resigned, that it would cut back a loss-making operation and that it has acquired a small engineering group. Mr Sculley's decision to join Spectrum last month shook the computer industry because the company has a history of losses and legal disputes. In a lawsuit settlement, Spectrum said it had agreed to pay its shareholders Dollars 1.5m in cash and issue 750,000 warrants to buy stock at prices at or above the current market price. The lawsuit was filed by shareholders in May when Spectrum's stock price dropped sharply after AT&amp;T challenged the company's claim that a licensing agreement could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties. Spectrum admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement and said it was trying to end the 'disruption of basic operations and to avoid the nuisance and costs of protracted litigation'. It said nearly all the cash payment will be covered by insurance. The company said the resignations of Dana Verrill, its founder and former chairman, John Rule, vice-president of corporate development and Katherine Bachand, in charge of investor relations, were on amicable terms. It also announced cuts at its Data One, a mobile communications systems hardware and related services subsidiary. 'Our strategy now is to move out of direct hardware sales to end-users and to refocus our communications services investment towards contract engineering and consulting services,' said Mr Sculley.</p>

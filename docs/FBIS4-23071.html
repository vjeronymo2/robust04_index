			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L. A. Slavutskiy; UDC 5 51.466:621.396.96] </F>   [Abstract] Electromagnetic waves in the centimeter range  are scattered from the sea surface on small ripples under  conditions of Bragg resonance. In a two-scale model, large-scale  waves lead to spatial and temporal modulation of the amplitude  of the radar signal due to a change in the local scattering  angle, and to phase modulation associated with the orbital  velocities of surface elements. This article describes a method  of studying the Doppler spectrum of a radar signal with a  frequency up to 20 GHz scattered by the sea surface. It is  possible to obtain information on the fine structure of the  Doppler spectrum associated with resonant scattering on  gravitational-capillary ripples in digital processing of the  received signal. It is also possible to evaluate the effect of  large waves with a period of several seconds. A numerical fast  Fourier transform algorithm was used to obtain the radar signal  spectrum. The stable fine structure of the spectrum is provided  by ``sliding'' averaging. Digital data processing may be done in  real time, so the method is suitable for comprehensive studies  of sur face phenomena. Figures 2; references 9: 6 Russian, 3  Western.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Sterling falls sharply on inflation fears STERLING FELL sharply yesterday on signs that UK inflationary pressures may be strengthening and on growing international disenchantment about prospects for recovery in Britain. Investors from the US, the Middle East and Far East sold pounds for other currencies, pushing sterling to a record low on its trade-weighted index and close to its lowest ever level against the D-Mark. Share prices on the London stock exchange dropped on speculation that the falling pound might limit the government's room to cut interest rates. A factor swaying sentiment was the unexpectedly strong inflationary pressures last month arising from higher import costs, triggered by the pound's 15 per cent devaluation since it left the European exchange rate mechanism in September. The cost of raw materials and fuels purchased by manufacturers rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent between December and January. Prices of these items at the factory gate were 7.2 per cent higher than a year previously, the highest year-on-year figure since May 1989. Any sign that inflation is strengthening could dissuade the government from a further cut in base rates from 6 per cent, in spite of calls from many City economists and industrialists for an easing in borrowing costs to help demand. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to come under pressure from the Treasury's panel of outside economic advisers for an early cut in base rates, possibly around the time of the Budget on March 16. The seven-strong Treasury panel met for its first policy discussions yesterday. It finished after five hours without issuing a formal statement. The panel is due to report next week to Mr Lamont, who was warned last night at a meeting of backbench Tory MPs not to introduce measures in the Budget which could threaten recovery - although some Conservatives did back increases in VAT or other taxes. Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England who takes over in July as governor, is expected in a speech in Frankfurt tomorrow to sound a warning note about inflation in his first policy address since news of his promotion last month. After the heavy selling of sterling, the currency hit a low of 76.2 on its trade-weighted index, which measures its value against a basket of currencies. It closed slightly higher at 76.6, from 77.2 on Monday night. Against the D-Mark, the pound came within a tenth of pfennig of its historic low of DM2.3480 reached last Wednesday amid an earlier bout of selling. Profit-taking saw sterling climb back slightly, to a London close of DM2.3625 and for an overall loss on the day of 2 pfennigs, after a 3-pfennig drop on Monday. The pound also lost further ground against the dollar, closing down nearly 1 cent at Dollars 1.4305. In New York, sterling closed at DM2.3655 and Dollars 1.4305. The heavy selling on the London stock market reflected the dropping pound, together with worries about a possible spate of rights issues. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed 38.7 lower at 2,831.3. Investor sentiment was depressed by a pessimistic tone to early Wall Street trading - the Dow Jones Industrial Average eventually closing 22.96 down at 3,414.58. Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg Securities, the London investment house, said: 'Sterling's torrid performance is a reminder that there is as yet no confidence in the financial community of a cyclical recovery in the UK.'

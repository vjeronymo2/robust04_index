			<p>BFN     [Text] If the State Duma does not support the draft  statement on the latest events in former Yugoslavia, this  document will be published on behalf of the factions of the  Liberal-Democratic, Communist, Agrarian and Democratic parties,  and possibly of the Party of Russian Unity and Concord and the  New Regional Policy group, Chairman of the State Duma's  Committee for Geopolitics Viktor Ustinov (the LDPR) told  Interfax.    He said that on commission from the State Duma Council, his  committee had drafted a statement which says that "the signs of  settlement in the Balkans have been brought to naught" and that  the conflict was assuming a dangerous character, while the U.S.  began to play the role of world gendarme. It also says that the  U.S. is disregarding Russia and its interests.    The draft statement demands that the UN Security Council's  resolution on the use of NATO forces in the Balkans be suspended  and that the Security Council urgently discuss the situation in  former Yugoslavia. "We must give a worthy response to the U.S.  which does not take Russia's opinion into account," said Ustinov.    He said that the four parliamentary committees--for  geopolitics, security, CIS affairs and industry--"are  categorically against Russia's participation in NATO's  Partnership for Peace program." If Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev signs the framework agreement on the program on April  21, "the confidence in the Russian leadership and government  will drop by several percentage points," said Ustinov.</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Italy to sell off BCI at 5% discount The Italian government has set a price of L5,400 a share on the public offer which gets under way today of 54 per cent of shares in Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), one of the country's most prestigious banks. This represents a discount of just 5.3 per cent on Friday's average price of L5,904, after deducting the recently announced L200 dividend which buyers will not receive, The state holding group, IRI, which is shedding its last significant interest in the banking sector by disposing of its entire stake in BCI, expects to raise L2,900bn (Pounds 1.16bn) from the sale of 260m shares to private investors and 240m to institutions. Although the discount is below that set on two recent bank privatisations - nearly 10 per cent for Credito Italiano and 6 per cent for the financial services group Istituto Mobiliare Italiano - it values the bank at close to its net worth. There is some disappointment at the size of the discount, but the Italian privatisation bandwagon has gathered such pace that analysts still expect the offer to be over-subscribed. The offer could close tomorrow, instead of the scheduled close on Friday. Mr Romano Prodi, IRI's chairman, said that demand was 10 times the offer. BCI's share price has surged in recent weeks, touching a high of more than L6,200. The sell-off of BCI, which ranks among the top half-dozen of Italian banks in terms of assets, is the biggest of the bank privatisations. Earlier this month BCI reported group net profits of L301.2bn, up 37.8 per cent. Heavy turnover in the shares on the Milan bourse has fuelled rumours that a group of institutions is manoeuvring to build a sizeable stake, with a view to eventual control. Generali, Italy's biggest insurance group, has said it has taken a 2.6 per cent stake. This has focused attention on the role of the powerful Milan-based Mediobanca, which has links with Generali and other institutions believed to be showing interest in BCI. As with previous privatisations, the BCI sell-off offers an incentive price of L4,860 for the 40m shares reserved for employees, reflecting Mr Prodi's wishes for a wide spread of ownership. This sentiment is shared by a wide spectrum of political parties. With the election campaign now in full swing, the emergence of a hard core of stake-builders would prove controversial.

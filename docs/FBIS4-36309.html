			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kurdistan Democratic Party Leader Mas'ud </F> Barzani by Zuhayr Qusaybati; place and date not given]    [Text] [Qusaybati] What is the latest on the security  situation? Have the clashes and skirmishes stopped?    [Barzani] The security situation is moving toward  relaxation. Efforts to disengage the forces are continuing in  all areas. Everyone, with the participation of the Iraqi  National Congress [INC] and the Kurdistan Front, is making  commendable efforts to consolidate the cease-fire and separate  the forces. These efforts have, to a large extent, been  reflected on the ground.    [Qusaybati] What, in your view, is the way or the solution  that would consolidate security?    [Barzani] I believe the solution that would consolidate  security lies in faith in pluralism, democratic methods, and  recourse to the people and to political dialogue to contain  problems. I do not see any other solution. That is how it is  with all democratic systems. The solution also lies in  adherence to the decisions of the operations room and serious  and responsible implementation of these decisions.    [Qusaybati] Do you really believe that a dispute over land  is  a good enough reason for an outbreak of fighting that is harmful  to the region?    [Barzani] No, it is not a question of a piece of land. It  has to do with ways of tackling problems and resolving a  political matter, and it also has to do with the mobilization  and education of cadres, and with the question of hegemony. At  the beginning of the crisis I sent a cable to the [Patriotic]  Union [of Kurdistan, PUK] and [Kurdistan] Democratic Party [KDP]  officials in the Raniyah area, urging them both to act in unison  to contain the problem in Qal'at Dizah, and I held them  responsible for that. Contrary to my expectations, the PUK  official in Raniyah dispatched a military force to Qal'at Dizah.  And when a government delegation from both sides was in  Raniyah, our forces' positions there were the target of  occupation and looting.    Within three days, the fighting covered the areas of  al-Sulaymaniyah and Karkuk. The PUK then moved its forces  directly to Irbil. We can conclude from that that there was a  premeditated plan. We have some evidence, which we do not wish  to reveal now, supporting the theory of a military coup by the  PUK. Despite the harm done to our forces, a meeting was held on  4 May and leadership committees were formed to normalize the  situation in all areas, but these committees made no progress.  After 4 May, we had to resort to positive defense to stop the  excesses of the PUK forces.    [Qusaybati] Jalal Talabani has told AL-HAYAH that Iranian  Revolutionary Guard elements supported the KDP fighters and  "Revolutionary Hizballah" with artillery shelling. What is your  reaction to that?    [Barzani] We have been hearing that a lot and we have also  heard that some Iranian Revolutionary Guard members were taken  prisoner. We called on the PUK at the time to show these  captives on the television screen so that the Kurdish people  would know. We have also read statements claiming that the PUK  was the target of a comprehensive plot with the participation of  Iran, Turkey, our party, and the Islamic Movement in Iraq. Then  we read that Jalal Talabani had asked Iran to invite the PUK,  our party, and the Islamic Movement to Tehran, and to mediate.  And there were other statements. At any rate, I do not know of  and have not seen any Iranian participation in this dispute.    [Qusaybati] Talabani's statements and confirmations by  Iraqi opposition sources seem to indicate that he feared an  attack on his motorcade on his return to Kurdistan (from  Damascus), and this delayed his return. Do you believe these  fears are serious?    [Barzani] We have been awaiting Talabani's return for three  weeks and I see no justification for the delay. His presence  would certainly facilitate the cease-fire and solve many  problems. Many attempts were made to secure Talabani's return,  and Dr. Ahmad al-Jalabi (chairman of the INC Executive Council)  and I sent a written message on 14 May assuring him that all  precautions would be taken to ensure his safe return across the  Syrian-Iraqi border.    Talabani wanted me to go to Zakhu to receive him. I have no  objection to doing that, but I cannot leave my headquarters  because of the situation and the efforts to consolidate the  cease-fire. I told him that I would send a high-level  delegation from the political bureaus of our party and the PUK  to receive him. Fear of an attack on his motorcade in the area  of Dahuk is unfounded. Treachery is not one of our  characteristics.    [Qusaybati] The PUK has been critical of the 50/50 principle  with your party (in jobs) and sees that as one of the factors  contributing to the tension.    [Barzani] The 50/50 principle in the administration has  caused major problems and has been one of the causes of tension.  We believe that principle should be abolished in a democratic  way, by going back to the people. We suggested that idea months  ago and we promised to respect the result whatever it may be.  The suggestions we made at our joint meetings calling for new  elections were met with an extensive media campaign and other  measures and manifestations reaching the point of direct  aggression. Despite all that had happened, I did not expect  matters to reach this dangerous level and did not expect a  recourse to force to overturn the balances of power.    [Qusaybati] Turkey has announced that it is preparing for a  meeting between you and Talabani. Do you see a need for such  mediation?    [Barzani] Several friendly quarters have offered mediation.  We viewed the Turkish initiative positively and a meeting was  held between two delegations from the leaderships of our party  and the PUK in Silobi. The meeting was positive. We are  interested in all initiatives aimed at containing the crisis.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko, </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 4 May TASS -- Viktor Pinzenik, a candidate for  the Ukrainian presidency, one of the prominent Ukrainian  economist and former vice-premier, has dropped out of the  presidential race. He announced his decision on Wednesday but  declined to give the reasons for the move.    It looks like supporters of market reforms are staking on  former Economics Minister Vladimir Lanovoy, 42, organiser of the  "reforms for the people" parliamentary faction, president of the  centre of market reforms and master of economic sciences. He  stands a better chance of being elected than Pinzenik, since  Lanovoy is believed to be the "victim" of cabinet games.    When Lanovoy was an economics minister and vice-premier, he  suggested several programmes of coming out of the crisis which  were blocked both by the cabinet of ministers and the  parliament. During the current election campaign Lanovoy has  been insisting on these programmes again, saying that this will  bring about economic recovery of the country.    One of the real candidates to the presidential post, Leonid  Kravchuk, maintains his former position, saying that elections  should be postponed until later. He motivates his position by  the absence of a new constitution, an indefinite status of the  president and an inadequate structure of the executive power. A  total of 120 Ukrainian lawmakers had come out in support of  Kravchuk's position, demanding in an address the nation that the  presidential elections be postponed.    This caused a stormy reaction from other lawmakers and  primarily, those contesting for the post of the president.  Former speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, Ivan Plyushch, is  busy finding out the names of those who signed the address. The  Ukrainian parliament has been putting pressure on the Ukrainian  UKRINFORM news agency which circulated the address in a bid to  get a list of the 120 lawmakers who put their signatures under  the document.</p>

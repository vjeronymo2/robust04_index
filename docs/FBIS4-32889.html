			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 30 May (EFE) -- Today, Venezuelan President  Rafael Caldera carried out his first cabinet change, only 117  days after the start of his government and in the mist of a  profound economic crisis.    Caldera, who assumed the presidency on 2 February, appointed  Alberto Poletto, Luis Carlos Palacios, Ciro Zaa, and Carlos  Bernandez as ministers of Development, Central Office of  Coordination and Planning [Cordiplan], Transport and  Communication, and Venezuelan Investment Fund, respectively.    Caldera's restructuring of his cabinet has been interpreted  by local political experts as a sign that the president is  prepared to make a switch to an economic policy less populist  than the one he proposed during the elections campaign and  closer to the neoliberal policy implemented by former president  Carlos Andres Perez.    Apparently, Caldera, who was one of the most severe critics  of the free market policy promoted by Perez, has been unable to  structure an economic formula out of the neoliberal guidelines.    Venezuela is living through a difficult economic situation,  with a fiscal deficit estimated at more than $4.5 billion, a  severe depreciation of the bolivar, and an explosive social  situation fueled by a significant fall in the purchasing power  of the people.    President Caldera put Carlos Bernandez at the head of the  organization in charge of privatizing state enterprises.  Bernandez has always been linked to the local banking sector and  he has been president of the Bank of Venezuela, which is one of  the most important banks in the country. Bernandez has offered  to increase the privatization process. The local media has  described his appointment as a victory for the financial sector,  which was able to produce the departure of Abdon Vivas Teran, a  politician very close to Caldera and to his electoral offer for  an economy with a human face, from the Venezuela Investment Fund.    Luis Carlos Palacios, the new Cordiplan minister, replaces  Enzo del Bufalo, a dissonant voice in Caldera's economic team.  The new minister is closer to the free economy concepts that the  Caldera administration apparently wants to adopt in this new  phase.    Also, Alberto Poletto, president of the Foreign Trade  Institute, will be development minister, which joins these  departments to create the Industry and Commerce Ministry.    Ciro Zaa has been virtually forced to leave the Urban  Development Ministry to take over the Transport and  Communication Ministry vacated by Cesar Quintini, who was  accused of maintaining an attitude of tolerance in multiple  cases of corruption in his ministry.    Zaa will be replaced by Francisco Gonzalez, former president  of the Urban Development fund. The responsibilities of Special  Affairs Minister Pompeyo Marquez have been expanded and from now  on he will also be responsible for the government's social  programs.</p>

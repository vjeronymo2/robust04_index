			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 3 Jan (XINHUA) -- To commemorate the 15th  anniversary of the publication of the "Message to Compatriots in  Taiwan" by the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress [NPC], Vice Chairman Cheng Siyuan recently made a  statement through the Voice of the Strait Radio Station which  said: The "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" has brought about  a relaxed situation in cross-strait relations. In the new year,  the two sides of the strait should further strengthen contacts  and exchanges to push forward the process of the peaceful  reunification of the motherland.    Reviewing the changes that have taken place in cross-strait  relations in the past 15 years since the publication of the  message, Cheng Siyuan said: Because of the development of  cross-strait relations, as of today, more than 1 million visits  by people of both sides have been recorded; indirect trade has  topped $10 billion; exchanges in various fields are increasing;  and there has been a tremendous change in the painful situation  of 15 years ago in which communications and contacts were  totally cut off due to military confrontation between the two  sides of the strait. He expressed the hope that both sides  would treasure the new hard-won situation and push forward the  relations between the two sides of the strait on the existing  basis.    He said: Although exchanges and personnel contacts between  the two sides have increased, they are also faced with many  difficulties. On the one hand, the exchanges and contacts are  still indirect, because the personnel visiting each side have to  go by way of Hong Kong or a third country. Even the development  of economic and trade relations has to be conducted through a  third region. This not only wastes time and causes delays in  business, but it also wastes money and manpower. On the other  hand, the Taiwan authorities have set up many restrictions to  obstruct exchanges and personnel contacts. He expressed the  hope that the Taiwan authorities will take into account the  vital interests of the people on both sides of the strait, adopt  effective measures to remove the manmade obstacles, and  establish, as soon as possible, postal links, trade relations,  and air and shipping services between Taiwan and the mainland.    Cheng Siyuan said: Besides speeding up exchanges and  contacts, an important task is to firmly stop the movement  toward "independence for Taiwan" and to oppose all acts aimed at  dividing the sovereignty of the state in the forms of "one  China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas." The failure to carry out  this task well will cast a shadow over cross-strait relations  and will affect the further development of relations between the  two sides of the strait. He said: Of course, the complete  solution of problems is most important. Both sides should sit  down to discuss the reunification of the country. If we can  realize the peaceful reunification of the country, we will have  something good to tell our forefathers and posterity and open a  new page in the annals of the Chinese nation.    On the occasion of commemorating the 15th anniversary of the  publication of the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan," the  joyous New Year's Day of 1994 happens to be drawing near. Cheng  Siyuan very happily extended festive greetings to compatriots in  Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and to other compatriots living  overseas. He expressed the hope that they will continue to show  concern for and support the motherland's reform, opening up, and  socialist modernization drive on the mainland, and contribute,  through various forms, to the early realization of the peaceful  reunification of the motherland.</p>

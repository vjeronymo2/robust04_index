			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- A subcommittee of a ruling  coalition panel on tax reforms on Thursday [2 June] proposed  overhauling the present tax privileges for small businesses as a  precondition for raising the consumption tax from the present 3  percent.    The group made the proposal in a draft report on tax  reforms,  including a continuation of income tax cuts beyond this fiscal  year and a raise in the consumption tax.    Regarding tax privileges for small businesses in connection  with the consumption tax, the subcommittee proposed overhauling  the present system of applying reduced tax rates to businesses  with taxable annual sales of less than 50 million yen.    The report, however, made no mention of the margin of a  raise  in the consumption tax. Members had failed to reach agreement  on the matter, officials said.    The subcommittee will submit its final report to the tax  reform panel around June 9 after coordinating its views, and the  coalition will use the report to work out basic guidelines for  tax reforms by the end of this month, the officials said.    The draft report also suggested that the income threshold  for  taxation be raised to offset the effects of a higher consumption  tax on low income earners.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jun 22 (ANTARA) -- The Indonesian  Journalist Association (PWI) expressed its concern over the  revocation of the leading weekly-magazine TEMPO, EDITOR and the  tabloid DETIK.    PWI said in its press release -- issued here on Wednesday --  that it can understand the government's reasons in cancelling  the license of the three publications.    The press release, which was signed by its chairman Tribuana  Said, and secretary general Parni Hadi, noted that it believes  the revocation will not slacken the participation of the  Indonesian press in the national development and dampen the  openness spirit among the public.    The journalist association also proposed to the government  to  issue new licences for the three publications as soon as  possible so that journalists of the three media can have their  jobs.    It called on the government and the public to go through  legal mechanism or the press organization mechanism in handling  cases concerning the press itself.    It believes that revocation of publications licenses will  not  happen if such mechanisms are followed.    Meanwhile, the Indonesian Newspapers Association (SPS) has  also expressed its concern over the revocation.    The press release, which was signed by its chairman Jakob  Utama and secretary A. Bagyo Purwanto, said that the revocation  should remind the press society that the implementation of the  principles of "positive interaction between the press, the  government and the public" did not yet function well.</p>

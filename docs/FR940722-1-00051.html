			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1447&blank;Equipment Standards for Oxygen Dispensing Units <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed new &sect;23.1447(a)(4) would require that if radio equipment is installed in an airplane, flightcrew oxygen dispensing units must be designed to allow the use of communication equipment when oxygen is being used. If radio equipment is installed, that equipment cannot perform its intended function if the flightcrew is not provided the proper means for its utilization under all operating conditions, including operations when oxygen is being used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal would not require all flightcrew oxygen dispensing units to be equipped with communication equipment. Since an airplane may be operated in uncontrolled airspace, where two-way radio communication is not required and, at the same time, be at altitudes where oxygen is required for the flightcrew members, some airplanes have a crew oxygen system but no radio equipment. It would be inappropriate to require the flightcrew dispensing units of those airplanes to be equipped with communication equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revisions to &sect;23.1447(d) would require the flightcrew oxygen dispensing units to be automatically presented before the cabin pressure altitude exceeds 15,000 feet or be the quick-donning type if the airplane is certificated for operation above 25,000 feet. The requirement in paragraph (e) for the passenger dispensing units to be automatically presented if the airplane is approved for operation above 30,000 feet has not been revised. The revision to paragraph (d) would provide the flightcrew and the airplane passengers the same level of safety as provided by other airworthiness standards. This proposed revision is also consistent with the proposed revision of &sect;23.841 in this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1451&blank;Fire Protection for Oxygen Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed new section would specify that fire protection is needed for oxygen equipment installations. Section 23.1451 (a) and (b) would, respectively, prohibit the installation of oxygen equipment in designated fire zones and require that oxygen system components be protected from the heat from designated fire zones. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1451(c) would require oxygen equipment and lines to be separated from other equipment or to be protected in a manner that would prevent escaping oxygen from striking grease, fluids, or vapors. The impingement of pure oxygen on certain materials will lower their combustion point to a value where ignition will occur in ambient conditions thereby creating a potential source for an airplane fire. In one instance, an airplane was destroyed by fire that resulted when escaping oxygen impinged on lubricating material during maintenance of the airplane. The proposed new section would ensure that oxygen systems are protected to prevent fire hazards that can result from escaping oxygen. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1453&blank;Protection of Oxygen Equipment From Rupture <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed new section would clarify the rupture protection needed for oxygen system installation. Rupture protection for oxygen systems is currently required by the application of the structures load requirements of part 23. The addition of &sect;23.1453(a) would clarify the application of these load requirements and would identify the need to consider maximum temperatures and pressures that may be present. Section 23.1453(b) would identify the protection to be provided for high pressure oxygen sources and the high pressure lines that connect such sources to the oxygen system shutoff valves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1461&blank;Equipment Containing High Energy Rotors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would revise paragraph (a) of this section to clarify that the requirements apply to high energy rotors included in an auxiliary power unit (APU). Following the addition of this section to part 23, the FAA issued a policy message that showed &sect;23.1461 was adopted to cover equipment such as APU's and constant speed drives that may be installed on small airplanes. The proposed revision of paragraph (a) will clarify the applicability of this section as identified in that policy material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix F <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would revise appendix F to provide the procedures needed to test electrical wire to ensure that the wire meets the burn requirements of &sect;23.1359. It would also add procedures for meeting the 45 degree and 60 degree angle burn test requirement proposed for &sect;&sect;23.855(c)(2) and 23.1359(c), respectively. Paragraph (b) would be revised to clarify the specimen configuration that must be used in the testing procedures that are proposed to be added by this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 91.205&blank;Powered Civil Aircraft With Standard Category U.S. Airworthiness Certificates: Instrument and Equipment Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed new &sect;91.205(b)(11) would require that airplanes certificated under &sect;23.1401 of this notice be equipped with an anticollision light system for day VFR operations. Day VFR operations are discussed under &sect;23.1401 of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 91.209&blank;Aircraft Lights <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed new &sect;91.209(b) would require that airplanes equipped with an anticollision light system be operated with the anticollision light system lighted during all types of operations, except when the pilot determines that, because of operating conditions, it would be in the interest of safety to turn the lights off. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation, Regulatory Flexibility Determination, and Trade Impact Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA has determined that this rule: (1) Would generate benefits that would justify its costs and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is not ``significant'' as defined in DOT's Policies and Procedures; (3) would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) would not constitute a barrier to international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section summarizes the costs and benefits of each provision of the proposed rule. Many of the provisions would impose either no cost or a negligible cost. Such provisions are typically administrative, editorial, clarifying, relieving, or conforming in nature. In addition, the FAA holds that certain provisions have a potential safety benefit that can be achieved with no incremental cost, due primarily to the fact that this rule would apply to future certificated airplanes and retrofitting would not be required. All provisions of the proposed rule, including those with no or negligible costs, are summarized below. Only those provisions with non-negligible costs are further evaluated in the section that follows. The reader is directed to the full regulatory evaluation for additional information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

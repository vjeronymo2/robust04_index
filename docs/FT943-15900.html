			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Bar says QC rank should be retained The Bar has come down in favour of retaining the present system for appointing Queen's Counsel in spite of criticism from barristers that the system is secretive and open to abuse. A working party chaired by Mr Michael Kalisher QC says in a report published today that the present system of appointment by the Queen on the advice of the Lord Chancellor is preferable to alternatives such as appointment by an independent commission, or by the Bar itself. The Bar favours retaining the rank of QC because it helps the public and solicitors identify barristers of a recognised high standard. But it recognises that changes would have to be made to the present system to meet the concerns of many barristers. The report recommends publication of formal criteria for getting silk, including outstanding ability as an advocate, experience and knowledge of the law, professional integrity and an extensive practice. The report says appointments should be solely on merit, with no positive discrimination in favour of women or ethnic minorities. The number of appointments should remain low to underline the importance of the rank but numbers should not be artificially restricted. Applications have risen from 204 in 1985, when 34 were appointed, to 539 in 1994, when 77 were appointed. The barristers say the high number of applicants threatens the efficacy of the system as the judges and senior barristers who are consulted on appointments cannot give every application the consideration it requires. A limit on the number of applications should be considered and barristers should be discouraged from applying prematurely. The report says there is no justification for any part of the process to remain secret. Guidance notes should set out precisely how the system works and identify all those consulted. Applicants should be told in general terms what has been said about them and what impact this has had. Unsuccessful applicants should be told broadly why they have failed and that they are entitled to seek an interview at the Lord Chancellor's Department to be told in more detail why they have been unsuccessful.</p>

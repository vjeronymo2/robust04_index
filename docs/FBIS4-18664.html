			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["rmc/DW"-signed report: "Eurofighter Will Cost DM300 </F> Million More Than Planned"]    [Text] Bonn -- The development of the Eurofighter 2000  aircraft will probably cost more than originally planned.  Germany's share in the development costs alone will at least be  300 million German marks [DM] more than planned. An expert in  the Federal Audit Court even expects the costs to increase by  DM700 million. The reason is that, on the instructions of  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe of the Christian Democratic Union,  the industry must make the controversial Eurofighter less  powerful and thus cheaper. In view of Ruehe's request to force  the unit price of the European fighter aircraft below DM100  million, the additional costs have become inevitable, the German  general contractor, German Aerospace (Dasa) has stated. The  DM300 million are made up of DM145 million caused by the longer  duration of the project, DM100 million in inflation  compensation, and a remainder resulting from a change in the  guidelines for the calculation of profits. All in all, Dasa has  requested DM570 million from the German defense budget for the  development of the Eurofighter 2000. A government decision on  the procurement of the fighter aircraft has been announced for  1995.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Observer: False alarm When John Harris retired unexpectedly early from the chairmanship of East Midlands Electricity earlier this year, it had been thought that he could at least look forward to the chairmanship of the Coal Authority - which the government had indicated was his for the taking. However, Harris's reputation, once among the highest in the industry, has taken a bit of hammering following revelations about the problems East Midlands has had with some of its post-privatisation acquisitions. Indeed, it seems that the government is now looking for someone else to head the organisation which will supervise the licensing of pits and their liabilities following coal privatisation in the winter. As for Harris, he seems to be enjoying life away from the business fray. Apart from a bit of consultancy work overseas, he is busy painting his Nottinghamshire house. Who knows - the government may still decide he's the right man for the job.</p>

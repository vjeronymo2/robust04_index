			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / TeleWest will proceed with flotation TeleWest, the UK's largest cable operator, has decided to go ahead with an early share offering in both London and New York. The decision comes only five months after the cable group postponed flotation because of difficult market conditions. TeleWest now plans to go to market in the next couple of months making it the first cable company in the UK to have a London Stock Exchange listing. It appears that the flotation of TeleWest, a joint venture between US West, the US telephone company, and Telecommunications Inc, the largest US cable company, will resemble the original plan and could value the company at as much as Pounds 1.9bn. The main aim of the float would be to establish a value for TeleWest while making the company a more British organisation. This would involve a stake of about 20 per cent fully diluted which would be sold, in line with the original proposal, through a placing and intermediaries offer on both sides of the Atlantic. Such an offer would seek to raise between Pounds 300m and Pounds 370m in new money. TeleWest owns and operates 16 cable franchises and has minority stakes in a further seven covering a total of 3.6m homes. Some 1.3m of the 3.6m homes are passed by cable networks and 1.2m of them have been released for marketing. The total number of cable television subscribers is 275,000. In addition, the company has sold 190,000 residential telephone lines and 30,000 business lines. TeleWest's return to the market has been influenced by the current brighter outlook for new issues and the good performance of the stock of cable companies such as International Cabletel and Bell Cable Media in the US, which have risen sharply since flotation on the Nasdaq market. The much larger British Sky Broadcasting could be coming to the market at the same time as TeleWest, but this is not seen as a barrier, although Goldman Sachs, which is advising BSkyB, will no longer be involved in the TeleWest float. Morgan Stanley has now joined Kleinwort Benson as TeleWest advisers. Both BSkyB and TeleWest see cable and satellite television as complementary to BSkyB. The cable industry as a retailer of new television channels is mainly a distributor while BSkyB (in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake) is primarily a programmer. Overall there are now more than 750,000 cable television subscribers in the UK and more than 500,000 telephone lines installed. Lex, Page 18</p>

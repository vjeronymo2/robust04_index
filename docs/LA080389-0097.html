			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHEAST AREA ADDED TO L.A.'S RECYCLING NET  </P> <P> Trash recycling bins are being distributed this week to about 15,000 homes in  several northeast neighborhoods of Los Angeles as part of a citywide expansion  of voluntary recycling.  </P> <P> The distinctive yellow containers, some with 12-gallon and some with 14-gallon  capacities, are being left at curbs by the Los Angeles Conservation Corps along  with booklets explaining the recycling program. Special recycling trucks will  begin weekly pickup one week after the containers are delivered.  </P> <P> In most cases, recycling pickups will be on a day other than regular trash  pickup days, said Gyl Elliott, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Bureau of  Sanitation.  </P> <P> Residents included in the program will be asked to put aluminum and steel cans,  glass bottles and jars and clear plastic soda bottles into the containers, then  leave them, along with loose or bundled newspapers, at curb side on the  recycling pickup day.  </P> <P> The recycling containers are being distributed on a staggered schedule to large  portions of Atwater, Highland Park, Eagle Rock, Mount Washington and Silver  Lake.  </P> <P> The program, called Recycle L.A. Phase Two, will nearly double the number of  households involved in voluntary recycling, bringing the total to 90,000  distributed through all 15 Los Angeles City Council districts, Elliott said.  </P> <P> Other curb-side recycling areas, the earliest begun in 1985, now include about  45,000 households in Westside and San Fernando Valley neighborhoods. The  materials collected at those houses are sold to several recycling firms,  holding the overall cost of the collection to from 90 cents to $1.20 per house  each month, Elliott said.  </P> <P> Some of those earlier programs called upon residents to separate different  kinds of recyclable refuse into three containers. However, the Bureau of  Sanitation decided to move ahead with single-container recycling because it  proved easier on residents, Elliott said. Voluntary cooperation with recycling  has generally run from 30% to 50%, she said.  </P> <P> The new recycling areas being opened this week are expected to cost more, as  much as $3.66 per household each month, because of the complex logistics,  Elliott said. The cost would be expected to fall as the program grows.  </P> <P> Elliott said the new pilot areas will help the bureau answer key questions such  as how the market for recyclable refuse will sustain greater supply and what  types of vehicles and containers work best.  </P> <P> The bureau will use the knowledge as the basis to propose mandatory recycling  for all 720,000 households in the city, Elliott said. A recommendation for  mandatory recycling will be presented to the Los Angeles City Council within a  month, she said.  </P> <P> The council has directed the bureau to initiate recycling as a way to reduce  the volume of trash rapidly filling the city's landfill capacity.  </P></p>

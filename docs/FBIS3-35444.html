			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Feb. 23, IRNA -- The English daily 'TEHRAN  TIMES' here Wednesday commented on the Saudi motive behind an  untimely, unnecessary and economically unjustified extravagance  as buying passenger planes from the U.S.    The daily's editorial said that the kingdom, after the  Desert  Storm, had failed to transfer the 'special' relationship it  enjoyed with George Bush to the Clinton Administration and  commented that Washington's refusal to send an ambassador to  Saudi Arabia for more than two years was an indication of the  cold shoulder treatment Riyadh had been getting from the U.S.    It wrote that to allure the U.S. into old relationship, the  Saudis had unveiled its petro-dollar and added that this splurge  had serious consequences for other regional countries.    "Saudi's increased production has glutted the market and  caused oil prices to fall from dlrs. [dollars] 18 to dlrs. 12  per barrel in 1993, reducing the purchasing power of the Persian  Gulf petroleum producers and making such extravagancies  detrimental to their economies."    Considering the estimated Saudi production increase, and its  refusal to cooperate with other OPEC members to stabilize the  overall production level, the article believed it would be  unrealistic to expect a fair price for oil any time soon.    "In the event that OPEC oil ministers fail to reach an  agreement to lower production levels in their scheduled March 25  meeting, crude prices could fall to dlrs. 11 per barrel.  Reaching a consensus on production levels is contingent upon  the realization, by overproducers, that regional and national  interests have the highest priority when it comes to political  and economic policies," the editorial concluded.</p>

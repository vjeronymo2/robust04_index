			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Flying a kite for prompt payments - In a Nutshell Would the creation of a prompt payment standard or kitemark persuade British companies to improve their poor payments performance? The Institute of Credit Management has approached both the British Standards Institution and the government to sound out their ideas. The institute's original plan was for a 'prompt payment' clause to be added to BS5750, a quality management standard which has won widespread acceptance. But this was rejected by BSI because many companies had signed up for BS5750 without such a clause. The institute now hopes to create a separate 'kitemark' which would commit companies to paying their bills by the date stipulated in the agreed terms.</p>

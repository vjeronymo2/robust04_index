			<p>BFN     [Text] East London May 2 SAPA -- Counting had not started  in the Lady Frere District of Transkei by 10AM on Monday [2  May], an Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] spokesman said.  Matthew Moonieya said IEC officials and international observers  had been sent from Umtata to the area to resolve a dispute over  counting.    "We have a problem, but it's not a big problem," he said. He  said the IEC had originally not authorised any counting stations  in the district. Four were later established but owing to a  failure in communications were not staffed.    Pan Africanist Congress officials were, however, insisting  that the counting be done there and did not want the boxes moved.    An attempt late on Sunday to take the boxes to Queenstown to  be counted was unsuccessful.    Mr Moonieya said he did not know how many votes were  involved, but there had been 82 voting stations in the district.</p>

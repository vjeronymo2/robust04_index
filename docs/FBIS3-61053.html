Pasyakin </F> under rubric "Deployments and Flights": "And Again in the  Mediterranean..."]    [Text] No matter how difficult the conditions in  which the Russian Navy now finds itself, it lives and is  performing assigned missions. This is indicated by the recent  deployment of a group of ships of the Northern, Baltic and Black  Sea fleets as well as of Leningrad Naval Base into the  Mediterranean Sea. Military journalist Captain 2nd Rank V.  Pasyakin acquaints readers with its details.    It was the typical working atmosphere in the operations room  of the flagship, the large ASW ship Kerch. Rear Admiral A.  Grinko, chief of the deployment staff, and his closest  assistants captains 1st rank N. Mikheyev and G. Ukhanov were  bending over a chart with a colorful abundance of symbols. A  hunt was under way for a conditional enemy submarine by the ship  detachment made up of the Kerch, patrol ships Ladnyy and  Razitelnyy and hydrographic vessel Liman (Black Sea Fleet); the  patrol ship Legkiy (Northern Fleet); and the patrol ship  Druzhnyy (Baltic Fleet), divided into two interworking groups. A  submarine and the oceanographic vessel Polyus of Leningrad Naval  Base also were in the exercise area.    What is typical is that all ships and vessels began search  operations in an organized fashion without preliminary joint  drills. Later, while the Liman was maneuvering in the area in an  attempt to detect the submarine, crews replenished fuel and  water stores from the large ocean oiler Ivan Bubnov.    It was eight years ago in the Mediterranean that I had  occasion to observe the Ivan Bubnov in the simultaneous underway  replenishment of three ships, including the air-capable cruiser  Kiev, by the abeam-astern method. A guided missile cruiser,  destroyers, large ASW ships and patrol ships of the Northern and  Black Sea fleets were waiting their turn. We were paid more than  one visit by NATO aircraft and helicopters, which trained  television, camera, and movie lenses on the floating "city."    Unfortunately, the Russian Navy now cannot boast of such a  scale. Ships of the once great naval power put onto the oceans  more and more rarely. Our Navy has been a rather rare guest in  these regions since squadrons in the Mediterranean and South  China seas and in the Indian Ocean were abolished. Is it  surprising that instances of seizure of our merchant vessels  have become more frequent of late? This time, too, one other  ship of the Northern Fleet, the patrol ship Bessmennyy, was  supposed to take part in the joint exercise, but she was sent to  the Suez Canal, where a Russian tug was being detained for  unknown reasons. It was well that our forces were in the  Mediterranean and reacted promptly to the incident. But if they  had not been?    Yes, the Russian Navy must be present constantly in areas of  active shipping and fishing, not "vegetating" in bases. But  evidently not everyone understands this. Or perhaps they give  the appearance that they do not understand? Our air-capable  ships are not seen at sea. By the way, Russia has been left with  just one, the heavy air-capable cruiser Kuznetsov, and she has  to be brought up to snuff. But the cradle of these ships, the  Black Sea Shipyard, went over to sovereign Ukraine. Ukraine,  however, is incapable of having such giants and so they cut up  the heavy air-capable cruiser Ulyanovsk--our first air-capable  ship with a "normal" configuration for aircraft takeoff and with  a nuclear power plant--for scrap just when she was being born.  The almost ready heavy air-capable cruiser Varyag "got caught  between heaven and earth." The air-capable cruisers Kiev, Minsk  and Novorossiysk were decommissioned because of the absence of  funds and a repair facility.    Now our Navy's ships and auxiliary vessels rarely go beyond  the Bosporus. True, the oiler Ivan Bubnov is there somewhat more  often than others, in the words of her captain, A. Danilenko,  but his crew today also has a large number of problems.    "The captain of our enormous oiler has a salary of only  18,000 karbovantsy," said S. Sukharevich, chairman of the  vessel's trade union committee, seething with just indignation.  "And what does that say about seamen, when the subsistence wage  in Ukraine long ago topped 22,000? How can a family be clothed,  provided with shoes and fed on such money?! It was not without  reason that above all the low pay and a desire to draw attention  of authorities to our beggarly situation forced the seamen of  Black Sea Fleet auxiliary vessels to hoist the St. Andrew's  ensign."    Problems of the Black Sea Fleet's status, unresolved through  the fault of the leadership of Russia and Ukraine, often creates  extreme situations. For example, the Ivan Bubnov was forced to  put to sea from Sevastopol... without necessary fuel for  refueling, and it was not so much because of its scarcity.    "We were detained in Sevastopol by Ukrainian customs for two  days," I was told by first mate V. Zadorozhnikov. "They let us  go only after seeing that we had no fuel for refueling  ships(!--Ed.), but only necessary minimum fuel for  the transit, and this despite the fact that it is Russia that  completely supplies the Black Sea Fleet with all fuels and  lubricants. So our Bubnov had to proceed across the  Mediterranean to replenish stores from her Northern Fleet  colleague, the oiler Dnestr, near the Strait of Gibraltar. She  received another 2,300 tonnes of fuel from the Baltic oiler  Lena, and only after that were we able to begin refueling ships."    It was here in the Mediterranean that it was clear how much  we need not only combatant ships, but also auxiliary vessels,  without which the Navy risks becoming only a coastal fleet.    After refueling, the search group continued the "hunt" for  the submarine, especially as they were not forced to wait for  information on her--Captain 2nd Rank V. Borisenko's subordinates  from the hydrographic vessel Liman had worked professionally.  After studying the data received, the deployment staff adjusted  the maneuvering scheme and places for laying the antisubmarine  barriers which ASW aviators were supposed to put out. After some  time a Ka-25 helicopter (a Saber-Toothed Tiger, as it was dubbed  on the ship because of the emblem on its sides) piloted by  Lieutenant Colonel I. Chernenko and navigator Major I.  Sinigovets soared upward into the sky. Although it was not the  first time ever for them to perform such an assignment (the two  Ivans already had been flying together for six years and had  learned to understand each other with hardly a word spoken),  each hunt for a submarine conceals surprises.    "Arrived in area, beginning placement," was the report the  flagship received from the crew of the rotary wing craft.    After laying two antisubmarine barriers, the helicopter  personnel departed for the observation area. They did not have  long to wait. Soon a report went to the flagship about contact  with a submarine. Chernenko and Sinigovets immediately received  the command to drop a series of "clarifying" buoys. It became  clear from the information soon received from the Ka-25 crew  that contact with a submarine had been established. This also  was confirmed by listening to the sea using a dipping sonar. So  the "long arm," as those in the Navy often call Naval Aviation  aircraft and helicopters, proved its advantage this time as  well, but it is becoming more and more difficult for that same  Chernenko and Sinigovets to do this. I have to admit I was  surprised to learn that their "tiger" has an even more venerable  age than the twenty-year-old Kerch. The Ka-25 already was  removed from production long ago and spare parts, instruments  and accessories are not being produced for it. Senior  technicians captains A. Mezentsev, V. Bakhtin and N. Maksimov  have to work a great deal to see that their "little old man"  does not let people down in flight, which is why the  "Saber-Toothed Tiger" still retains sharp "claws" and "fangs"  despite its venerable age.    When the area in which the conditional underwater enemy was  located became known for certain thanks to the helicopter  personnel, the deployment staff developed a precise tactical  plan of action: Each ship was assigned a specific mission by  Chief of Staff and First Deputy CinC Black Sea Fleet Vice  Admiral P. Svyatashov, the exercise director, and the helicopter  was brought back to the ship. By the way, a half-hour after its  return the "tiger" again took off into the evening sky: a  multiton "little fish" already was heading into the "net"...    Much more could be written about actions of ASW personnel on  this deployment and about the people whom I met in the  Mediterranean, but another issue worries all sailors today. Many  crew members, even those who have served more than a single year  in the Black Sea Fleet, were in the Mediterranean for the first  time. Will they have occasion to be here in the future? Will not  our navymen soon be navymen in uniform only, going on coastal  cruises only rarely, and will not the appearance of the St.  Andrew's ensign over expanses of oceans and distant seas become  something exotic? By the way, it is not the Fleet which has to  be asked this question...    COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1993.</p>

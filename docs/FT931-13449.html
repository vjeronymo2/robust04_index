			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Kitchen scales tip to France: Nicholas Lander travels to Paris for the Prix Culinaire, one of the world's top cookery contests Jeremy Cooper had envisaged spending Christmas plucking turkeys in his father's butcher shop in Huddersfield, Yorkshire. Instead, he flew to Paris to represent Britain in the 26th Prix Culinaire Pierre Taittinger, one of the world's most prestigious culinary contests. At age 24, Cooper, is chef saucier, head of the meat section, at London's Inter-Continental Hotel. For four years he worked at Claridge's under executive chef, Marjan Lesnik, who won the Prix Taittinger in 1981 but was disqualified because of an unauthorised use of parsley leaves as garnish. This year he is one of the 16 international judges. The Prix Taittinger is the culinary world's equivalent of the Tschaikovsky Piano Competition in Moscow. Although there are similar competitions held around the world, this one attracts the most international interest, with almost 500 entrants this year from America, Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Holland, Britain, Japan, Switzerland, and of course, France. It also offers a rare insight into the highly conservative world of French gastronomy. Most of those fortunate enough to eat both in and outside France would agree that France's long-held domination of the culinary world is seriously under threat. Today, talented and inspired chefs are to be found all over the world. French chefs, however, have dominated the competition. Indeed the Prix Taittinger has only been won twice by chefs from outside France - in 1984 by a Japanese and in 1986 by an Indonesian working at the Hilton, Amsterdam. A strong flavour of French culinary conservatism was evident in the British semi-finals when the eight contestants had to prepare a classic 19th century dish, quenelles of pike with a sauce amoricaine. This dish was well known when rivers were flush with pike and lobsters for the sauce were cheap (the sauce was created in 1860); but today it rarely appears on menus. That may have been one reason that the British favourite, Bruno Loubet, a highly innovative chef from the Inn on the Park, finished behind Jeremy Cooper. Cooper arrived in Paris with three words - gibier a poil (furred game)  - ringing in his ears. Two weeks earlier this, and nothing else, had been divulged as the subject of the four-hour finals. At 7.30pm on the night before the cook-offs the 12 contestants, of whom three were French, and 16 members of the jury met for cocktails. At the party, the chairman of the judges produced four envelopes and asked Cooper, as the youngest, to pick one. To his and his competitors' consternation he chose the envelope marked 'hare' (the other three were rabbit, wild boar and venison). All the chefs were concerned because hare is a particularly difficult animal to cook well even if time is unlimited. Unlike other game, hare is not hung but requires marinating to soften the flavours; the chefs had to skin the animal, too. The most anxious was Japan's Minoru Sonehara who had never seen a hare before. Over dinner the chefs were given a list of rather prosaic ingredients: carrots, red cabbage and cauliflower - nothing as exotic as a wild mushroom or a small truffle. At 11pm it was up to bed where, with their telephones unplugged, the chefs spent the night racking their brains for inspiration and sleep. The next morning, they took a short coach trip to the nearby Ecole Superieure de Cuisine Francaise, where the cooking would take place. The chefs then drew numbers for the sequence in which they would cook and at 7.20 met their commis chefs, their short-term personal assistants. The commis were students who spoke little English, another big advantage for the French competitors. The competition began at 7.30, which seemed designed to benefit the judges rather than the chefs. To enable them to taste in sequence each chef started to cook at 15 minute intervals and the poor Dutch entrant, who drew number 12, had to sit glumly until 10.15 before he could get to his stove. Two top professional chefs and two professors of the culinary arts supervised the cooking. In theory, they could deduct points but rather than being quick to criticise they were inclined to help and encourage. The tasting judges each had a maximum of 50 points in two categories - presentation and taste. From 11.30, and at 15 minute intervals, they were presented with a silver tray, borne by student waiters and waitresses sworn to silence, and placed in the middle of the room for the judges to appreciate its design. The tray was then passed to the foreman of the jury who cut two slices of meat per judge and placed the two garnishes and sauce alongside. Finally, 16 mouths began to open and close. Inside the kitchen the international character of the contest was obvious. The Spanish chef made a tortilla to enclose his garnish while the extremely calm German produced very classy potato cakes and cabbage dumplings. The Italian, despite a bandaged finger, made ravioli of hare mousse wrapped in cabbage while the Japanese opened a box of wonderful high-tech knives, suitable for sushi, and cooked with chopsticks, too. The Dutch chef made a hare sausage and enthralled the French judges with a Japanese machine for making 'vegetable spaghetti'. But all this was in vain because of the anachronistic finale to the competition. This stipulated that the chefs' creations must be presented on a huge silver tray, an accessory no longer used in good restaurants. Today, chefs prefer to serve their dishes on a plate designed by themselves. The winning dish certainly filled the tray. Entitled 'saddle of hare Pojarski' and based on a recipe that was a great favourite with Tsar Nicholas I, it resembled a chess board with pyramid tops of cabbage and 'castles' made of red cabbage filled with a hare mousse. It was too pretty - food to admire, not to eat. But it impressed the judges. And on a podium filled with some of France's top culinary luminaries (Pierre Troisgros, Emile Jung, Michel GueArard and Jacques Lameloise) Joel Robuchon, president of the jury, announced the winner - France's Michel Izard, who recently became chef des cuisines at the Dodin Bouffant restaurant in Paris. His compatriot, Eric Briffard, was second, and Spain's Jose Arriero Barroso, third. The experience of being in such company will have done a modest, talented young Yorkshireman nothing but good. Whether French gastronomy will ever benefit from such international gatherings is, however, another matter.</p>

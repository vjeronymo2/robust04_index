			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of the Mainland  Affairs Council, Friday [4 March] said Taiwan's future admission  to the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, does  not mean a collapse in the ROC [Republic of China] Government's  policy to keep trade and transportation with Mainland China on  indirect basis. Also the cross-strait ties will not be altered  simply because both Taipei and Peking are expected to join GATT  in foreseeable future. The GATT membership and cross-strait  relations are two different issues, Kao explained, judging that  the government's mainland policy is governed by national  reunification guidelines. The guidelines state very clearly  that direct trade and transportation will not be allowed until  the two sides enter the medium phase of the unification, Kao  said.    Although GATT asked members to remove trade barriers and  abide by the principle of free trade in open market, Taipei and  Peking can still apply Article 21 instead 35 to exclude each  other for enjoying a cross-strait trading privilege.</p>

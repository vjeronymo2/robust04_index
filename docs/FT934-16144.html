			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Kremlin plans radical reforms as election confidence grows RUSSIAN ministers are preparing plans for new reforms beginning next year, on the assumption that a radical, pro-market government will be formed after parliamentary elections set for December. Reformers believe that candidates identifying themselves with President Boris Yeltsin will win in the polls after the smashing of the Russian parliament and the assertion of strong presidential authority. 'Tanks shelling the White House is a much bigger argument than any other,' said Mr Sergei Vassiliev, head of the economic reform centre. 'For ordinary people it is not felt to be so bad that there is a strong man in the Kremlin once more. I think we will get a parliament in December which is not bad from the point of view of reform.' Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister of finance, agreed that 'after the tanks we found relations with the regional people suddenly got much better'. Mr Yeltsin yesterday continued to move against his political opponents, banning the Constitutional Court until a new constitution is adopted and issuing a further decree banning Moscow City Council. Security forces arrested Mr Viktor Anpilov, head of the Labouring Russian group and a leader of the attack on the Ostankino television centre on Sunday. As troops and policemen killed in the battles were buried with full state and religious ceremonies, Mr Yeltsin promised to banish the spectre of 'communist fascism' from the country, and said: 'Russia, its people and its leaders must learn a solemn lesson from this tragedy and do everything in their power so that it cannot happen again.' The provisional death toll in two days of fighting stands at about 170 after the discovery of a further 49 bodies in the White House, according to Mr Viktor Yerin, the interior minister. Some regional councils - as in Vladivostok - have responded to Mr Yeltsin's call to dissolve themselves but others are likely to object strenuously. The optimism in the reformers' camp is based partly on the perceived success of Russia's Choice, the liberal-conservative electoral bloc formed under the leadership of Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister. Mr Vassiliev said that 'the Gaidar bloc has a good chance now to get around 40 per cent in the state Duma' (the lower house of the proposed new federal assembly, the only one for which elections are to be held). Mr Vassiliev and his colleagues are working on an economic plan for next year, which would attempt to stabilise the currency as soon as a new government took office with the aid of the International Monetary Fund. The economic plan includes a new tax regime, being developed by Mr Fyodorov, devolving taxation powers to the regions and republics, in the hope of constructing a system that can satisfy their aspirations of autonomy.

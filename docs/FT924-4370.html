			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / US-led force set to intervene in Somalia: UN approval near as Marines are despatched THE United Nations Security Council last night reached broad agreement on authorising a US-led force for Somalia, while an advance party of Marines was already heading to the starving country. The general accord emerged from private consultations between diplomats from the Security Council's 15 member nations. The council is expected to vote tomorrow or Friday to despatch the force to Somalia to make sure food gets through to the starving rather than to looters and local warlords. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, earlier indicated he preferred a force under more direct UN control. But Sir David Hannay, Britain's delegate, said there was 'a large degree of support' for a multi-national force for which the country providing the largest contingent would also provide the commander. The Chinese delegate indicated he might abstain because Beijing preferred an enlargement of the exisiting UN peacekeeping force in Somalia. The advance party of 1,800 US Marines sailing to Somalia could be in position off Mogadishu today, ready to land once the UN gives the go-ahead. US military officials said the Marines could be used to secure airport facilities, assisting Pakistani troops of the UN peace force already there, and paving the way for a force of perhaps 15,000-20,000 US troops. It is not clear how many countries might be willing to contribute contingents to the proposed US-led force. The prospect of using US troops in Somalia is causing considerable trepidation in Washington, where the successful conclusion of Operation Desert Storm last year has not wholly erased the memory of Vietnam as a traumatic warning against military involvement in faraway countries. Somalia does not, by any account, meet the criteria formulated by Mr Caspar Weinberger, defence secretary under President Ronald Reagan, to guide decisions on when to commit US forces: intervention may have the support of the American people, but there is no substantial US national security interest, nor is it clear what would constitute victory. White House officials have stressed the limited goal of establishing the conditions for food aid to start flowing again. They have played down earlier suggestions that one of the aims would be to re-establish some kind of Somali government in place of the warring guerrilla factions that have made it difficult to mount any effective famine relief operation. Military commanders appear much less worried about the prospect of intervention in relatively flat and barren Somalia than they are about the conflict in mountainous Bosnia, where they say outside military intervention would stand little chance of success. While recognising that the various Somali guerrilla bands could make life uncomfortable, Pentagon officials believe that superior training, armaments and air power would permit a US force to establish control quickly. US officials said Washington told Mr Boutros Ghali last week it expected US forces to be in Somalia for two to four months. After that, conventional UN peacekeeping troops would be able to keep order, possibly demobilise all Somali factions and smooth the way for a functioning government in place of the virtual anarchy now prevailing.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A HIGHER CALLING;  </P> <P> DIOCESE OF ORANGE LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD MEN  </P> <P> WANTED: Single men, any age, for entry-level position with longstanding  international concern. Low pay, long hours, limited wardrobe. Requires five,  possibly eight years training. Must be fluent in Spanish. Obedience to  superiors, celibacy a must. Rewards, incentives almost entirely intangible.  Promotion slow or nonexistent. Preferred jobs not guaranteed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not the sort of ad that would make you want to chuck that Beverly Hills  corporate law practice and dive right in, is it? Or put that career as a pro  shortstop on permanent hold? Or say "thanks but no thanks" to medical school?  </P> <P> But that's precisely what three Orange County men did. And right now, there are  92 others from the county like them working hard, and praying harder, hoping to  fill that job. They look forward to it, they say, with greater fervor and  anticipation than they have for any other event in their lives. For them,  landing that job will be the realization of a dream, the beginning of what they  see as an exalted future.  </P> <P> Sure it's tough, they say. But they can't see themselves being truly happy with  anything other than ordination to the Roman Catholic priesthood.  </P> <P> "I grew up planning to be a doctor and to go to UCI for premed," said Tim  Freyer, 25, of Huntington Beach, who is now Father Tim Freyer, the result of  his ordination early this month. "I wanted the nice house and the family and  the luxuries. But at the end of my junior year at Huntington Beach High School,  I decided I'd be much happier (being a priest). I'd thought that medicine was  important in helping people, but I wanted to help the whole person, in this  life and in the next.  </P> <P> "The best thing for me is that I've been able to follow the call of the Lord,  and because of that, I've been able to experience a lot of love and friendship  with the people I've worked and studied with. I could never be as happy doing  anything else."  </P> <P> Neither could Cirilo Flores, 40, of Costa Mesa, who gave up a Beverly Hills  corporate law practice to study for the priesthood. Or Juan Hernandez, 28, of  Santa Ana, a former semi-pro shortstop who hung up the spikes and glove in  favor of a Roman collar and a breviary.  </P> <P> All three men are products of St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, the only  Catholic seminary in Southern California. It is a school for diocesan, or  parish, priests, who are, said Father Daniel Murray, the director of vocations  for the Diocese of Orange, "the general practitioners of the church." Upon  their ordinations, the new home-grown Orange County priests return to the  county and are assigned to a parish here.  </P> <P> They are perhaps the most visible of the county's priests, differing in their  influence and duties from priests in specific religious orders who study at  seminaries outside California, such as the Norbertines (who teach at Mater Dei  and Santa Margarita high schools, maintain an abbey in El Toro and study  theology in Rome), the Servites (who teach at Servite High School, do hospital  chaplaincy work and have their seminary in St. Louis) or the various Trinity  Missionaries, Jesuits, Dominicans, Franciscans and others.  </P> <P> The diocesan priest is the church's Jack-of-all-trades. He celebrates daily  Mass, hears confessions, performs baptisms, visits sick parishioners, helps  organize bingo, trains altar boys, preaches sermons, conducts funerals and in  general ministers to a specific flock.  </P> <P> In many locations throughout the country, the ranks of diocesan priests are  thinning, and few young men are coming up to fill the jobs. However, Freyer and  four other Orange County diocesan candidates were ordained June 10. That's one  more than the number of priests who were ordained on the same day in the  Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the largest Catholic diocese in the nation. The  Archdiocese of Boston, another large and traditional Catholic enclave, ordained  only five this year.  </P> <P> But in Orange County, gains in religious vocations of all kinds are expected in  the next few years, said Murray.  </P> <P> "I like to think that we have a lot of good priests who have provided good role  models for the young people coming up to admire," said Murray. "It also, I  think, reflects the enthusiasm of Bishop Norman McFarland (bishop of the  Diocese of Orange) for religious vocations. He's been very outspoken about it."  </P> <P> Seminarians also say they feel that the relative youth of the Diocese of Orange  -- it was formed in 1976 -- lends a kind of pioneering enthusiasm to the  prospect of becoming a priest.  </P> <P> And in central Orange County in particular, priests are beginning to emerge  from traditionally devout Vietnamese Catholic families. One of the five priests  ordained this month was Joseph Nguyen, 25, a Vietnamese refugee who had early  seminary training in Vietnam and who was graduated from St. John's.  </P> <P> Whatever their motivation, however, the candidates for the diocesan priesthood  in Orange County are faced with a long road. They cannot simply announce their  desire for ordination and snap on the collar.  </P> <P> That's where St. John's comes in. The seminary, on a quiet hillside in  Camarillo surrounded by citrus groves, has been turning out graduating classes  of new diocesan priests for the southwestern United States for 50 years. On the  wall of one of the dormitories are hung portraits of each class, and it is a  fair bet that most current parish priests in Southern California can be found  there. For example, the first bishop of the Diocese of Orange, William Johnson,  appears in the class of 1944, and the current archbishop of Los Angeles, Roger  M. Mahony, comes from the class of '62.  </P> <P> There are actually two distinct parts of the seminary: the seminary college,  which offers a four-year degree in philosophy to prospective priests who decide  to pursue studies for the priesthood directly out of high school, and the  theological seminary, a short walk down a hill from the college. The  theological seminary requires another four years of study in such subjects as  canon law, church history, homiletics (preaching), pastoral theology, Spanish  and psychology.  </P> <P> (Candidates who have earned a college degree elsewhere must attend the college  for one year of "pre-candidacy" studies in philosophy before being admitted to  the seminary.)  </P> <P> During their time in the seminary, the candidates are elevated, successively,  to the pre-ordination ranks of "reader" and "deacon," and by the time they are  ordained they will have earned either a master's or a doctoral degree in  divinity.  </P> <P> Candidates in Orange County must be recommended for seminary training by Father  Murray, who has several meetings with each man. Most of the men who come to him  to discuss a religious vocation will never enter seminary training, he said.  Some students in the seminary college will drop out before going on to the  theological seminary, but once the candidates enter their final four years at  St. John's the attrition rate is low, said Murray.  </P> <P> Most of the students live at the seminary during the school year, and  participate in a daily routine that would be considered highly regimented at a  secular college. A typical day begins with morning prayers at 7 a.m., classes  until Mass at 12:10, followed by lunch and quiet time for afternoon prayer.  Some afternoons and evenings are taken up with community service work, and most  days will involve studying after dinner. It can be a demanding and sometimes  difficult life, say the seminarians. But most of them, like Cirilo Flores, the  former Beverly Hills lawyer, are exactly where they want to be.  </P> <P> "It came down to the bottom line that there had to be something more," he said.  "When I told people I knew that I wanted to be a priest, they wanted to know  how much I'd be paid. And it was rather difficult, giving up the car and the  condo, things like that. But I find that it's very freeing not to be tied down  to those things."  </P> <P> So does Juan Hernandez, the former semi-pro shortstop who just completed his  first year of theology at St. John's after leaving his seminary studies for  three years to pursue, among other things, his baseball career.  </P> <P> "I was quite comfortable," he said, "making good money, living in my own place.  But I found that I was missing something. I'm very glad I came back. This year  is the best I've ever had in any school, all around. I feel that it has been  very right for me to be here."  </P> <P> How is the decision made? When does the realization come that nothing else will  do? Does it arrive with a blinding flash?  </P> <P> Just the opposite, say the seminarians.  </P> <P> "I used to be kind of a goof-off, arrogant and self-centered" said Stephen  Duffin, 26, a Fullerton resident who recently completed his second year of  theology at St. John's. "But that leaves you isolated and alone. For me, it was  a gradual process of breaking down negative barriers. After the heady days of  high school and the first couple of years of college, I still went to church,  but it didn't take top billing in my life. There was a big emptiness there. I  got a bachelor's degree in journalism from Cal State Fullerton, but I also took  classes in philosophy and felt called to the priesthood.  </P> <P> "It's not like I woke up one day and said, 'Hey! I'll be a priest.' It's more  like one day you finally just say, 'I have to address this.' "  </P> <P> Some, like Hernandez, take an initial run at it but find they have left  something undone in the secular world.  </P> <P> "I found I loved baseball very, very much," he said, "and I wanted to give it  one last shot. I thought that time was a factor. I couldn't always play  baseball, but I could always be a priest."  </P> <P> After graduating from St. John's college, Hernandez returned to Orange County  and joined a semi-pro team. He played for a year and a half, then worked at a  succession of jobs, "looking for something that would really capture my  interest."  </P> <P> He decided to obtain a teaching credential. But while he was driving with a  friend to UC Irvine to enroll in classes, he said, "all the time I was thinking  about the priesthood again, and it seemed to be knocking on my door again. I  wanted to get into the spiritual realm of people's lives and in teaching I  wouldn't have been able to do that. I knew I had to reconsider my vocation."  </P> <P> Steven Holtkamp, 24, a second-year seminarian from Santa Ana, grew up, in a  sense, with the priesthood.  </P> <P> "My family was always very, very involved with the church," he said, "and I  worked in the rectory after hours during high school. There, you get to see the  full range of what it means to be human. It really made me stop and think that  priests were dealing with people at the base level -- the most happy and tragic  times in their lives."  </P> <P> Like Holtkamp, who went to Mater Dei High School, many seminarians attended  Catholic schools at one time in their lives and, said Father Murray, almost all  were once altar boys. Freyer, however, attended public schools exclusively.  </P> <P> "My dad was a Lutheran who became a convert when I was in about the fifth or  sixth grade," said Freyer. "He got cancer when I was in the eighth grade, and I  saw how much good the priests did for him and my family. They would come over  for a home Mass, and that day was a big high for him. His whole disposition  would change."  </P> <P> However, said Freyer, such satisfying moments are not always part of the daily  reality of either the priesthood or the seminary. And that realization, he  said, sometimes comes hard.  </P> <P> "My vocation became stronger with time," he said. "But there were times that I  wondered if I could make it through the years. I didn't doubt my vocation too  much, although now and then I thought about what I could do if I left. Also,  I'd see that the priests had shortcomings and that the (seminary) system wasn't  perfect, and that would get me discouraged sometimes."  </P> <P> For Nguyen, the seminary could be difficult "because of the long training and  the sometimes monotonous atmosphere. You're always longing for something that's  ahead of you. You're anxious to be a priest. You can get tired of school."  </P> <P> Hernandez, a first-year theology student, said, "I have to say there are times  when I still question (my vocation). It's not something that one never asks  again. It's like marriage in that even when some people are married they may  not be sure it's right."  </P> <P> But, said Duffin, reality can be a pleasant surprise.  </P> <P> "I had a naive picture of the seminary," he said. "I thought I'd see guys with  their heads in the clouds, floating around, all pious. But when I first came  here I saw guys with Walkmans bopping around, and I said, 'I can do that.' It's  just normal guys doing normal things."  </P> <P> Almost. The priestly promise of celibacy and their commitment to a life of  relative poverty, say the seminarians, can weigh on them to differing degrees.  </P> <P> "I think the rewards of the friendship and the openness people have shown me  means more to me now than money or a family," said Freyer. "There's a freedom  in not having a wife or family that allows you to become part of others'  families."  </P> <P> Duffin said celibacy "probably is easier for some guys than others. But what  human beings need is intimacy, and you don't give that up when you're celibate.  You channel all the passions and desires you have into all the good things they  can bring."  </P> <P> Flores said priests "are committing their lives for others. That's a real basic  understanding. People are going to be coming to you at all hours, all days.  It's a basic human fact, sexuality. But it can also be viewed as an adventure  to be involved with people at so many intimate moments in their lives."  </P> <P> Keeping the commitments, said Holtkamp, involves "remembering who's in charge  here. If your heart's in it, it really isn't a sacrifice."  </P> <P> But, said Duffin, the priest-to-be must remember that he is, in effect,  studying not to occupy a higher position, but to be demoted.  </P> <P> "With a lot of the attention that people give you, you can get swell-headed,"  he said. "But you have to remember that when you're ordained, you're stepping  down to be a servant of the people."  </P> <P> The ordination is the payoff. And because it is a joyful and relatively rare  ceremony, the church trots out the big cast, the bright vestments and puts on  the big show that manages at the same time to be highly personal and intimate.  </P> <P> At this month's ceremony at Holy Family Cathedral in Orange, the five new  priests' hands were anointed by Bishop McFarland, an estimated 150 priests from  throughout the diocese laid hands on the young men's heads and embraced them  one by one, and several hundred of their family members and friends in the  packed church finally applauded them enthusiastically.  </P> <P> Later in the parish hall, reception lines formed before each new priest, with  family and friends offering congratulations and receiving the first blessings  of each man's new career.  </P> <P> "It's living it up in the real sense," said Nguyen. "Knowing you will be  working with people and fulfilling a call that grows deeper within you."  </P> <P> Freyer, who celebrated his first Mass at his home parish of SS. Simon and Jude  Church in Huntington Beach the next day, said "the whole weekend (of the  ordination) for me was beyond my wildest dreams. It was so great. It was a very  spiritual time, a very humbling time, seeing so many people I'd met or worked  with, and all this love just poured out on me.  </P> <P> "I'm still not able to absorb it all, even now."DON TORMEY / Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

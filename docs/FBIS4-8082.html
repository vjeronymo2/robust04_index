			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Banja Luka, April 11 (TANJUG) -- Following Sunday's  bombing by the NATO aircraft of Bosnian Serb targets south of  Gorazde, Bosnian Moslem forces attacked early on Monday Serb  positions along several major directions, along which they have  been undertaking offensive actions for days already.    Supported by their artillery, Moslems attacked from Bugojno  in the direction of Srbobran, central Bosnia, while the corridor  and Serb positions near Brcko and Doboj bore the brunt of Moslem  attacks in northern Bosnia.    Early on Monday Moslem forces delivered a heavy  mortar-infantry attack 7 km southwest of Brcko on Serb positions  in the area of Ulice, Lukici and Lipovac, Bosnian Serb military  sources said.    Members of the Bosnian Serb army defending access points to  Brcko and the corridor linking eastern and western Bosnia and  the republic of Serb Krajina, responded to the attack and a lull  followed in that part of the front along the River Sava valley.    Moslem units are launching heavy attacks along nearly all  directions around Doboj, the sources said.    Moslem forces on Monday resumed unabated artillery attacks  on  the western positions on the Doboj front and its suburbs and  residential areas.    Except for a few observations by U.N. representatives that  Moslems were undertaking offensive actions in the Doboj region  and warnings to them not to provoke Serbs, there were no  stronger reactions by the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to a  nearly two-week-long Moslem offensive on Doboj, Bosnian Serb  sources said. The media attention was in that period focused on  Gorazde, from which 10,000 Moslem troops mounted a fierce  offensive and thus provoked the Serb counter-offensive.    Serb positions and localities on the right bank of the River  Bosna, from Zavidovici to Maglaj (south of Doboj), were a target  of heavy infantry and mortar fire. Serb forces did not have any  casualties and repulsed a stronger artillery-infantry attack in  the Trebava front, northeast of Doboj.    Moslem forces did not cease attacks on the Srbobran front  either, from the direction of Bugojno in central Bosnia.  Attacks were renewed along almost all sectors of the front in  this area, Bosnian Serb military sources reported on Monday.    Since the outset of the all-out Moslem offensive on the  Bosnian Serb Republic mounted late in March, forces of Bosnian  Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic have been trying to reopen the  strategically important road to Jajce and western Bosnia, by  breaking through Serb lines in the direction of Srbobran.</p>

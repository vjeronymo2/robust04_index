			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / US strikes blow at Canada free trade deal THE US Customs Service yesterday struck a blow at the US-Canada free trade agreement by formally ruling that the content of Honda Civics shipped from Canada to the US will be subject to a 2.5 per cent import duty. About 75,000 Honda Civics are manufactured in Ontario for export to the US each year. A Customs Service audit found that the cars did not contain the 50 per cent North American content required for duty-free treatment. The ruling has infuriated Canadian officials, who have been trying to convince their voters that the loss of thousands of jobs since the start of the FTA three years ago was due to recession rather than the pact. The decision could make it harder to convince Canadian voters that the North American free trade agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico will benefit their economy. A ruling by the Commerce Department, expected on Friday, could create further rancour if the US levies new duties of up to 15 per cent on Canadian lumber. This could bring counter retaliation from Ottawa and an escalation in the trade crisis, which also includes disputes over beer and magnesium. The long-delayed Customs Department audit found that the engine blocks, produced in Marysville, Ohio, and exported to Canada for re-export to the US, did not contain sufficient North American content. The US and Canada have been unable to agree on what constitutes local content. The manager of the engine plant, Mr Al Kinzer, was quoted as calling the result of the audit 'baffling'. He said: 'We know these are American engines. We make them in Ohio from aluminum ingot and molten iron. We do not understand Customs' rules that do not count basic manufacturing processes such as the casting and machining we do at our engine plants.' Mr Scott Whitlock, executive vice-president of Honda of America said the ruling was a severe setback for US-Canada free trade.</p>

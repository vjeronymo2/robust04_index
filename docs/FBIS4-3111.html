			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Tang Shuifu (3282 3055 1381)] </F>   [Text] Seoul, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- Korean President Kim  Yong-sam said here today: "During my recent visit to China, I  held talks with President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng; we  frankly and sincerely exchanged views on further developing  bilateral relations and on issues of common concern. The talks  were very beneficial."    Kim Yong-sam made these remarks while meeting at the  presidential office with Wu Xueqian, executive vice chairman of  the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC], who is currently on a visit to  Korea.    Kim Yong-sam added: "During my visit, I saw how China's  reform and opening up has developed robustly. China has scored  tremendous achievements. I believe China will score even  greater achievements in its economic construction."    Wu Xueqian said: The establishment of diplomatic relations  between China and Korea in August 1992 restored the long  historical relationship between the two countries. President  Kim Yong-sam's recent visit to China made important  contributions to further advancing relations between the two  countries.    Korean Foreign Affairs Minister Han Sung-chu hosted a  banquet  here this evening to welcome Wu Xueqian. Before the banquet,  Han Sung-chu and Wu Xueqian had a cordial conversation.    Wu Xueqian arrived in Seoul on 10 April to begin an 8-day  goodwill visit to Korea at Han Sung-chu's invitation.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> DDC DRUG MADE AVAILABLE FOR AIDS  </P> <P> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week made Hoffman-La Roche's drug  DDC available to AIDS patients in a "compassionate use program" designed to  test the safety of the drug, the pharmaceutical firm and the FDA announced  Thursday.  </P> <P> "The most exciting thing about DDC is that it is looking more and more to be  the drug that DDI was supposed to be," said Dr. Jay Lalezari, co-director to  the HIV Clinical Research Center at Mt.  </P> <P> Zion Hospital in San Francisco.  </P> <P> "We don't know the efficacy, but it looks like it is well-tolerated," he said.  </P> <P> New York-based Bristol-Myers has been distributing the experimental drug DDI  free in a similar compassionate use program to about 8,000 patients who are not  responding to AZT treatment or cannot tolerate AZT.  </P> <P> The side effects of DDI include nausea, diarrhea and depression, but DDC, which  stands for dideoxycytidine, has shown few side effects, Lalezari said.  </P></p>

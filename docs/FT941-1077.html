			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (7): Newcomers go for ease and simplicity - Young designers favour the daring baby doll dress / The new generation Fashion may have been confusing recently but there's no denying its vitality. And without vitality, quality fashion simply is not fashion. It is just a uniform. And while that can be interesting in its own way, ultimately it makes us jaded, restless, edgy with the need for change. The early 1990s found fashion concreted into uniform; grunge shattered it; and out of the rubble something new will be built. Exactly what is still in doubt. There are, however. plenty of suggestions. That is what all the fuss was about this month at the Paris collections: a wealth of competing ideas, a dazzling display of exciting new directions. Some will prove to be cul-de-sacs but some will be the first steps on fashion's new route. Some of the freshest ideas are coming from the stalwarts of the old guard, such as Issey Miyake, Karl Lagerfeld, Vivienne Westwood, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Valentino, John Galliano, Rei Kawakubo and Ann Demeulemeester. But there is also a new generation of designers which, probably because the fashion establishment is in a period of joyous experiment, are managing to have their ideas taken into account as well. From their ambitious, idealistic ranks, three designers and one design partnership stand out. They all have essentially different styles, different points of view and different customers in their sights but they are remarkably united in believing that ease and simplicity are the keynotes for clothes this spring. (But watch out for something entirely different next autumn.) Ease and simplicity can be done many ways: from Paul Frith's deliberately understated sophistication, through Maria Grachvogel's high glamour and Lisa Johnson's playfully coy camp to Clements Ribeiro's sporty gamine. Asked to select one outfit to sum up this fashion moment, none of them hesitated. 'The baby doll dress,' says Paul Frith, 'because it is very short, very feminine, sexy, young and very daring. It is a bit floaty so there's a sort of innocence about it; that's the best sort of sexy dress. It provokes the imagination, gets the mind working. The strappy effect is important; I love the natural shoulder line, the fragility and vulnerability of the curves and hollows made by the bones.' Like most of this new generation of designers, Frith looks upon the clean, youthful simplicity which is the mood for spring as a kind of psychic clearing of the decks for action. It deliberately rejects the overly structured, body-hugging styles which held sway throughout the late-1980s and into this decade. There was a jaded knowingness to those clothes which looks quite distasteful now. It is also a decisive move away from 'deconstruction' and the grunge look which so disconcerted women over 25. It is likely, however, given the undeniably juvenile quality of this spring's definitive looks, that they will remain disconcerted. In some cases, they should be. Of her pink baby doll dress, Lisa Johnson says: 'It's fun, not serious and sophisticated. I think things got overly complicated in the last few years. There's a sense of relief at the simplicity of wearing just one garment. This collection is very light and breezy. Call it breezy classicism.' And although she is certain that the mini version is breeziest of all, Lisa also makes her simple dresses in long versions. These should hold few terrors for those old enough to buy a drink. 'You can wear a T-shirt or a shirt underneath,' she says. 'It ties round the bust but nowhere else so it is guite flattering and very comfortable.' Maria Grachvogel, a self-taught designer who invented the complicated but cunning construction of her body-enhancing slip-dress 10 years ago when she was 14, says of it: 'It's simple and glamorous. What else should clothes be? It's a dress which grows with you; it moulds itself to your shape and it's kind to women of all sizes.' She is hardly alone in her delight in the unadorned minimalism of the slip dress. From designers such as Giorgio Armani and Calvin Klein down, the whole fashion industry is in love with it. At smart parties in Milan, New York and London the most stylish women in their slivers of silk or satin are making the rest look over-dressed and middle-aged. Some are wearing just one fluttering Klein slip, others layer two in contrasting colours, others layer theirs over a silk T-shirt or organza blouse. Whichever way it is worn, it looks modern and effortless. 'It is,' says Suzanne Clements, partner with her husband, Inacio Ribeiro, in Clements Ribeiro, 'a matter of attitude, not age. I think everyone desires some freshness and some subtlety in clothes now.' Sleek, uncluttered, spare; that is the mood for summer. 'Clean-looking,' says Inacio. 'Innocent,' says Frith. 'Timeless,' says Grachvogel. 'Uncomplicated,' says Johnson. Almost, one could add, puritanical in its insistence on the simplest of shapes and the absence of accessories. But not humourless: the young and lean of leg can wear the baby doll dresses with Minnie Mouse heels and socks (Lisa's have a row of baby-bonnet pink bows down the back) and the short shorts with clumpy Alpine-meadow-mowing Birkenstock sandals. If fashion is taking a breather from the obvious and complicated, it is just keeping its powder dry for an autumn of richness, sensuousness and complication. Who says so? Frith: 'Very dark, lush, layered, contrasting lengths.' Grachvogel: 'Aphrodite at the witching hour, baroque glamour.' Clements and Ribeiro: 'Narnia, shades of monochrome, sparkly fabrics, bright colours, little bonnets and fluffy muffs.' And Johnson: 'Cutesy, cutesy, very pretty, lots of detail, very long and very short, lambskin, velvet, fluffy things and silver metallic, vents and tucks and furry crowns.' Furry crowns? Fluffy muffs? For this summer of simplicity, may we be truly gateful.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Index-related buying fails to stem Nikkei's decline ACTIVE index-related buying by investment trusts failed to support share prices, and the Nikkei average registered another new 1992 low, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei fell 48.77 to 14,773.79, its fifth consecutive decline after fluctuations on margin positions, short selling, and index-related buying, hitting the day's high of 14,906.16 and low of 14,658.57 in the morning session. Volume rose to 240m shares from 199m. Declines led advances by 739 to 167, with 84 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 12.78 to 1,114.02 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.28 to 928.91. A total of 659 issues, 53 per cent of the first section, fell to new lows for the year. Most analysts see the fall continuing. 'If share prices discount corporate earnings for the current fiscal year, the Nikkei could fall to 12,000 in the next three to six months,' said Mr Craig Chudler at UBS Phillips and Drew. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the market leader, fell Y7,000 to a new low of Y458,000 on selling by individuals. In spite of the overall weakness, most banks were firm on index buying, with Industrial Bank of Japan up Y20 to Y1,740 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank gaining Y40 to Y1,330. However, Nippon Credit Bank, the long-term credit bank, lost Y100 to Y3,500 on continued worries over its problem loans. High-technology blue chips were mixed. Hitachi fell Y1 to Y731, in spite of small-lot buying by foreigners, and Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y60 to Y1,120 on rumours of a downward revision of its earnings. However, Sony advanced Y20 to Y3,780 and NEC gained Y10 to Y750. Investors took profits on highly-priced stocks which had rallied on prospects of firm earnings. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, lost Y360 to Y7,590, Seven-Eleven Japan fell Y160 to Y5,100, and Secom, the security company, declined Y300 to Y6,000. Speculative theme stocks fell on another round of liquidation. Okamoto Industries, the most active issue of the day, fell Y15 to Y810 along with other Aids-related issues such as Mochida Pharmaceutical, down Y40 to Y2,220. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 391.36 to 15,622.70 in volume of 22.5m shares. Roundup FOR ONCE, the rest of the region seemed to have more serious immediate concerns than Tokyo. AUSTRALIA weakened on a four and a half year low for the Australian dollar and uncertainty ahead of next week's federal budget. Speculation that the government might sell more shares in its 70 per cent owned Commonwealth Bank of Australia also had a depressing effect on the market. The All-Ordinaries index fell 16.9, or 1.1 per cent to 1,570.7 after the Australian treasurer, Mr John Dawkins, said on radio that the government did not see the need for any further easing in monetary policy, and that the government budget deficit would be 'something like' ADollars 14.5bn, the latter raising speculation about the Commonwealth Bank stake. Turnover rose from ADollars 146m to ADollars 205m. The investment bank, Bain &amp; Co, said that the domestic dollar will rebound over the next week. Westpac Banking fell 12 cents to ADollars 2.98, or 2 cents below the price of its proposed rights issue. The diamond miner, Ashton Mining, fell 22 cents to ADollars 1.56 after bad news at De Beers; the central selling organisation said it will reduce Ashton's diamond sales 'by no more than' 5 per cent. SINGAPORE dropped further on foreign blue chip selling, the Straits Times Industrial index chips closing another 26.68, or 1.9 per cent lower at 1,366.23. Turnover rose from SDollars 94.2m to SDollars 142.3m. Keppel's near 20 per cent rise in interim group earnings left the shares 10 cents lower at SDollars 5.65 while Sembawang Shipyard, Singapore Press Holdings foreign shares and SIA foreign each lost 50 cents to SDollars 6.20, SDollars 12.40 and SDollars 16.20 respectively. HONG KONG lost early gains in afternoon profit-taking,the Hang Seng index slipping 7.56 to 5879.19 as a flurry of rumours surfaced on the trading halt in 10 local companies controlled by the Malaysian-Chinese tycoon Lee Ming Tee. SEOUL hit a 56-month low, the composite index falling 9.79 to 492.66; NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index fell 18.12 to 1,496.56 as Fletcher Challenge and Brierley slid again; and TAIWAN 's weighted index fell 56.67 to 3,901.61 as margin calls forced investors to sell shares. MANILA, however, rebounded smartly after Wednesday in improved trading, bolstered by the overnight US gain in Philippine Long Distance Telephone, the composite index rising 25.58 to 1471.25 and PLDT closing 30 pesos higher Manila at 1,020.</p>

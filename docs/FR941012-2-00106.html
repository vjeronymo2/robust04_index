Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from September 19, 1994, through September 29, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on September 28, 1994 (59 FR 49425). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for each amendment request is shown below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By November 14, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (Project Director) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Carolina Power &amp; Light Company, et al., Docket No. 50-400, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, Wake and Chatham Counties, North Carolina <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> August 19, 1994 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment will move the current procedural details of the radiological effluent Technical Specifications (TS) programmatic controls for radioactive effluents, radiological environmental monitoring and solid radioactive wastes from the Administrative Controls Section of the TS to the Offsite Dose Calculation Manual (ODCM) or the Process Control Program (PCP), as appropriate, in accordance with the guidance of Generic Letter 89-01. This amendment will also incorporate changes to the reporting requirements for the Effluent Release Reports, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.36; incorporate references to the new 10 CFR Part 20; and revise the terminology for the gaseous effluent release rate limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

The changes are unrelated to the initiation and mitigation of accidents and equipment malfunctions addressed in the Final Safety Analysis Report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revisions to the reporting requirements for Effluent Release Reports, the gaseous effluent release rate limit and the relocation of the old 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302 have no impact on plant systems, plant operations or accident precursors. The changes to the Effluent Report requirements and the updated reference to 10 CFR 20.1302 are administrative in nature. The change to the gaseous effluent release limit is also administrative in nature in that it will allow the continued operation of the facility with the same release rate limits as are currently implemented by the Technical Specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, there would be no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The relaxation of surveillance frequency will not affect any of the initiators or precursors of any accident previously evaluated. Performance of CS spray nozzle testing on a ten year basis rather than on a five year basis will not increase the likelihood that a transient initiating event will occur because transients are initiated by external events, equipment malfunction, and/or catastrophic system failure. There are no failure mechanisms or modes for the CS system or spray nozzles that could initiate a transient since the CS system is passive except during a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). Upon receipt of a Containment Spray signal (Containment High-High Pressure coincident with a Safety Injection Signal), the CS pumps automatically start and valves align to provide spray flow through the CS risers, ring headers, and out the spray nozzles. Periodic testing requirements for the CS pumps and valves (the active components of the system) are unaffected by the proposed changes. Industry experience and previous test experience at Zion Station supports the conclusion that functional checks of the spray nozzles on a ten year basis is adequate to detect degradation or blockage of the spray nozzles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed typographical and administrative changes do not affect the operability or surveillance requirements given in Technical Specifications. They will only improve consistency of existing terminology and format of Technical Specifications and will remove temporarily imposed Bases that are no longer applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the fact that reliability of the system will not be affected and transient precursors and initiators are not affected by operation in accordance with the proposed changes, the probability of occurrence of accidents previously evaluated will not significantly increase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change in surveillance frequency will not affect the ability of the CS system to function as designed during the accidents considered in the Safety Analyses. Periodic testing requirements for the CS pumps and valves (the active components of the system) are unaffected by the proposed changes. Industry experience and previous test experience at Zion Station supports the conclusion that functional checks of the spray nozzles on a ten year basis is adequate to detect degradation or blockage of the spray nozzles. Given the proposed changes, the CS system will maintain the ability to reduce containment pressure, remove heat from containment, and remove iodine from the containment atmosphere during the design basis LOCA. As a result, peak containment pressure will be maintained below design pressure and the off-site release due to the postulated accident will remain as described in the Safety Analyses. Therefore, based on the previous discussion, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in consequences of any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications do not involve the addition of any new or different types of safety related equipment, nor does it involve the operation of equipment required for safety operation of the facility in a manner different from those addressed in the safety analyses. No safety related equipment or function will be altered as a result of the proposed changes. Also, changes to the procedures governing normal plant operation and recovery from an accident are not necessitated by the proposed Technical Specification changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed typographical and administrative changes do not affect the operability or surveillance requirements given in Technical Specifications. They will only improve consistency of existing terminology and format of Technical Specifications and will remove Bases that are no longer applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since no new failure modes or mechanisms are added by the proposed changes, the possibility or a new or different kind of accident is not created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plant safety margins are established through LCOs, limiting safety system settings, and safety limits specified in the Technical Specifications. There will be no changes to either the physical design of the plant or to any of these settings and limits as a result of relaxing the surveillance frequency of CS nozzle checks from five years to ten years. Testing on a ten year basis is adequate to detect spray nozzle degradation or blockage since the system piping and spray nozzles are constructed of corrosion resistant Type 304 stainless steel and since the system is normally passive (i.e. spray risers and spray rings are empty with no flow except during an accident). This conclusion was also provided in NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05 which recommended revising the surveillance frequency as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed typographical and administrative changes do not affect the operability or surveillance requirements given in Technical Specifications. They will only improve consistency of existing terminology and format of Technical Specifications and will remove Bases that are no longer applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above discussion, the ability to safely shut down the operating unit and mitigate the consequences of all accidents previously evaluated will be maintained. Therefore, the margin of safety is not significantly affected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The change in the surveillance frequency has been evaluated and approved by the NRC staff as discussed in Section 9.1 of NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements.'' The change is based on the finding in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUREG-1366 that an analysis of AFW pump failures indicates that a monthly surveillance test interval may be contributing to AFW pump unavailability through failures and equipment degradation and, therefore, AFW pump availability is increased by quarterly testing on a staggered basis. Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specification Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation,'' provided the sample TS for this change. The change is accomplished by dividing TS 4.7.1.2.1a into two parts. The new 4.7.1.2.1a maintains the previous 31-day testing frequency for the AFW valves while the new 4.7.1.2.1b inserts a new frequency of once per 92 days for the AFW pump tests. Also, an obsolete footnote is deleted. The new footnote discussed above is consistent with NUREG-1431, ``Standard Technical Specifications for Westinghouse Plants.''

Decreasing the frequency of AFW pump testing as specified in TS from monthly to quarterly will have no impact upon the probability of any accident, since the AFW pumps are not accident initiating equipment. Also, since Catawba's AFW pump performance history supports making the proposed change, system response following an accident will not be adversely affected. Therefore, the requested amendments will not result in increased accident consequences. Deletion of the obsolete footnotes as indicated in the Catawba technical specification markups is purely an administrative change, and therefore will have no impact upon either the probability or consequences of any accident. Incorporating the new STS note will only serve to clarify when the turbine-driven pump is required to be tested and will not have any impact upon either the probability or consequences of any accident.

Deletion of the Catawba obsolete footnotes has no bearing on any accident initiating mechanisms. Incorporating the clarifying note from the new STS will not result in any new acident sequences, since plant operation will be unaffected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion 3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The AFW pumps will still be capable of fulfilling their required safety function, since plant operating experience supports the proposed change. The availability of the AFW pumps will be increased as a result of the proposed amendments because they will not have to be made unavailable for testing as frequently. Finally, the proposed amendments are consistent with the NRC position and guidance set forth in NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05. Deletion of the Catawba obsolete footnotes will not result in any impact to plant safety margins.

Specifically, the proposed amendment replaces existing TS Figures 3.2.2.a,b,c,d, and e and associated TS Tables 3.2.2.a,b,c,d, and e, that define the limits for minimum reactor vessel temperature for pressurization and account for neutron damage at exposures up to 18 effective full power years (EFPY), with new figures and tables that are applicable for up to 18 EFPY. The licensee stated that the new pressure-temperature (P-T) limits were developed based on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant-specific Charpy shift model for Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1 which is consistent with and meets the requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, ``Radiation Embrittlement of Reactor Vessel Materials.'' The new P-T limits were calculated in accordance with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G, and with the requirements specified in Appendix G to Section III of the American Society of Mechnical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME Code). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 [NMP1], in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Components of the reactor primary coolant system are operated so that no substantial mechanical or thermal loading is applied unless the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) materials are at a temperature well above the reference nil-ductility temperature (RT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> NDT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) of the limiting RPV material. Protection against brittle fracture is further ensured by postulating a defect with a depth 1/4 of the RPV wall thickness and a length 1-1/2 times the wall thickness, and calculating the allowable pressure loading as a function of temperature using linear elastic fracture mechanics. Safety factors are applied to the allowable loading determination and lower bound fracture toughness properties are used to represent the material behavior. The net effect of the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G and the ASME Section III, Appendix G P-T curve calculative procedures is to produce very conservative P-T curves. These procedures have been applied in the calculation of the proposed P-T limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neutron damage during plant operation is accounted for in the allowable pressure loading by calculating an adjusted reference nil-ductility temperature (ART <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> NDT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ). Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, defines the ART <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> NDT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  as the sum of the reference nil-ductility temperature (RT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> NDT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) plus the shift in the reference nil-ductility temperature caused by irradiation ([delta]RT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> NDT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ), plus a margin. The proposed amendment replaces Equation (2) in Regulatory Position 2.1 with an accurate plant-specific model. The ART <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> NDT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  margin is the same as for earlier P-T curve calculations. Operation of NMP1 in accordance with the proposed P-T operating limits will preclude brittle failure of the RPV materials. Safety margins for brittle fracture are in accordance with those specified in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G and Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code. Therefore, the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment incorporates P-T operating limits based on previously established calculative procedures described in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G, Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code, and Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2. The proposed changes to the P-T operating limits are based on analyses of the irradiated limiting plate material for Nine Mile Point Unit 1. The proposed changes do not modify any plant equipment nor do they create any potential initiating events that would create any new or different kind of accident. Operation in accordance with the proposed P-T operating limits will preclude brittle failure of the reactor vessel material, since safety margins specified in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G and Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code will be maintained.

These systems are not accident initiators, since their design function is accident mitigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed TS change, which only addresses equipment status, will not significantly increase the probability of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated. The addition of the proposed ACTION statement enables the plant not to implement TS Section 3.0.3, which requires a plant shutdown, when the HPCI system is inoperable in conjunction with one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem. The proposed TS change does not impact the operation of any equipment important to safety. This proposed TS change does not make physical modifications to the plant or to equipment, nor does it impact any design requirements of the HPCI, CS, and LPCI systems. The proposed TS change does not introduce any failure mechanisms of a different type than those previously evaluated, since no physical changes are being made to the facility. This proposed change will not create any new failure modes which would cause plant equipment to malfunction more frequently than previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The basis for TS Sections 3.8.2.1 and 3.8.3.1, which specify that four (4) independent divisions of Safeguard dc electrical power shall be operable, or shall be restored to operability with 8 hours, is to ensure that sufficient power is available to supply safety-related equipment required to safely shut down the plant, and to provide for mitigation and control of accident conditions at the plant. As discussed in Section 6.3.2 of the NRC Safety Evaluation Report (SER), i.e., NUREG-0991, ``Safety Evaluation Report Related to the Operation of Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2,'' dated August 1983, the most limiting single failure for the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS), which includes all break sizes, is the failure of the dc power system common to the HPCI system, one (1) CS subsystem, and one (1) LPCI subsystem. Only one (1) single failure is assumed to occur in the event of a Design Basis Accident (DBA). Therefore, three (3) LPCI pumps, one (1) CS subsystem, and the Automatic Depressurization (ADS) system would be operable and available, for use in the event of a DBA, to provide sufficient core cooling to safely shut down the plant. Although the loss of Division 2 dc power specifically impacts the ``B'' LPCI and ``B'' CS, the analysis performed in the NRC SER evaluates the number of ECCS available for use in a DBA. Since the amount of available core cooling is independent of which loop of LPCI or CS is assumed to fail, this analysis is applicable to the loss of any division/loop of LPCI or CS. Therefore, the loss of the HPCI system, one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem is bounded by the existing analysis. Since the loss of HPCI, one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem is an analyzed condition, and actions associated with TS Section 3.0.3 are related to unanalyzed conditions, the requirements of TS Section 3.0.3 are not applicable to this scenario. Adding an ACTION statement, as proposed, identical to the ACTION statement which currently applies to the loss of Division 2 of Safeguard dc electrical power causes no change in the consequences of any accidents previously evaluated. This proposed TS change does not impact systems, structures, and components designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. In the event of an accident, the plant configuration following the event will be within the bounds of the existing analysis, and there will be no change in the radiological consequences due to an accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident [previously] evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed TS change does not require any physical changes to plant systems or equipment, nor will it affect the ability of the HPCI, CS, and LPCI systems from performing their design functions, which is to mitigate the consequences of an accident. These systems do not contribute to the initiation of an accident, since their function is accident mitigation. This proposed TS change will not introduce new equipment malfunction or failure modes. The proposed TS change will not introduce any failure mechanisms of a different type than those previously evaluated. The existing design basis for the plant, as described in Section 6.3.2.5 of the LGS Updated Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) and Section 6.3.2 of the NRC SER, bounds the condition proposed by this TS Change Request. Section 6.3.2 of the NRC SER indicates that the most limiting single failure for the ECCS is the loss of the dc system powering the HPCI, CS, and LPCI systems. Assuming this failure, three (3) LPCI pumps, one (1) CS subsystem, and the ADS would still be operable and available, for use in the event of a DBA, to ensure adequate core cooling to safely shut down the plant. Although the loss of Division 2 dc power specifically affects ``B'' LPCI and ``B'' CS, the analysis performed in the NRC SER evaluates the number of ECCS available for use in a DBA. Since the amount of available core cooling is independent of which loop of LPCI or CS is assumed to fail, this analysis is applicable to the loss of any division/loop of LPCI or CS. Since the loss of HPCI, one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem, is an analyzed condition, and the actions associated with TS Section 3.0.3 pertain to unanalyzed conditions, the requirements of TS Section 3.0.3 do not apply to the condition proposed by this TS Change Request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed TS change [TS] does not involve any physical changes to the design or functional requirements of the LPCI, CS, or HPCI systems. These systems will continue to function as designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed TS change involves adding an additional ACTION statement, and revising the associated supporting Bases section, to specifically address the inoperability of the HPCI system in conjunction with the inoperability of one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem. These systems would be inoperable in the event of the loss of Division 2 of the Safeguard dc electrical power supply. The Bases associated with Safeguard electrical power systems, which provide power to equipment required to safely shutdown the plant and to mitigate consequences of an accident, are unchanged. The proposed TS change involves adding an ACTION statement which is identical to the ACTION statement which addresses the inoperability of Division 2 of Safeguard dc power, which is a condition analyzed in the LGS UFSAR and NRC SER. Therefore, the proposed TS change to include an additional ACTION statement does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

Since all Battery Load Table changes (i.e., UFSAR Changes) and procedure changes are evaluated per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59, no reduction (significant or insignificant) in the margin of safety will be allowed.

Regulatory Guide 1.108, Rev. 1, states that the performance of a loss of Off-site Power (LOP) test (Surveillance Requirement 4.8.1.1.2.h.4.b) immediately following the 24 hour endurance run demonstrates that the Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) can start in the prescribed time when the EDG is at its normal operating temperature. The purpose of performing the LOP test immediately following the 24 hour endurance run is to demonstrate the hot restart capability of the EDG at full load conditions. However, demonstrating diesel generator hot restart capability without loading the engine does not invalidate or reduce the effectiveness of the hot restart test. Performance of this test can be conducted in any plant condition since its performance at power will have no adverse effect on plant operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The LOP test will continue to be performed at standby conditions to provide assurance that the EDG is capable of responding to a LOP as assumed in the accident analyses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EDG design and function remain as previously analyzed.

Several other clarifications and enhancements have been incorporated to provide consistency with the latest version of standard TSs (NUREG-1431). The new action times provide a prompt one-hour action to initiate unit shutdown for conditions that could prevent the injection of a CLA into the core. For boron concentration outside limits, a 72-hour action to restore CLA concentration is allowed because the CLA can still perform the core injection safety function. The removal of surveillance requirements (SRs) for verifying automatic opening features for the CLA isolation valves does not impact the required TS alignment that is assumed in the safety analysis. The instrumentation calibration and functional test SRs have also been removed based on the instrumentation only providing CLA level and pressure indications for TS compliance and not performing an accident mitigation function. The above changes do not alter the required limits for CLA operability or system configurations. These changes are consistent with NUREG-1431 and provide acceptable flexability[sic] for CLA operability verification and surveillance testing and reasonable actions for CLA inoperability. Since no changes have been proposed that would change the conditions assumed for the CLAs in the accident analysis, the consequences of an accident will not be increased. The CLAs perform accident mitigation functions and are not considered to be the source of an accident.

The removal of the remaining reference to cycle-specific core operating limits and Technical Specification Figures 3.12-1A and 1B, from the Surry Technical Specifications has no influence or impact on the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment is administrative in nature in that it corrects omissions from a previously approved amendment. This change has no impact on actions to be taken when or if limits are exceeded as is required by the current Technical Specifications. Each accident analysis addressed in the Surry UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report] will be examined with respect to changes in cycle-dependent parameters, which are determined by application of NRC-approved reload design methodologies. The impact of these parameter changes on transient results is then evaluated to ensure that the results remain bounded by respective transient analysis acceptance criteria. This examination, which is performed per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59, ensures that future reloads will not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

The removal of the remaining reference to cycle-specific core operating limits and Technical Specification Figures 3.12-1A and 1B has no influence or impact, nor does it contribute in any way to the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. No safety-related equipment, safety function, or plant operating characteristic will be altered as a result of the proposed changes. This cycle-specific variable (control bank insertion limits) is calculated using NRC approved methods, and the results are submitted to the NRC for information in accordance with Technical Specification 6.2. The Technical Specifications will continue to require operation within the required core operating limits, and appropriate actions will be taken when or if any of these limits are exceeded. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not in any way create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The margin of safety is not affected by this administrative change which removes the remaining reference to cycle-specific core operating limits and Technical Specification Figures 3.12-1A and 1B from the Technical Specifications. The margin of safety presently provided by current Technical Specifications remains unchanged. Appropriate measures exist to control the values of these cycle-specific limits. The proposed amendment continues to require operation within the core limits which were developed from the NRC-approved reload design methodologies. Further, the actions to be taken when or if limits are violated remain unchanged. Development of limits for future reloads will continue to conform to those methods described in NRC-approved documentation. In addition, each reload requires a 10 CFR 50.59 safety review to assure that operation of the unit within the cycle-specific limits will not involve a reduction in any margin of safety. Therefore, the proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not impact the operation of Surry in a manner that involves a reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no impact on, nor were they considered in, existing UFSAR accident analyses. Safety significant procedure changes, i.e., changes that require a safety evaluation to be prepared, will continue to be reviewed by SNSOC, as will new procedures. Procedure changes still require cognizant management approval and preparation of an activity screening to determine whether or not the change impacts nuclear safety. This ensures activities important to nuclear safety are being appropriately reviewed. The effectiveness of the safety evaluation program, and the thoroughness of SNSOC meetings and reports will be assured through the MSRC's plant overview function which is based on observed performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee has been informed of the public comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, it is so indicated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By November 14, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Assembly continued its plenary session  this morning. The parliamentarians examined the document  submitted by the parliamentary opposition group accusing the  president of the Republic of violating the Constitution. For  the parliamentarians of the parliamentary majority, the action  introduced by the parliamentary opposition falls outside the  realm of constitutionality. Here is an excerpt of the statement  issued this morning by the National Assembly.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] In accordance with  Article 6 of the Constitution, only the people have the right to  embark on civil disobedience against an oppressive regime or one  that comes into being through a coup d'etat. No one can  represent the interest of a section of the people while claiming  to be legitimately acting on behalf of the entire people.    At any rate, the functions of the present institutions are  in  tune with the provisions of the Constitution as voted by the  Niger people. The president of the Republic, elected through  direct universal suffrage, duly selected a cabinet based on the  actual majority in the National Assembly. Such institutions  cannot be reasonably suspected of wanting to go against a  constitution which forms the very foundation of their own  stability.    From the foregoing, it behooves the executive branch of  government, which is responsible for maintaining law and order,  peace, and public safety, to guarantee the normal functioning of  republican institutions. In this regard, any parliamentarian  who, departing from the exigencies of his mission, indulges in  acts that jeopardize government operations, must, like any other  citizen, bear the full consequences of his commissions and  omissions with regard to the laws as well as rules and  regulations in force.

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Outokumpu edges into black on 8% sales gain OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, made a profit of FM3m (Dollars 700,000) for the first four months of the year compared with a FM77m loss in the same period of 1991. Net sales improved by 8 per cent to FM4.42bn against FM4.1bn in the year-earlier period. The company said the improvement reflected the devaluation of the markka last autumn and a 'faint upturn in demand', but it added that the results 'remained unsatisfactory'. Dr Jyrki Juusela, chief executive and chairman, said that he believed 'world economic growth and investment activities' should 'strengthen slightly', although there were many uncertainties about forecasting performance for the rest of 1992. Dr Juusela said the expected upturn would be 'quite slow'. For the year, Outokumpu aimed to show 'a strong improvement' on the FM543m loss it made for the whole of 1991, he added.</p>

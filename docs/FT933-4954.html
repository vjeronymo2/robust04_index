			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Multiplication the Transylvanian way: Virginia Marsh finds a popular Romanian scheme to make money have sunk cash into a pyramid money-multiplying scheme at the Transylvanian town of Cluj. The scheme is known as Caritas, although it has no connection with the international charity of the same name. It takes deposits, with a promise to pay back eight times the amount in three months. Tales of 'Caritas millionaires' have spread around Romania, encouraging thousands of people to descend on Cluj, in Romania's western province, in the hope of cashing in and hedging against feverish inflation. The scheme has produced some lei millionaires - in effect, worth over a thousand dollars. While most Romanians grapple with soaring prices, declining living standards and meagre pay, investors deposit a minimum of Lei20,000 (Pounds 15.70), nearly a third of the average monthly wage. Three months later, Caritas, which has in the meantime collected from new depositors, pays out eight times the original investment, less a commission. Many people are leaving their money in the scheme in the hope of bigger gains to come. No section of Romanian society appears immune to the lure. Head-scarved peasant women from the countryside, many clutching bags full of money, wait their turn in the four-day queue outside the sports hall where Caritas is based, alongside groups of laughing gypsies. Two young men from Bucharest furtively count out large bundles of notes. Others, unable to find room in hotels, sleep in their cars. All hope it is not too late to benefit from Caritas, even though most say they know it will eventually collapse like other such schemes, many of which have sprung up in post-communist Romania and which have various precedents in other parts of southern Europe. 'Caritas is our only hope of surving the winter,' says a woman who had travelled 300 kilometres with her elderly father to deposit their monthly salary and pension in the scheme. 'We can't keep up with the price rises. Inflation is 260 per cent a year, but we only get 50 per cent interest in the savings bank.' The riches Caritas has brought to many in Transylvania have made its founder, Mr Ioan Stoica, a former bookkeeper, a national hero. He lives modestly and no-one is able to put a figure on any profits from the scheme. Others hit by the country's declining economy see Mr Stoica as a Robin Hood figure. One man says: 'Caritas is an association to give money to the people and to save them from poverty. I don't know where Stoica gets the money but he's the only one doing something to help us.' Caritas has also lifted the popularity of Mr Gheorghe Funar, Cluj's radically anti-Hungarian mayor and the leader of the Romanian parliament's largest nationalist party. No formal links between Caritas and the mayor have been proved but Mr Funar has become its unoffical ambassador. Diplomats say the scheme looks like a classic money-laundering scam but the Romanian central government, which since July has been able to levy on Caritas a new 18 per cent value-added tax, has done little to discourage it. However, a senior local police officer warned: 'There were near riots in other towns when similar (schemes) with only a few thousand participants went bankrupt. I just don't want to think about what will happen here when we have a whole county and hundreds of thousands of people involved.'</p>

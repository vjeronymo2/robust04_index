Meanwhile, the total number of persons suffering from  AIDS on a national basis has risen to 185 individuals in 12  provinces, since the first HIV case was discovered in West  Kalimantan Province.    Dr. Tuti Parwati Merati, chairperson of the AIDS Working and  Research Group at the Faculty of Medicine of Udayana University  in Den Pasar, is treating a person in Den Pasar who has recently  been discovered to be infected with the HIV virus. The person  concerned came directly to her clinic and asked for a blood  test. Later, after "Elisa" and "Western Blot" tests were  performed, it was learned that the person concerned was infected  with the HIV virus. The person concerned, who is in the tourism  business and is 26 years old, had himself tested because he  became aware that his behavior involved the risk of infection.    Doctor Tuti said on 2 December: "The person concerned took  the initiative to have himself examined after obtaining  information through the mass media. Later on, he came to my  clinic to ask for a blood test. It turned out that he was  HIV-positive."  <H5>  Positive </H5>   Regarding the participation of a number of groups, including  ulama [Muslim religious teachers], businessmen, and officials  from a number of government services, in programs concerned with  handling AIDS, such as the seminar held in Jakarta on the  commemoration of World AIDS Day on 1 December, Doctor Tuti  thought that this was a positive sign. This is because this  disease is not just the responsibility of the Department of  Health. Neither is it possible for the matter to be resolved  through the media alone, because there is a close connection  with sexual behavior.    According to Dr. Tuti Parwati, who is also chairperson of  the  Indonesian Business Image Foundation [YCUI] and is active in the  field of handling AIDS, the involvement of businessmen in this  area is very much needed. For example, in helping to provide  funds to support community information activity. The same thing  is true with businessmen in the tourism field in particular.  They can provide warnings of the danger of AIDS to their hotel  guests.    A similar view was expressed by Dr. A.A. Gde Muninjaya, MPH  [master's degree in public health], chairman of the  Epidemiological Research and Training Unit of Udayana  University. He said, for example, that the involvement of the  Department of Manpower in handling AIDS is intended, among other  things, to provide security and protection to workers known to  be infected with the AIDS virus. Those who suffer from AIDS can  be protected from being dismissed from their jobs or from being  quarantined. Doctor Muninjaya said: "As long as those suffering  from AIDS are not quarantined, as happens in Western countries,  we must take action quickly to protect them."    Regarding activities to celebrate World AIDS Day in 1993,  Dr.  Tuti Parwati said that, in cooperation with a number of senior  high schools and the Student Senate of the Faculty of Medicine  at Udayana University, the YCUI sponsored the "World AIDS Day  Walkathon" at the end of November 1993. After that a discussion  was held with students at senior high schools concerning the  danger of AIDS and related problems facing us.    According to Doctor Tuti, the AIDS problem cannot be handled  by only one or two events each year. Rather, it must be handled  on a continuing basis. The information efforts undertaken by the  YCUI up to the present have included the formation of discussion  groups, at which persons suffering from AIDS talk about their  feelings and the problems which they face. One of them, who has  previously been provided with a variety of information, acts as  the chairman of the meeting.    Doctor Tuti said that the attitude of persons suffering from  AIDS who have received this training has been very positive.</p>

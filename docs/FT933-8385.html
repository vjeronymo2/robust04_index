			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / UK minister wants world social charter on employment rights MR DAVID HUNT, the employment secretary, has called for a world social charter of minimum employment rights to supersede the European Community's own social chapter. Mr Hunt, who proposed the idea privately to Mr Padraig Flynn, the EC social affairs commissioner, said it was 'ludicrous' for EC countries to introduce extra non-wage labour costs through the EC social chapter when they had to compete in world markets. But he also believed there is a case for some basic level of employment protection which all countries, including developing countries, would have to observe. 'Instead of imposing costs on ourselves we would be better served pursuing the idea of a world social charter,' he said. 'I would like to see such a charter concentrating particularly on basic health and safety standards.' Although improved world labour regulation is under scrutiny in several countries which fear the competitive threat from low-wage south-east Asian countries, the idea of a world social charter is unlikely to find favour with all Mr Hunt's cabinet colleagues. The idea, which is sometimes proposed in the form of a social clause in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has been discussed in France and even the US, but is usually pushed hardest by international trade union bodies. On the wider issue of Europe, Mr Hunt said few of the divisions in the Conservative party over Maastricht were a result of hard policy differences. There is now, he said, 'a great deal to unite around on Europe'. He will have pleased his more orthodox colleagues by stressing his support for the government's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty and by pledging to resist any imposition of EC employment directives through the back door. He also wants a competitiveness test to be applied to all new EC measures and says other EC countries are now far more willing to accept such British initiatives. Mr Hunt also hinted that he would not be seeking another round of employment laws to follow the latest tranche of legislation. 'In the meetings I have had with unions and employers' organisations, the message that comes across is that there should be time for reflection and consolidation,' he said.</p>

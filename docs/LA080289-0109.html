			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. FOCUSING HOSTAGE EFFORTS ON IRAN, SYRIA  </P> <P> The Bush Administration worked delicately Tuesday to encourage third-party  negotiations seeking the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon, while trying to  reduce pressure at home for a quick response to the apparent murder of Marine  Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.  </P> <P> The Administration's "preferred outcome," as one senior counterterrorism  official put it, is an exchange of Lebanese prisoners held by Israel, including  a militant Shiite Muslim clergyman seized last week, for Israeli and American  captives held by Lebanese radicals.  </P> <P> For the time being, however, U.S. efforts are concentrated on Iran and Syria,  with diplomats trying to open channels of communications with Tehran and  pushing Damascus to intervene with radical Islamic groups in regions of Lebanon  it controls.  </P> <P> "Iran and Syria are the two countries there that would have the most impact on  the situation, so it is natural that our diplomatic efforts are centered  largely on those two countries," a State Department official said.  </P> <P> "There's obviously some kind of disagreement in Iran about what has happened,"  the official added, noting that Iran's foreign minister had condemned the  Higgins killing while the interior minister appeared to condone it.  </P> <P> Although the United States has no formal diplomatic relations with Iran,  American diplomats have passed messages to that nation's new government through  numerous channels, including the government of Syria as well as the embassies  of Japan, West Germany, Austria and Switzerland.  </P> <P> Also, the Administration is hopeful that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze may have been able to elicit Iranian help during meetings in  Tehran on Tuesday. Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Shevardnadze  in Paris on Monday, after the Shiite group had threatened to hang Higgins but  before a videotape of the purported act was released, and discussed the hostage  issue with him, officials said.  </P> <P> In the past, however, repeated efforts to enlist Iranian and Syrian help in  freeing hostages have proven futile. And so far "we have not had a single  positive signal," a State Department official said.  </P> <P> U.S. officials repeatedly insist that the one group they have not sought to  talk with directly is the captors themselves.  </P> <P> "Our policy has been very clear that we do not negotiate for the release of  hostages," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. But what U.S. officials  are unable to do directly might be accomplished indirectly.  </P> <P> "Israel is a sovereign nation," Fitzwater noted. "They have a different policy  with regard to hostages than we have." In the past, Israel has been able to  engineer hostage exchanges that have freed U.S. captives while avoiding direct  U.S. negotiations with hostage takers.  </P> <P> On Monday, Israeli officials proposed swapping U.S. and Israeli hostages for  Shiite detainees in Israeli prisons and Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a Lebanese  Shiite clergyman and radical leader seized by Israeli troops in Lebanon last  week. Prospects for such a swap dimmed when it was rejected by Lebanon's  fundamentalist Hezbollah organization.  </P> <P> If that deal could be brought about, it could lead to freedom for some or all  of the remaining U.S. hostages in Lebanon. If it does not succeed, however,  "the options are not good in a situation like this," a senior U.S. official  said.  </P> <P> With U.S. hopes riding on Israeli success in negotiating some sort of swap,  both the White House and the State Department moved quickly to repair any rift  between the two nations stemming from Obeid's kidnaping.  </P> <P> Over the last several days, several members of Congress, including Senate  Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), had expressed irritation with Israel, saying  that seizing Obeid had endangered American lives.  </P> <P> Asked about those criticisms, Fitzwater repeatedly emphasized the close nature  of U.S.-Israeli ties. Israel, he said, is "a strong ally," and the two nations  have a "vibrant relationship."  </P> <P> Other members of Congress, including Orange County Reps. William E. Dannemeyer  (R-Fullerton) and Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), called on the President to  stage a military strike against the terrorists -- if they can be located.  </P> <P> "The key is whether we can establish who is responsible and where they are,"  Dannemeyer said. He said another alternative would be to rally European leaders  behind the United States to collectively deny commercial airline landings at  countries where terrorists are believed operating.  </P> <P> Dornan said Bush should warn the terrorists that "the next hostage they kill,  we will act as if they've killed all eight. We cannot let them kill them one at  a time."  </P> <P> Bush spent a good part of the day meeting with key advisers to assess the  situation, conducting one 90-minute session with Baker, Vice President Dan  Quayle, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, Defense Secretary  Dick Cheney, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Deputy National  Security Adviser Robert M. Gates, CIA Director William H. Webster, Atty. Gen.  Dick Thornburgh, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and Adm. William J.  Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  </P> <P> Later in the day, Bush telephoned Pope John Paul II to ask for help in getting  Higgins' body returned, although White House aides cautioned that the  government is still not entirely sure Higgins is dead.  </P> <P> Such doubts underscored the tremendous uncertainty facing Administration  policy-makers. The Administration cannot say for sure when Higgins was killed  -- assuming that he is dead -- who killed him, where he had been held or where  the remaining hostages are being held.  </P> <P> U.S. forensic experts, who have obtained a copy of the videotape that purports  to show Higgins' hanging, are examining the tape in an attempt to find clues  that would indicate whether the victim was already dead when it was made and  whether it is Higgins, officials said.  </P> <P> As conflicting reports poured into Washington, White House aides sought to  coordinate information from the Situation Room in the White House basement. At  the State Department, officials reactivated a special hostage task force,  placing its members in a room down the corridor from the seventh-floor office  of the secretary of state. The atmosphere, a task force official said, was  "bedlam."  </P> <P> Despite Bush's extensive involvement in monitoring the Lebanese crisis, aides  took pains to insist that he was not preoccupied with it. The situation at the  White House was "not business as usual," said spokesman Fitzwater. But, he  added, "we're still conducting the day's business here."  </P> <P> "Nobody wants to fall into the Carter trap," said a senior White House  official, referring to then-President Jimmy Carter's high-profile preoccupation  with U.S. hostages in Iran during 1980. "You paralyze your own government and  the hostage takers get some of what they want, which is the preoccupation of  the world's pre-eminent power. . . . It's important to deprive them of that."  </P> <P> Bush pointedly stuck to his plans to host a White House barbecue for members of  Congress on Tuesday evening.  </P></p>

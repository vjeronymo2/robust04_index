			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PIRATES' PRIDE HIGH IN FACE OF DIVISION CHANGE  </P> <P> It was hustle and bustle time at Paramount High School last Friday, the final  weekday before classes began. Construction workers, their saws whining,  scurried to finish a $9-million science and administration complex.  </P> <P> Electrical wires hung from ceiling panels, and floor covering stood boxed  beside a barren stairway. Teachers, some wearing T-shirts proclaiming the  school's back-to-back Southern Section Division III football titles, carted  boxes of beakers and books.  </P> <P> Football Coach Ken Sutch endured the din, his bright blue eyes gleaming at all  the changes. Hours later in the season opener, Paramount rolled on, mauling  Bell Gardens, 27-6.  </P> <P> Like the new building, Paramount's football team is full of wrinkles but loaded  with promise. Only eight starters return from last year's 13-1 team, but  because Sutch allowed almost everyone to play last year, a host of experienced  players return.  </P> <P> Against Bell Gardens, Steve Lopez and Larry Hooper, both backups last season to  All-Southern Section Jack Manu, took turns at quarterback.  </P> <P> "It makes for better morale and for better practices," Sutch said. "I owe it to  the kid that comes out every day and runs sprints alongside the rest of the  players. If I have the opportunity to play him, I will."  </P> <P> It was easy for Sutch, 65-25 in his ninth season, to let everyone play last  year. In more than half its games, Paramount held halftime leads as large as 35  points. The only loss was to Lynwood, but that did not stop the Pirates from  winning their second San Gabriel Valley League title.  </P> <P> It might not be so easy this season. Only two Southern Section teams have won  three consecutive titles. And this year, in an attempt to balance the level of  play, the Southern Section bumped up fifth-ranked Paramount into Division II,  which includes perennial finalists Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley, Muir of  Pasadena and El Toro.  </P> <P> In addition, Paramount faces a tough battle with Dominguez and Lynwood just to  defend its two consecutive league titles.  </P> <P> Sutch, 42, who attended Millikan High in Long Beach, is known to be fair,  honest and a disciplinarian. Miss a practice, miss a game. A tardy player must  spin a wheel that hangs from a wall in the school's musty weight room. The  wheel is divided into sections, each assigning some type of physical activity  as discipline.  </P> <P> In Sutch's early years, more than one player crawled the football field, or ran  an extra mile. A few got lucky when the arrow found the "pardon" slot. The  wheel has made his job easier, Sutch said.  </P> <P> "Consistency is so hard, yet so important," Sutch said later over a roast beef  lunch at a Paramount coffee shop. "Discipline has to be fair to work."  </P> <P> Bell Gardens Coach Dave Newell said: "If you look at Paramount on film, it is  very simple. What (Sutch) has is discipline and tremendous athletic speed, and  he is able to get the best out of the talent he has."  </P> <P> If pulling starters at the half last year was a noble thing to do, it wasn't  always the right thing statistically, Sutch admits. Running back Leon Neal, a  returning starter who was an All-Southern Section selection as a junior,  carried the football only 100 times in 10 regular season games.  </P> <P> "Could you imagine what his statistics would have been if we had left him in  (each) game?" Sutch asked.  </P> <P> Neal, who gained 1,729 yards last year, ran for 59 yards in eight carries  against Bell Gardens. But he threw several key blocks for some of those other  players who were backups last year.  </P> <P> The Southern Section titles served as a rallying point for many in Paramount,  which was in physical and economic dilapidation in the late 1970s but rebounded  to win an All-American City award two years ago.  </P> <P> Explained Sutch: "The football team has brought a lot of pride to this city,  and (the city) has paid us back."  </P> <P> City officials bought championship rings for the players last year. Renovation  of the lights and bleachers at the football field, scheduled to begin shortly,  is being paid for completely by donations, Sutch said.  </P> <P> Sutch, Jim Monico and Rick DeCicco joined Paramount High as assistants in 1975  and worked with veteran Coach Tom Davies at a time when the team had won one  game in five years. Sutch, who had been a successful sophomore coach at Long  Beach Wilson, said: "We were three young pups with an older head coach, and we  thought we knew everything," Sutch said.  </P> <P> Player morale was in disarray, and teachers bet on how badly the varsity would  be defeated. But in 1979, Paramount won the Suburban League title.  </P> <P> Sutch left to become coach at Workman High in Industry in 1980 and Paramount,  which was moved into the tough San Gabriel Valley League, had 1-8 and 5-4  records. When Davies took an administrative post in 1982, Sutch became the  Pirate head coach, rejoining Monico, his longtime friend. DeCicco left after  the 1975 season but returned this year. Glen Kaskela and Mike Giers are also on  the staff.  </P> <P> "What the success with football has done for the school is incredible,"  Paramount Principal Maureen Sanders said. "It has been great for our  self-esteem."  </P> <P> Academics have also benefited, Sanders said. Paramount established an  early-morning tutoring program for athletes. Others are also picking up their  books more. "The students have really, really pulled together because they have  realized that they can make a difference (in their lives,)" Sanders said.  </P></p>

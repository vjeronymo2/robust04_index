			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 6 (BTA) -- At the meeting of the  foreign and defence ministers of the member states of the  Western European Union [WEU] in May, Bulgaria will probably be  invited to ratify its "enhanced status" of a WEU associate  member, Sir Dudley Smith, president of the WEU Assembly, told  Bulgarian Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov today. The WEU  delegation arrived on a visit here on Monday at the invitation  of the Bulgarian National Assembly. Right from the beginning of  its association, Bulgaria could get a place on the WEU's  Operational Planning Group and, later on, in the so-called  Western European Armaments Group.    Bulgaria's inclusion in the WEU Armaments Group will relieve  the dire straits in which the Bulgarian Army has been plunged by  the economic crisis, Sir Dudley believes. According to Mr.  Aleksandrov, Bulgaria's military-technological and technical  dependence on the former USSR makes the military and  military-technological need of the country's inclusion into the  WEU structures all the more pressing. In the near future,  contacts with the WEU must advance from their get-acquainted  stage to cooperation in substance, Mr. Aleksandrov stressed at  the meeting.    Membership in the WEU for Bulgaria is comparable to  membership in NATO, Sir Dudley told Bulgarian MP's yesterday.  What matters more than signing an association document,  however, is to take practical action for the country's actual  integration into the Euro- structures, he told Mr. Aleksandrov  today. Such action is all the more needed in view of the  current situation in Europe and, specifically, in the former  Yugoslavia, according to the president of the WEU Assembly. In  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] there is a  risk of a repeat of the Bosnian events, he noted yesterday at  the meeting with the Bulgarian parliamentarians. According to  the WEU, Bulgaria is a leading power in the eastern part of the  Balkans, Sir Dudley pointed out. The WEU countries are members  of an organization intended to guarantee peace and security, he  recalled.    Later in the day, the delegation visited Ruse (on the  Danube), where they met with the WEU German and Spanish teams  monitoring the observance of the Yugo-embargo on the Bulgarian  sector of the river. Sir Dudley told a news conference that he  was pleased with the close cooperation of the Ruse executive  authorities with the European officials and of the understanding  showed by the public. He confirmed that he is aware of the  difficulties which Bulgaria and Ruse in particular are  experiencing as a result of the observance of the sanctions and  could not promise but would try to help make arrangements for  compensations.    The only problem which he found was the bad communications  between the WEU teams in Calafat, Romania, and Ruse.</p>

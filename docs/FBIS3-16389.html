			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 15, BNS -- Russia promised to start  removal of nuclear fuel from the two reactors in Paldiski on  April 6, Environment Minister Andres Tarand announced at the  government press conference today.    "We hope the three-month operation really starts when  promised," Tarand said.    The government today set concrete tasks to several  ministries  to guarantee safety of the operation. The environment minister  told BNS the Cabinet is now "organizationally ready" for the  removal of fuel.    "It is most unlikely that an accident should occur in  Paldiski, but we must be prepared for any eventuality," Tarand  said. "For example, a fire may break out, which may involve  leakage of radioactive substances, and in this case people will  have to be evacuated. Estonia must guarantee the safety of the  population."    The environment minister said the government laid main  responsibility for safety on the Rescue Department, the  Environment Ministry, the Estonian Railways, and the Economics  Ministry.    "The dismantling of the two nuclear reactors in Paldiski  does  not directly concern Estonia, since we lack specialists for this  and, besides, Russia regards the reactors as a state secret,"  Tarand said. "We are, however, interested in everything that  concerns the removal of fuel."    Tarand claimed Estonia and Russia haven't yet agreed on what  is to become of Paldiski after the fuel has been removed.    "What remains is the shells of the reactors, purification  systems, and some solid and liquid nuclear waste," the  environment minister said. "Russia asks for five years to  eliminate them, which we think is too long. On the other hand,  we cannot make too stiff demands (on Russia), since Estonia  lacks a radioactive waste depository and the cost of building  one would be enormous. To resolve the issue, probably pressure  from third countries is needed."    Russia plans to use new, TK-18 type containers for the  removal of nuclear fuel from Paldiski. This is the first time  they will be used in such operations.    Tarand said he has heard rumors that the containers "were a  couple of weeks ago shipped off to Estonia from Vladivostok or  some other faraway place," but that they "were stuck halfway."    "The new containers are a better alternative if only because  they haven't previously been used for transporting nuclear fuel  and they are not radioactive," Tarand said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 27 (AFP) -- The European Investment  Bank, the financing arm of the European Community, increased its  investment loans in 1993 by 15 percent despite the economic  recession, the bank announced here on Thursday [27 January].    It increased lending to ECU19.6 billion (21.56 billion  dollars), up from ECU17 billion (18.9 billion dollars) in 1992.    The bank finances on average 30 percent of project costs.  Having a top-ranking borrowing status, it is able to raise  money more cheaply and pass on the advantages to borrowers.    In 1993 the EC bank lent ECU17.7 billion (19.6 billion  dollars) for projects within the EC, and ECU1.9 billion (2.11  billion dollars) outside -- mainly in East Europe and the  Mediterranean basin.    EIB president Brian Unwin said the bank was playing a key  role in the EC's economic recovery programme. "The bank is well  equipped to contribute further to the European integration  process in 1994," he said.    Prominent in the EIB's activities in 1993 were the  allocation  of ECU7.8 billion (8.66 billion dollars) for the development of  trans-European transport, telecommunications and energy networks.    The networks are a key element in an EC initiative to speed  up the integration of West Europe and to boost employment by  providing a more efficient infrastructure for businesses.    The bank said it had already signed network loan contracts  for ECU2.4 billion (2.66 billion dollars).    Nearly three quarters of the funds allocated within the  community in 1993 went to the EC's poorer regions. The biggest  amounts went to Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Britain and  Portugal (in descending order).    In 1993 the EIB more than doubled its investment loans to  East Europe -- to ECU882 million (979 million dollars), up from  ECU320 million in 1992. The largest recipient was Poland (just  over ECU300 million).    Similarly, loans to Mediterranean countries doubled from  ECU321 million to ECU680 million (755 million dollars), with  more than a third of the funds going to Algeria.    In 1993, for the first time, the EIB extended its investment  support operations to Asia and Latin America.    India got ECU55 million (61 million dollars) for an  electricity grid system in the south, and Costa Rica received  ECU44 million (49 billion dollars) for power projects.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TOXIC TIME BOMB  </P> <P> It has been seven years since the solvent-recycling business operated by Robert  and Thomas Chatham in Escondido was declared a hazardous waste site.  </P> <P> It has been four years since the voters of California approved $100 million in  bonds to start cleanup on 50 of the 323 such sites around the state, of which  Chatham Brothers is one of the 20 most serious.  </P> <P> It has been 2 1/2 years since state toxic cleanup crews started the preliminary  work to determine how much contamination there was, how far it had spread and  how best to clean it up. At that time, state officials estimated that the  preliminary work would take about three months.  </P> <P> Yet today that preliminary work is still going on, and the state's most  optimistic projections are that removal of the drums of waste and contaminated  soil won't start until late this year. And that is contingent on federal  approval to dump the waste at a landfill, which was restricted in November.  </P> <P> If that approval is not granted, when Chatham will be cleaned up is anyone's  guess, because there is not enough of the $100 million left for the more  expensive incineration of the wastes.  </P> <P> Some of this lengthy delay is a necessary part of cleaning up highly toxic  substances such as heavy metals and cancer-causing PCBs, which must be done  with great care to avoid harming nearby residents or cleanup crews.  </P> <P> But we think that Escondido residents, the Escondido City Council and the  county have good reason to criticize the delays and to question the efficiency  of state procedures.  </P> <P> By its own admissions, the state Department of Health Services has stumbled  several times and been tripped up by internal problems and changes in personnel  and strategy.  </P> <P> For instance, one of the reasons that the preliminary studies are still not  completed is because the decision to test the extent of ground-water  contamination was not made until late in the process. Meanwhile, every day that  the gooey wastes sit in the soil, the chances of ground-water contamination  increase.  </P> <P> The time has come to cut through the bureaucratic delays and find a way to  clean up the Chatham Brothers site. The Escondido City Council and the county  have some good ideas.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Carla DeDominicis' proposal that the city take on the cleanup task  might be too ambitious, but the council's decision to prod federal and state  officials to look at alternative ways to clean up the site might provide the  kind of leadership that the state has failed to show.  </P></p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / EIB staff struggle with expanded role THE European Investment Bank may need as many as 200 new staff in order to cope with its rapidly expanding loan portfolio in the EC, eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. Sir Brian Unwin, the new president, told its board of governors' annual meeting in Luxembourg that the EIB was now bigger than the World Bank in lending and borrowing. Staff were 'very thinly stretched' as a result of new lending beyond its traditional base inside the Community. The EIB, which enjoys a Triple A credit rating, lent a record Ecu17bn (Pounds 13.4bn) inside and outside the EC last year. It has taken a leading role in the EC's 'growth initiative' and also plans to finance projects for 30 Asian and Latin American countries amounting over three years to Ecu750m. The bank has also been asked to extend lending in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania for a total of Ecu200m over three years. Sir Brian yesterday avoided a direct appeal for more staff, but pointed out that about a third of staff resources were being devoted to less than 10 per cent of total lending.</p>

A spokesman for the Shanghai government said that nearly 400  returned students have signed up investment contracts or  tentative agreements with the Shanghai Xinxin Investment Ltd,  which oversees the park, located at Songjiang County near  Shanghai.    He said that returned students can enjoy preferential  treatment on a range of aspects -- from paying tax to import of  raw materials to use of land.    The charge on use of land is less than half that of other  development zones, he said.    Currently, more returned students from Western Europe, Japan  and the United States have expressed strong interest in  investment here, he said.</p>

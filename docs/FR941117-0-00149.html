			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) A call is terminated by the ground station when either a hang-up signal is transmitted by the airborne mobile station, or the signal from the airborne mobile station on the communications channel is lost for a period of 15 continuous seconds. The hang-up signal is the on-off keying (50% duty cycle) of an unmodulated carrier over a period of one second with pulse duration of 5 milliseconds. However, if all carriers authorized to operate air-ground systems using the channels listed in &sect;22.857 agree that an alternative hang-up signal and/or procedure would be more efficient or beneficial, such alternative hang-up signal and/or procedure may be used. The carriers must jointly give prior notification to the FCC if an alternative hang-up signal and/or procedure is used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.867  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Effective radiated power limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The effective radiated power (ERP) of ground and airborne stations operating on the channels listed in &sect;22.857 must not exceed the limits in this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The ERP of airborne mobile station transmitters must not exceed 30 Watts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The ERP of ground station transmitters must not exceed 100 Watts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The ERP of low power ground station transmitters operating pursuant to paragraph (a) of &sect;22.859 must not exceed 1 Watt. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.869  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Assignment of control channels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC selects and assigns exclusively one control channel to each commercial aviation air-ground licensee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.871  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Control channel transition period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rules in this section provide for a period of transition during which the experimental air-ground system operating on the channels listed in &sect;22.857 will be discontinued and replaced by a system operating in full compliance with the rules in this subpart.

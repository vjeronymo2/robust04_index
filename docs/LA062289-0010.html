			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Once again, Pat Nolan reveals his lack of concern for the welfare of the  various citizens in this state, in favor of his own constituents, by whom he  expects with statements like this, to be reelected.  </P> <P> He thinks we should believe that students in depressed areas like Watts need  only what those of poor families in Glendale need. He proposes to resolve this  "disparity" by increasing funds to all students but more so, relatively to  those within districts like his own. Yet he ignores the real reasons for the  disparity, such as population density, crime rates and stress, and lack of  employment opportunities in the inner-city depressed areas.  </P> <P> I say thank goodness for the "political muscle" that provides for those with  clearly greater needs. Nolan and Gov. Deukmejian should stop their  Democrat-bashing and start releasing funds from the state lottery and the new  cigarette tax, or they will soon both be out of public life.  </P> <P> WILLIAM A. HONIGMAN  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

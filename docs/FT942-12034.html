			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Industrial recovery gains pace The economic recovery is strengthening, say two reports out today. They report that manufacturers are increasing output and investment, and the outlook for new businesses is improving. A sharp increase in orders and production is reported by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, while the Confederation of British Industry says employment and investment among small manufacturers should rise strongly during the next few months. In a third survey, venture capital group 3i is positive about recovery prospects, though it says a majority of small companies believe interest rates will rise during the next year because of the need to combat inflation. According to the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which every month asks purchasing managers how they see industrial trends, manufacturing activity increased last month at its fastest rate since the survey began three years ago. Improved demand, helped by an increase in marketing activity, led to a large rise in orders. Delivery times across industry increased significantly because suppliers were busier. Stocks of purchases and finished goods fell sharply in April compared with March. That reflected the success by many manufacturers and suppliers in shifting products more quickly from their warehouses to customers. Manufacturing recruitment increased in April for the third successive month. The report from the CBI, conducted jointly with Pannell Kerr Forster, a consultancy, also points to brightening economic prospects. Mr John Parsons, chairman of the CBI's smaller firms council, said it provided more evidence that small businesses were 'leading the economic recovery'. Total orders for small manufacturing groups rose sharply last month and are expected to show a further rise during the summer. More small businesses than at any time since July 1988 say they will step up spending on plant and machinery over the next year. Monthly Trends.

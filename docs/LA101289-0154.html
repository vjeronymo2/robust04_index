The 6-pound, 1-ounce son of Ka Zoua Thao, 15, was found safe in a Sacramento  home. Police Chief John Kearns said a woman who had worked as a nurse's aide  and was familiar with hospital procedures was held for questioning. Her  identity was not immediately disclosed. Investigators said the abductor took  the infant after telling the baby's mother that it was feeding time.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: MOSCOW;  </P> <P> RED ARMY WILL MARCH  </P> <P> The Red Army on Wednesday will parade through Moscow's Red Square to mark the  45th anniversary of the Allies' victory in World War II.  </P> <P> There is speculation that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may be staging the  display as a gesture to the military, which has been restive over relentless  budget cuts and the realization that in the Soviet Union of the future, the  armed forces may have a diminished role.  </P> <P> The parade also comes against the backdrop of moves toward German  reunification. On the anniversary of victory, some Soviet militarists fear that  the postwar settlement -- guaranteeing a divided Germany that would never again  threaten its eastern neighbor -- is coming undone.  </P></p>

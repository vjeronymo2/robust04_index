			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the French Defense Ministry, the 400  French soldiers deployed at Kigali airport in Rwanda should be  able to continue the evacuation of foreigners this morning in  good security conditions. A first Transall plane left last  night with about 40 French nationals on board, as well as a  number of other foreign nationals. We have just learned that  about 10 members of the late President Habyarimana's family were  also on board.</p>

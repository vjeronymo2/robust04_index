			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S LED ZEPPELIN SONG REMAINS THE SAME  </P> <P> This letter is in response to a recent article about Robert Plant ("Down to  Earth -- Singer Robert Plant's Post-Zeppelin Career Isn't So Full of Hot Air,"  by Mike Boehm, Aug. 9, 1990, OC LIVE!).  </P> <P> First of all, there has never been a band in contemporary pop music as  misunderstood as Led Zeppelin. The comment that you made in the article --  about Led Zeppelin putting "sensation first and plain old sense a distant  second, maybe ninth or tenth" -- epitomizes the total lack of understanding  that much of the media has never overcome in regards to the band and their  music. On the contrary, Led Zeppelin is one of the few bands that had managed  to keep sensation out of their music while pushing ahead with their own  capabilities, both individually and collectively, within the framework of a  single working unit. As a unit, Led Zeppelin reached heights most only dream  of, but the important thing is that they did it without compromising any of  their musical integrity or vision. As a result, their music had a certain  unconventional edge that was unique to themselves. However, it did not cause  any of their songs to make less "sense" as you had indicated. The truth is  that, whether acoustic or electric, Zeppelin employed a wide range of sounds to  give their songs substance, depth and meaning (characteristics that many of  today's bands urgently need.)  </P> <P> As far as describing "the band's method" as you did, Led Zeppelin had no  method. To them, having a method was un-rock 'n' roll. For rock 'n' roll in its  purest sense is energetic, spontaneous and unpredictable. During the '70s, when  the band was in its prime, one of the members remarked about the release of  their forthcoming record, "People aren't going to get what they expect."  </P> <P> Guitarist Jimmy Page once described Led Zeppelin as "street music, rock 'n'  roll." I, for one, know it's dangerous for rock's own survival to elevate this  or any other kind of "street music" onto pedestals too high, but within the  realm of rock 'n' roll, there's room for the recognition of bands that have  made a contribution and a difference. Led Zeppelin is one of those bands and  they deserve the respect as such.  </P> <P> I would like to thank you for not outright associating the band with the term  "heavy metal," although I believe the subtle message was there. It is  imperative that Zeppelin be free from the chains of that misnomer. It is my  hope that the next time you (mention) the band Led Zeppelin in an article that  you would do so from a fresh perspective because the current one is old, worn  and detrimentally untrue.  </P> <P> KIMBERLY HUTH  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

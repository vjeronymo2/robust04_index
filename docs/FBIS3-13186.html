The evil ayatollahs in Tehran had  been eagerly awaiting any opportunity to take revenge on Iraq  and its historic leadership for their miserable defeat in the  second Iraq-Iran War. [passage omitted]    What tempted the Iranian rulers to blindly pursue their evil  delusions and mean intentions was the Iraqi Army's preoccupation  with the potential invasion by the allied forces. Thus, the  Iranian role was to stab the Iraqi fighters in the back in a  premeditated act that was motivated by hypocrisy and misguided  policies. It was an act carrying all the meanings of treachery,  hatred, meanness, and cowardice, displaying a complete lack of  morals or honorable values. [passage omitted]    In order to conceal their collusion with Washington, the  Tehran rulers resorted to their known methods of maneuvering and  cheating. They pursued a strange line showing a contradiction  between the policies and stands announced over the media --  which appeared neutral and opposed to the U.S. and Western  military buildup and military aggression on Iraq -- and the  actual practices and stands of those rulers -- which in  substance and results harmed Iraq, especially its policies and  stands, and cast aspersions about its historic leadership.    The timing of the Iranian role was important. The  ayatollahs' deceptive role was to express verbal opposition to  the U.S. military aggression against Iraq and at the same time  turn the Iranian media into an active supporter for the  propaganda and psychological warfare against Iraq and its people  by casting doubts by devious means about Iraq's policy and the  soundness and correctness of the stands of its historic  leadership. The general tone of the Iranian media during the  aggression was inciteful at times and subtle at others. [passage  omitted]    Following Iraq's final victory by tearing up the chapter of  treachery and treason in record time, which caused the enemies  to lose their senses and balance, and the introduction of  measures marked by a high degree of national responsibility,  wisdom, and ability, the march of steadfastness and challenge in  our country proceeded with vigor. More opportunities were given  to pool the Iraqi people's inventive and creative resources for  the counter-offensive of reconstructing what the aggressors had  destroyed, for rebuilding life in Iraq, and for moving to the  new phase of steadfastness and resistance against the blockade  and the conspiratorial plans.

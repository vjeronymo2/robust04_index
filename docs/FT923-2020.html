			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Cold comfort in Midlands for Tories IF MR Norman Lamont had bought his lunchtime sandwiches at Five Ways, Birmingham, yesterday he would have found the reception as grey as the drizzle. No arm round the shoulders and 'Nice one, Norm.' Rather a mix of anxiety, anger, bewilderment and indifference as worries about the future surfaced. 'I'm just sitting and waiting to see if my husband's still got a job,' said Mrs Yvonne Turk, a teacher. 'Interest rates are finishing the firm off. If interest rates go down, that's okay.' Concern among shoppers was not so much with the technical merits of the European exchange rate mechanism - which many confessed they knew little about - but with how the government handled the currency crisis and what it means for the economy. Miss Karen McAuley, who works for a finance house, argued that 'it's not done us any good going into the exchange rate mechanism - but I don't understand a lot of it' - but she was more concerned about the prospects of buying a house. 'A lot of people are wondering whether they've done the right thing by voting the Conservatives in,' she said. Mr Neil Halliday, an accountant, considered that the events this week were 'a disaster from start to finish'. He added: 'It was a waste of time and money to hold sterling's value. The decisions (to float the currency) should have been made far sooner. The government has certainly not covered itself in glory.' His view was widely shared. 'Total mismanagement. Absolute shambles,' complained Mr Roger Baker, a Conservative-voting computer-services executive. Mr Ken Cameron, a computer installation engineer, said: 'I'd felt for some time the pound would get devalued. It was inevitable. The government actions were very amateurish.' There seemed to be little inclination to pin the responsibility for sterling's plight on perfidious Europeans. 'This country needs to be in the front line of Europe,' said Mr Osei Nana, an acoustic consultant. But there were mistakes in the past, he said. 'We should have devalued the pound a long time ago. If we had done there wouldn't have been a crisis.' Mr Cameron said: 'I don't think the Germans can be blamed for it.' The UK government was 'stuck in a train of thought which is out of touch with reality'. Mr Cameron was quite clear that there was 'too much dogma'. But Mr Baker had a word of warning about Europe. 'We should have closer ties, but on the trading side,' he said. 'This getting closer politically: you've only got to see what's happening in east Europe. Everybody wants to go their own way.' Miss Lee Shue, a civil servant, thought 'we should be with Europe, but it doesn't make any difference'. She added: 'The Tories don't know what they're doing anyway.' Such implied lack of power over the great affairs of state led Five Ways shoppers generally to shrug their shoulders at the thought of government resignations. And it led to expressions of indifference on the part of two messengers, gossiping in the rain. 'It don't bother me,' said one of sterling's plight. His companion let loose: 'Once they get in power they just change everything. It doesn't matter what you do. They're all liars.'</p>

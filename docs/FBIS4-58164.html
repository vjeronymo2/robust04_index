He said:  Iran is recognized as a cradle of one of the most ancient human  civilizations. My visit to Iran and talks with Your Excellency  can be considered a turning point in the history of cooperation  between the two countries and a source of strengthening the  friendship, peace, stability, and security in the region.    The Vietnamese president added: The grand victory of the  Islamic Revolution in Iran generated deep changes and upheavals.

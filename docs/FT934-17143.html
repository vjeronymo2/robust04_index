			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Woman in the News: Luck may not be a lady - Kim Campbell The band of party workers crowded into a meeting room in a nondescript Vancouver shopping centre is brimming with confidence about its local candidate's chances in Canada's forthcoming general election. The candidate is Ms Kim Campbell, the prime minister. Judging by the latest opinion polls, she will have no trouble sweeping to victory in her Vancouver Centre constituency on October 25. One by one, the organisers enthusiastically spell out their plans to solidify the prime minister's lead in a diverse inner-city constituency, whose residents range from a vociferous gay and lesbian community, to wealthy immigrants from Hong Kong and students at the University of British Columbia. Events on the agenda include a vintage car rally featuring the prime minister's 15-year-old red Honda Civic. But the mood around the table darkens when Mr David Camp, Ms Campbell's campaign manager, invites views on how the prime minister and her governing Progressive Conservative party are faring in the country at large. One young woman complains that Ms Campbell comes across as boring and intellectual in the party's television advertisements. Another chips in that the media has been far kinder to Mr Jean Chretien, leader of the opposition Liberals, who has escaped much of the close probing on policy issues to which Ms Campbell has been subjected. A third gripes that party managers have left Ms Campbell carrying too much of the campaign burden, rather than her cabinet colleagues. The Vancouver workers are unanimous that the image of their leader being projected is not the witty and down-to-earth Kim they know and who they believe is being undersold as a political leader. With three weeks to voting day, Ms Campbell needs to engineer either a big improvement in her party's image or await a mistake by her opponents if the Conservatives are to win a third successive term in office. Opinion polls show that she has a personal lead of about 10 percentage points over Mr Chretien. But her party has fallen several percentage points behind the Liberals in the country as a whole, and is trailing far behind the separatist Bloc Quebecois in Quebec, where the Conservatives currently hold 54 out of the province's 75 seats in the House of Commons in Ottawa. In Ms Campbell's native British Columbia, the Tories are even behind the right-wing Reform party, which currently holds one seat in parliament. The Conservatives chose 46-year-old Ms Campbell as their leader last June when her unpopular predecessor, Mr Brian Mulroney, stepped down after nine years in office. They hoped a bilingual westerner and Canada's first woman prime minister would make voters forget the tough times: an unemployment rate of 11 per cent, towering budget deficits and, as a result, the threat of cuts to social-security and healthcare programmes. Mr Mulroney's name is seldom heard these days. But Ms Campbell has been unable to shake off his legacy entirely. The strength of the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform party, which attract many defecting Conservative voters, largely reflects Canadians' wish for a change. Mr Mulroney gave his successor little time to prepare for an election campaign. Ms Campbell, who qualified as a lawyer in her mid-30s, is a relative newcomer to Ottawa. She cut her teeth in local politics in British Columbia, and was first elected to the House of Commons in 1988. Mr Chretien, by contrast, is one of Canada's most seasoned politicians. He celebrated his 30th anniversary as an MP this year, and held almost every leading cabinet portfolio when the Liberals were last in office under Mr Pierre Trudeau until 1984. Ms Campbell's strengths are her nimble and intelligent mind, which gives her an impressive grasp of complex economic issues, and an impish  - sometimes cutting - sense of humour. She often refers self-deprecatingly to the weight problem encountered by women in their mid-40s. But her assets have been over-shadowed by her political inexperience. She made herself an easy target by remarking that a 47-day election campaign was too short to debate the complex issue of social-security reform. Her answers often seem more suited to a courtroom or a university lecture hall than to the campaign stump. She had journalists rushing for their dictionaries by using the word 'terpischorean' (pertaining to dancing) at a press conference. Ms Campbell has made fiscal discipline the main plank of her campaign platform, with a pledge to eliminate the CDollars 35.5bn (Pounds 17.4bn) federal budget deficit within five years by, among other measures, cutting defence spending, grants to business and foreign aid. But she has failed to convince voters of the connection between lower deficits and job creation; opinion polls show unemployment remains a leading concern of voters. Her emphasis on deficit reduction has given opponents an opening to question her commitment to social services. With their backs to the wall, Ms Campbell and her advisers are now rethinking their strategy. Instead of making polite visits to schools and rotary club lunches, the prime minister is expected to sharpen her rhetoric as she takes her campaign across the country over the next three weeks. The Conservatives are still hoping for a turnround. The youthful, quick-thinking Ms Campbell could perform strongly in the party leaders' televised debates tomorrow and Monday. Conservative strategists also hope that support for the the Bloc Quebecois and Reform parties will subside as election day approaches. Their best chance would be a well-timed word from Mr Robert Bourassa, the francophone province's hugely popular premier, that Quebeckers should beware of the false hopes being preached by the separatists. The novice prime minster needs all the luck and skill she can muster over the next three weeks if she is to gain the support in the country at large which her enthusiastic volunteers back home in Vancouver Centre think she deserves.</p>

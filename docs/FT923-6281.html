			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries tumble in wake of dollar's decline FOR the second consecutive trading day US Treasury securities fell across the board in the wake of a sharply declining dollar. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  7/8 at 97 27/32 , yielding 7.425 per cent. The two-year note was also notably weaker, down  9/32 at 100 1/16 , yielding 4.215 per cent. Selling was particularly heavy in the intermediate sector, with the 10-year bond down a full point at 97 27/32 to yield 6.666 per cent. Despite central bank intervention to support it, the dollar has fallen to new all-time lows against the D-Mark in the past two days. That decline has upset bond markets, because a lower dollar reduces the chances of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, it raises the possibility of higher inflation from more costly imports and it also makes US assets less attractive to foreign investors. Political uncertainty also continues to worry bond markets. After last week's Republican convention President Bush has made up lost ground in the polls but the unpredictable outlook has made Treasury investors cautious about buying government securities. THE EUROPEAN government bond markets were dominated by currency concerns yesterday as the dollar's fall served to heighten tensions in the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system. Concerted central bank intervention failed to provide much support for the US currency, leading to a strengthening of the D-Mark and a weakening of sterling and lira. As a result, the UK and Italian bond markets suffered sharp falls while German government bonds rose as investors were drawn into strong D-Mark assets. UK government bonds fell as much as a point on fears that sterling's weakness could force a base rate rise and worries about a large gilts auction on Wednesday. Sterling's close, near the bottom of its EMS band, and rises in money market rates, depressed prices across the yield curve. The 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 1997 dropped  5/8 to 96 23/32 to yield 9.64 per cent while the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 fell  23/32 to 98 1/4 , with a yield of 9.12 per cent. In active futures trading, the Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 96.2l7 to 96.05. Dealers said prices were also adjusted for Wednesday's Pounds 2.5bn new gilt issue and would have fallen in spite of sterling's troubles. Some traders said price falls meant the auction would be more attractive, although others said overall market gloom would drag prices further downward. Among the other European markets, weakness in the lira contributed to the half-point fall in the Italian government bond market yesterday. The futures contract fell from its opening of 93.20 to a low of 92.68 before ending the day at about 92.80. German government bonds closed higher in quiet trading helped by weakness in the dollar and the Treasury market, and sharp falls in German equities. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 87.85 and closed just short of its high for the day at about 88.15. Some dealers said the strength of the D-Mark was attracting some buyers looking for price gains if there is an EMS realignment. August inflation figures for North Rhine Westphalia were as expected, showing prices up 3.4 per cent in the month to mid-August compared with 3.3 per cent in July. Other states are reporting figures for August over the next few days. Dealers reported some switching out of French government bonds into German government paper because of the strength of the D-Mark. The yield on the French 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 rose from 9.05 per cent at the opening to 9.11 per cent by late afternoon. The 10-year French-German yield spread moved from 109 basis points to more than 120 basis points. Dutch bonds ended little closed and sentiment was helped in late trading by news of a better-than-expected tap sale. The state finance agency said it raised Fl 2.5bn on the first day of sales for its 8.25 per cent bond due 2007. JAPANESE government bonds closed higher, in spite of a continued rally on the Tokyo stock market, on further hopes of interest rate cuts and a stronger yen. The benchmark No 129 bond opened with a 4.785 per cent yield and firmed throughout the day to close at 4.715 per cent, before easing to 4.73 per cent in line with a weaker US Treasury market. The No 145 bond continued to rally in anticipation of becoming the benchmark issue in September, closing at a yield of 4.885 per cent compared with Friday's close of 4.945 per cent. The Nikkei stock index rose for the fourth consecutive session, adding 411.08 points to close at 16,627.96. But bond dealers said the Nikkei's rally looked vulnerable.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Opposition candidate ahead in Panama Mr Ernesto Perez Balladares, the presidential candidate for the Panamanian party driven out of power during the 1989 US invasion, appeared to take the lead last night after the country's first fully free election in nearly three decades, Reuter reports from Panama City. According to unofficial figures - exit polls released by Panama's television station TVN - Mr Perez Balladares, the opposition candidate for the Democratic Revolutionary Party, had 39.5 per cent of the vote. The exit polls put Mr Ruben Blades, the Caribbean salsa music star, in second place with 23.6 per cent. Earlier thousands of Panama's 1.5m voters lined up, some for more than an hour, at 1,900 polling stations across the country, most of which did not open on time. Mr Perez Balladares had gone into the final stretch of the campaign with a 4-9 percentage point lead over Mr Blades. This marked a revival of the PRD, which was founded in the 1970s by General Omar Torrijos but which fell into disrepute under the rule of military strongman Manuel Noriega. Mr Blades, who appeared in Robert Redford's film The Milagro Beanfield War, wooed voters with lively music and the prospect of a clean break from Panama's traditional politics but his economic platform was less clearly defined. As violence has marred Panama's elections for much of its history, the government took pains to ensure a peaceful voting process, banning sales of alcohol nationwide from Saturday and mandating strict security at the polling stations. Some 8,000 police were posted near polling stations, while an international team of observers headed by former US President Jimmy Carter was monitoring the process. Voters were also choosing a new 71-member National Assembly and 67 mayoralties.</p>

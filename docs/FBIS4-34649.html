			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On 12 June, President Luis Alberto Lacalle said  the incorporation of Chile into Mercosur [Common Market of the  South] would give momentum to this drive for integration. He  added, however, that Chile would have to abide by Mercosur  rules. [passage omitted]    Lacalle said: "We consider Mercosur to be the most  significant undertaking in the River Plate area since our  countries' independence. It is a key factor for bringing about  change. Yet Mercosur has its own rules."    On 8 June, Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa handed  to  his Argentine counterpart Guido Di Tella an official proposal on  behalf of his country for joining Mercosur.    Argentina at present holds the presidency pro tempore of  Mercosur, and it is incumbent upon that country to officially  inform Paraguay, Brazil, and Uruguay of Chile's intention to  join Mercosur.    Uruguay has so far been reluctant to accept a new partner in  Mercosur before its current members consolidate this free trade  zone, which will become effective at the end of the year.    Mercosur is, moreover, in the throes of establishing a  common  external tariff, which will reportedly range between 0 and 20  percent.    Chile has set a tariff ceiling of 10 percent, which in  principle precludes it from joining Mercosur.    High-ranking sources close to the Foreign Ministry told EL  PAIS that Chile's possible incorporation into Mercosur will be  discussed by the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI)  within the framework of the Brazilian proposal to establish a  South American Free Trade Area.

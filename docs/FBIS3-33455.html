The UDI, which  recalled that the Cuban regime has denied freedom to its people,  demanded that Chilean authorities express their solidarity with  that suffering, and abstain from supporting a government that  violates human rights.    Deputy-elect Ivan Moreira said there are clear indications  that the future Chilean Government will attempt to reestablish  the relations. Among such indications he mentioned the visit to  Havana by Senator Carmen Frei and Deputy Eugenio Ortega, and the  meeting they held with Fidel Castro, which Moreira considered  extremely serious.    [Begin Moreira recording] We therefore believe that the  symptoms that we have described -- the visit to Cuba by Senator  Carmen Frei and Deputy Ortega, the invitation extended to a  high- ranking Cuban Government official [not further  identified], and also the visit that a Christian Democratic  Party delegation will reportedly pay to Cuba in March -- are  tremendously serious. All this means, to a considerable extent,  that the future government of Mr. Frei has the will or intends  to reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba. We categorically  oppose this. [end recording]    Moreira added that it is advantageous to maintain  consular-level relations, but reestablishing diplomatic  relations would be equivalent to attaching legitimate status to  the Cuban regime, at a time when this country has a chance to  return to democracy.    [Begin Moreira recording] This measure would give legitimate  status to this regime, and we are not willing to give legitimate  status to Fidel Castro. Unfortunately, Latin America and Chile  apparently do not remember things, forgetting the situation that  we suffered in the 1970's. [end recording]    UDI leaders finally said that their party will do everything  in its power and will use all legitimate influences to avoid  reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba.    As a political party, the UDI will work in the eyes of  people  through Congress, and will contact all public offices.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Bank cancels tender of Ecu Treasury notes THE Bank of England has cancelled its tender of three-year Ecu Treasury notes scheduled for October 20, citing the tensions in the Ecu market. It had become clear in recent weeks that demand for the notes would be negligible, according to traders. However, an Ecu1bn issue of T-bills is going ahead as planned on October 13. The Bank hopes to resume its T-note issuance programme if market conditions improve. The next issue is due in January. The T-bill auction next Tuesday will consist of Ecu300m each of one-month and three-month bills and Ecu400m of six-month bills. The T-bill auction is expected to meet satisfactory demand, partly because market conditions are rather better at shorter maturities. In addition, the issue represents a refinancing of maturing T-bills, rather than a fresh supply of paper, as in case of the notes. Meanwhile, trading in the Ecu bond market has virtually stalled. Bond prices dropped a further  3/8 point yesterday in lacklustre trading, and volume in the Ecu bond futures contract on the Matif in Paris reached only 1,700 contracts. The only area of activity is asset-swapping (the exchange of fixed-rate for floating-rate assets), which is providing some support for the market. Goldman Sachs has stripped a further Ecu100m tranche of Italy's Ecu2.5bn issue of 9 1/4 per cent bonds due 2011. A total of Ecu500m of the issue has now been stripped. The Italian deal has been one of the worst performers in a generally weak market, partly because asset-swaps cannot be executed at the long-end of the market. The bonds currently yield 10.78 per cent.</p>

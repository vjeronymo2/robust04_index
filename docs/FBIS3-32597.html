			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Mexican Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho </F> Solis at the Diego de Mazariegos Hotel in San Cristobal de las  Casas, Chiapas -- live relay]    [Text] Messrs. representatives of the media: I have  received a confidential message from the EZLN [Zapatist National  Liberation Army] command. They had certain doubts and worries  which I have proceeded to answer and clarify. Seeking to  maintain an atmosphere of seriousness and responsibility in  connection with the dialogue for peace and reconciliation, allow  me to state the following:    1. Today, with the authorization of the president of the  republic, I met with the region's military commanders to request  their support and establish the specific conditions of safety  required by the meeting in previously agreed upon terms. The  Mexican Army has notified me it is prepared to provide all the  guarantees required for the meeting's safety and success.    2. We all know that the problem we face is extremely  complex, that in-depth political decisions are at stake in the  dialogue. The truly important thing is not the spectacular  character of the event; it is the political meeting and its  substantial points. Its political essence is what matters and  that viewpoint should drive the process.    3. I am worried that I still cannot tell you the dates for  the dialogue for peace and reconciliation. I know the level of  public expectation which prevails because I have shared with you  the anguish of waiting. I understand the media you represent  and you have professional and personal schedules and plans. I  can assure you that the dialogue will not occur within the next  48 hours. If someone has to travel he can do it at will.    To conclude, as far as I am concerned, I will remain in  Chiapas State for the next few days as an expression of my  determination in favor of a dialogue and political solution to  this conflict. Thank you.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Hanwa loses heavily on investments HANWA, the Japanese steel-maker led by Mr Shigeru Kita, who is renowned for his love of zaitech - financial engineering - said it would post losses of Y25bn (Dollars 195.31m) on its stock and trust fund investments and long-term stock holdings for the current year to March. Hanwa said the losses were due to liquidation of tokkin - specified money trusts - and other trust funds. The company expects to reduce funds under investment management to Y300bn, half of the balance of last September. Hanwa has been famous among the Tokyo financial community for its active trading in the foreign exchange markets. However, a company official said the negative image of stock investments and market speculation had prompted it to liquidate its holdings. The low return on equity investments has also caused Hanwa to review its investment strategy. Hanwa said it would move to liquidate all its investment trusts for the time being. To cover the fund management losses, it expects to realise profits through sales of bonds and other investments. Earnings projections for the current year to March are unchanged, and the company expects a 33 per cent fall in unconsolidated pre-tax profits to Y25bn, on a 0.3 per cent decline in sales to Y750bn.</p>

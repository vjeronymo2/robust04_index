			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by He Linxiang (0149 2651 4382), deputy director, </F> Agricultural Bank of China: "Increase Credit Investment, Promote  the Healthy Development of Township Enterprise"]    [Text] Since 1979 when the Agricultural Bank of China was  reinstated, it and credit cooperatives have loaned a cumulative  total of more than 1.3 trillion yuan to rural enterprises.  Through the end of 1993, the annual increase rate of loans to  rural enterprises was 35.9 percent, up 63 times over the period  just after Agricultural Bank rehabilitation. The Agricultural  Bank and credit cooperatives have loaned to more than one  million of these enterprises. This includes a group of backbone  enterprises with total annual output value of several 100  million to several billion yuan which constitute the nuclear  force of rural enterprises.    In the development process, the contradiction of a shortage  of funds in rural enterprises is fully prominent, becoming an  issue to which everyone pays attention. The reasons for this  problem are:    One, excessive fixed asset investment, with the pace  of development surpassing the capacity funds can bear. Two,  disorderly financial order with rural funds seriously  split. Random fund accumulation and lending against regulat  ions not only blindly expanded the scale of investment,  increased the need for circulating funds, and slowed savings  deposit increases by banks and credit cooperatives, but also  affected rural enterprise loan supply progress.    Three, some rural enterprises have economic results  that are not ideal. This is reflected in bank credit. The issues  of overly tight credit, slow turnover, poor results and great  risk still are relatively prominent. Overdue and idle loans and  bad debts continue to increase and the principle and interest on  a considerable portion of loans cannot be repaid on time.  Rural enterprise idle loans and bad debts have reached a certain  proportion affecting loan turnover utilization.    According to the spirit of the 1993 annual national rural  enterprise work conference, important links to promote the  healthy development of rural enterprises are doing all to  relieve the current contradiction of funds in short supply and  improve fund utilization results. Toward this end, the  Agricultural Bank and credit cooperatives bear an extremely  heavy and arduous burden. We will adopt several main measures:    1. Hold steadfastly to both collecting funds, taking  stock of funds, and expanding the dynamics of credit input.  Utilize interest rate readjustment and financial order  rectification, mobilize rural workers to save actively and  expand fund sources. At the same time, strengthen accounting  services for rural enterprises that continuously expand new  accounts, do a good job of enterprise time deposits and public  deposits and one of peasant household fund accumulation  management, increase the useable amount of rural credit funds,  and strive to realize funds needed within plans on the scale of  rural enterprise loans.    Look within to resolve the funding difficulties of rural  enterprises, ferret out potential, accelerate turnover of the  more than 210 billion in credit and improve fund utilization  results. Definitely take stock of sedimentary credit funds,  recoup overdue and idle rural enterprise loans. Make credit  funds flow back smoothly, accelerate turnover with one yuan of  money playing the role of several yuan. An important way to  ameliorate rural enterprise funding difficulties is to use fund  increase superiority to spur on taking stock of savings to  create a good credit and enterprise fund input and output cycle.    2. Firmly uphold the principles of suiting measures to  local conditions and divided guidance. Further improve regional  credit policies. Actively support rural enterprises,  particularly accelerating the development of rural enterprises  in central and western China. Rural financial sectors must  adhere to state unifie d planning and the principles of suiting  measures to local conditions, a rational division of labor, each  developing its strengths, and all developing together under the  premise of respecting economic laws. Further improve and  implement regional credit policies. The economic backwardness of  the central and western areas compared to eastern China is  caused by a lack of talent, transportation and communication  difficulties, closed off information, and rather low degrees of  market development. In these areas, the Agricultural Bank and  credit cooperatives must fully develop the role of credit  levers, coalesce all efforts, create conditions and help improve  the development environment. For credit support in the central  and western areas, we must "stress priorities and regard the  rest equally," giving key support to national agricultural  product production bases, poor areas, and national minority  areas, fully developing the relatively ample and advantageous  conditions of agricultural, mineral, water, land and human  resources. Develop variegated forms of rural enterprises by  using local materials at hand, having work suit workers,  agriculture suit agriculture, and business suit business. While  supporting existing enterprises well, act according to  capabilities, develop strengths, and stress support of new  projects such as agricultural and sideline food product  processing, fund development and rural energy.    The "sprinkling pepper" method [spreading investment among  many small-scale projects] must be changed to suppport central  and western rural enterprise development. Moderately accumulate  funds, support enterprise on the road of concentrated,  collective operations and development by joining together  disparate areas. Stress support of and reliance on existing  towns and enterprises as well as using the advantageous  conditions of river coastal, coastal lines, and coastal borders.  Backbone enterprises of a certain scale developed according to  economic principles and various forms of enterprise groups spur  on development of surrounding areas. Strictly control lending to  blind establishment of small industrial development zones which  ignore conditions, seize farmland, compete and rush headlong  into action.    China's east coast has become the most vital area for rural  enterprise development. The Agricultural Bank and credit  cooperatives develop their ov erall capabilities under the  premise of implementing gross national credit readjustment and  control policies, providing prefer ential loans for enterprises  or projects which have low asset debts, good returns of scale,  are high science and technology and high export earners,  matching local and outside monies. Trial shareholding systems  and cooperative shareholding systems plus collectively operated  enterprises must gather experience and be boldly supported so  that they are perfected more with grand plans restarted. To  develop the east's leading role and promote regional economic  and technological unity, the State Council proposed an important  "east-west rural enterprise cooperation project" which the  Agricultural Bank and credit cooperatives must investigate and  study, actively participate in planning and select from these a  group of projects with great influence, good results and  comparatively strong radiating and attracting power. Unite these  with adoption of combined loans, bank group loans, specific  project loans, foreign exchange loans to promote regional  economic coordination and promote rational economic compositions  and development of overall strengths.    3. Firmly uphold the principles of differential  treatment and supporting the best, and support industrial  structure readjustment. Centered around improving economic  results, prominently support key enterprises and projects, and  implement the policy of supporting the strong and limiting the  weak. Give preferential support in terms of loan scales and  funds to industrial enterprises that accord with state  industrial policies and produce saleable items, foreign exchange  earning export enterprises and energy and raw materials projects  of priority national development. Projects have to be ranked and  arranged in categories. Support of projects with good market  prospects and high forecasted economic results must be continued  to ensure they are put into operation on time. There should  firmly be no new loans to enterprises which have no future or  make products that cannot be sold. Strictly control new projects  and do not lend to projects which cannot raise their own funds,  have poor results or reconstruct. Centralize funds to resolve  the need for rational circulating funds of existing enterprises.  At the same time, greatly support loans to enterprises with  authority to import and export, use well special laons for  "trade, industry and agriculture" export bases, spark plans and  earmarked "scientific and techological development" project  loans, and unite such loans with general loans for greater  results. At the same time, greatly collect foreign exchange  funds, enhance international accounting, and provide to export  enterprises comprehensive, top quality, inexpensive, highly  efficient financial services.</p>

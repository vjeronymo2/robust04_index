Immediately after Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa gave up the cabinet reshuffle, NHK conducted this  nationwide opinion poll of 1,800 men and women who are over 20  years old on 5-6 March by interviewing respondents individually.  NHK obtained valid answers from 1,169 people, or 64.9 percent  of the pollees. According to the results, 53 percent of  respondents answered that they supported the Hosokawa  administration, 31 percent did not support it, and 16 percent  said they have no opinion, or gave no answer. The Hosokawa  cabinet's support rate dropped by 16 percent from the 69 percent  marked in the December poll. However, its support rate still  exceeds that of the Kaifu Cabinet which was the highest among  past cabinets.    When asked about the reasons for their support, 29 percent  of  the pollees answered the prime minister's personality is  trustworthy, 28 percent said his political stance is good, and  14 percent indicated because he belongs to the party which they  support.    In answers to a question on reasons for not supporting the  Hosokawa cabinet, 34 percent of respondents answered they could  not expect good policies from the Hosokawa Cabinet, and 30  percent said he lacks the ability to implement his policies.    To the question of what issues they want the Hosokawa  cabinet  to deal with most, 44 percent indicated implementation of the  economic stimulus package and stabilization of commodity prices,  11 percent asked for promotion of political reform, and 10  percent called for improvement of social welfare.    In response to the question asking which party they  currently  support, 26.6 percent supported the Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP]; 10.2 percent, the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ]; 9.2 percent, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]; 3.6  percent, Komeito; 6.2 percent, the Japan New Party [JNP]; 2.3  percent, the Communist Party of Japan; 2.7 percent, the  Democratic Socialist Party; 2.9 percent, Sakigake [Harbinger  Party]; 0.3 percent, the United Social Democratic Party; and  33.2 percent answered they did not support any party.    Comparing the results of this poll to those of the December  opinion poll, while the support rate for the LDP as well as  Shinseito and the SDPJ increased by 4.5 points, the JNP's  support rate, which was second to the LDP's in the December  survey, dropped by 9.9 points.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Budget '92: Dragons still to slay - Tory hopes hinge on next week's Budget Next Tuesday is make or break day for Mr Norman Lamont. Rarely has so much been riding on a parliamentary occasion as on the chancellor's second Budget on March 10. Barring an unexpected and surely self-destructive last-minute attack of the dithers by Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Lamont's speech will effectively launch the campaign for the general election that is expected on April 9. The Budget itself will become part of the Conservative manifesto and so compete for electoral support with rival budgets from Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Besides salvaging the battered political fortunes of the chancellor and his party, it must also offer a credible prospect of lifting the UK out of the longest recession since the second world war. Given the bleak economic background, Mr Lamont has fared moderately well through a notably porous pre-Budget purdah. He and other Treasury ministers have joined in the party rough-and-tumble while coyly ducking questions relating to the Budget. Meanwhile, the pre-election campaign has allowed speculation to run riot about what the chancellor might or might not do on the big day, conveniently anaesthetising the reservations of financial markets. It would have been a brave soul who forecast a tax 'giveaway' of Pounds 2bn when the chancellor began his Budget planning just two months ago. Now talk of a fiscal boost of between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 4bn is commonplace, and even considered cautious by some. After speculation that the Budget deficit or Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) could soar from about Pounds 12bn this year to Pounds 30bn in 1992-93 - some 5 per cent of gross domestic product - it is likely that anything between Pounds 24bn and Pounds 26bn will leave the markets unfazed. But while the chancellor's financial room for manoeuvre has grown, he probably has less scope for action politically. The Labour party's charge that he is planning to 'borrow to bribe' voters appears to have struck a chord with the electorate and won back some of the ground lost by Labour to the Conservatives in January when Mr Lamont launched an attack on Labour's plans to tax higher income earners. It can have been no comfort to the chancellor and his advisers that a Thatcherite rump, centred on Mr Cecil Parkinson, the former Tory party chairman, and the monetarist economists Sir Alan Walters and Professor Patrick Minford, has also castigated the idea of borrowing more to finance tax cuts. So Mr Lamont will have a lot of dragons to slay when he delivers his speech. His cabinet colleagues will be expecting what one minister this week called a 'Budget for victory'. The chancellor's appeal to the voters must manage to draw the sting of Labour's own shadow budget, which is due for publication the following week, and quell the anxieties of Thatcherites and Tory monetarists. It must also satisfy financial markets, and offer them a convincing intellectual justification for next year's sharply increased PSBR and high borrowing in later years, if, as expected, the government's previous goal of balancing the Budget over the economic cycle no longer is sustainable. Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism and the convergence rules attached to the Maastricht Treaty on Economic and Monetary Union have greatly eased Mr Lamont's task in making his financial judgment for the Budget. The constraints imposed on interest rate reductions by the ERM and Germany's tight counter-inflationary monetary policy have been matched by a growing tolerance of fiscal activism in financial markets. As a result, PSBR projections that would have shocked the City when sterling was a free-floating currency have left the market for government gilt-edged securities largely unruffled and protected the pound from speculative assault through the pre-Budget period. However, the chancellor will be aware that markets are fickle. Although he may be able to drop or fudge the government's balanced budget commitment, the City will be anxious that he does not erode the government's revenue base in future years. Drawing the line between profligacy and prudence will still require careful judgment. In his assessment of the economy, he must decide whether his Budget can continue to be based on expectations of economic recovery - albeit delayed - or whether Britain is facing something more serious than a cyclical recession, such as a depression triggered by the accumulation of debt in the 1980s. He knows that the Budget will come too late to have any direct effect on the economy by election day. But his speech must offer a plausible path out of the recession. Although Mr Lamont was mistaken a year ago in believing that the economy would pick up from mid-1991, there is nothing to suggest he has revised his belief that the ingredients of recovery are in place. Indeed, lower bank base rates and a sharp 8.6 per cent jump in general government expenditure planned for 1992-93 mean that the government's policy stance has eased substantially since Mr Lamont's first Budget. Recovery now lies largely in the hands of the consumer, who, if in work, is benefiting from low inflation, modest real wage increases and falling mortgage rates. Of more immediate importance will be the Budget's political judgment. That will determine whether Mr Lamont will enjoy a niche in history and an honourable place in the Conservative pantheon or be blamed for defeat at the polls. With the Budget set to become part of the Conservative election manifesto, he must choose whether to emphasise the differences between Conservative and Labour economic policies or appeal to as broad a cross-section of voters as possible. The mood of the electorate is a problem. Neither the Tory campaign against Labour's tax plans nor the flood of news stories pointing to income tax cuts in the Budget appear to have caused any great enthusiasm for tax give-aways. A Mori poll in last week's Sunday Times found that 69 per cent of the electorate would prefer Mr Lamont to spend more on public services against only 26 per cent who wanted tax cuts. When asked which tax cuts people would prefer, an overwhelming 72 per cent favoured what would be a humiliating reversal of last year's increase in VAT to 17.5 per cent from 15 per cent. Nearly 60 per cent backed a big increase in tax-free allowances rather than a cut in the basic rate of income tax from 25 per cent. On the other hand, the Conservatives suffered no electoral damage from lowering the burden of income tax in their two previous pre-election Budgets in 1983 and 1987. The obvious conclusion is that electors are more altruistic when talking to opinion pollsters than when filling in their ballot papers. Taken together, the financial, economic and political background to the Budget points to a balanced package of tax cuts rather than a radical Budget that could offend as much as it might please. Although Mr Lamont is a more unpredictable politician than his downbeat public image might suggest, the record of his chancellorship and his own instincts and convictions will tell against any package that is overtly risky. These factors and fears of eroding the tax base would count against anything as radical as two pence off the basic income tax rate or permanent increases in depreciation allowances to boost investment. The motor industry has some claim on the chancellor's generosity because last year's Budget extended employers' national insurance contributions to company cars with effect from July this year, in a move that will boost government revenues by Pounds 550m in 1992-93. But one penny in the pound off the basic rate of income tax, some increase in income tax allowances by more than the statutory 4.5 per cent indexation, and temporary help for businesses, most probably through easing the burden of the uniform business rate, look the most likely give-aways, offset in part through higher excise duties on alcohol and tobacco. In this health-conscious age, the government can probably escape serious electoral damage from a Budget day assault on beer and tobacco. And Mr Lamont is sure to have other fiscal lollipops up his sleeve. One strongly tipped possibility is a national lottery. Another may be help for Britain's hard-pressed film industry, which, if nothing else, would give the chancellor some flattering photo-calls between Budget and election days.</p>

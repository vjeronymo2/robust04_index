			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Cadbury shop-steward change opposed UNIONS are to oppose a move by Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks group, to cut the number of shop stewards it recognises at two of its factories. Cadbury has given unions - including the TGWU general union and AEEU engineering and electrical union - 90 days notice of its decision to derecognise 29 of the 39 shop stewards at the Somerdale factory, near Bristol, and 26 of the 45 at its Bournville assortments factory in Birmingham. Both factories also intend to withdraw facilities for full-time conveners. Mr Brian Revell, TGWU national officer for the food industry, who had talks with Cadbury yesterday, said the company's traditional Quaker-inspired paternalism might be drawing to a close. 'The existing values of co-operation and mutuality are being threatened by a change in management's attitude towards trade unions,' he said. Cadbury said the decisions to cut the number of shop stewards had been taken locally by managers at two of the group's five confectionery plants. It added: 'To suggest this represents a sea-change in the way we relate with trade unions overstates the case.' The formal disputes procedure has been invoked and meetings have begun. It is understood the unions have no immediate plans for industrial action.</p>

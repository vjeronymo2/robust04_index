			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPHSON ON ETHICS OF YOUTH  </P> <P> It must be nice to sit in an office in Marina del Rey pontificating about  what's wrong with the world while engaging in sanctimonious hyperbole about the  decay of an entire generation of American youth.  </P> <P> Josephson does not even identify what his role as a harbinger of ethical  platitudes is.  </P> <P> Is he a parent, a teacher, a worker, a manager or a business leader? Or is he  just a brow-beater of the first order, ready in theory but lacking in  implementation?  </P> <P> Perhaps Josephson ought to spend more time in the front lines of life acting as  a role model for my misguided generation. Then maybe he would look twice at  himself before attacking people he doesn't even know or care to know.  </P> <P> ARTHUR FORD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

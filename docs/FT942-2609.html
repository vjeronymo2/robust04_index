			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rutland, contradictions over costings and the government grant factor Sir, You state in your leader 'Councils and the Concorde fallacy' (June 14) that independence for Rutland could mean up to an extra Pounds 125 on each Rutlander's council tax bill. As you will know, this council maintains that the effect of Rutland gaining unitary status will be broadly cost-neutral. May I explain the apparent contradictions between the two sets of costings. The Local Government Commission acknowledges in its draft proposals that its figures are based on the Ernst &amp; Young model which generally reflects current county council management structures. This model was developed to provide robust costings for comparison purposes over review areas as a whole rather than small parts of them. Our model, on the other hand, is specifically designed to be applicable to the likely management structure of an authority the size of Rutland, taking into account the reduction in overheads and bureaucracy which would result from the creation of such a unitary authority. Taking this model, independence for Rutland would be broadly cost-neutral to the local taxpayer. Both sets of figures can therefore be said to be correct, but both are in any case purely hypothetical. It would be a dangerous exercise to try to foretell council tax levels in 1996 since more than 70 per cent of council funding comes directly from central government. Indeed, the commission itself acknowledges that the impact on council tax would depend upon future decisions by central government about the distribution of grant. That is the biggest and most unpredictable variable, not the figures under discussion here.

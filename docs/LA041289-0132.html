			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SOUTH COAST WOODWINDS PLAY OUTDOORS  </P> <P> Having endured several days of record-breaking (and energy-sapping) heat,  visitors to South Coast Village in Santa Ana on Sunday enjoyed weather  virtually perfect for an alfresco noon concert.  </P> <P> Held on the shopping center's Village Green, the South Coast Symphony's free  chamber concerts are relaxed, informal affairs in which listeners may enjoy a  picnic lunch while sampling music. On this third of four programs in the  series, the South Coast Symphony Woodwind Quintet offered a program as pleasant  and soothing as the cooler but sunny weather itself. Distractions, all things  considered, were relatively few and the audience remarkably attentive, though  there were minor aerial disruptions.  </P> <P> The first half, in which the players offered three works written specifically  for wind quintet, proved stronger. Jacques Ibert's "Trois Pieces Breves"  sparkled with ebullient vitality. Anton Reicha's Quintet in E-flat showed each  player's expressive lyricism and the ensemble's rhythmic tautness. Malcolm  Arnold's "Three Shanties" received crisp, witty and accurate treatment.  </P> <P> The post-intermission portion consisted entirely of transcriptions. In both  Bach's "Little" Fugue in G minor and a Vivaldi concerto, a small number of  technical blemishes and a tendency to allow tempos to drag detracted from  otherwise-spirited playing.  </P> <P> Sweelinck's Variations on a Folk Song fared better; here flutist Cheryl  Strommen-Loofbourrow, oboist John Ralston, clarinetist Patty Hecker, bassoonist  Phoebe Ray and hornist Linda DeRoche-Duffin showed just how well their  instruments can blend.  </P> <P> To fill out the program, the players added, probably to their regret, the first  two movements of Beethoven's Sextet in E-flat, Opus 71, to their planned  agenda. Rhythmic insecurity and a passel of errors marred this reading.  </P> <P> They should have stopped after the preceding "Pink Panther" theme.  </P></p>

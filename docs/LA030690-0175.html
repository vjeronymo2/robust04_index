			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DICK CLARK MOVES 'BANDSTAND' TO DINERS  </P> <P> OK, so MTV and other video channels knocked "American Bandstand" off the air  last October.  </P> <P> Now Burbank-based Dick Clark Productions hopes its name, spirit and ability to  generate cash flow from the American public will rock on at a string of novelty  restaurants named for the television show that entertained generations of  teen-agers.  </P> <P> A pilot diner overlooking Biscayne Bay in Miami opened Monday as Dick Clark's  American Bandstand Grill, complete with a mock "Bandstand" set; a pop art  cellar club that recalls the 1960s and other decade theme areas; a sing-along  arena; and TV monitors churning out repeats of "Bandstand" segments from 1958  to 1989.  </P> <P> For dessert, patrons can use the grill's video studio. For a fee, they can  record their own music videos with intros from Clark, once known as "America's  oldest teen-ager" and the host of "American Bandstand" for more than 30 years.  </P> <P> "We realize there is untapped value in certain trademarks," said Francis C. La  Maina, president of Dick Clark Productions. "For the past year we have been  actively exploring ways to capitalize on those assets."  </P> <P> The Burbank company kicked in its famous name in a joint venture with Harmon  Entertainment, a Secaucus, N.J., commercial real estate outfit that paid  start-up costs and the $2-million construction cost of the 8,500-square-foot  restaurant.  </P></p>

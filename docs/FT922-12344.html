			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Tokyo tightens its belt: The recession is beginning to bite I feel the recession has definitely arrived,' says Ms Itsuko Sagehashi, a bar owner. 'People who used to come three times a week now come once a week. Those who came once a month hardly come at all.' Ms Sagehashi's bar, the Charing Cross, in Kichijoji, an affluent suburb of western Tokyo, is decked out with souvenirs from Britain, including a large map of the London Underground. It is open until late. The customers are a cross-section of the city's middle class - accountants, salesmen and office managers. If these men are starting to tighten their belts, it is a sure sign that Japan's economic slowdown is beginning to affect average 'salarymen'. Ms Sagehashi says: 'Conversation is really dull now. Until last year, people used to talk about horse-racing and make bets in the bar. Now, even if they bet, they don't talk about it.' Two years ago, many ordinary Japanese were glad when early signs of trouble appeared in the economy and the boom in stocks and land collapsed, The victims were mostly over-borrowed speculators. In the minds of many, these men got their just desserts for having bid up prices in the first place. Today, there is growing evidence that the slump in the financial markets is starting to concern even those who have never owned a share or a tsubo of land (the standard 3.3-square-metre measure). As companies have cut investment and costs, so employees have started to worry about the future. Consumers last year began postponing purchases of cars and electrical hardware. Now they are becoming cautious about clothes, household goods and entertainment. Tokyo department stores this week reported that sales in March dropped by 7.8 per cent over last year - the largest decline on record. The sharpest fall was in corporate gift-buying. But everything from spring fashions to consumer appliances was affected. Mitsukoshi, the department store chain, says: 'Consumers still want to buy. But they're becoming more aware of value and pay less attention to brand names. People who bought Y100,000 suits a year ago, now buy suits for Y80,000. Imported Y300,000 suits don't sell any more.' Japan Air Lines estimates that for the Golden Week holiday in early May, a peak time for holiday travel, bookings this year are down about 5 per cent. Nothing serious, but enough to indicate consumers' growing caution. So far, most Japanese feel the recession more in their minds than in their pockets. There have been no large-scale redundancies. Unemployment is at 2 per cent and there are still 125 vacancies for every 100 job seekers. Few Japanese have any real fear of losing either their job or their home. Average household savings rose last year by 6.5 per cent to 11.28m. Japan Housing Loan Corporation, a big mortgage lender, has problems with loans made to developers but hardly any with lending to owner-occupiers. 'People are now too pessimistic, just as in the 1980s they were too optimistic,' says Mr Akio Mikuni, president of a credit rating agency. However, companies are trimming bonuses - equivalent to about five months' pay a year - and cutting overtime. For example, at Nissan Motor, Thursday has been declared an overtime-free day. At headquarters the lights go out at 6.30pm. The constant talk about recession undermines confidence. The average Japanese may have almost as muchmoney in his wallet as a year ago but he thinks it better to spend less, out of concern for the future. At the Charing Cross, Ms Sagehashi says that one of her customers, a textile company manager, tells her he used to have a mountain of papers on his desk. Now there is nothing. So he leaves the office early and goes straight home. He rarely calls at the bar any more. The young, too, are becoming a little more careful with their money. They still spend freely on ski trips and foreign holidays but they are beginning to shop around. Mr Yamato Shiine, editor of Hanako, a magazine for young women, says his readers now favour retailers' own-label goods over expensive imported brands. They tend to stay away from expensive French and Italian restaurants. 'Cheap Japanese-style western food is in - curry, rice and spaghetti. Around Y1,500 a head.' Rich people - doctors, lawyers and property developers who got out of the market at the right time - are also spending a little less than before, though they can still find plenty of outlets for their cash. Galerie Tamenaga, a Ginza art gallery, says French Impressionist paintings are hardly selling but there is demand for modern works priced at up to Y20m. A nearby jewellery store says: 'Sales of Y5m items are down, but at Y1m they're fine.' Reminders of the boom times are still everywhere. Dai Ichi Kangyo Bank this week celebrated the appointment of a new chairman and president with parties in a luxury hotel - sushi and champagne for 8,000 guests. Honda Motor launched a Y5m motorcycle, billed as the world's most expensive. Mercedes Benz reports that its new S-Class models, Y10m and up, are selling well. Fears of recession seem to prey on the minds of middle-class, middle-aged managers more than anybody else. Nissan Motor, the car maker, sees the social differences in their figures. It says sales of compact cars are doing well. So are sales of luxury vehicles. But sales of mid-sized cars have slumped, as they have for other manufacturers. An official says: 'Middle-managers buy these mid-range cars. They're concerned about future business trends.' They are also worried about mortgage payments, school bills and care for elderly relatives. They remember the damage done to the economy by the oil shocks of the 1970s. The customers of the Charing Cross intend to be careful. Additional reporting by Mitsuko Matsutani</p>

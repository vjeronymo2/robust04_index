			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow hits record on retail prices report Wall Street US blue-chip stocks closed at a record high yesterday, but a tame report on retail prices and evidence of growing consumer confidence were not enough to lift other indices, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 10.89 ahead at 3,740.67, well above the old record of 3,734.53 set last Wednesday. But the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.25 to 463.93. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 1.03 to 466.28, and the Nasdaq composite was down 0.74 at 760.75. Activity on the NYSE was moderate, with 246m shares traded. After a disappointing finish on Thursday, the market opened on a positive note, pleased to find no surprises in November's consumer price index. The Labour Department reported a 0.2 per cent rise in retail prices last month, or 2.5 per cent at a compound annual rate. Even though the data matched forecasts, the US Treasury market barely touched positive territory before prices began to drift lower in mid-morning. The mood was dampened by the release of the University of Michigan's reading on consumer sentiment in early December. With the index rising to 81.7 from 81.2 in November, suggesting a greater willingness by consumers to spend, the inflation-sensitive 30-year government bond fell to 100 19/32 in light trading. The yield rose to 6.21 per cent. For equities, any cheer to be gained from the survey was mitigated by the downturn in bonds. Most indices hovered at slightly lower levels, but stronger oil issues helped lift the Dow Industrial Average in the last hour of trade. Petroleum-related issues were in demand after crude oil prices climbed in New York and London. Texaco put on Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 64 1/2 , Chevron was Dollars  5/8 ahead at Dollars 86 5/8 , Amoco was up Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52 5/8 and Exxon was Dollars  1/2 ahead at Dollars 62 7/8 . Among the cylicals, Alcoa was Dollars  7/8 higher at Dollars 72 3/8 and Inland Steel was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 34. Kaiser Aluminum was down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 9 3/4 on news of a restructuring. Bowater added Dollars 1 1/2 after it said it would raise its newsprint prices. In the automobile sector, Chrysler climbed Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 56 1/8 after Salomon Brothers raised its earnings estimate on the company. Ford added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 64 3/8 but General Motors was unchanged at Dollars 56 1/8 . Borden was marked up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 18 3/4 after its chief executive resigned amid criticism of his efforts to turn around the food products concern. IBM advanced after Dean Witter Reynolds said stronger than expected sales would lift its fourth-quarter profit. The stock gained Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 55 1/4 . On the Nasdaq, share prices fell for a fifth straight session. In the technology sector, Apple was down Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/4 , Intel dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 56 1/4 but Microsoft was Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 81 7/8 . Canada Toronto closed slightly lower in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index fell 10.33 points to 4,280.30 in turnover of 60.8m shares. Declines led advances by 470 to 344. Trading value was CDollars 718.6m. Among Toronto's 14 sub-sectors, transportation, consumer products and energy showed solid losses. Financial services, industrial products and golds were flat, while mining was up slightly. The heavily-weighted Laidlaw class B shares fell CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 9 1/2 . On Thursday, Laidlaw said that the US Internal Revenue Service's USDollars 90m claim in unpaid back taxes would not affect the company's financial results.</p>

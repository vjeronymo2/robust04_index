			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Martin S. Lambeck report: "Ruehe Rejects Kinkel's </F> Criticism"]    [Text] Bonn -- One day before the Constitutional Court  deals with Bundeswehr missions outside NATO, Defense Minister  Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) rejected the criticism  by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of  Germany) regarding the planned reduction of the Bundeswehr  yesterday. In an interview with DIE WELT, Ruehe stated that the  troops will become smaller and be reduced to about 340,000  because "exercises and investments will again be possible."  However, he added: "We reserve the right to 370,000 men."  Kinkel insisted on a strength of 370,000 men.    The Chancellor's Office also pointed out that,  internationally, Germany will reserve the right to 370,000 men.  Ruehe's conceptional guidelines for the Bundeswehr that will be  submitted to the defense working group of the Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] today are  being supported by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and CDU/CSU Bundestag  group leader Schaeuble. They stipulate a peacetime strength of  320,000 to 340,000 men. They also provide for a military  service of 10 months.    Ruehe told DIE WELT: "The weakening of the Bundeswehr is the  result of expenditure cuts involving 2 billion German marks  within 12 months. It is now important to strengthen the  operational readiness of the Bundeswehr by optimizing the use of  the money." The smaller armed forces will be given structures  that make it possible to ensure a quick increase to 370,000 men.</p>

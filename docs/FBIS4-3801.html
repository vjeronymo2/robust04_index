			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- Former U.S.  President Richard Nixon died of a major stroke at 2108 (EST)  today at New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center at the age of  81, reports reaching here said.    Nixon suffered a major stroke at his New Jersey home at  around supper time on April 18, and he was soon rushed to the  hospital.    Beginning Thursday [21 April] afternoon, Nixon lapsed into a  very deep coma.    The life-long Republican was born in California on 9 January  1913 and was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives  in 1946 and to the U.S. Senate in 1950. He was elected vice  president as running-mate to Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and  re-elected vice president in 1956.    In 1968, Nixon was elected president of the United States  over Democrat Hubert Humphrey and independent George Wallace and  on 20 January 1969, he was sworn in as the 37th president of the  country.    In November 1972 he was re-elected U.S. president until 9  August 1974, when he was forced to resign in culmination of the  Watergate scandal, thus becoming the only president in U.S.  history to resign to avoid impeachment.    The former U.S. leader visited China in February 1972 and at  the end of his visit, the Chinese and U.S. Governments issued  the famous "Shanghai Communique," opening the door to Sino-U.S.  exchanges. He later visited China five more times as an old  friend of the Chinese people.    Beginning this evening, flags in the capital Washington and  the rest of the United States will fly at half-mast for 30 days  to mourn Nixon's death.</p>

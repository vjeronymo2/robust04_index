			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Ousted Gambian president leaves on US warship A US warship carrying ousted Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara steamed out of Banjul yesterday while the leader of the coup which toppled him received ambassadors and religious leaders, Reuter reports from Banjul. Diplomats said the US Navy tank-landing ship La Moure County carrying Mr Jawara, members of his family and senior officials was believed to be heading for Dakar, capital of neighbouring Senegal. Religious leaders who met coup leader Lieutenant Yayeh Jameh said he told them that he and Mr Jawara had spoken but failed to agree terms for the president to return. Mr Jawara fled to the US warship after young army officers on Saturday announced a coup against him after what began as a rampage through Banjul on Friday by soldiers demanding back pay. Officials said 10 Nigerian officers working with the military had been put under house arrest. They included the former commander of the 800-strong Gambian army, Colonel Boubakar Dada, who was preparing to leave Gambia. The capital Banjul was calm, the market was open and people were going about their business normally. An overnight curfew was in force from 7pm to 7am. Officials said Mr Jawara, the first of his two wives Lady Chilele Jawara, and about 14 of his 19 children were on the US ship with the finance minister and inspector general of police. They said the justice minister had been arrested, as had the information minister and Vice President Saihou Sabally. The education minister, Mr Alieu Badjie, gave himself up on Saturday morning. Mr Jawara was prime minister when Gambia won independence from Britain in 1965 and became president when it became a republic in 1970.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (16): Breaking free of the rouble zone - Baltics THROUGHOUT the Baltic states privatisation is a key element in overall economic, financial and monetary policies designed to ensure their full independence from Moscow which still maintains over 100,000 troops in the region. All three states wish to break away from the rouble zone and establish their own currencies. Estonia took the lead by issuing the first Estonian Kroon last month and both Latvia and Lithuania are planning similar steps. All three were tightly integrated into the former Soviet economy and privatisation, which is partly aimed at attracting foreign investment, is seen both as a means of reducing the former Russian influence and turning all the economies of the region in a westerly direction. With foreign investment in mind the Baltic trio are in the process of setting up Natiuonal Investment Banks in their respective capitals on the lines of the Nordic Investment bank. KPMG, are acting as management consultants for the project which is being financially backed by the EBRD and the European Communty's Phare fund. Lithuania, the largest and most populous of the trio, has moved fastest in the area of housing privatisation with the creation of investment vouchers for the purchase of apartments and other property. Its Land Reform Act of July 1991 provides for private ownership of land and compensation for those expropriated after the Soviet invasion. Latvia has the largest ethnic Russian population. As elsewhere in the region many of the plants to be privatised are the result of all-Union investments, financed largely by Moscow. Most are managed by ethnic Russians who also make up a large proportion of their workforce. While work is far advanced on drawing up a large volume of privatisation-related legislation the reality on the ground is rapid 'spontaneous' privatisation, especially of small shops, agricultural land and other property, but slow progress in the industrial area. Estonia with its close linguistic and ethnic links with Finland is also banking on foreign investment to help both privatise and modernise its industrial base, especially the highly polluting oil shale industry. It has been the first to cut its links with the Rouble zone by issuing its own currency- but like the other states still has the bulk of its savings and hard currency deposits frozen in Moscow.</p>

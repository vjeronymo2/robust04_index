			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / People: Mining team digs in at Hambros The complete 15-strong mining team at Indosuez Capital Securities (UK) has moved to Hambros Bank where a new subsidiary, Hambros Equities UK, has been set up to house them. Among those who have moved is Chris Orchard, now managing director of Hambros Equities UK, Roger Franklin, executive director, dealing, and Graham Roberts executive director, research. This trio, and many of the other team members, have been together for eight years during which time the organisation they worked for had several name changes. They started out with stockbroker Galloway &amp; Pearson, which became WICO Galloway and then, after being sold to Banque Indosuez, WI Carr (UK). A merger turned that into Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken and, fairly recently, after a reshuffle at Indosuez, the team found itself working for Indosuez Capital. Graham Roberts acknowledges that mining teams do not sit comfortably in any company in London where there has been a decreasing amount of interest in the sector - so much so that one gold miner, Monarch Resources, recently decided to move to the Toronto stock exchange instead. Nevertheless, Hambros is providing a home 'which will be culturally a place where we can take the business a step further'. Hambros already owns Hambros Equities Australia, set up as a joint venture with Strauss Turnbull in 1986 and becoming HEA in 1990, which specialises in Australian mining and oil, banking, transport, media and technology companies. Ross McFadyen, managing director of the Australian offshoot, is chairman of Hambros Equities UK. Roberts says the combined Australian and UK businesses will offer a worldwide service, not just in international mining shares but also financial instruments in the South African and Australian markets. Other members of the Indosuez team who have already moved include, on the research side, John Barker and Chris Pearson; from sales, John Lee, Mike Long, Robert Lee, and David Starling, while the dealers are Mark Head, Mark Gibbons and Tony Phillips.</p>

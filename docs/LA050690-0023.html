			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BERMAN HAD NO EASY JOB TO INCREASE FOREIGN AID;  </P> <P> CONGRESS: THE PANORAMA CITY REPRESENTATIVE USED HIS POLITICAL CONNECTIONS TO  GET HIS PRIORITIES INTO THE HOUSE BUDGET PROPOSAL. BUT IT WAS ONLY THE FIRST  STEP IN A LONG PROCESS.  </P> <P> Many members of Congress regard foreign aid as budgetary poison ivy, but Rep.  Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) is not among them.  </P> <P> Berman has pushed for more foreign aid at a time when many congressmen believe  that few voters appreciate their tax dollars going abroad, especially with  domestic needs growing and the United States' international economic position  slipping.  </P> <P> Berman succeeded in getting more foreign aid in the House budget, passed last  week, for the next fiscal year than the $16.6 billion the government is  spending this year. If the allocation survives the budget labyrinth, it will  reverse a five-year decline in foreign aid.  </P> <P> What follows is a look behind the scenes, based on interviews with congressmen  and House staff members, at how Berman shaped one piece of the elaborate  $1.2-trillion budget process. His success reflected, in part, the importance of  personal connections -- particularly to influential fellow Californians -- as  well as sheer persistence.  </P> <P> "Right from the beginning, he made sure it was his goal" to increase foreign  aid funding, said Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a Budget Committee ally.  "Berman worked his tail off for something he believes in, and he got it done."  </P> <P> The story begins in January, when Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.)  sought to redefine the foreign aid debate by calling for a shift from  traditional beneficiaries such as Israel, Egypt and Pakistan to emerging  democracies in Eastern Europe and drug-fighting nations in Latin America.  </P> <P> To Berman, the only Democrat on both the House Foreign Affairs and Budget  committees, those were fighting words.  </P> <P> He agreed that more money was needed for Eastern Europe and Latin America. But,  appealing to idealism as well as self-interest, Berman argued that the pie  should be expanded rather than redistributed.  </P> <P> "Foreign aid plays a more important role as we redefine our national security  needs than military aid," Berman said recently. "It's very important in  supporting development of democracy and America's economic growth."  </P> <P> Berman cited statistics indicating that $2 out of every $3 in foreign aid comes  back to the United States in the form of U.S. goods and services that foreign  countries buy. And he said that continued support is essential for the security  and stability of traditional beneficiaries, including Israel. Berman is one of  the Jewish state's leading advocates on Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> Although Berman's approach was often circuitous, his ultimate target was Rep.  Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), the powerful chairman of the House Budget  Committee, which is charged with crafting a budget proposal to take to the  House floor.  </P> <P> Panetta must produce a budget that falls within the Gramm-Rudman deficit  reduction limits and satisfies a majority of Democrats on the committee and,  later, the full House. To do so, he must balance the conflicting demands of  individual committee members and interest groups.  </P> <P> Berman went to work in late February. His goal was to build a coalition of key  colleagues by lobbying them individually as well as exhorting constituent  groups to put the heat on them. The more allies he lined up, the more clout he  would have with Panetta.  </P> <P> Throughout, Berman was acting on behalf of House Foreign Affairs Committee  Chairman Dante B. Fascell (D-Fla.), the chief proponent of increased aid.  Initially, the two paid a visit to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.).  </P> <P> They knew Foley was sympathetic but wanted to get him involved on their behalf.  Foley said he would speak to Panetta.  </P> <P> Berman then approached Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) to enlist the  support of the Black Caucus for more aid to African nations and the Caribbean,  both of which have suffered cuts in U.S. aid in recent years. Dellums, just  back from a trip to Africa, offered to send a letter to Panetta calling for  more foreign aid.  </P> <P> Berman then called Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente), another California  ally, and Puerto Rico's non-voting Resident Commissioner Jaime B. Fuster (D-San  Juan), to enlist the help of the Hispanic Caucus. In this instance, Berman  highlighted the need for more money for Nicaragua and Panama. He felt they  would be supportive if he needed them.  </P> <P> Next, Berman spoke to Rep. William O. Lipinski (D-Ill.), an advocate for  Eastern European immigrants, and emphasized the need for more aid for new  Eastern European democracies. He asked Lipinski to organize other members whose  districts include large numbers of ethnic minorities from that region.  </P> <P> All along, Berman was approaching Budget Committee members who had previously  supported foreign aid. He started with Democrats, who hold a 21-14 majority on  the committee, but he also identified several Republicans likely to be  sympathetic if needed.  </P> <P> With each, he stressed the regions of interest to them. For instance, he knew  Rep. Mike Espy (D-Miss.) was keenly supportive of aid to Africa. Rep. Richard  J. Durbin (D-Ill.), who is of Lithuanian descent, was most concerned about  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "We met endlessly," recalled Michael S. Powell, Berman's legislative assistant  on the budget. "We met for hours upon hours upon hours."  </P> <P> Berman went to see House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) as well.  </P> <P> Cognizant of Gephardt's acute interest in the United States' ability to compete  with Japan, Berman stressed that foreign aid for the U.S. Export-Import Bank is  essential to give U.S. industries an even playing field overseas against  heavily subsidized Japanese and European companies. In addition, he reminded  Gephardt that Japan had surpassed the United States as the biggest provider of  foreign aid as a percentage of gross national product.  </P> <P> "Even the most sweeping imaginable increases in foreign aid would have  negligible effect on the overall budget deficit," Berman wrote to Gephardt on  Feb. 27. "Yet modest growth will go far in restoring the leadership role we  once enjoyed among foreign aid donors."  </P> <P> Gephardt, too, expressed his support.  </P> <P> At the same time, Berman was in touch with the politically potent  American-Israel Public Affairs Committee and with Employment Through Exports, a  business coalition that supports the Export-Import Bank. He encouraged the  groups to turn up the pressure on Budget Committee members to support increased  international assistance.  </P> <P> He also spoke to the Sierra Club, a natural ally because the foreign aid budget  includes family planning funds for Third World countries, one of the  environmental group's priorities.  </P> <P> Then, with the House coalition and constituent groups in line, Berman went to  Panetta.  </P> <P> The fellow California Democrats know each other well. Among other things, they  worked closely on the sweeping 1986 immigration reform bill.  </P> <P> "There's a great amount of trust there," said a senior aide to Panetta. "They  understand each other and they respect each other. There's not a lot of  posturing between them."  </P> <P> Berman spoke to Panetta on the phone, on the House floor and in private  meetings. Fascell joined him for one crucial session in Fascell's office in  early March.  </P> <P> The three lawmakers failed to reach agreement, but Fascell and Berman let  Panetta know that his proposed $19.1 billion in spending authority and $16.9  billion in direct spending for foreign aid would not fly with them. This year's  figures are $18.4 billion in spending authority and $16.6 billion in direct  spending, or actual outlays.  </P> <P> Spending authority represents congressional approval for federal agencies to  enter into spending commitments that could span several years, while outlays  are sums actually spent in a single budget year.  </P> <P> Berman and Fascell pushed Panetta harder than they had in previous years in  part because they felt emboldened by the dramatic cuts the Democrats were  advocating in defense spending. "I understand the problem," Fascell said  Panetta told them. "We'll do the best we can."  </P> <P> Foreign aid was, of course, just one part of a broad budget consensus Panetta  was seeking. Without the backing of Democratic members, Panetta's budget  resolution could face a messy internecine battle in the committee or on the  House floor.  </P> <P> "Leon is under tremendous pressure in the budget resolution," Berman said.  "Part of the dynamic that produces an agreement is the notion that the failure  to produce one will result in a lot of opposition."  </P> <P> Panetta subsequently agreed to modest increases. But Berman was not satisfied.  He talked to Panetta on the House floor and invited Panetta's two top budget  staff members and his foreign aid budget analyst to his office for two sessions  of poring over the foreign aid figures.  </P> <P> Berman was bolstered by the presence of Eric Lief, a 10-year veteran of the  State Department who was working on Berman's staff as a department fellow.  </P> <P> "It makes the member more effective if he can understand what the technical  issues are," said a Budget Committee staff member who participated in these  meetings. Berman "really understood the nitty-gritty of what went into  Panetta's recommendations. It helped him argue where he thought we were short."  </P> <P> Lief helped Berman understand how money for State Department programs is spent  in the so-called "out years," or those beyond the next year's budget. This  proved important in persuading Panetta's staff of the need for increased  spending authority.  </P> <P> "It was very important because the out years are really a mystery to most  members," Panetta's aide said. "They chose the right policy for '91 that would  fit with our out-year path and that was really critical."  </P> <P> Panetta eventually agreed to raise the numbers to $20.3 billion and $17.6  billion -- or $1.2 billion more in spending authority and $700 million more in  direct spending than he had originally planned to propose.  </P> <P> Berman's triumph, however, was only the first step in a long process. The House  budget, which was approved along partisan lines, is merely a Democratic  blueprint for the congressional committees -- particularly the House  Appropriations Committee -- that will decide later this year how much actually  will be spent. Those deliberations will follow negotiations with the Republican  Bush Administration as well as the Senate.  </P> <P> "It gives us a shopping license with Appropriations," said Fascell, who called  Berman's role indispensable. "And Howard's already hard at work on that."  </P></p>

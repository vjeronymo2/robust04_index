			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Tsepkalo, political scientist: "Creators </F> of the New Sensation, or About the Myths of the Foreign Policy  of Belarus"]    [Text] "The world revolves not around the creators of  new sensations but around the creators of new values..." F.  Nietzsche: "Thus Spoke Zarathustra."    The problems of Belarus today have been mixed in to the  domestic political sphere. The republic's population is  suffering from higher prices, impoverishment and unemployment, a  sharp rise in crime, and a loss of future prospects. Because of  the difficulties of daily life, public opinion remains actually  indifferent to questions of foreign policy. Yet we cannot allow  ourselves to be indifferent to international activity. The  taxpayer has the right to know about the effectiveness of the  utilization of funds spent for conducting the state's foreign  political activity.  <H5>  How It All Began </H5>   Foreign policy, like policy in general, in civilized  countries is formed by a fairly narrow group of people. They  include political figures of a certain level and the so-called  analyst-experts who develop various political concepts.    In Belarus, which is just starting out on the bumpy path of  development of civilization, the situation with the development  of a political course is much simpler and hence also sadder. A  lack of professionalism does not play last fiddle in the  political orchestra of the Republic of Belarus. This disease has  affected many power structures of our country as well as,  unfortunately, one of the key organs of state  administration--the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    Many critical shots have been taken at this department  recently. And Petr Kravchanka, chief of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, has ended up at the center of the target. And in  general this is understandable. It is the leader of the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs who is largely responsible for both foreign  policy and the republic's image in the international arena.  Therefore when analyzing the foreign policy of independent  Belarus, the author of these lines automatically has to look at  the image of the minister of foreign affairs.    To be fair, it should be noted that Kravchanka's first steps  in the post of leader of the foreign political department  deserved all possible praise: It was necessary to begin under  the conditions of the existence of the USSR when the Belarusian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs was nothing more than a branch of  the Union one. In these circumstances, which were so unfavorable  for the establishment of national independence, the only correct  line of foreign political behavior was  selected--cultural-national.    "Native Tongue," the propaganda of Belarusian culture, the  development of ties with the Belarusian diaspora--all this could  not fail to evoke the sympathies of the republic's  intelligentsia. For a certain amount of time Petr Kravchanka was  able to charm even the leaders of the Belarusian People's Front  who, in general, cannot be suspected of having great love for  the so-called party nomenklatura. I would also like to point out  another of the minister's positive characteristics--his  consistent behavior. Certain of his opponents understand this  quality as an adherence to methods and forms of party  leadership. But the author sees it as "devotion to ideals," in  the long list of which one can note ideals of a culturalogical  direction.    Veteran Belarusian diplomats and the intelligentsia will  understand well how three years ago the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs was turned into something like a private investigation  bureau, all of whose workers day and night, with or without  technical means, looked all over the world for the notorious  "cross of Yefrasinya of Polotsk." These searches continue to  this day, although with less enthusiasm.    While giving the great Belarusian sacred object and the need  to return it to the homeland their due, it still should be noted  that searches for national treasures that have disappeared  abroad should be handled, apparently, by the Ministry of Culture  and the corresponding authorized organs. And the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs may exert a certain diplomatic influence but  certainly not usurp the entire process.    But we will not get into an analysis of the causes of the  "cultural fever" that gripped the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  abroad for two epochs. A sufficient number of interesting  articles have been devoted to this topic. Let us turn to the  less-studied aspects of our state's foreign political activity.  <H5>  Forgotten Initiative </H5>   One of the methods of fighting for peace is to fight for the  creation of a zone free of nuclear weapons. A couple of years  ago Minister P. Kravchanka put forth an initiative to create a  nuclear-free zone from the Baltic to the Black Sea. But no  further steps were taken to add details and real content to this  initiative. The problem of a "Ukrainian Chernobyl" remains.  Moreover, it recently acquired a new quality--our southern  neighbors decided to continue to operate their nuclear reactor.  And what can be said about the condition in which nuclear  weapons are kept in Ukraine today! This is how our initiative,  long forgotten by everyone, has been realized.    While the citizens were thinking about the problem of doing  without nuclear weapons, they were told that Belarus had  submitted a proposal for mediation in the Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict.    A moment later we are already becoming the initiators of  regulation of the conflict in the Dniester region. The latter,  naturally, was resolved without even our minimal participation.  As for Nagorno-Karabakh, here at the diplomatic level our side  has done nothing and is doing nothing. The minister has not  taken a single trip to either Armenia or Azerbaijan. They have  all been longer--to Western Europe and America. Apparently  Belarus needed the intermediary mission more than the  Transcaucasus did.    The only result of our activity for regulating conflicts has  been that the government has allotted money for the  reconstruction of a number of facilities in the former building  of the CPSU Gorkom [city committee] (now, Ministry of Foreign  Affairs) for an international group of observers. But the  intermediary group moved to Rome without even registering in our  country.  <H5>  Memorial Markers Are All Right, But... </H5>   The activity of Belarus in the United Nations is evoking a  multitude of complaints. Naturally, one is reminded of the  related work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the past  three years in this area--A. [as published] Kravchanka's  appearance in the United Nations in an ethnic shirt. This  surrealistic episode, incidentally, can be included among the  minister's cultural predilections.    The next session of the UN General Assembly (the minister of  foreign affairs headed this delegation as well) was marked by  the fact that the contribution of Belarus to the United Nations  was increased by $2 million. We will now pay three times more  than Hungary, twice as much as Greece, and 1.5 times more than  the 800 million put up by India.    Without analyzing the reasons for adopting this decision,  one  can say merely that it will lead to a 1.5-fold increase in the  republic's contributions to other international organizations,  which are based on the existing scale of contributions to the  UN: the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), UNIDO (United  Nations Industrial Development Organization), UNCTAD (United  Nations Conference on Trade and Development), the International  Labor Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational,  Scientific, and Cultural Organization), and dozens of other  international organizations and hundreds of various conventions  and joint expert and consultative groups.    The leader of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs prefers to  remain silent about these facts. Therefore we will most likely  not learn the truth about the contribution of the long-suffering  Belarus to the budget of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe either. All we know is that it exceeded  the contribution of Portugal and Ireland, whose economic  potential is not likely to be very far below that of our  country. And if perhaps these figures still do not strike terror  in us, as more institutions of European cooperation appear,  Belarus' contribution will strike a painful blow to our  pocketbooks, which are practically empty to begin with.    Belarus' sharp increase in expenditures on multilateral  diplomacy is occurring under conditions of a terrible economic  crisis, which has struck literally all branches of the republic  national economy.    A curious comparison can be made with the People's Republic  of China. A country with more than a billion population and the  most rapid rates of economic growth in the world (about 12  percent annually), each year it contrives to reduce its  contribution to the budget of the United Nations. After the  increase of the contribution of Belarus and the regular  reduction of China's contribution, we have almost caught up with  this superpower in terms of the volume of hard currency payments  for maintaining international bureaucrats.    Is there really no logic in diplomacy? There is logic. It  lies in the varying degree of effectiveness of diplomatic  efforts of various countries.    At the last session of the UN General Assembly Belarus  submitted its candidacy for the Security Council. It lost to the  Czech Republic. Now we will not appear on the lists of  candidates for this position before the next millennium.  Although if we had been able to really evaluate our capabilities  and gain the support of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, at the  next elections in two years our chances of obtaining a position  on the Security Council would have looked much better.    Another fact related to the selection procedure is  confusing.  After the first round of votes it was clear that the Czech  Republic would make it onto the Security Council. In this case  the states that garnered the fewest votes in the first round, as  a rule, remove their candidacies for the next vote, as if making  a gentlemanly gesture. Belarus did not do this. We know how it  ended--the Czech Republic was selected.    But let us be tolerant. Today's diplomacy is mainly  multilateral diplomacy. In the international arena questions are  decided to an ever increasing degree in informal discussions  with the participation of several diplomats at the same time.  Having only one foreign language, Russian, the minister of  foreign affairs apparently sometimes experiences certain  difficulties in communicating with representatives of other  countries. Therefore some of the aforementioned blunders are  partially the result of objective difficulties related to the  problem of understanding.    But there are also blunders that have nothing to do with  understanding....    Strange as it may be, the Czechs did not put up their  memorial plaques to Karel Capek and Jaroslav Gasek throughout  all of Europe, but they were still selected for the Security  Council. But, putting up signs all over the world and calling  this foreign policy, we speak with the Italians about Frantsisk  Skorina and his plaque in Padua, we engage in conversation with  the Poles about Manyushko, and with the Japanese--about the need  to immortalize the memory of Gashkevich. It is finally time to  stop asking the entire world the eternal question: "Do you  respect me?"  <H5>  A Time To Gather Up Stones </H5>   For the foreign affairs ministers of the United States,  Germany, France, Japan, and also the Czech Republic the  imperative of foreign policy has been problems of the economy  and particularly questions of international trade. The author of  these lines is not surprised by the fact that the first question  raised in the international arena by leading politicians of the  West and East is the defense of their interests in negotiations  within the framework of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade).    It seems that the main foreign political task for Belarus is  to provide favorable external conditions for carrying out  economic modernization. But, observing the activity of the  leader of the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, one could  get the impression that all of our problems related to this were  solved long ago and we can allow ourselves to work  on....questions of culture.    The situation is quite the opposite. Antidumping legislation  is continuing to work against us in the European Community. That  is, we are considered to be a country with subsidized production  (like the former USSR and now Russia). In other words, we  continue to be seen as a state that receives oil, gas, and metal  raw material at discounted prices. And therefore, unlike the  Baltic states, we are taxed to such an extent that it actually  blocks off our access to the European market.    In both domestic and foreign policy there is a certain  tactic  of behavior to which certain figures in the highest echelons of  power resort from time to time. This tactic is as old as the  hills, but even today it continues to produce certain political  points. The main thing is to come up with a slogan or introduce  an initiative and then, without following up on what has been  said, immediately switch to other initiatives or historic  programs.    Realizing the idea is much more complicated than merely  discussing it. But it is the realization of what has been  earmarked that increases the state's prestige in the  international arena. Anything else merely undermines faith in  the country's foreign political commitments.    There was a time when we threw stones. But sooner or later  the time will come when we have to gather them--take  responsibility for the promises we have made.    From the editorial staff. The facts contained in the  published article show that Petr Kravchanka and the ministry he  heads sometimes work on problems outside their purview.  Moreover, instead of the expected aid, the republic itself is  making considerable unjustified expenditures. Therefore it is  impossible to understand why the activity of the Belarusian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet attracted the fixed  attention of the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Council.  At the present time SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA intends to publish a  series of articles devoted to an analysis of the foreign policy  of the Republic of Belarus in the most important regions of the  world.</p>

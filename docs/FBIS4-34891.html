			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 Jun (DPA) -- Argentine President  Carlos Menem praised bilateral relations with the United States,  anticipated Argentina's prompt joining of NAFTA, and called the  opposition's request for a political trial of Economy Minister  Domingo Cavallo "outrageous."    Upon arriving in the capital following a trip to the United  States and Canada, Menem said that "the decision about Argentina  joining NAFTA has practically been made," but everything  "depends on the invitation extended to us," he said.    Menem said his meeting with his U.S. counterpart Bill  Clinton  at the White House on 24 June was very significant, and that his  meeting with former U.S. President George Bush was very "warm  and affectionate."    As for the request by the Radical Civic Union [UCR], the  main  opposition party, that Cavallo, who drafted the current  adjustment plan, be brought to political trial, Menem said that  action cannot be taken just because the minister interpreted a  law.    Former Argentine President Raul Alfonsin, current UCR  leader,  told the UCR deputies' faction leader to ask for a political  trial of Cavallo following his interpretation of the extension  stipulated by Congress to choose between private or state  retirement.    Despite the 90-day extension to opt for the distribution [de  reparto] or capitalization plan approved by the legislature,  Cavallo announced last Friday that those who did not choose  before 1 July would be registered in an administrating board for  private retirement funds.    Opposition legislators challenged Cavallo's interpretation  and expressed their concern that the executive branch would not  promulgate the law approved by Congress before 1 July, when the  deadline expires.    Menem stressed today that he will decide the issue of the  extension for choosing a retirement plan.</p>

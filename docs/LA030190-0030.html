			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD LIFTS BUILDING BAN  </P> <P> The Inglewood City Council agreed Tuesday to lift a building moratorium on  apartments and condominiums for 21 developments whose plans already had been  submitted when a citywide moratorium went into effect last August.  </P> <P> But seven other projects in that category will remain under the moratorium  because they are planned for streets where apartment and condominium  construction would have a significant impact on the area, city officials said.  </P> <P> Those seven properties are on streets where most of the properties are  single-family homes.  </P> <P> Half a dozen residents objected, arguing that the building ban should include  all construction.  </P> <P> The original moratorium only blocked submission of new plans. Last month, the  city amended the moratorium to include the 28 properties whose plans had  already been submitted.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the council exempted 21 of the projects, noting that they are in  areas where substantial apartment and condominium development already exists.  </P> <P> A moratorium on the submission of new plans for multifamily projects in the  high-density R-3, R-4 and P-1 zones remains in effect. City officials said a  comprehensive study of the city's density problems should be completed by May.  </P></p>

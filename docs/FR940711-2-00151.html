It is essential that a long term perspective be taken in programming improvements, selecting among alternative maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction strategies, and designing pavements, structures, and other highway elements. Longer design lives may have to be considered, and traditional strategies for programming maintenance and rehabilitation activities may have to be reevaluated to determine whether they adequately consider future costs, including user delay-related costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increasing congestion on important highways in urban areas and some rural areas makes it critical to fully consider life-cycle costs of investment decisions. Safety concerns and auxiliary construction costs to maintain, rehabilitate, or reconstruct congested highways and bridges under traffic are very high. User costs and delays around work zones in congested areas may be even higher and represent significant inefficiencies that may adversely affect economic productivity, especially on the National Highway System (NHS). These delays can erode productivity gains realized by the growing number of industries using just-in-time and other advanced logistics strategies that depend on efficient and predictable transportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regardless of whether user costs are included in a formal LCCA, most States already implicitly consider user costs when they choose to pay premiums to maintain traffic through work zones or design more durable pavements in congested urban areas. Including user costs in LCCA makes these implicit considerations explicit, and may help identify other opportunities to reduce overall agency and user costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recognition of the high future costs to maintain and rehabilitate highways, bridges and tunnels, and their associated traffic control, safety, environmental, and hydraulic components has led to increased interest in the potential for LCCA to improve investment productivity and reduce public and private costs of highway and other transportation programs. The FHWA and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) jointly sponsored a symposium in December 1993 to learn more about LCCA practices among the States and to identify research, training, technical assistance, and policy-related needs to improve LCCA application. An important input to that symposium was an AASHTO survey of State LCCA practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many specific LCCA issues and research needs were identified at the symposium. Key technical issues included how to establish the appropriate analysis period, how to value and properly consider user costs, and how to choose the appropriate discount rate. Participants also identified important research and data needed to predict pavement and bridge performance and forecast future traffic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An important policy issue raised at the symposium was the recognition that results of LCCA may favor selection of improvements with higher initial costs in order to achieve significant long term savings in overall investment requirements. It may indicate, for instance, that more projects warrant reconstruction rather than rehabilitation strategies, that early intervention with preventive maintenance is cost effective, or that somewhat higher designs or levels of service may be appropriate for some facilities. The FHWA recognizes that LCCA, thus, may result in proposals for greater expenditures up front. At the same time virtually all transportation agencies will continue to face budgetary limitations at least over the short term. Life-cycle cost analysis will help agencies identify and explain the real costs borne by transportation users of inadequate infrastructure funding. Furthermore, LCCA can assist agencies that face fiscal constraints in making the best use of available funds. Several States already use LCCA in developing network improvement programs as part of their pavement and bridge management systems. Eventually it is desirable for all States to have such capabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (8): Tough adjustments ahead - The agriculture sector is uncompetitive A collective sigh of relief greeted the news that Austria's negotiators in Brussels had finally reached agreement on European Union membership terms covering agriculture. A 'good' deal was seen in Vienna as crucially important if the government was to win support for a June referendum on joining the EU. In the event, most politicians saw last month's outcome to the negotiations as positive for Austria, and more importantly it was perceived that way by much of the public. Even so, the government will be hard put to calm local fears about the impact of joining the EU. Austria's uncompetitive agriculture faces some tough adjustments. The EU deal allows Austria to continue to subsidise its farmers for a period with generous financial help from Brussels, but it also requires Austria to open its market to competition with prices aligned on EU prices from day one of membership. There will be no soft transition period. Austria will be able to limit imports of cereals, poultry, pork and milk over a four-year period. It was granted an annual milk production quota of 2.5m tonnes - less than the 2.9m tonnes it had originally sought but seen as an acceptable compromise in Vienna. A sugar quota of a little over 390,000 tonnes roughly meets real annual sugar production rather than the theoretical 450,000-500,000 tonnes claimed in the negotiations. Mr Franz Fischler, agriculture minister, says the immediate cost of reducing prices to EU levels will be about Sch4bn. The EU is expected to provide about Sch2.8bn in environment-designated financial help in addition to standard support from its regional and social funds. It is also hoped farmers will benefit from free access to EU markets, but the benefits may be delayed until Austria develops both better marketing and distribution networks. Meanwhile, Mr Fischler is confident that Austrian agriculture can succeed with new products and markets. 'Austria can develop niche markets for environmentally sound produce. Biological farming production in Austria already is the biggest in Europe,' he says. Adjustment will be difficult but, he says, Austrian agriculture was already facing difficult changes under the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Even if Austria did not become a member of the EU, its agriculture would face serious problems. 'Access to traditional markets in the EU would be limited and burdened with duties. Reduction of subsidised export quantities by 21 per cent and export subsidies by 36 per cent as stipulated in the Gatt agreements would worsen Austria's position,' said a recent agriculture ministry report. Austrian agriculture is hampered by difficult local conditions, low productivity, narrow markets and poor distribution networks. Migration from the land at an annual rate of about 5 per cent also threatens long-term prospects. With a farmer's average income less than half that of an industrial worker, considerable incentives will be needed to keep people on the land. There are about 270,000 farms in Austria, most of which are family owned. About half are smaller than 10 hectares and 45,000 are smaller than three hectares. One in three farmers works full time on their farm, and two thirds rely on a second job to supplement their income. Altogether farming employs about 5.5 per cent of the population, although it contributes only 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product. Local climatic and land conditions make farming more difficult than in other European countries. More than 64 per cent of agricultural land is in mountain areas, and more than 60 per cent of farmers are Alpine farmers - a higher proportion than in any other EU country. Mountain land is difficult to tend, the use of machinery is limited and much of the work has to be done manually. Because it is economically and socially important for Austria to keep people on the land - a large number of farmers help to sustain the economically vital tourist industry - farming is encouraged with a wide range of subsidies, and by any estimate, support will be needed for years to come. Modernisation and productivity improvements are likely to be slow. Further down the food chain, the domestic food processing industry faces similar problems. Mr Werner Teufelsbauer, director of economic policy at the Austrian Economic Chamber, says both sectors will experience a shock as markets are opened up and protection ends. He says Austria's exclusion from the EU for 20 years has not prepared it for the challenge and opportunities of a much wider market. It will take time and money to establish new market systems. Meanwhile, 'quite a lot of companies could go bankrupt or be bought up by French or German ones,' he says. The food processing industries employ about 40,000 people, but make mainly basic products on an uncompetitive scale, he argues. An example of things to come is provided by the rapid inroads of German producers of dairy products who have picked up 15 per cent of Austria's market in milk and yoghurts in the three months since the European Economic Area came into effect last January. Other sectors will face similar challenges. Mr Alois Mock, the foreign minister who headed Austria's negotiating team in Brussels, is more optimistic. He says conditions for farmers, and especially mountain farmers, will improve during the transition as a result of the agreement. But no-one doubts there will be pain as well as benefits. 'There will be tougher competition and we will see restructuring at the local level,' he says.</p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLISH LEADERS OPENLY TACKLE ISSUE OF LEGALIZING SOLIDARITY  </P> <P> In what could be a landmark session of the Central Committee of Poland's  Communist Party, authorities began to grapple openly Monday with the question  of legalizing the banned trade union Solidarity.  </P> <P> "Today we will draw directions of democracy which will include some pluralistic  solutions," the party leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, said as he opened the  two-day committee meeting.  </P> <P> More than once Jaruzelski referred to "pluralism," a concept often proposed by  Solidarity leader Lech Walesa as the key to solving Poland's intractable  political and economic problems.  </P> <P> The 230-member Central Committee was also told by the party's leading  ideologist, Politburo member Marian Orzechowski, that "the problem of trade  union pluralism is becoming ripe to be solved."  </P> <P> Neither Orzechowski nor Jaruzelski mentioned Solidarity by name, but the issue  was clear to party conservatives and reformers alike. Both are expecting a  heated discussion before the meeting ends.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Push for Legalization  </P> <P> The question of legalizing Solidarity has been gathering force since last  August, when strikes by union activists were ended at Walesa's urging after the  government promised to enter into discussions with Solidarity.  </P> <P> But party hard-liners have balked at legalizing the union, and Solidarity's  leaders have refused to take part in discussions with the government until it  grants legal status to the union, which was suspended and later outlawed after  a 1981 martial-law decree.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, the authorities and the official news media have taken pains  to describe Walesa as a moderate voice in the opposition, and this suggests  that the Communist leadership is trying to win over party hard-liners,  particularly among officials of the state-sanctioned trade union alliance, the  military and the police -- the party "apparatus," as it is called.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski told the meeting Monday that the party wants pluralism but not  pluralism that is "confrontational, destructive, anarchizing."  </P> <P> He said that after a decade of economic decline, Polish citizens have become  "irritated and unsure about the future."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Radical Reconstruction'  </P> <P> "The priority goal," he said, "is radical and irrevocable reconstruction of  social life so that . . . there is a place in it for all citizens who recognize  the supreme interests of our country and the unchangeable shape of its  essential framework."  </P> <P> Although the reference to "supreme interests" is usually taken to mean the  primacy of the Communist Party and the state's relationship with the Soviet  Union, the party's conservative elements are increasingly concerned that reform  efforts can only dilute the party's authority.  </P> <P> "Many party members have doubts about a successful dialogue," said Manfred  Gorywoda, the party leader from Katowice, one of the first hard-liners to take  the floor.  </P> <P> Orzechowski said that any move to allow more than one legal trade union should  be accompanied by guarantees that there would be no repeat of the "events of  1981," when factories became "arenas of political struggle."  </P> <P> Walesa has argued repeatedly in recent months that the legalization of  Solidarity would not mean a return to the chaotic days of 1981, which were  characterized by widespread strikes and economic paralysis.  </P> <P> Orzechowski said that those who want to contribute to the welfare of the state  and nation, while respecting the constitution, should be allowed to "function  legally within the state structures, and not against them."  </P></p>

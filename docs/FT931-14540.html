			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Arts: 'Madness' tours the country Love may be madness, yes. But it took the truly baroque mind of the Spanish playwright Lope de Vega to put love in a madhouse and to show madness inspiring love to new peaks. In a wonderful production of Madness in Valencia at London's Gate Theatre which is about to tour the country, two sane (and beautiful) people, Floriana and Erifila, are forced to take refuge in a lunatic asylum. Meeting there, they fall in love; and the madness all around them intensifies their passion and gives them new emotional freedom. Men both sane and mad fall for Erifila and scheme to take advantage of her; other sane women fall for Floriano and enter the madhouse to be with him. As with The Great Pretenders, which the Gate staged this time last year, you not only follow the plot like a whodunnit, you are also kept on tenterhooks waiting to find out simply what kind of play this really is. Comedy or tragedy? The tone keeps shifting; you never know how it will end. Actually, the ending is the only weak point in the play - but that hardly matters, because it has been so riveting getting there. The language of the play fluctuates likewise. In the first half-hour all the parlance is so prosaically unadorned that one presumes this is a play Lope dashed off in a hurry (he wrote hundreds); and one misses the astonishingly rich utterance of, say, his Punishment without Revenge - shown at the Gate in 1990. Then, however, in the madhouse, both comedy and poetry suddenly flower. Though Floriano and Erifila fall in love with each other at once, each also assumes that the other is genuinely mad, and speaks aside in a stream of metaphors: 'a blank mind in a perfect form,' 'a cathedral without a roof,' 'a golden chalice filled with air when it could hold the purest wine,' 'I'm standing looking at a madman, knowing full well I would follow him to the ends of the earth.' The moon - which traditionally makes people luna-tic - is invoked every which way. 'Any woman would be the moon that inspired this man's madness,' 'Even the moon and stars stare at you, such is your beauty.' Doors open on to the brilliantly educated baroque view of the world. Floriano (whose assumed name is Orlando Furioso) and Erifila become Lancelot and Guinevere to each other ('How's Gawain?' 'Green with envy.') When Floriano is interrogated about love, he speaks with such fluent philosophical command that we are amazed, even though we know - unlike his audience onstage - that he is sane. David Johnston's prose translation underlines all the times when Lope's thought parallels Shakespeare's. Floriano reminds us of Edgar as poor Tom in Lear; and the play ends with the quip 'All the world's a madhouse - and all the men and women merely mad.' Laurence Boswell's staging, as always, gives us changing riches in the little upper room that is the Gate. Paul Russell's simple series of curtains is eloquently used to suggest the baroque layerings of this topsy-turvy mad/sane world; and Rae Smith's costumes combine period flavour with intense characterisation. At first it bothers you that Simon Kunz has none of the beauty to which every female onstage credits him, but his playing has the fervent integrity to make you suspend disbelief. Caroline Loncq negotiates both tragic and comic sides of Erifila's situation with great charm and skill. The production's only miscalculation is in making the doctor behave like a slapstick madman. This is the sixth play by Lope that I have seen. With each one, he appears a different and larger playwright, and more intoxicating; I shall soon have to start teaching myself Spanish. He makes theatre itself thrilling, even while he makes you see through it to the subject that he is dramatising so surely. I owe my introduction to four of these plays to Laurence Boswell's stagings at the Gate, and my gratitude, ever since the 1990 Punishment without Revenge, has been immense. Simply, these productions have been among the greatest boons of life in London. 'Madness in Valencia' starts its countrywide tour in Bournemouth on Jan 18 and ends in Valencia on March 2.

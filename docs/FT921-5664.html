			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Denmark to hold reverse auction THE Danish government is holding a reverse auction to buy up as much as DKr25bn of state variable interest bonds. The bonds have failed to live up to the intention that they should have a relatively stable price and be a liquid series, according to statement from Danmarks Nationalbank, the Danish central bank. Uncertainty about the price has reduced liquidity in the series and lessened their attractiveness to investors. The bonds that the authorities buy up will be annulled and replaced by other instrument, including Treasury bills. Tenders in the reverse auction must be made by March 9. The authorities will buy up bonds for a maximum of DKr25bn. Kreditforening Danmark (KD), one of the two big Danish bond-issuing mortgage credit associations, plans to raise supplementary capital of DKr3bn this month through a bond issue. This follows a change in the regulations, taking effect on January 1, which enables the associations to raise supplementary capital. KD is the first association to take the opportunity. The issue will be priced to give it a yield that is 1.50 points above the yield of the government benchmark 9 per cent bond maturing in 2000.</p>

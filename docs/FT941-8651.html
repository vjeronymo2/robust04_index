			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Wickes jumps to Pounds 18m and plans more stores Wickes, the DIY and timber retailer, said yesterday it would open 25 stores in each of the next three years, as it announced a five-fold increase in full-year profits before tax to Pounds 17.8m from a restated Pounds 3.46m last year. Mr Henry Sweetbaum, chairman, said the chain would expand from 82 stores to 150 by 1996. Some 19 stores will open in the UK this year, and 6 in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Mr Sweetbaum said he hoped to increase the number of openings outside the UK. Wickes has cut prices on 1,000 of its 3,700 lines with the aim of increasing volumes. Mr Sweetbaum said like-for-like sales increases for the last 8 weeks that were 'comfortably into double figures' suggested the strategy was working and consumer confidence was improving. Group turnover for the 1993 year increased from Pounds 548.4m to Pounds 608.5m; operating profits rose from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds 25.8m. Figures for the individual businesses will be published in the annual report next week, but Mr Sweetbaum said turnover in UK retailing increased 13 per cent, and pre-tax profits 19 per cent. Sales were up 10 per cent at Hunter Timber, which cut its loss to about Pounds 1.5m before interest. But Malden, Wickes' other timber business, continued to be squeezed by a weak market among small builders, and its deficit showed little change at about Pounds 4.5m. Wickes is merging the managements of the two businesses to cut costs and to develop a joint marketing strategy. Group borrowing has fallen from Pounds 73.2m to Pounds 10.1m, cutting gearing to 7 per cent, thanks to last year's Pounds 58.1m rights issue and a net cash inflow of Pounds 5m. Earnings rose from 0.8p to 4.2p, and the final dividend - reinstated after a two-year absence - is 0.8p, making a total of 1p. COMMENT Police had to be called to cope with the traffic as Wickes opened its second store in France yesterday - testimony, perhaps, to the strength of its format. With a limited, all own-label range, it has developed a loyal following among DIY enthusiasts and trade customers, and is sufficiently different from its competitors to be planning expansion in what is usually considered a saturated market. The timber operations, whose acquisition almost sunk the business three years ago, remain a concern, but the pick-up in the housing market and Wickes' cost-cutting efforts could bring an improvement this year. Current-year forecasts of about Pounds 32m put the shares on a multiple of 20 - a 15 per cent premium to the market, but one justified by Wickes' status as a strong recovery stock.</p>

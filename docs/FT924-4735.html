			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Arts: Savage myth in modern dress - Opera in Berne It is hard to believe that the new production in Berne of Siegfried Matthus's Judith is only the third time the opera has been staged since the sensational Komische Oper premiere in 1985. Based on Friedrich Hebbel's 1840 play about the Old Testament heroine, Judith is a natural repertory piece, combining the blood-lust of Elektra with the intensity of a psychological thriller. The music may not be particularly subtle or original, but it is sure of touch and free of affected modernisms. The two leading roles offer a magnificent challenge to a dramatic soprano and bass baritone, and the choral writing is powerful. Judith seems tailor-made for Josephine Barstow and English National Opera, who need look no further than this staging by Eike Gramss, director of the 1989 ENO production of another modern German classic, Reimann's Lear. Ever since Vivaldi, composers have seen the dramatic potential of Judith. A widow with a destructive longing for a mate, she saves her native Bethulia from extinction at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar's unconquerable general, Holofernes, by seducing him and chopping off his head. Matthus's opera has an extended finale, in which the victorious Bethulians rape and plunder as their enemies had done: nothing changes, the oppressed simply become the oppressors. It also has a feminist subtext: Holofernes is an ogre who proves his power by abusing women; Judith initially claims 'A woman is nothing'. When she finally realises her power by killing him, she is raped and rejected by the very society whose interests she served. Gramss and his designers, Werner Hutterli and Renate Schmitzer, presented Judith as a savage myth in modern dress. Holofernes, with tattoos visible beneath his string vest, could have been an Arab military commander or an urban guerrilla chief, with a voracious appetite for sadistic, sexual violence - the only area where this production went beyond the bounds of taste. Holofernes' men wore army fatigues, Nebuchadnezzar's arrogant messenger resembled an overfed lawyer. The besieged Bethulians were an anonymous 20th century crowd of Jews, trapped behind the shutters of a vast blood-red bulwark. The conflicts of the first act were emphasised by placing the protagonists on different levels, the lighting oscillating between the two just as the music does. The tension of the second act was superbly realised as Judith stalked her prey in a decollete red and black evening dress. Berne was lucky in its leading partnership. Holofernes could have been written for Monte Jaffe (well-remembered from ENO's Lear and Timon of Athens). He sang with steady, penetrating voice and used every limb and nerve to pierce the depths of this unpredictable human monster. Christa Ranacher captured Judith's do-or-die courage and erotic power, but the important top notes lacked the necessary brilliance and abandon. Carry Persson as Holofernes' cowering sidekick and Anita Herrmann as Judith's Maid gave strong support. The Berne chorus sang remarkably well. The weak link was Martin Fischer-Dieskau's conducting. While the solo contributions from piano, harp, bassoon and amplified bass guitar were sensitively handled, the tutti were undifferentiated and tempi were allowed to drift.</p>

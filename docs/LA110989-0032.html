			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HARVARD ROLLS TO WATER POLO PLAYOFF WIN  </P> <P> Brian Border and Eric Deutsch combined for 13 goals as Harvard High buried  Newbury Park, 27-4, in a first-round Southern Section 3-A Division water polo  playoff match Wednesday at Harvard.  </P> <P> The Saracens, who won the 2-A Division championship last season, led by as many  as 16 goals early in the third period before Coach Rich Corso emptied his  bench.  </P> <P> "Basically, it's the first step toward the championship," said Corso, whose  team improved to 25-4, including a 12-0 Del Rey League mark. "We can win it  all. I really believe it. The kids have got to keep on remaining positive and  keep faith in the system."  </P> <P> The Saracens were bumped up a division after winning the area's first water  polo title in seven years last season, but they hardly have appeared  overwhelmed by the improved competition. Harvard scored the game's first seven  goals, and, after a Newbury Park (6-13) score early in the second period,  rattled off the next 10 in a row. Newbury Park Coach Jack Doman was impressed.  </P> <P> It was suggested, in jest, that perhaps the 3-A Division was better off without  the fourth-seeded Saracens.  </P> <P> "The 4-A can have them," Doman said. "Next year the 4-A, and the next year the  world. It's an Olympic year, right?  </P> <P> "You get out, count all your fingers and your toes, and if they're all there .  . . I think they're No. 1, but we'll see."  </P> <P> Harvard will next play Fontana, a 7-6 first-round winner over Indio, on Friday.  </P></p>

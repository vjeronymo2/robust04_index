According to mining company officials, from January to  October of this year, Falconbridge brought in foreign revenue  amounting to $8,990,720, compared with a total of $34,797,705  for the same period of 1992.    They reported that firm executives plan to produce 70  million  pounds of nickel contained in ferronickel next year.    During the first 10 months of 1993, they said, nickel  exports  amounted to 43,579,4124 [as published] pounds, which production  was sold at an average per-pound price of $2.02.    In contrast, 49,591,422 pounds were exported during the same  period of last year at an average price of $3.20 per pound.    From March to October of this year, Falconbridge Dominicana  produced 40,916,441 pounds. It will be recalled that due to the  drop in price and demand on the international market, executives  decided to suspend operations on 26 December 1992, then resumed  them on 8 March.    During the first 10 months of 1992, Falconbridge produced  47,933,842 pounds. The estimated monthly average was 5.6 million  pounds.    From March to December of this year, the company planned to  produce 55 million pounds at a much lower cost than that  achieved during the final quarter of last year.    In 1992, production totaled 60.7 million pounds and 60.5  million pounds were sold abroad at an average per-pound price of  $3.14. A total of 70 million pounds was obtained during the  entire period and the government took in $46,641,773 for the  year.    Experts estimated that it is impossible to produce at a cost  of under $2.00 per pound, meaning that it will be necessary to  change policies if world prices drop below that price this  coming year.    Falconbridge maintains its policy of reducing costs in order  to continue operating, increase profits, and meet the region's  development programs, the experts said. It will be recalled that  in 1991, Falconbridge produced 64.1 million pounds of nickel and  exported 61 million pounds.    For the first time, the mining company reduced its  operations  by 50 percent on 7 October 1991, a situation that continued  until late February 1992 due to the drop in prices and demand.  By that time, prices ranged between $3.23 and $3.29.    Meanwhile, production remained halted throughout almost all  of August as the result of an effort to reduce the supply on  hand.    Company experts attribute the drop in prices and demand on  the international market to the current overproduction since the  former Soviet bloc countries have become exporters.</p>

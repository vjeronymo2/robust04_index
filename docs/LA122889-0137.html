			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> POLICE GET RAISE BUT AREN'T SATISFIED  </P> <P> Officers and other employees of the Police Department received a 5.4% salary  increase Wednesday under a new, one-year contract that was praised by city  officials but approved reluctantly by police representatives.  </P> <P> Police had sought an increase of 9%, according to Arl Farris, president of the  police officers' association, while the city originally offered 2%.  </P> <P> "Our pay is at the bottom end of the county, and we don't feel our performance  is at the bottom end of the county," Farris said.  </P> <P> City Manager Robert C. Dunek said that the City Council was pleased with the  department's performance and that the salaries agreed upon are a reflection of  what the city can afford.  </P> <P> "The council is proud of what the police do in this city," Dunek said.  </P> <P> The contract, formally approved Tuesday night, covers the period between Nov. 5  and Oct. 30, 1990. The council had met in closed sessions during the last  several meetings to hammer out the new contract.  </P> <P> Police officer salaries will range from $31,968 to $39,264 a year under the new  contract. The old range was $30,324 to $37,248 annually.  </P> <P> The salary range for chief of police will be $56,916 to $72,900 under the new  terms. The old range was $53,729 to $70,044.  </P> <P> Farris noted Wednesday that association members approved the settlement by the  narrowest of margins earlier this month. KATHIE BOZANICH  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> PACIFIC LEAGUE  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley  </P> <P> COACH: Tony Zarrillo, 2nd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 12-13; tied for 3rd at 8-7  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: After a sluggish start, the Falcons came on strongly and made  the playoffs last season. That momentum could continue if oft-injured Shane  Cowsill, who pitches and plays first base, can remain healthy. Despite a  spectacular sophomore season in which he drove in 39 runs, Cowsill tailed off  and hit .293 last year. Eric Berger, a right-handed senior, also will pitch and  play several infield positions. The pitching staff includes Brian McBride and  left-hander Henry Fernandez and is coached by ex-minor leaguer Steve Rousey.  "He's done wonders with our kids," Zarrillo said of Rousey. Defensive  specialist Ernie Diaz will play second and Mike Johnson, a rangy senior, will  start at shortstop. Fernandez will help out at first. Crescenta Valley's  outfield is green but includes speedy Damon Martin and Scott Anderson, the most  valuable junior varsity player last season.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Things might be looking up for the Falcons. Said Zarrillo: "We're  deeper than last year and we're a better hitting team than last year -- with  only two kids over .300, you don't have to go too far. . . We're going to try  to steal more, take the extra base."  </P> <P> Glendale  </P> <P> COACH: Chris Axelgard, 3rd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 10-12-1; 4th in league at 5-10  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Glendale, which boasts 11 seniors, has no shortage of  experienced players. A sub-.500 season last year leaves some doubt about the  players' ability to win, however. "Having experience and experience winning are  two different things," Axelgard said. Brent Overfelt, a three-year starter who  will play third, center field and pitch, is perhaps the Dynamiters' most  versatile player. Catcher Jon Strauss and right fielder Marco Rivas also have  played three seasons of varsity ball. Sophomore John Aguilar, who moved from  left field, will play shortstop. "He's a very hard worker," Axelgard said. "He  doesn't have a lot of all-out speed, but he reacts to the ball well." Bill Kirk  was promoted from the junior varsity to play first, and Mike Thomas will play  second. Lance Evans, a transfer from Burroughs, will play third and pitch. When  he is not pitching, Danny Gray will play center field. Gray, the top man in the  rotation, throws heat but has also honed his curve during the winter. Curtis  Jung, a hard-throwing right-handed senior, will also pitch, but he has been  bothered recently by a sore shoulder.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Axelgard has a soft spot for this team. "I came in with this class, so  it's an exciting thing," he said. The Dynamiters are short on power, Axelgard  adds, but long on savvy. They will need some know-how to weather March --  Glendale begins with eight consecutive away games and will not play at home  until March 27.  </P> <P> Hoover  </P> <P> COACH: Bob Cooper, 15th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 13-8; tied for 3rd at 8-7  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Returning for his final season is standout first baseman  Mickey Moreno, who has started for the past three seasons and is the class of  the league at his position. Moreno batted .476 last season with 22 RBIs, nine  doubles and four home runs. Other impact players include shortstop Bryan Day,  third baseman Jose Robles and pitcher Kevin Deitch. Day is strong on defense  and Robles batted .297 -- second highest among returning players. Deitch, a  right- handed sophomore, relies on a wicked curve to frustrate batters. Fellow  sophomore right-hander Young Park joins Deitch on the pitching staff as do Jose  Gonzalez, Mike Evans and left-handers Ernie Zavala and Rob Walley. Walley might  be a pleasant surprise. "He reminds me of (Philadelphia Phillies pitcher) Wally  Ritchie," said Cooper, who coached Ritchie at Hoover. Cesar Covarrubias moves  up from the junior varsity to catch.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Hoover has a deep pitching staff but is otherwise green. The Tornadoes  might have some power, however. "We've got some bigger kids," Cooper said.  "Maybe we'll eventually catch up with those Arcadia kids. We're always the  smallest team."  </P></p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Letter: Simple answers to restraining wage growth Sir, I refer to Professors Layard and Bean's personal views ('Shut the stable door', November 4). I do not feel competent to argue about the macro-economics of wage push inflation and stop-go history, and do not propose to do so. If, however, one is looking for a simple policy to restrain pay growth, then I suggest that it is easier to get general agreement and effective action about the timing of increases rather than about their size. Why not have a generally agreed recommendation, or guideline, to postpone all increases whenever they come up by three months without any backdating. In a situation of low inflation this delaying would not cause hardship and need not call for any complicated policing, but would have an important effect. In a year, one could, perhaps, look afresh at the situation created and possible improvements to the simple process of modifying the intervals between settlements.

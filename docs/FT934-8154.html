			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / More pass in vocational courses PUPILS taking vocational qualifications, which assess practical skills such as dressmaking and photography, obtained superior results to those taking academic subjects, the government's league tables show. At Marshalls Park School in Romford, Essex, for example, all 232 of the school's 15-year-olds were entered for GCSE examinations and the City &amp; Guilds Diploma of Vocational Education (Foundation). Twenty eight per cent achieved five or more grades at GCSE while 93 per cent achieved their vocational qualification. Mr Cedrick Hendricks, headmaster of the comprehensive school, said: 'It is not that vocational qualifications are easier than academic ones. They are just different. 'The vocational qualification, which is an umbrella qualification, is made up of several units in subjects like law, technology and administration. 'Some of these units can be achieved after six or seven-week courses. It can be easier to motivate students on these shorter courses, which may, for example, include visits to the law courts. In addition it is easier for teachers to make sure that pupils are on target.' Vocational qualifications, which assess a person's practical competence to do a task, have been offered in a small number of schools for some years. They have long been regarded by parents and employers, however, as a poor relation to academic qualifications. This is a perception which the government is seeking to change. For example, General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs) are being offered to students older than 16 in England and Wales as a vocational equivalent to A-levels. National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) are available for people in work. Both parents and employers have expressed anxiety about the new qualifications. Mr Hendricks said when two years ago his school decided to offer vocational qualifications there was resistance from parents. Mr Hendricks said parents were starting to see their validity. 'They see that there is a certificate of achievement and that it can contribute towards a further qualification.' Less than 10 per cent of the 5,200 schools in England and Wales offered vocational qualifications in 1993 - with numbers varying from all the pupils in a school to just one or two. The schools with most entrants were Marshalls Park School, Knutsford High School in Cheshire, Thomas Bennett Community College in Tilgate, West Sussex, and Moseley School, West Midlands. The two awarding bodies for pre-16-year-olds are BTEC and City &amp; Guilds. The organisations have different origins and are technically in competition with each other. BTEC is newer than City &amp; Guilds, which has its origins in the livery companies that provided training for artisans and craftsmen.</p>

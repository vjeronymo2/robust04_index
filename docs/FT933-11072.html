			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / UN probes torture claim THE United Nations last night ordered an immediate inquiry into charges by a London-based rights group that UN troops in Somalia killed and tortured civilians and little was done to discipline the offenders, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, said the allegations by Africa Rights, part of a prestigious group that includes Helsinki Watch, were being taken 'very seriously.' The report was transmitted to Admiral Jonathan Howe, his representative in Mogadishu, who was already discussing the question with General Cevik Bir, the UN force commander, and other military officers. There have been persistent charges of UN excesses from other quarters, and a publc row with General Bruno Loi, commander of the Italian contingent, led to a demand by New York that he be sent home. Italy, Germany and Ireland responded by calling for a thorough re-examination of the UN role in Somalia but this has yet to be done. Africa Rights asserted that UN actions had earned the hatred of the very people the troops were sent to help and that Admiral Howe, an American, was considered by them to be 'another warlord.' The report alleged that Pakistani troops machine-gunned demonstrators in Mogadishu last month and that an 850-strong Belgian contingent in Kismayu was especially brutal, dragging a Somali through the streets behind a military vehicle and hitching the body of another to a tank. In another incident, the Belgians were said to have driven off field workers with machine gun fire and then to have stolen an entire crop of melons.</p>

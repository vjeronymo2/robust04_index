			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Brierley Investments up 18.6% to NZDollars 251m BRIERLEY Investments, the New Zealand investment holding company, reported an 18.6 per cent increase in net profit to NZDollars 251.1m (USDollars 135.3m) for the year to June 30, compared with NZDollars 211.7m last year. Mr Paul Collins, chief executive, forecast the company would show a similar improvement in the current year and would be helped by improving fortunes from its its main investment, UK hotel group Mount Charlotte. Directors said the latest advance was largely due to a substantial rise in operating earnings in New Zealand and lower interest and overhead costs. Interest charges fell 44 per cent to NZDollars 171m (NZDollars 308m) due to lower debt levels and interest rates. But the directors pointed out that good results from Air New Zealand and Carter Holt Harvey were offset by losses from Ariadne Australia and Magnum. The figures included write-offs of NZDollars 72m for Magnum, NZDollars 44m for Ariadne Australia, and NZDollars 20m for New Zealand properties that are to be sold. Operating profit before tax and minorities rose 17 per cent to NZDollars 354.8m (NZDollars 303.7m). New Zealand-controlled companies produced a combined profit of NZDollars 73m (nil last year), and directors expect another strong contribution this year. Mount Charlotte made a loss of NZDollars 6m, against a profit of NZDollars 78m last year. The UK contribution was NZDollars 321.1m (NZDollars 452.5m) which included a profit of NZDollars 160m on the sale of UK motor group Tozer Kemsley and Millbourn. A NZDollars 33.4m loss was incurred in Australia after the decision to write off the NZDollars 44m investment in Ariadne. Investments in W D and H O Wills and the 93 per cent shareholding in Australian Consolidated Investments did not produce revenue. Directors are proposing a final dividend of 5 cents a share, making an unchanged 9 cents for the year.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Trading concentrates on telecoms as Nikkei rises ARBITRAGE-linked trading dominated activity and share prices followed the futures market, closing higher in thin volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 89.61 at 20,521.45, finishing above the 20,500 level for the first time since August 16. The index fluctuated between 20,542.35 and 20,412.24 on technical trading as most investors remained on the sidelines. Volume was 200m shares, against 172m on Tuesday, as advances led declines by 553 to 368, with 231 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.96 to 1,649.27 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.91 to 1,261.40. Some investors were wary ahead of the last trading day for August delivery today. Many market participants were also discouraged by the June diffusion index, the leading indicator for the economy, which fell below the critical 50 per cent level for the second consecutive month. Trading concentrated on telecommunication-related issues following the successful auction on Tuesday for DDI, a new long distance telecom company. The public offer price, the weighted average of the successful auction bids, was fixed at Y3.7m. Short-term trading of DDI related issues is expected to heighten ahead of DDI's listing on the TSE's second section on September 3. Kyocera, DDI's leading shareholder, moved forward Y20 to Y6,180. Dealers bought Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which rose Y5,000 to Y938,000, while Fujitsu put on Y11 at Y791. Banks were higher on bargain hunting. The sector had lost ground following the yen's rise, which had depressed hopes of a cut in the official discount rate. Industrial Bank of Japan advanced Y50 to Y3,390 and Mitsubishi Bank appreciated Y50 to Y2,900. Housing-related shares were bought on reports that interest rates on housing loans will fall in October following the cuts in short and long-term prime lending rates by commercial banks. Mitsui Fudosan improved Y10 to Y1,320 and Daikyo Y30 to Y1,290. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 71.64 higher at 22,459.27 in volume of 39.1m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, advanced Y240 to Y10,100. Roundup WALL STREET'S overnight gains did relatively little for the Pacific Rim. AUSTRALIA crept lower, the All Ordinaries index finishing 1.6 off at 1,922.6 as turnover rose from ADollars 408m to ADollars 434m. News Corp slipped 13 cents to ADollars 9.32 as its 72 per cent jump in net profits was described as below expectations. Caltex Australia, the petroleum refiner and marketer, closed 13 cents ahead at ADollars 2.59 after its half-year results pleased oil analysts. NEW ZEALAND saw another big business but the NZSE-40 index subsided by 18.79 to 1,984.08 as investor worries about industrial relations at Telecom, and profit-taking in Brierley, weakened the two key stocks. Telecom receded 9 cents to NZDollars 3.97 and Brierley dipped 5 cents to NZDollars 1.15. Turnover came to NZDollars 68m. HONG KONG fell on worse than expected profits for airline Cathay Pacific, weakness in property shares, and fut-ures linked trade. The Hang Seng index shed 62.10 to 7,265.58 in its fourth straight decline. Cathay's 46 per cent drop in first-half profits left it 40 cents lower at HKDollars 10. Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties lost HKDollars 1.25 at HKDollars 36.25 after Tuesday's major bank decision to tighten mortgage lending. SEOUL's composite index fell a further 9.93 to 705.10, investors staying away as brokers said economic fundamentals were weak. Turnover shrank from Won298bn to Won253bn. KARACHI finished lower on selling by short-term operators and the absence of institutional buying, the KSE index sliding 14.31 to 1,325.35. SINGAPORE approached its all-time high again, the Straits Times Industrial index ending 21.22 up at 1,976.09. Kay Hian James Capel rose sharply on expectation that the stock-broker will do better in the second half, after a very good set of interim results, as the market's bull run continues: the registered shares added 11 cents at SDollars 1.61. KUALA LUMPUR was mixed but property issue Lion Land saw strong afternoon buying on renewed talk of a timber deal. The KLSE composite index edged up 0.25 to 805.72 as Lion climbed 58 cents to MDollars 4.12 in 18.4m volume on a strong rumour linking it with Sabah Forest. BANGKOK advanced on late buying of banks and small finance companies, the SET index finishing 8.50 ahead at 952.33 in turnover up from Bt5bn to Bt5.4bn. JAKARTA hit another year's high as the JKSE index rose 4.86 to 398.49 on strength in the banking and manufacturing sectors.</p>

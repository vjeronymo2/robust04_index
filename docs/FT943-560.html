			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: GTE agrees Mexican telephone venture GTE, the US telephone company, has agreed to form a joint venture with GF Bancomer, Mexico's second largest financial group, and VISA, a large industrial holding company, to provide telecommunications services in Mexico. The three companies have signed a letter of intent to form a company that plans to apply for a long-distance telephone licence. The long-distance monopoly enjoyed by Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's national carrier, expires in 1997, and Mexico's ministry of transport and communications is expected to publish the regulations governing the concession of new long-distance licences in the near future. GTE joins MCI and Sprint, the two US long-distance carriers, in forming joint ventures with Mexican partners to provide long-distance services from 1997. MCI has formed an alliance with GF Banacci, Mexico's largest bank, and Sprint with Iusacell, Mexico's largest non-Telmex cellular company.</p>

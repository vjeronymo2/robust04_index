			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> 2 TO BE NAMED FOR JORDAN RANCH TALKS  </P> <P> The Simi Valley City Council on Monday is scheduled to appoint two of its  members to meet with Thousand Oaks officials to discuss which of the two cities  is the more logical choice to annex entertainer Bob Hope's Jordan Ranch.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the Thousand Oaks City Council voted to delegate Councilmen  Lawrence E. Horner and Frank Schillo to meet with Simi Valley officials.  </P> <P> Bob Heitzman, Simi Valley deputy city manager, said Friday that no dates have  been set for talks.  </P> <P> The Simi Valley City Council voted July 30 to ask county planners if annexation  of Hope's Jordan Ranch is feasible for the city, but Mayor Greg Stratton has  suggested that it might be more practical for nearby Thousand Oaks to annex the  2,308-acre parcel because it could more easily provide services for the planned  750-unit housing development and golf course.  </P> <P> The city of Simi Valley is separated from the ranch by a series of hills to the  south, which would make it difficult for the city to provide services to the  area, considered essential for annexation.  </P> <P> In addition to his Jordan Ranch property, Hope has asked the city of Simi  Valley to annex 3,495 acres of his Runkle Ranch property to the northeast.  </P> <P> Hope officials said the Simi Valley annexation proposal was prompted by  concerns that the Ventura County Board of Supervisors would reject the Jordan  Ranch development project.

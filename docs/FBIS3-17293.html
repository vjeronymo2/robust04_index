			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maia Gogoladze: "Centrist Forces Have No </F> Alternative But To Unite...."; passages between slantlines  published in boldface]    [Excerpts] Nodar Natadze [chairman of the Georgian  Popular Front]: "A centrist position does not mean standing  between those on the right and those on the left, between one  extreme and the other. A centrist position is one that views  the central question of the construction of the state."    Irakli Shengelaia [leader of the Christian-Democratic Party  (CDP]): "The chief characteristic feature of a centrist force,  apart from political tactics, is political language. A centrist  never operates using such concepts as `traitor to the nation,'  `agent,' and `turncoat.'"    Davit Berdzenishvili [leading member of the Republican  Party]: "The democratic center is creating more problems today  for Georgia's leadership than the radically-minded wing."    Tedo Paatashvili [leader of "Charter-91"]: "In a war  situation, the country's political center cannot be viewed as  the center according to the traditional meaning of this word.  The situation that has taken shape in the country is definitely  pushing it toward radicalis. [Passage omitted]    As can be seen, new elections are not far off. Probably, the  most well-defined centrist forces are the Republican Party and  the Popular Front that will again contest the elections  together. Realistically speaking, however, there are four  forces amongst whom seats will be distributed at Georgia's  future elections. These forces are: The Union of Georgia's  Citizens [led by Shevardnadze], the Liberal-Conservative  coalition, the Republican Party, and the National-Democratic  Party [NDP].    The Republican Party is today creating serious problems for  Shevardnadze's government. It is opposing the latter more  fiercely than the radically-minded wing. Davit Berdzenishvili,  one of the leaders of the Republican Party, explains the  mechanism that has come to power today as follows: "After 9  April [1989, when Soviet soldiers forcibly dispersed a peaceful  demonstration killing some 20 civilians], opposition to the  communist regime was conducted in the name of Gamsakhurdia. The  communist regime in those republics of the former Soviet Union  where it was impossible for the Communist Party to remain in  power gave way to such forces that were unable to govern the  country and, following their collapse, a transformed communist  nomenklatura assumed the reins of power. It was not possible  for such a scenario to be played out in the Baltic states, but  it was implemented with great success in Georgia. Therefore,  the fresh victory for Brazauskas does not signify the  strengthening of the pro-Russian orientation in Lithuania.  However, Shevardnadze's arrival in power in Georgia means  precisely this. Moreover, he has confirmed this by his own  actions."  It could not happen in Lithuania because of the strength  of the democratic centrist wing and the existence of social  strata supporting it. Reform really got started there and the  principles of a market economy were put into action. The  country gradually distanced itself from Russia and integrated  itself with the West. Therefore, both the success of Brazauskas  in Lithuania and the success of leftist forces based on the  former Communist Party in Poland in no way create a threat to  the sovereignty of these countries. As regards their foreign  policy and relations with Russia, they are as principled as,  say, Walesa and Landsbergis were.    Events in Georgia have developed differently. Centrist  forces and the social strata supporting them are in the process  of being formed. The political spectrum is now being cleansed  and extended. From this point of view, the creation of the Union  of Georgia's Citizens has fulfilled a certain positive role.  The Republican Party assesses this event as a normal political  process.    Davit Berdzenishvili: "The creation of a political  organization around the figure of the head of state will  contribute to the cleansing of the political spectrum.  Belonging to such a political organization, which, to all  intents and purposes, is leading the country, determining cadres  policy, has a monopoly on the mass media, and has brought the  youth movement under its influence, places certain  responsibilities upon its members. If the Shevardnadze factor  were to lose its appeal tomorrow, a certain number of his  supporters would follow him. Such is the logic of the political  process. It is only unfortunate that a large number of the  leaders of our (?student) movement [word indistinct] nourished  in both the material and political sense of this word. It is  some consolation that this does not apply to everyone."    The creation of the Liberal-Conservative coalition has also  contributed to the tidying-up of the political spectrum. The  coalition views itself as a centrist formation, although it is  difficult to say how centrist the Merab Kostava Society is,  which is part of the coalition. The Republican Party does not  view the coalition as belonging to the center although it  recognizes that the organizations within it -- the Ilia  Chavchavadze Society and "Charter-91" -- clearly manifest  centrist tendencies. The Union of Traditionalists, however,  will not oppose the center. The view exists that the  "coalition" will form itself as the right wing. It is not  excluded that this political union will split into two.    As always, the political steps taken by the NDP are  interesting and original. The National-Democrats expressed the  wish that the NDP declare itself as a centrist organization.  They have said several times that the NDP occupies the center  of the political spectrum. It is clear to everyone that the  NDP, given the mentality, tactics, and political language and  skills that characterize it, will never attach itself to the  center. This party's situation will be quite complex at the  next elections. The NDP is not detached from the Shevardnadze  factor. Naturally, the NDP will try to appear as an independent  political force and it will try, during the election campaign,  to use those steps that the party took to disassociate itself  clearly from Shevardnadze's policy. During the last few months,  the National-Democrats have been less active in Parliament and  Giorgi Chanturia himself appears as the party's leader.  [sentence as published] This is probably a tactical step. As  can be seen, the National-Democrats want to preserve their  equilibrium before the new elections. They will try to ensure  that the NDP is not perceived as the alternative to Shevardnadze  so as not to inflict a major blow upon themselves. However, at  the same time, it is not in their interests to appear once more  in the role of the young friends of the central figure, Eduard  Shevardnadze.    If a change of positions and partners is not alien to the  National-Democrats, they could propose the next metamorphosis to  their own electorate after the new elections. In general, as my  respected colleague would have said, the NDP and its leader (we  will not specify which) are amazingly principled and aggressive  in their lack of principle. Therefore, it will be quite  difficult for the electorate to trust this party and its leaders.    The CDP was formed as a centrist force. It is centrist both  in its mentality and tactics and in its attitude toward key  questions concerning the construction of the state. It is  another question how effective this force is. There is no doubt  that the efficiency of centrist forces would have doubled, if  they had united in a form acceptable to each one of them. The  CDP leader Irakli Shengelaia does not deny that a weakness of  these forces is their fragmentation. There is almost no  question on which the CDP and the Republican Party would not be  able to reach a consensus. Batoni Irakli Shengelaia says that  they have to move toward one another. It would be better if  these steps were taken right now.    The attitude of the Union of Traditionalists toward centrism  is very interesting. It is difficult for us to deny that this  political force is not centrist in its origins. However, it is  also difficult to deny that the Traditionalists' wing is,  according to its tactics, almost moderate policies, and  constructivism, satisfying a whole number of serious demands of  the center.    "Charter-91" is clearly perceived by the Georgian political  spectrum as a centrist-oriented political organization. This  organization has more than once been given the chance to affirm  its centrist reputation. However, Tedo Paatashvili, the leader  of "Charter-91," believes that, in a war situation, the  country's political center is permitted to manifest a certain  radicalism.  The fragmentation of centrist forces in Georgia has its  internal logic and is due not only to subjective reasons. The  self-declared center is more radical than forces that are  recognized as being radical and is creating far more problems  for the authorities than the latter. Certain right-wing forces  are displaying moderation and the desire to cooperate of which  the center is envious. The centrist forces differ according to  their political origins, mentality, and world outlook; they also  differ according to their attitude toward a whole number of  questions concerning the construction of the state. In spite of  everything, there is probably no alternative to the unification  of centrist forces. The future of the country depends on these  forces as there are no other reformist-minded forces in Georgia.  There centrist reformist forces have a single social base, more  precisely, the embryo of a social base -- business circles that,  no matter by what means they have collected their capital, are  in need of assistance and protection as far as their own  financial and economic activities are concerned.    As regards the elections, it is very difficult to make  any forecasts concerning the Georgian population. However, one  thing can be said without difficulty: The centrist forces will  have a future provided they realistically propose something to  the electorate and show that their own activities hold some  prospects.</p>

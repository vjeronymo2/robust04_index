			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BALBOA FIRE KILLS WOMAN  </P> <P> A 57-year-old woman was found dead in her bed early Monday after a fire swept  through the maid's quarters of a Balboa Island home, authorities said.  </P> <P> The woman, Law Kwui Ching, was a housekeeper who occupied separate living  quarters in a home at 608 S. Bay Front, Newport Beach fire officials said. The  owners of the house live in Los Angeles and were not at the home when the fire  occurred, about 5 a.m.  </P> <P> Investigators said the blaze appeared to have started accidently, caused by  either cooking utensils or candles. Damage to the home was estimated at  $140,000, mostly from smoke.  </P> <P> Dr. Daniel Stringer, who lives across the street from the residence, said he  was awakened by the screams of a neighbor who saw the flames. Stinger said  Ching had come from Hong Kong about 20 years ago.  </P> <P> Although a cause of death has not been determined, authorities said it is  likely she died of smoke inhalation.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bela Kadar, Hungarian minister for international </F> economic relations: "A Few More Obstacles Have To be Overcome  Along The Long Road Toward The European Union"]    [Text] Hungary, situated between the East and the West,  has had an economic, political, and cultural relationship with  Western Europe for centuries. After World War II, the Yalta  accord determined the country's economic direction -- two thirds  of Hungarian trade went to the CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic  Assistance] countries. No impulses for economic development  were to be expected from these countries. The turnabout came in  1989. Hungary's opening toward the world economy, to be seen as  a shift in the fulcrum of its foreign trade, was, together with  the change in political regime and economic system, one of the  cornerstones of a comprehensive systemic transformation.    One illustration of the success of this transformation is  the  fact that between 1989 and 1993, Hungarian exports to the  countries of the European Union [EU] rose from 24 to 47 percent.  At the same time, the involvement of Austria and the  Scandinavian countries in Hungarian foreign trade rose from 6 to  12 percent. In 1995, about 60 percent of Hungary's exports will  go to the European Union.    Forty-three percent of the $7 billion that has been invested  in Hungary comes for the European Union. EFTA countries that  are waiting for EU membership have invested 14 percent. These  countries provide more than 70 percent of Hungary's tourist  income and 90 percent of the income we earn from other services,  and they permit us to finance over 50 percent of our debt  repayments. These figures show that Hungary is already closely  integrated with Europe.    It was not easy to leave behind the restrictions of CEMA and  join the rest of Europe. It was a difficult road. The most  important milestones along this road were: The establishment of  diplomatic relations between Hungary and the European Union in  1988; the first comprehensive accord on trade and economic  cooperation, otherwise known as PHARE [Economic Reconstruction  Aid for Poland and Hungary], designed to promote the economic  restructuring of Poland and Hungary and concluded in Brussels on  16 December 1991; and the treaty on associate member status with  the European Union that came into force on 1 February 1994.    Following a resolution by the Hungarian parliament, Hungary  submitted its application for full EU membership on 1 April  1994. In accordance with an already-established schedule of  Hungary's European strategy, there will be a government-level  conference in 1996 in order to decide on the European Union's  future geographic expansion. Only after this decision has been  reached can negotiations on Hungary's full EU membership  commence in 1997.    Hungary's road of re-integration with Europe can be divided  into clear stages. The period between the end of 1989 and the  end of 1993 marked the most difficult stage of transforming the  economy. Over 90 percent of prices and imports were released  from control, the number of private enterprises quadrupled, the  private sector's involvement in Hungary's GNP rose to over 50  percent, and the forint achieved partial convertibility. All  these are clear signs of the Hungarian economy's world market  maturity and its openness in this direction.    Between 1994 and 1996, Hungary's European strategy will  release the country from the last shackles of the  state-controlled system and prepare it for the EU negotiations.  Between 1997 and 1999, the prerequisites for EU membership will  be created. The democratic rights that are enshrined in the  Hungarian Constitution and the implementation of these rights  already conform to the political conditions of the European  Treaty and the 1993 Copenhagen Resolution.    Hungary is now faced with the difficult task of adapting its  legislation and its rules governing finance, environmental  protection, health protection, and technology to EU norms. A  particularly difficult task will be the subsequent fulfillment  of the macroeconomic conditions of the Maastricht treaty  regarding inflation, budget equilibrium, and the national debt.  These objectives can be attained if the economy picks up in  1996 and economic growth exceeds the EU average. Thus, our  country will be ready for the EU talks by 1997, and ready to  become a member by 2000.    The inevitable difficulties and sacrifices caused by this  process can be alleviated by new forms of cooperation that will  arise during the period preceding full EU membership. These  forms of cooperate could contribute to an acceleration of  Hungary's economic growth, recovery, and adaptation. But  Hungary's membership of the European Union represents no burden  and sacrifice on the part of existing members; instead, it  represents a dowry. In economics, politics, and security,  European interests, even international interests, involve the  need to show that the path of comprehensive systemic change is  justifiable.    Hungary has a good chance of presenting the first successful  transformation for everyone to see. This is also a major  impulse for the remaining countries in the region. Full EU  membership permits EU enterprises to avail themselves of  Hungary's historic role of mediator in Eastern and Central  Europe in order to develop relations even further. The 20,000  foreign enterprises in Hungary and 1,500 Hungarian joint  ventures in the neighboring countries also encourage closer  links with Western Europe in this region.    Over the past four years, Hungary has become an  extraordinarily extensive market for Western European goods, a  market that is still expanding. The capital investments that  have been made so far clearly show that Hungary has become a  very attractive industrial location in the new European Economic  Area on account of the progress in free trade, its qualified and  cheap manpower, and the motivation of its work forces.</p>

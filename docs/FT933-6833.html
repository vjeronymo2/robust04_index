			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: US farmers help Deere earnings top Dollars 100m EARNINGS of Deere and Company, the US agricultural equipment manufacturer, surged in the third quarter amid signs that confidence is returning in the North American agricultural economy. Deere said retail sales of combine harvesters and tractors continued to improve in spite of record rains in the US midwest and drought in parts of the south-east. US farmers, who have been conservative about new equipment purchases because of their cautious outlook on the economy, have excellent prospects in much of the country, said Mr Hans Becherer, chairman. As well as strong agricultural sales, Mr Becherer said heavy rainfall and improving economic conditions boosted demand for Deere's lawncare equipment, while increases in housing starts and higher public construction expenditures in the US are also expected to benefit the company's industrial sales. However, he said overseas demand for Deere agricultural equipment is expected to remain weak. Deere's third-quarter earnings surged to Dollars 100.1m, or Dollars 1.31 a share, compared with Dollars 9.1m, or 12 cents, in the third quarter of 1992. In the quarter, Deere's North American sales of all equipment products rose 26 per cent to Dollars 1.3bn, compared with Dollars 1bn in the third quarter of 1992. Overseas sales rose 2 per cent to Dollars 436m. Net worldwide sales were Dollars 2.05bn, up from Dollars 1.75bn. Sales of agricultural equipment rose 16 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn, industrial equipment sales were up 27 per cent to Dollars 396m and lawn and grounds care equipment sales rose 24 per cent to Dollars 240m. Before an Dollars 80m restructuring charge taken in the second quarter to reduce the European operations, worldwide net income for the first nine months ended July was Dollars 182.7m, or Dollars 2.39 a share. This compares with last year's Dollars 33.2m, or 44 cents.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Costs threaten 'free' banking: Current account charges may be reinstated to pay Pounds 4.5bn clearing bill BANKS have moved a step closer to the reintroduction of charges on personal customers' accounts with the discovery that the cash and cheque clearing system is costing them Pounds 4.5bn a year. The figure was worked out by the Association for Payment Clearing Services during an industry-wide review started by the banks last year. It is the first time the banks have managed to quantify the cost of clearing. In the past, the clearing system was subsidised by banks earning interest on customers' funds, but banks are now considering reintroducing charges, even on personal accounts that are in credit, in order to cover their overheads. Since late 1985, the big four English clearing banks have all provided free banking to customers who keep their current accounts in credit. Other banks, including Co-operative Bank and Scottish banks, had already followed the same policy. The study of clearing costs will also give added impetus to banks' efforts to cut the number of branches and staff. Cost reduction is one component of attempts to raise operating profits to compensate for lending losses in the 1980s. Three cheque and credit clearing companies operate different types of clearing services under Apacs. Some 21 banks participate directly in these operating companies, while hundreds of other institutions have access to clearing through them. The Pounds 4.5bn figure is disclosed in Apacs' annual report, which also says that banks and building societies contained the rise in credit card fraud to 10 per cent in 1992. They lost Pounds 165.6m to fraud in 1991, up 35 per cent on 1990. The volume and value of lower-value cheques passing through the clearing system in 1992 fell for the second year running after many years of growth. The value of cleared cheques fell 3 per cent to Pounds 4.18bn a day, and volume fell 4 per cent to 8.6m. The volume of transactions passing through the banks' Bacs system for bulk electronic clearing rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 1.8bn, while there was a 12 per cent rise in volume in the Chaps system for high-value credit clearing. The Apacs review is still under way, and banks will decide on strategies after receiving the full results. Mr Dick Allen, Apacs chief executive, says in the Apacs annual report that cost reduction 'is a high priority'. The banks started the review to take account of changes in banking services including the growth of telephone banking.</p>

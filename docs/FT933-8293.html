			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Gooda Walker Names fail to heed cash call LESS THAN 7 per cent of the money owed by Names on the worst-affected syndicates at the Lloyd's of London insurance market had been paid by a deadline which expired yesterday. Less than Pounds 10m of the Pounds 154m demanded from the members of the Gooda Walker syndicates in mid-June had been received by the end of Monday afternoon - an indication of the financial difficulties many of the Names face. The cash call affected the 4,500 Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite the market - on Gooda Walker syndicates 164, 290, 295, 296, 298, 299 and 387. Mr Ken Randall, a director of GW Run Off, the agency supervising the affairs of the seven stricken syndicates, estimated that only Pounds 5m to Pounds 10m had been received. But he played down the significance of the shortfall, stressing that previous cash calls had also taken some time to collect. He said: 'We have had several millions come in today, but I would not expect it to be coming in by the bucket-full.' Mr Randall said he would only become worried if GW Run Off had not received 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the cash calls within two months. He said slow repayment reflected the fact that earlier demands from the syndicates had absorbed the more liquid funds of Names, who needed more time to realise their remaining assets. The June demand came on top of five previous cash calls between July 1991 and February this year, totalling Pounds 639m, from losses in previous underwriting years dating back as far as 1983. He said that only Pounds 51m remained outstanding from these calls. After appeals for more time to pay, the deadline for the latest call was extended from the end of July until mid-August. The amount demanded was also reduced slightly from Pounds 157m to Pounds 154m. Those who have not met their cash calls by yesterday can expect to be charged 2 per cent interest above bank base rates on the amounts outstanding.</p>

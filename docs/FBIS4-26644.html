			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, June 24 (XINHUA) -- North-east China's  Liaoning Province, one of the most industrialized areas of  China, is trying to restructure its economy, aiming to pull  ahead of others again in the economic field.    Wen Shizhen, acting governor of the province, said that  Liaoning is mapping out a blueprint to revitalize its  state-owned economic sector and bring another economic boom to  the former industrial leader of China.    Liaoning, with a population topping 40 million, has more  than  1,260 state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, accounting  for one-tenth of the nation's total. These enterprises have  given great help to the country during past decades.    But due to long-term running under a tightly planned  economy,  most of them have problems adjusting themselves to the demands  of the market economy which China is implementing. Still worse,  an economic boom is hindered by outdated equipment and means of  production.    The acting governor said that the province is making  vigorous  efforts to restructure its economy. The state-owned sector is  being revived and new economic sectors, including private firms,  rural enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises, have been  developing rapidly.    By 1995, the majority of state-owned enterprises are  expected  to make a profit as new management systems and relevant reforms  are being carried out in them.    The industrial output value of the non-state-owned economic  sector makes up 47.5 percent of the province's total, compared  with only 16.4 percent in 1978. The rural enterprises have  generated one-third of the province's gross product, reaching  164.3 billion yuan last year.    According to the acting governor, a market system for  commodities, finance, technology and labor will be established  in the province soon, to guide enterprises' production according  to market demand. The present planning system will be phased  out.    Social security insurance and the housing system will also  be  reformed to cope with the new situation.    The province will open further to the outside world. The  port city of Dalian will be built into a center of finance,  trade and information services.    Foreign businessmen are encouraged to invest in basic  industries, infrastructure facilities and high-tech sectors.  Export-oriented ventures are also welcomed.    Liaoning has huge economic development potential as it has  vast reserves in oil, iron, coal, non-ferrous metals and  diamonds. It is self-sufficient in food supplies.    In addition, the number of high-grade personnel in science  and technology and in management is large. Geographic  advantages, including a long coastline and numerous ports, will  also help the province's development, said the acting governor.</p>

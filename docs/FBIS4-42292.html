			<p>BFN     [Text] The only road to resolving the serious crisis in  Rwanda is that of trying to find a political solution. Any  military solution must be ruled out. Foreign Minister Antonio  Martino stated this when telling the Chamber of Deputies of the  latest developments in the civil war in the African country.  Martino said that Italy will continue to work for a peaceful  solution under the aegis of the United Nations to stop the  crisis from spreading to neighboring countries, starting with  Burundi.    Martino announced that he will be sending Franco Rocchetta,  deputy secretary for foreign affairs, to the African country  within the next few days.</p>

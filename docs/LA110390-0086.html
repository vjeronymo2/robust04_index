			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION;  </P> <P> SHERMAN-PARRISH RACE GOES FROM POTHOLDERS TO BRICKBATS  </P> <P> In recent weeks, little-known State Board of Equalization candidates Brad  Sherman and Claude Parrish have attempted to lure prospective voters by handing  out combs and potholders.  </P> <P> But with Election Day looming, the pair have switched to verbal brickbats,  accusing each other of spreading big-time lies to confuse residents of their  massive District 2, which stretches from Santa Monica to San Francisco.  </P> <P> Democrat Sherman, appearing with Democratic state attorney general candidate  Arlo Smith at a Los Angeles press conference, took issue with a last-minute  campaign mailer distributed by Republican Parrish which says Smith has refused  to endorse Sherman for a post on the state's elected tax appeals board.  </P> <P> "This is one of the most outrageous hit pieces in contemporary California  political history," said Sherman, proceeding to put his arm around Smith's  shoulders.  </P> <P> Parrish, meanwhile, is livid about a Sherman leaflet which claims that  Parrish's ice cream company was shut down in 1985 for failure to pay state  income taxes.  </P> <P> Parrish says he actually sold the firm, National Ice Cream Products Inc., on  Jan. 21, 1983. That was 10 days before the company's business license was  suspended for a month by the state Franchise Tax Board.  </P> <P> Sherman says he relied on public records in making his allegations. Besides,  Sherman said, the 1983 suspension could only have occurred because of previous  tax delinquencies.  </P> <P> Parrish, however, says he will sue Sherman for libel.  </P> <P> "It's a good thing Sherman sold his house (to finance his campaign)," the  Republican said. "(Otherwise) when I get through with legal action, I'd own  it."  </P></p>

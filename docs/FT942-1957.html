			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Paris presses UN over Rwanda plan: Boutros Ghali supports move France last night pressed a sceptical United Nations Security Council to sanction the despatch of up to 2,000 French troops to Rwanda to protect civilians caught in the vicious civil war. Despite widespread opposition the plan is expected to be approved because it has the backing of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, and no one wants to be seen standing in the way of a humanitarian mission. Mr Jean Bernard Merimee, the French delegate, says France seeks no political or military advantage and the mission would be 'absolutely' protective. He will have to spell out just how and where the troops would enter Rwanda since the Patriotic Front rebels have promised to eject them. The RPF vehemently opposes French involvement, because it says Paris supports the Hutu-led government and militias widely regarded as responsible for most killings. Last night the RPF demanded the Security Council withdraw the small UN force already in Rwanda if it approved the deployment of French troops. In a letter to the Council Mr Gerald Gahima, the RPF representative at the UN, said this was necessary because RPF forces might not be able to distinguish between UN and other foreign troops. There are 450 Ghanaian soldiers in Rwanda under a Canadian general. In Rome, Mr Antonio Martino, Italian foreign minister, sharply criticised the French proposal, voicing fears any white troops entering Rwanda would be 'torn to shreds'. In Geneva, the World Council of Churches urged France to abandon the plan saying the entry of French troops would worsen the crisis and make a solution even more difficult. Mr Boutros Ghali, who discussed the crisis yesterday with Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, is trying to assemble a 5,500-man all-African UN force. Because of logistical problems he has told the Security Council it would be impossible to have it in place in much under three months. Ethiopia, Ghana, Senegal, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Congo, Malawi, Mali and Nigeria have all offered infantry soldiers, but on condition equipment needs are met by more affluent countries. This will create further delays because the troops must be trained in the use of unfamiliar equipment - another reason why the French plan may win acceptance. Editorial Comment, Page 23</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Administrators urge Polly Peck creditors to play waiting game 'PATIENCE IS a virtue' sums up the message from Polly Peck International's administrators to the group's many creditors in their report distributed yesterday. Rather than settle for the quantifiable, albeit meagre, returns that a liquidation would yield, they urge that creditors should hold their fire in the hope that money will start to flow back to the group from Turkey and northern Cyprus at some indeterminate future date. That would reverse what are said to have been 'very large sums' flowing in the other direction, leading to debts of about Pounds 959m being owed to the rest of the group by businesses in the area. The administrators also say that they have been told that, between July and October last year, as Polly Peck's financial crisis developed, Pounds 230m was pumped into proposed leisure developments in northern Cyprus. They have not been able to verify this, but say that 'substantial further investment' would be needed to achieve any return. Meanwhile, the core businesses would be primped up to enhance values with the aid of strategic partners who would be brought on board. And investigations into the possible enhancement of returns through legal claims would continue. If all went well, the implication is, creditors might eventually expect to receive more than the 52p in the pound dividend implied by the directors' estimate contained in the report, since this includes no estimated realisable values for 'certain' northern Cypriot and Turkish subsidiaries. The likely return from a liquidation would approximate to just 20p in the pound, with some creditors, acting to improve their position at the expense of others, receiving 30p. This implies a deficit of assets against liabilities of more than Pounds 900m. The report puts unsecured creditors at Pounds 1.15bn. 'The group was in a more parlous state than we imagined,' said joint administrator Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. Under the broad strategy for 1991 and 1992 outlined by the administrators yesterday, approximately Pounds 500m of debt (equivalent to a range of 30p-60p in the pound) would be settled by way of repayment or refinancing. The proportions of each would depend on the performance of the principal underlying companies within the group. 'A substantial part' of the remaining debt would be converted into an instrument giving rights to participate in returns from the food, packaging and leisure businesses in northern Cyprus and Turkey. The rump of the group's borrowings would be written off or converted into equity. The current equity would be reduced to a nominal value, 'with a view to launching a possible rights issue' to raise funds to support the on-going businesses. The operation in the most obvious need of support at present is Sansui, the Tokyo-listed electronics group that Polly Peck bought control of last year. The administrators said yesterday that the strategy of expanding Polly Peck's Far Eastern electronics operations by utilising the Sansui brand name on the output of Capetronic, another subsidiary, had not yet been successfully implemented. As a result, Sansui incurred trading losses of Pounds 30m in the nine months to December 31 1990. The administrators said that they had been advised that there was 'little prospect' of realising their investment in Sansui in the short term and that restrictions existed on selling Polly's shares within two years of acquisition. They are accordingly working urgently on the preparation of a recovery plan, as well as seeking a partner to 'provide financial and management resources and to assist in restoring the profitability of the group'. A partner is also being sought for Del Monte, the US fresh fruit arm, to help the company to exploit the developing European market. Proposed deregulation, coupled with the emerging situation in east Europe, is a source of great potential, the administrators stated. In the year to December 31 1990, Del Monte made pre-tax profits before interest of Dollars 80m on turnover of Dollars 799m. The company is structured 'so as to be financially independent' of the rest of the group, the report confirmed. On the food, packaging and leisure interests in Turkey and northern Cyprus where the principal uncertainties lie, the administrators said that there had been 'an encouraging improvement'. An understanding has now been reached as to 'the method by which the relevant businesses' could be reorganised, they said. One of a number of 'avenues' being considered is the possible flotation of the food and packaging entities as one group and of the leisure interests as another. Less encouragingly, they said that trading in the foreseeable future was likely to be 'at a considerably lower level than previously reported'. This was due to the impact of the Gulf war and the uncertainty caused by the appointment of administrators. A number of valuable markets for Meyna, the fresh foodstuffs producer, and Unipac, the carton box-maker, existed in Iraq, Kuwait and other countries, they said. Vestel, the Turkish consumer electronics company, made trading profits of Pounds 52m on turnover of Pounds 270m in the year to December 31 1990. Since last October, it has negotiated its own financing facilities with the assistance of the administrators which are regarded as adequate to meet on-going needs. The administrators believe that realisation of the assets, whether by a sale or a share placing, would currently only be possible at 'a significant discount to the current market capitalisation'. In general, the administrators said that they had 'serious reservations' as to the quality and fairness of Polly Peck's published results. Mr Paul Hipps, senior partner of Stoy Hayward, Polly Peck's auditor, said yesterday: 'The administrators have had full access to our audit working papers (those dealing with the group accounts) and no queries have been raised with us.'</p>

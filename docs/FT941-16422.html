			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: When the hedging had to stop - Metallgesellschaft lost DM800m on oil contracts Correction (published 10th February 1994) appended to this article. Metallgesellschaft, the stricken German metals and oil trading group, puts its losses from oil derivatives for the year ended September at about DM800m (Dollars 470m). By the time it has shed all its unprofitable positions, a further DM1.5bn could be added, creating the most spectacular losses incurred through trading in the derivatives markets. Could this disaster really have its origins in a misguided hedging strategy intended to reduce the group's potential losses from movements in the oil price? The answer, according to people close to the group and traders in the oil derivatives markets with a close knowledge of its activities, is yes. However, as the losses began to mount through last autumn, further misjudgments by the group's management in the US added to the scale of the disaster. At the heart of the company's difficulties lies a basic mismatch in the maturity of its commitments to deliver oil and oil products, and the derivative financial instruments used to hedge those commitments. MG Corp, the US arm of the group, had been bent on an aggressive expansion of its energy business, both in gas and oil. Through its 40 per cent stake in Castle Energy, a Pennsylvania refining and marketing company, MG had been widening its refining interests rapidly. Last year, Castle acquired Powerine, a California-based refinery. Its refining capacity is put by analysts at between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels a day. The group is also reported to have had an ambitious marketing arm, buying and selling on energy products to a wide range of customers. Total sales are put at some 300,000 b/d. Yet the rapid growth of its refining and marketing operations left MG with a large risk. It was contracting to sell oil and oil products in the future at a fixed price which had been determined at the outset. However, it would have to buy oil to meet these commitments at the prevailing market price. If the oil price were to move up, it could face a big loss. MG chose to hedge this risk mostly by buying short-term futures contracts. MG's operations on the financial markets were conducted through MG Refining and Marketing, the same New York-based subsidiary through which the physical side of the oil business was handled. The bulk of the trading was handled through the subsidiary's operations in Houston, a centre for much of the energy trading in the US. MG had acquired a reputation as a moderately active trader in the over-the-counter derivative markets, though not one of the biggest. Its staff enjoyed a good reputation among Houston's small oil trading community, and it was known for hiring talented people. Last year, for example, it recruited Mr Kirk Kinnear, a former vice-president of Phibro, the energy trading arm of Salomon Brothers and a long-time participant in the derivatives markets, to run its growing swaps business. But the group's hedging strategy proved a disaster. It appears to have been based on a belief which was widely held in the oil markets before this summer: that short-term oil prices would never fall much below long-term ones. Ever since an active market in long-term oil derivatives developed in the late 1980s, traders say, short-term prices have remained higher than long-term ones (a phenomenon known in the oil market as backwardation, equivalent to an inverted yield curve in the interest rate markets). A number of oil traders recall that it was an article of faith in their own firms that this phenomenon would persist, or that if short-term prices fell below long-term ones, it would be only marginally. Based on this presumption, the maturity mismatch in MG's hedging strategy posed few risks. It could even lead to a small profit if the oil market retained its gentle backwardation, since the company would profit from short-term trading gains. The savage oil price fall last autumn revealed the flaw in this approach. The long-term oil price remained little moved, while the immediate market price fell some Dollars 5. Suddenly, MG was faced with big losses on its short-term derivative positions. A number of questions remain. Why did MG not act earlier to change its hedging strategy? As the oil price slid, even before the crucial Opec meeting in November, it was clear that past assumptions about the pattern of oil prices might be challenged. Were all its short-term positions in the financial markets the result of hedging, or was the company also speculating to try to make a profit? It is clear that MG was running a large position: even with a Dollars 5 a barrel loss on all its derivative exposure, it would have needed an open position of 200m barrels in to take a loss of Dollars 1bn. That is equivalent to nearly two years' business through its refining and marketing arm, all of it hedged in the short-term market. 'That's a pretty big bet,' said one experienced oil trader last week. 'It certainly raises the question of when hedging turns into speculation.' CORRECTION We are happy to make it clear that Mr Kirk Kinnear was not recruited to run the growing swaps business at MG Corp, as stated on January 10. He joined the company shortly before the end of its fiscal year, ended September, 1993 as vice-president, crude arbitrage. He was not involved with the company's trading in the derivatives markets.</p>

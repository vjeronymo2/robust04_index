			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Member of Academia Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comment from academia provided an objection to the proposed protein quality criteria for meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems. The commenter stated that ``every available survey indicates that all meat eating groups in the U.S. far exceed their protein quality and quantity requirements'' and suggested that the protein quality criteria be removed from the rule. Furthermore, the commenter provided literature to support this. The commenter also stated that they strongly agree with the red meat sausage manufacturers that have alleged that a disparate situation exists between labeling certain poultry products produced by mechanical separation and MS(S) which poses an unfair advantage for the manufacturers of poultry products. The commenter believes that standards for MS(S) and meat produced by advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems should be similar to the present ones for mechanically deboned poultry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Definition of Meat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the comments that it is not necessary to define meat by making distinctions based upon whether specific pieces of machinery do or do not crush, grind, or pulverize bones, FSIS has determined that such a distinction is important because the type of machinery affects the characteristics (in terms of appearance, texture, and composition) and functionality of the material produced. Such distinction is critical because machinery that crushes, grinds, and/or pulverizes bones from livestock to remove adhering muscle tissue results in a meat food product whose paste-like consistency and content of bone, including bone marrow and certain minerals, are materially different from those of ``meat.'' Furthermore, these differences have potential consequences for finished product quality and health and safety. Because of the mechanism of this machinery, bone and bone particles, including bone marrow, are incorporated into the finished product which is not consistent with that of meat as traditionally defined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, FSIS has determined, as discussed in the section of this document entitled ``Characteristics and Composition of Meat,'' that the product derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems that do not crush, grind, or pulverize bones to remove adhering muscle tissue is comparable to meat derived by hand-deboning techniques, including the use of mechanical knives, because it has the functional and chemical characteristics of ``meat.'' As such, the product derived from the advanced systems warrants classification as ``meat.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters expressed a need for clarifying the acceptability of ``incidental'' bone breakage with regard to the use of advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems. FSIS believes that the description of the bones from which muscle tissue has been removed that emerge from the advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems, set forth in the proposed regulations, sufficiently addresses this issue, and, thus, this description remains as proposed. The description in the proposed amendment to the definition of meat is consistent with the description of the bones resulting from the removal of muscle tissue by hand-deboning using knives, including high-speed hand-held mechanical knives. This description indicates that these bones emerge comparable to those resulting from hand-deboning (i.e., essentially intact and in natural physical conformation such that they are recognizable, such as loin bones and rib bones when they emerge from the machinery), thus, recognizing that some removal of a minute amount of the bone surface might unavoidably occur during this process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS recognizes that even with the use of hand-operated knives, e.g., at the supermarket meat counter to cut up large cuts of beef, there is the possibility of shaving, pressing, or scraping close to the bone surface so as to unavoidably remove a minute amount of the bone's surface when meat is removed. FSIS has determined that this is a normal occurrence because of the difficulty in exercising precision in hand-deboning operations and, as such, it is still in conformance with good manufacturing practices that render products safe and wholesome. The minor abrasion of bone edges or surfaces in removing meat from bone using hand-deboning techniques, including mechanical knives, and the advanced meat/bone separation machinery is not the same as bone crushing, grinding, or pulverizing which would result in bone and constituents in bone being incorporated in the finished product in a manner inconsistent with meat as traditionally defined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Shares fall after arrest of top Milan developer THE ARREST of Mr Salvatore Ligresti, financier and king of Milan construction, on alleged corruption charges on Thursday caused a sharp drop yesterday in shares under his control. Mr Ligresti, responsible for building many large developments in Milan during the past decade as well being a shareholder in Mediobanca, Italy's most prestigious private financial institution, was arrested in connection with the corruption scandal involving rigged construction contracts and political kick-backs. He is the most prominent business figure so far to be linked by Milan magistrates to an affair which has involved almost 70 local and national politicians, as well as members of the city's leading construction companies. Shares in Premafin, one of Mr Ligresti's financial concerns, fell by more than 7 per cent and anxieties about the future of his group following his arrest also served to depress prices generally on the bourse by 2 per cent yesterday. The market also reacted negatively to Thursday's raising of interest rates by the Bank of Italy in response to the move by the Bundesbank. Again yesterday, the Bank of Italy lifted its short term rates by almost one point to 16 per cent. Meanwhile, the government confirmed it was winding up Efim, the debt-ridden industrial state holding company which has 37,000 employees and debts of L8,500bn (Pounds 3.87bn). The move had been foreshadowed on Thursday when the board resigned. A statement said Efim, which controls more than 100 companies with activities ranging from aluminium, defence and transport to glass and health spas, would be wound up in five stages: valuation of the group; transfers, incorporation and sales of assets; loss-making operations with debts will be administered according to the practice of a voluntary liquidation; issue of Treasury backed paper to cover outstanding debts at interest rates to be agreed by the Treasury; a freeze on debt for at least a year. The holding company was founded in 1947 to finance the development of private and public sector industry but has ended up as a hospital for loss-making businesses. Banks, mainly foreign, are owed some L2,000bn by Efim's helicopter subsidiary, Agusta.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / This Week: Music The greatest hits from the musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber, performed by original artists, are brought together for the first time in The Very Best of Andrew Lloyd Webber (Polydor). The phenomenally successful British composer - he once had six shows running simultaneously in London's West End  -tends to divide people into extreme camps, but here at least is a collection of highly memorable tunes, sung by a variety of mega-stars which includes Jose Carreras, Glenn Close, Barbra Streisand and Sarah Brightman. Mary-Chapin Carpenter is one of the more literate of the new wave of singer-songwriters who, just a few years ago, were in danger of becoming extinct. Stones in the Road (Columbia) will no doubt repeat the commercial success of her recent recordings, relying as it does on a similar mix of strong, country-based material and deft arrangements - Branford Marsalis makes a cameo appearance on soprano saxophone for 'John Doe No. 24', one of the album's strongest tracks. Carpenter also makes an appearance on Red, Hot &amp; Country (Mercury), that genre's contribution to Aids awareness, which follows the successes of Red Hot &amp; Blue and Red, Hot &amp; Dance. The compilation of classic tracks also includes Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash. One of Handel's neglected operas, Poro, Re dell'Indie, first performed in London in 1731, receives a world premiere recording on the Opus 111 label. Fabio Biondi conducts the young Europa Galante ensemble. Michael Nyman, still riding high on the success of his soundtrack for The Piano, releases his first live album, Live (Venture), a collection of his most popular material which also includes his scores for The Draughtsman's Contract and Making a Splash. Themed classical compilation albums get ever sillier: Classical Ecstasy: Exploring the Tingle Factor (BMG) is a collection of pieces chosen by readers of Classic CD for their ability to send shivers up the spine. They are amusingly sub-divided into 'lump-in-the-throat', 'goose bumps' and 'beating heart' categories; the pieces of music (by Wagner, Barber, Bizet, et al) are largely predictable. Wackier still is Classical (Real World) by the Terem Quartet - yet more familiar pieces, but this time played on Russian folk instruments. If you fancy the idea of Eine Kleine Nacht Musik on balalaika, domra and accordion, this is for you.</p>

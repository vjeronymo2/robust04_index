			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Offer ends Pechiney strike Striking workers at Pechiney's huge new aluminium factory at Dunkirk yesterday ended their 13-day stoppage after management gave them an extra FFr600 (Pounds 71) a month. Workers at the smelter, which has a capacity of 215,000 tonnes or almost half France's total output, had demanded FFr1,000 a month on top of their average monthly pay of FFr11,500. During the strike, managers kept the three-year-old plant's continuous smelting process going, producing low-grade aluminium which will now be recycled. Partly as a result of voluntary production cuts agreed by western and Russian aluminium producers, the market for the metal has greatly improved this year. But demands for higher pay have also sparked strikes. The number of industrial disputes in France, though still very low, appears to be rising with the current improvement in the economy.</p>

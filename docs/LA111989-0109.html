			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSALS FOR SOLVING COUNTY'S TRAFFIC JAMS  </P> <P> Stan Oftelie ventures that ("After Measure M's Defeat. . . ." Nov. 12), "with  some prudent revision" the 20-Year Master Plan of Transportation Improvements  might win voter approval in a countywide election. He supports this risky  proposition with the same puffery that doomed Measure M and Measure A before  that.  </P> <P> Prudent revision will not be enough. Starting with the Orange County  Transportation Commission itself, a major overhaul of Orange County's road  building system is in order.  </P> <P> The seven-member commission is currently made up of County Supervisors Thomas  F. Riley, Roger R. Stanton, and Harriett M. Wieder and Tustin City Councilman  Richard B. Edgar, Brea Councilwoman Clarice A. Blamer, and Anaheim Councilman  Irv Pickler. The supervisors appointed themselves, and the League of Cities  appointed the council members. The seventh member, Dana Reed, a Newport Beach  attorney, was appointed by the other six commissioners. Obviously the  commission is a second, part-time job for all of its members. None has any  transportation expertise and, as far as transportation issues, they do not  report to anyone, not even the voters. They depend on Oftelie (an  ex-journalist) to tell them what to do, and at an annual salary of $106,000, he  is the county's highest paid executive.  </P> <P> In the 11 years since its formation, the commission has spent more than $23  million asking the voters to approve two sales tax increases. Both failed  because Oftelie and the commission are completely out of touch with what a  majority of the voters wants and are willing to pay for: more general purpose  roads.  </P> <P> The Legislature created the present commission system in 1977. Now it is time  for the Legislature to replace it with a full-time commission directly elected  by the voters. The new commission's budget should be tied directly to the total  road building funds allocated to the county. And to prevent future costly  off-year tax increase elections, that give developers an opportunity to buy  their way in, the new commission should not be allowed to make any law or  ordinance.  </P> <P> Enough is enough and sometimes, enough is too much.  </P> <P> WAYNE KING  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

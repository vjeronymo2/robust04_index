Guan Guangfu arrived  in Xiangfan on 18 March. During his six-day stay, he went down  to a dozen or so factories and rural areas in Suizhou, Zhouyang,  Xiangyang, and Yicheng. He talked with the broad cadres and  masses to find out about the actual conditions, heard their  opinions and requirements, and discussed with them the major  plan for accelerating reform and development.    Last year, Xiangfan's economic growth rate and returns were  higher than the average level in the country and the province,  and fulfilled the Eighth Five-Year Plan two years ahead of  schedule. This year, Xiangfan has set itself a new target of  high-rate growth. Encouraged by the strategic decision of the  provincial party committee on building Xiangfan into a large  city, people of the whole city are in high spirits, and are  striving to catch up with and overtake one another. Since the  beginning of this year, the city's economy has maintained a  strong momentum of development.    Through several days of investigation, Guan Guangfu  conducted  a discussion meeting with Xiangfan city and county leading  cadres. He said: What left the deepest impression on me along  the way is a precious state of mind. People have emancipated  their minds; they are bold in exploration; they have united as  one, from the top to the grass roots; they are going all-out,  with the focus on accelerating reform, opening up, and  modernization. That the city set itelf the goal of learning  from Suzhou, catching up with Xingzhou, aiming high, and  creating first-rate results, is an expression of voluntarily  assigning tasks and putting pressure on itself, which embodies  the high criteria and strict requirements set by Xiangfan's  communists on themselves.    Guan Guangfu said that without the presence of a few  pillars,  it would be out of the question for the province to maintain the  momentum of a high growth rate. Xiangfan should continue to  play an exemplary role in Hubei, and make concrete the measures  for achieving the targets this year. He said that today, when  the market competition is extraordinarily intense, the gap in  the levels of economic development is actually widening between  some places. However, we must see that this widening is relative  when all places are developing simultaneously. Besides, we  should see that some models typical of developing by leaps and  bounds have surfaced. Such development by leaps and bounds  embodies the degree to which enterprises are linking themselves  to the market, minds are being emancipated, and work is being  carried out. It is a newborn thing and a fresh experience under  the conditions of the socialist market economy, and it  represents the orientation of development. Such models typical  of developing by leaps and bounds can be found in various  places. They should be studied and perceived earnestly, and the  law governing such leaps should be explored and used to educate  our cadres, complete and perfect our train of thought, and spur  us on to pursue high-rate growth.    On accelerating rural development, Guan Guangfu reiterated  the need to increase the weight of industrial development in the  wake of readjusting the ratio between industry and agriculture  on the basis of stabilizing agriculture. In the wake of  readjusting the ratio between grain, cotton and edible oil, and  diversified management on the basis of stabilizing the output of  grain, cotton and edible oil, the weight of diversified  management should be increased. That is the inevitable and only  way to make the county, village, and people rich.    In the wake of the provincial party committee making the  decision on building several large cities in Hubei, Xiangfan has  regarded this as a very good chance to enhance a city's  comprehensive ability and develop its staying power. Xiangfan  was ahead of others in perceiving this point and was quick to  take action. Guan Guangfu was very happy about this. He said:  The provincial party committee's decision was an important  strategic one to insure Hubei's sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic development [jing ji ci xu kuai su jiang kang fa zhan],  it was also the pressing need of Xiangfan in its continuous  development. In building a modern city system, it is necessary  to grasp two points: First, the building of large cities, and  second, paying attention to building of small towns. Only by  grasping these two points -- while bringing along the middle  section -- both industry and agriculture, both urban and rural  areas will be taken care of.    Guan Guangfu indicated that at present, various places have  met difficulties to various degrees, which should be resolved  through reform, development, and stabilization, and with the  understanding and support of workers, peasants, and  intellectuals. The greater the enthusiasm the masses show, the  more their efforts are prized. Party and government leading  comrades at all levels should go deep into realities, carry out  investigation and study, conduct organization with care, work in  a down-to-earth way, and do a good job in resolving practical  problems.    Accompanying Guan Guangfu in the investigation and study  were  Deng Guozheng, member of the provincial party committee standing  committee, and Yang Binxin, secretary of the Xiangfan party  committee.</p>

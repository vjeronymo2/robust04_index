			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> GRAND JURY INDICTS 10 MORE IN LARGEST U.S. METH LAB STING  </P> <P> A federal grand jury in San Diego has issued a 14-count indictment charging 10  more people with the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine in the  aftermath of a nine-month inter-agency sting operation that authorities have  billed as the largest of its kind in U.S. history, officials reported Friday.  </P> <P> The death of a 21-year-old woman is also involved in the case.  </P> <P> The indictment issued Thursday alleges that the group conspired to manufacture  800 pounds of methamphetamine at three clandestine laboratories throughout the  county.  </P> <P> Five of the group are already in custody on separate charges, while the  remaining five are still at-large, Assistant U.S. Atty. D. Thomas Ferraro said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Operation Crankcase  </P> <P> The drug lab operation was among the biggest encountered by authorities in the  investigation, dubbed Operation Crankcase, which resulted in the arrests of 100  people March 19. Twenty-three meth labs in San Diego County were shut down in  the massive sweep, which involved about 350 officers from every law enforcement  agency in the county.  </P> <P> The indictment Thursday was based on evidence gathered during the operation of  Triple Neck Scientific Laboratory, a privately owned company that assisted the  Drug Enforcement Administration in investigating the purchase of chemicals and  equipment used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, Ferraro said.  </P> <P> The investigation is still considered active because more arrests stemming from  Triple Neck's operation are possible, Ferraro said.  </P> <P> The "Walters Organization," as the group indicted Thursday was known, was  allegedly headed by Martin Edward Walters, 21, of Mira Mesa. He is in County  Jail on charges that include kidnaping and murder.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Charges  </P> <P> The indictment also charges Martin Edward Walters, his brother Vincent, and  three other men who allegedly belong to the organization with kidnaping three  people at gunpoint in an effort to obtain methamphetamine stolen from the  group.  </P> <P> In another dimension of the case, the San Diego County district attorney's  office has filed additional kidnaping and murder charges in connection with the  same incident, which resulted in the death last September of Kristine Reyes,  21. Reyes was killed after she; her boyfriend, Edward Michael Provencio, and an  unnamed friend were allegedly abducted by Juan Antonio Lopez, one of the five  men charged in the indictment.  </P> <P> Reyes was found dead in a vacant El Cajon house on Sept. 30, five days after  her kidnaping. She died after breathing fumes from a toxic chemical placed on a  gag covering her mouth. Lopez was arrested in connection with her death in  December, and he remains in custody.  </P> <P> Authorities believe the five men were present and participated in Reyes' death.  </P> <P> Ferraro said police were close to arresting Martin Edward Walters on drug  charges when the murder occurred. "(Reyes' death) really was an unfortunate  thing," Ferraro said.  </P> <P> Martin Edward Walters "had already involved himself with Triple Neck and had  sold to undercover officers prior to (Reyes') death," Ferraro said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pipe Bomb Factory  </P> <P> A pipe bomb factory was found at Martin Edward Walters' San Diego residence  when investigators raided a suspected meth lab in 1987, Ferraro said.  </P> <P> Those charged with kidnaping along with Martin Edward Walters, Vincent and  Lopez are Glenn Andrew Arnold, 22, and Michael (Satin) Lee Moore, 20. The five  were also indicted on the drug charges. Vincent and Moore remain at-large.  </P> <P> Also indicted for the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine were Paul  Elza Walters III, 25, and Michell Denise Walters, 18, who are in custody; Kirk  (Troll) Bush, 21; Robert Lee Hall III, 26, and Steven (Barney) Kelly Barnett,  28, who are at large.  </P> <P> On May 26, a federal grand jury returned indictments against four other people  who had purchased chemicals and equipment from Triple Neck. In that indictment,  the four men, identified as Mexican citizens, are charged with the manufacture  of 9.2 pounds of methamphetamine and with attempting to manufacture an  additional 85 pounds at the time the site was discovered by DEA agents.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: CHIEFS: WILL PLAY RAMS IN WEST GERMANY  </P> <P> The Rams apparently will play an exhibition game against the Kansas City Chiefs  in West Germany on the weekend of Aug. 11-12 at a site to be determined.  </P> <P> The Chiefs had been scheduled to play the New England Patriots in London in  early August, but Carl Peterson, the Chiefs' president and general manager,  said the team instead will play the Rams in Germany.  </P> <P> Although Peterson said everything but the exact site and date of game seems to  be set, members of the Rams office staff were unaware of the agreement.  </P> <P> "I knew there had been discussions between the league, (Chief owner) Lamar Hunt  and Mrs. Frontiere," said Pete Donovan, the Rams' director of sales. "But as of  the end of the working day Friday, nothing was final."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the faction of Ukraine's communists; place and </F> date not given]    [Text] For over three years, Ukraine, which became an  independent state, has been suffering from inflation, hunger,  poverty, paralysis of production, and the degradation of  science, culture, and moral principles. During this period, the  economic policy was senseless, helpless, and antinational. Only  three years more of such policy are required to make Ukraine a  source of raw materials, cheap labor, and to turn it into a  underdeveloped colony. Let us recall who is the initiator and  the advocate of this sycophantic policy.    From the very beginning of the existence of the former  Supreme Council, V. M. Pylypchuk, O. S. Emelyanov, and V. M.  Pynzenyk played an active part in imposing the principles of  market reforms. Their program foresaw the "liberalization" of  prices, privatization of state enterprises, and the introduction  of a national currency. This program praised the price policy of  a "shock therapy" -- imposed on Russia and Ukraine -- which  became a lever for robbing people.    In March 1992, the president submitted "Fundamentals of  National Economic Policy" for consideration by the Supreme  Council. Former presidential adviser O. S. Emelyanov headed the  drafting collective. Former instructor V. M. Pynzenyk and other  persons also participated in drafting this program. V. M.  Pylypchuk, chairman of Supreme Council commission for economic  reforms, supported this program in its entirety. Key principles  of this program are as follows:    1. Russia is an enemy. It is necessary to isolate Ukraine  from Russia as soon as possible. This could lead to the  disruption of contacts and stoppages of deliveries, and to a  crisis in wholesale prices;    2. It is necessary to introduce a national currency as soon  as possible (though it is not covered by goods or currency  reserves!);    3. It is necessary to introduce a system of clearing  accounting between the CIS states (which halted deliveries and  thus triggered a payment crisis what cost Ukraine losses in the  multibillions).    4. It is necessary to reorient the Ukrainian economy toward  integration with the West (nothing comes of this, because  entering new markets requires constant effort). These mindless  adventurous measures complicated a situation in Ukraine that was  already difficult.    Meanwhile, V. G. Lanovyy -- who worked in the  cost-accounting  laboratory at a state enterprise, and later headed the  department at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Institute of  Economics -- appears on the scene. V. M. Pylypchuk and V. G.  Lanovyy were involved in the introduction of tear-off coupons.  All of a sudden, an abstract dogmatist became minister of  economy and vice prime minister dealing with the reforms. He  drafted a regular populist thick "program," the essence of which  was narrowed to the illusory plans regarding privatization and  liberalization of prices. Nobody took this program seriously  because it did not correspond to Ukrainian reality. The program  did not contain anything revolutionary or original. V. G.  Lanovyy was dismissed because of his absolute inefficiency.  However, currently, he depicts himself as a discredited fighter  for reforms. There is nothing new in this. All populists  behave this way. Rukh also suffers from the same illness.    V. M. Pynzenyk, a theoretician of the same ilk, became  minister of economy and vice prime minister dealing with  implementing reforms. Therefore, his first moves -- the  untimely withdrawal from the ruble zone, the recommendation that  the National Bank chairman, who voiced doubts over the  opportunity to quickly introduce new money, resign -- present  nothing strange. He opposed union with Russia and CIS states.  He and his friends drafted several dozens of programs and  finally put the economy into a state of confusion.    Beginning in late 1992, he embarked on a wild increase in  prices which continued until January 1993. He also drafted  three projects addressing the implementation of the  "Fundamentals of National Economic Policy." Due to the lack of  time, L. D. Kuchma had to submit the third draft -- without  reading or introducing amendments -- for consideration by the  Supreme Council.    V. M. Pylypchuk, V. M. Pynzenyk, and V. G. Lanovyy did not  consider the economic and social situation in Ukraine and  advocated primitive measures, which they borrowed, first of all,  from U.S. theories. All their reforms are reduced to one  concept: liberalization of prices, introduction of free foreign  trade, quick privatization, sale of land, bankruptcy of  loss-bringing enterprises and collective agricultural  collectives, and restoration of tough money and credit policy to  oppose inflation. Life showed that all this is harmful to  Ukraine.    The international conference -- devoted to market reforms --  was held from 19 to 23 May in Ukraine. This was, in fact, a  political meeting, which was attended by all avid proponents of  shock therapy: Sachs, Balcerovicz, and others. Ukraine was  represented by our "heroes" V. M. Pylypchuk, V. M. Pynzenyk, and  V. G. Lanovyy.    Ukrainian representatives of alternative economic methods  did  not participate in the conference. U.S. "professors" called for  not protecting the Ukrainian economy from the crisis but  allowing it to undergo "structural changes" prompted by blows  arising from the crisis in sales and payments.    Only when V. M. Pynzenyk and V. G. Lanovyy were dismissed  and  V. M. Pylypchuk bridled his energy by being unable to think  realistically and in connection with launching an election  campaign, the statements that inflation could be kept down and  on the crisis in payments and production was challenged.    Minister of Economy R. V. Shpek also tries to continue the  implementation of the Western wild market policy. According to  him, even state regulation means liberalization of prices (we  cite him!). Under his office, the Ministry of Economy turned  into an unimportant department for carrying out propaganda.    V. M. Pynzenyk, V. G. Lanovyy, M. Pylypchuk, and R. V. Shpek  make attempts to become real compradors, and encourage the  policy of states-colonizers. All their reforms are new versions  of primitive Western recipes that do not take Ukrainian  conditions into consideration. They are pushing our people into  poverty and Ukraine -- to a colonial dependence. They cannot  become leaders of Supreme Council economic commissions.</p>

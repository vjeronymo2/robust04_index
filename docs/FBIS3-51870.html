The poll  requested opinions on PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]  deputy for Sao Paulo Manoel Moreira, independent deputy for  Bahia Joao Alves, PFL [Liberal Front Party] deputy for  Pernambuco Ricardo Fiuza, and PMDB deputy for Maranhao Cid  Carvalho.    Manoel Moreira obtained the highest number of opinions in  favor of his dismissal (78 percent). He is known to 92 percent  of Campinas (Sao Paulo) voters, which is his main electoral  stronghold. Among those polled, 58 percent believed they were  well informed on his involvement in the charges of budget  corruption, while 55 percent said his work in Congress had  brought no benefit to the city.    Deputy Joao Alves, against whom the main charges of  involvement in the scandal have been pressed, obtained 68  percent of opinions in favor of his dismissal. The poll was  made in Itarantim (Bahia), one of the various cities in which he  obtained a significant number of votes in the last elections.    Also in the case of Alves, the majority of those polled (35  percent) believe that his work as lawmaker has not produced any  benefits for the city, where 99 percent of those polled know  him. However, he obtained the highest percentage of opinions  that his work produced much benefit to the city (26 percent).  None of the others surpassed the 10 percent mark.    In Recife, 74 percent of voters believe that former minister  Ricardo Fiuza must be dismissed. Among those polled, 49 percent  said that his work had not produced any benefit for the city,  where he is known by 81 percent of the people polled.    Voters were more benevolent with Cid Carvalho, whose resume  registers a dismissal under the terms of the AI-5 [Institutional  Act No. 5]. He obtained the lowest number of opinions in favor  of his dismissal.    The poll was made in Imperatriz (Maranhao), where he was  known by 93 percent of those polled. The majority (54 percent)  have learned about the charges against him, but only 17 percent  consider themselves well informed.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Veil of Whitehall secrecy is lifted CAREER DETAILS of the head of MI5 are given in the first edition of a new guide to Whitehall, published with official blessing - but no reference is made to the head of foreign intelligence. Dod's Whitehall Companion, produced with the encouragement of Sir Robin Butler, the head of the Civil Service, provides information on 980 top civil servants, ministerial advisers, regulators and executive agency chiefs. It contains a brief biographical note on Mrs Stella Rimington, head of the MI5, but there is no entry for Sir Colin McColl, her counterpart at MI6. Dod's gives details of present jobs, past careers, education and recreations of mandarins as well as addresses and telephone numbers. Many of those listed have also supplied photographs of themselves. Apart from the reference to Mrs Rimington, information is given about the Security Commission - which deals with Whitehall leaks - and the Security Service Tribunal, which investigates complaints against the security service. The guide also discloses previously unpublished information about the responsibilities of individual civil servants, including those working in the Cabinet Office and at for the prime minister at No 10 Downing Street. Detailed organisation charts for each government department show the links between individual ministers, top civil servants and departmental divisions. Sir Robin Butler played a central role in producing the guide, arranging access for the compilers. In his foreword to the book, Sir Robin welcomes its publication as 'consistent with the mood of open govern-ment'. The Whitehall Companion 1992. Dod's Publishing and Research. Pounds 125.</p>

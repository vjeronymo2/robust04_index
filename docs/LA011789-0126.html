			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE / TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> IN EROSION OF ANTI-TAKEOVER STRATEGY, 3 MILLION PRIME SHARES SOLD TO MAI  </P> <P> Prime Computer won't be able to count on its largest institutional investor to  help thwart a hostile takeover bid by Tustin-based MAI Basic Four.  </P> <P> The state of Michigan, which held 3 million Prime shares in a pension fund that  serves about 300,000 current and retired state workers, has decided to tender  those shares to MAI's $20-a-share offer for Prime.  </P> <P> "We think it is a good price," Michigan State Treasurer Robert A. Bowman said  Friday.  </P> <P> In an effort to defeat the MAI bid, Prime management has tried to convince  investors and Wall Street analysts that it will take actions that will  eventually boost Prime's stock above the $20-a-share offering price. Prime, a  maker of minicomputers based in Natick, Mass., has also argued that MAI's  offer, heavily financed by debt, could impair Prime's competitiveness over the  long run.  </P> <P> But Prime may be losing the battle to persuade investors to be patient.  </P> <P> "Comparing the $20 cash with the potential $22 or $23 if Prime did things on  its own, we figured we'd take the bird in hand," Bowman said.  </P> <P> MAI said last week that 29.3 million Prime shares have been tendered to its  offer, including the Michigan pension fund. That represents nearly 65% of  Prime's 48.3 million common shares outstanding.  </P> <P> MAI began its $970-million bid for Prime on Nov. 15.  </P> <P> The Michigan pension fund paid $19 for each of its 3 million Prime shares -- or  about $57 million -- when it bought the stock "several years ago," Bowman said.  At the $20 selling price, the state will receive a 5% return on its investment.  DAVID OLMOS  </P></p>

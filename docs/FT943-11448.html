			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / EU hits back over fraud claim The European Commission yesterday hit back at allegations that up to 8 per cent of EU funds was going astray each year amid growing fraud in the Union budget. Responding to a highly critical report by Britain's House of Lords, the Commission said the fraud battle should mainly be fought by member states as they were directly responsible for spending three-quarters of the budget. The Lords report said that while it was impossible to estimate the scale of fraud within the EU it was at least Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn a year, equivalent to 7-8 per cent of the EU budget. The Commission said it had proof that fraud accounted for 1 per cent of the EU budget. 'Nobody knows how much the fraud is. If it's at that level it shows total dereliction of duty by member states,' said a Commission spokesman. Brussels yesterday set out a scheme under which people who inform on EU fraud could get up to Ecu10,000 (Pounds 7,886) for tip-offs. About Ecu200,000 would be earmarked annually for the scheme.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (7): Primed for privatisation - Profile / Polski Bank Rozwoju Polski Bank Rozwoju, the Polish Development Bank (PDB), is one of the new financial institutions set up by the first post-communist government to help finance the transition to a private, market-based economy. It began operations in February 1991. Untrammelled by communist-style banking habits its functions are to finance fledgling companies, to lubricate the restructuring of public sector enterprises and to channel funds from international institutions such as the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) into specific projects. Such is the pace of change in the economy, however, that Mr Wojciech Kostrzewa, the young, German-trained president, says 'we have become less and less a development bank and more and more a specialised corporate investment bank'. The bank, he adds, 'offers a full range of products for large and medium corporations', which means loans of Dollars 500,000 and above. Last year saw a virtual doubling in loans granted from 1,391bn zlotys to 2,521bn zlotys, a 65 per cent real increase after inflation, confirming the rapid growth in demand for investment finance from an increasingly confident private sector. More than 80 per cent of PDB's loans are to private or privatised companies and it is the only Polish bank which runs a regular commercial paper programme, including an active secondary market. The bank expects a heavy demand for investment credits from joint venture companies but the bank's commercial paper activities are limited to public companies listed on the Warsaw stock exchange. They are preferred because they are subject to the regulatory discipline and tough disclosure requirements of the US-style stock exchange regulators. The bank is involved in bringing new companies to the stock exchange and has teamed up with Kleinwort Benson, the UK-based merchant bank, to set up and manage one of the new National Investment Funds which will be created as part of the mass privatisation programme. But Bank Rozwoju is also helping to financially restructure state-owned enterprises prior to privatisation. The most successful example to date concerns the Szczecin shipyard. The deal involved a complex 2,500bn zlotys debt write-off and rescheduling agreement involving several leading banks and more than 1,800 suppliers. It was linked to a series of parallel productivity agreements with the trade unions and the introduction of modern managerial methods. This combination has transformed the shipyard from heavy loss-maker into one of Europe's few unsubsidised profitable shipyards. The Szczecin shipyard now turns out around 15 ships a year worth more than Dollars 250m and is on the way to privatisation. It recently gained new orders from Chile and Argentina in addition to orders from Germany, other European customers and South Africa. The bank now hopes to repeat the Szczecin formula at the loss-making state-owned Star truck plant at Starachowice, 200 km south of Warsaw which has been an unemployment black spot ever since the collapse of the old Soviet market for medium trucks and the evaporation of orders from the Polish military in 1991. Last year Deutsche Investitions und Entwicklungsgesellschaft, a specialist German project financing institution, took a 2.64 per cent stake in the bank alongside Italian, French and Austrian minority shareholders. The Polish Treasury, with 73 per cent of the 1,796bn zlotys capital, remains the biggest shareholder. This may change, however, if the government authorises PDB to raise fresh capital and dilute the state shareholding by a public offer of shares on a stock exchange which is increasingly coming into its own as a viable source of equity finance and as a privatisation vehicle. If the government gives the green light, as expected, 1994 could see the start of PDB's privatisation.</p>

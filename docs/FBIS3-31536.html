Correspondent David Stahlavsky talked with Kozyrev about his  planned talks with Czech officials.    [Stahlavsky] The Russian foreign minister is convinced that  the talks will concern the Bosnian issue, among other things,  because the stability of the Central and East European region is  in the interests of all. Andrey Kozyrev said that relations  between the Czech Republic and Russia are based on history and  enjoy good prospects. An assessment should be made of the ways  in which European partnership could be developed. This  assessment should be free of prejudice and mutual suspicions.    Kozyrev told Czech Radio that he is against reviving the old  doctrines on the inequality of relations. The main thing is to  build a new, big, and united Europe. The Russian minister of  foreign affairs emphasized that no one has a ready-made  prescription for doing this. He went on to add:    [Begin Kozyrev recording in Russian, fading to superimposed  Czech translation] Partnership for Peace is one of the variants  for joining NATO. We do not prevent anyone from doing so  because this is a matter on which all of the states, including  the Czech Republic, will have to decide themselves. [end  recording]    [Stahlavsky] But Andrey Kozyrev emphasized that there is no  need to focus only on NATO and recalled the existence of the  Visegrad Four, the CSCE, and others. There is no need to work  against these forms of cooperation. All of the options should  be used in the interest of political, economic, and cultural  benefit, Kozyrev said.</p>

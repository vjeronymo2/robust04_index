			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Expansion costs behind fall at Trio Pre-tax profits of Trio Holdings, the international money and securities broker, fell by almost Pounds 1m - from Pounds 2.39m to Pounds 1.45m - over the six months to end-March, despite turnover almost doubled from Pounds 24.8m to Pounds 48.4m. The company said the outcome reflected costs involved in rapid organic growth and subdued activity in its traditional core dollar/D-Mark market, particularly in Asia and Europe. Earnings per share fell to 0.69p (1.59p) and in view of this the directors said they felt it would be imprudent to pay an interim dividend - 1p was paid last time.</p>

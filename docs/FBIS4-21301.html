			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Three British Visitors on Cocaine Charges"] </F>   [Text] A teenager was among three British tourists who  appeared before an Arima magistrate yesterday charged with  possession of liquid cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and  attempting to export the drug.    Steven Peterkin, 31, of Sand Rock Road, London; Sharon  Mitchell, 27, of Batterson, London; and Nathalie Simmons, 18, of  New Cross, London, were held by members of the Organised Crime  and Narcotics Unit at Piarco Airport on Friday shortly before  they boarded BWIA flight for London.    According to court prosecutor Sgt Paul Glodon, Peterkin had  4.35 kilos of the drug in his luggage while Mitchell had 2.3  kilos and Simmons 150 grammes of cocaine hidden in their luggage.    Peterkin pleaded guilty to the charge of attempting to  export  the drug while the other two accused pleaded not guilty.    Magistrate Trevor Peters, presiding in the Arima First  Magistrate's Court, denied the three Londoners bail. They will  re-appear on March 3.</p>

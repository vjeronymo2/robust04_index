			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Canada's foreign debt downgraded by S&amp;P CANADA'S pride in being one of the world's most stable countries was shaken yesterday by a downgrade of its foreign-currency debt by Standard and Poor's, the New York credit-rating agency. S&amp;P lowered its rating from Triple-A to Double-A Plus, citing a rising current account deficit, heavy foreign debt and political uncertainty ahead of the October 26 referendum on constitutional change. The downgrade does not affect the federal government's borrowings in Canadian dollars, which make up the bulk of its debt. But it does include foreign-currency loans to the Export Development Corporation, Ottawa's export-credit agency, and several other public corporations. Mr Donald Mazankowski, finance minister, said S&amp;P was correct in assuming that political uncertainty, 'if it persists, could weaken investor confidence and hamper the conduct of economic policy.' But others expressed surprise at the downgrade. Mr Martin Bakker, chief financial officer of the Export Development Corp, one of Canada's most active international borrowers, said the corporation's profits and cash-flow before loan-loss provisions have improved in recent years. Canadian markets have been jittery ahead of the referendum. The Canadian dollar plunged last month, and the gap between US and Canadian interest rates widened by more than 3 percentage points. Yesterday, the Canadian dollar lost almost half a cent, falling below 80 US cents. S&amp;P noted that Canada's current account deficit had risen to 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product from an average of less than 2 per cent between 1985 and 1988. Net foreign debt is expected to rise to 148 per cent of exports this year, up from 100 per cent in the second half of the 1980s. S&amp;P said this was substantially higher than any Triple-A rated sovereign borrower. International Bonds, Page 30</p>

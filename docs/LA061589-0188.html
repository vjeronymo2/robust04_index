			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KLSX WANTS TO RAISE CHINA RELIEF FUNDS  </P> <P> In the wake of the violence in China, KLSX-FM (97.1) launched a campaign  Wednesday to raise money for China Relief, a humanitarian agency. But morning  talk-show host Peter Tilden conceded that "there are no guarantees" how or when  the money will be spent.  </P> <P> Tilden, who is spearheading the fund-raising drive on his 6-to-9:30 a.m.  program, said at a press conference that hundreds of the "classic rock"  station's listeners had called during the last few weeks asking how they could  help the pro-democracy movement in China.  </P> <P> The money will be given to China Relief through the American Red Cross and the  World Council of Churches, officials said, to be used "for humanitarian  purposes only," including "food, clothing, shelter as well as medicines in a  time of crisis."  </P> <P> On a day when the Chinese government was officially saying that only 100  students had been killed, however, both Tilden and publicist Michael Venema  said that they cannot guarantee that the money they raise will not be used on  behalf of the soldiers who crushed the rebellion rather than on behalf of the  students.  </P> <P> "The unusual thing here is that the Chinese government at this time is denying  that there is a crisis," the station and Venema said in a joint press release.  </P> <P> Venema represents Ice House, a comedy club in Pasadena, which is holding  "Benefit for Beijing" June 26 at $25 a head. KLSX is promoting that event as  well.  </P> <P> "Clearly the potential for violent change is right there," the statement said.  "We at KLSX-FM want to create a fund drive to have money and services in place  in the very likely possibility that the unrest we've seen in China for the last  month intensifies."  </P> <P> KLSX is asking for checks to be made out to China Relief. Listeners are being  told to send their checks to the station, said Julie Cahill, KLSX's promotional  director.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Red Cross here said that the Chinese Red Cross or China  Relief "will accept the money, but they haven't asked for it."  </P> <P> Asked when the money will be used, she answered: "When they have need for it.  The money will go to the Chinese Red Cross and they will use it as they see fit  in their humanitarian work."  </P> <P> Asked about concerns about who will benefit from the money, the spokeswoman  explained: "The Red Cross is a neutral organization. The Red Cross does not  take sides. We can't take sides for the military, we can't take sides for the  students."  </P> <P> Tilden likened the fund-raising drive to the money raised on behalf of cleaning  up the Alaska oil spill. On April 13, the station began a drive that thus far  has raised $5,830. The station also sent 10 of its listeners for 10 days to  Alaska at a cost of $9,250. Cahill said the station sent veterinarians, experts  on birds and communication coordinators.  </P></p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Thames turns choppy It brings back memories of the old days to see a company punished by the market for delivering interim dividend growth of 'only' 7.8 per cent. In common with other water companies, Thames has no incentive to apply gloss to its figures ahead of the periodic review by the regulator in 1994. But having flourished on expectations of high and stable dividend growth, water companies can hardly complain when investors are disappointed. Thames still has to prove it is an effective manager outside the business of water supply. Its international hodge-podge of waste and engineering businesses made a profit of less than Pounds 1m in the first half on turnover of Pounds 123m. Even allowing for the ravages of the cycle, it looks as though Thames paid too much for the likes of UTAG in east Germany. Still, Thames has an impressive ability to take out costs in the basic water business. With a two-year deal with the regulator on pricing already in the bag, real annual dividend growth of around 4 per cent looks certain, at least up to the 1994 review. Soon, though, the market will have to address the issue of how the sector will fare in the second half of the decade. By changing its licence to stop Ofwat meddling with its prices between the reviews scheduled at privatisation, Thames has taken the regulator by the horns. The downside is that, if costs are higher than expected, the company will be unable to pass them on to the customer. True, the regulator has promised to take this into account when setting Thames' new pricing formula in 1994. But there is precious little hard information to go on. Ofwat is shortly due to publish details of how the review will be conducted. That will give the market something more serious to worry about than a slightly disappointing dividend.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> EXPELLED GAYS WIN ROTC CASE  </P> <P> The Navy is dropping its bid to force repayment of tuition from two Ivy League  cadets expelled from ROTC for homosexuality.  </P> <P> A Navy spokesman said that the cases were "reviewed on their merits, and the  decision was made not to seek recoupment," the New York Times reported today.  </P> <P> However, the unidentified spokesman said there had been no change in the  Pentagon's ban on homosexuals in the military.  </P> <P> Robert L. Bettiker, 22, a chemistry major at Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, and David Carney, a 23-year-old Harvard graduate studying in  Britain, had been dismissed after informing their commanders they are gay.  </P> <P> The Navy had said it would seek reimbursement of their scholarship money:  $38,612 from Bettiker and $50,687 from Carney.  </P> <P> Bettiker called the turnaround "great" and said he hoped that it would have  implications for other ROTC cadets in similar circumstances.  </P></p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Letter: Grading as a tool for marketers Sir, Gary Mead ('More than just ABC', June 24) is, of course, correct in writing that the old system of socio-economic grades is inadequate for today's marketers. The 56m or so Britons cannot be sensibly divided into six categories for most marketing purposes. But there is nothing new in this. As long as I can remember people have been making this accusation, and it has always been true. Nevertheless, socio-economic grade has been one of the factors helping marketers to define their targets, along with sex, age, region and (sometimes) psychological measurements. All of these have two different functions. In the first place they are used to help media planners decide which advertising media should be used. In the second, they help creative people to decide what kind of message should be used. The former task is actually best performed by the use of a single-source survey, such as BMRB's Target Group Index. This tells you directly the best way to reach your target through the media. And if it turns out that this is through a combination of the FT and The Independent, you already know some important things about your market. Added to this should be specific study of prospects in the market, certainly including qualitative research. As the contributors to Gary Mead's article were suggesting, generalisations are dangerous. But this is just as true if they are based on an attitudinal segmentation of seven groups, as on a socio-economic segmentation of six.

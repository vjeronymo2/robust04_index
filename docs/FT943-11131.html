			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / International Company News: Polish banks fight foreign banking threat Three Polish banks have agreed to work together to establish a 'banking group' in a first step towards consolidation of the country's fragmented banking sector. According to Mr Wojciech Kostrzewa, head of the state-owned Polish Development Bank (PBR), smallest of the three, the outcome of the agreement would be 'somewhere between a holding company and a merger'. The other two banks are Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy of Crakow, which is shortly to be privatised, and the already listed Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK). WBK was sold by the state last year, with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development taking a 28.5 per cent stake. The banks said they were prompted by the potential challenge from foreign banks - expected once Poland's financial markets are fully opened to competition.</p>

The sources said the inspections to ensure that North Korea  has not been diverting nuclear fuel to military purposes may not  be completed by March 14 or 15 as originally scheduled.    An IAEA official said the inspectors are not being denied  access to North Korea's seven declared nuclear sites and that  there is still time to complete the inspections, refusing to  acknowledge a possible delay in their safeguards checks.    The sources, however, said North Korean officials have  reportedly told inspectors that it is "not necessary" to check a  certain number of sites before the nuclear experts have had a  chance to look for themselves.    Diplomatic sources have suggested the lack of progress may  have been influenced by the stalemate in inter-Korean  working-level talks Wednesday on the exchange of presidential  envoys.    Washington has already tied a third round of high-level  talks  with Pyongyang in Geneva on March 21 to the completion of the  IAEA inspections and the dialogue on envoys.    The sources here suggested that if the inspections are  delayed, the U.S.-North Korean talks will be placed in a  delicate situation.    Further, if IAEA inspectors cannot ensure the continuity of  the nuclear safeguards, the issue will likely be referred to the  U.N. Security Council, which could call for sanctions against  Pyongyang.    Meanwhile in Seoul, the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS)  reported that the inspectors have found some of the seals on  equipment to ensure the nuclear safeguards may have been damaged.    The seals were among those in seven declared sites in 40  locations.    However, there appeared to be nothing unusual on the seals  on  the 5,000-kilowatt reactor in the nuclear complex at Yongbyon,  some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang, KBS reported quoting IAEA  sources.</p>

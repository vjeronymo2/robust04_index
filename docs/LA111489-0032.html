			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 103: ILLUSION SEEKING REALITY;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: FAIRNESS IS A TWO-WAY STREET. THE INDUSTRY CAN'T KEEP CARRYING  UNINSURED AND RISKY DRIVERS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS.  </P> <P> Ceaseless attacks against the insurance industry are attributing the lack of  rate rollbacks and refunds under Proposition 103 to insurance companies'  "greed."  </P> <P> Let's take time out to recognize a few realities. The first is that insurance  companies do indeed try to make profits. It is called capitalism, the American  way of life, a way that has survived and outperformed other economic systems,  notably the regulated and bureaucratic structures now crumbling in Eastern  Europe.  </P> <P> The second reality is that the operative provisions of Proposition 103 were  modified dramatically by the California Supreme Court to make them lawful. As  Proposition 103 was originally written, rate rollbacks were required of all  casualty insurers. As modified by the Supreme Court in a decision effective  only four months ago, insurers could obtain relief from the refunds and rate  rollbacks to the extent necessary to earn "a reasonable rate of return."  </P> <P> Hearings are now being conducted to establish standards and components of a  reasonable rate of return. Consumer groups and insurers are both represented at  these hearings, accompanied by attorneys. Some seem to think that there is  something wrong with allowing the insurers to be part of these hearings. But  the fundamental fairness of our system requires that those whose interests are  affected have an opportunity to be heard.  </P> <P> To a very large extent, the rollbacks and refunds promised to the public in  seeking votes for Proposition 103 are illusory. The rates charged by some  insurers are insufficient for profitable operations, and those charged by  others are lower than necessary or merely adequate to generate a reasonable  rate of return. And persons insured with these companies should not expect  refunds or rollbacks.  </P> <P> Of course, some insurers are highly profitable and may be subject to rollbacks  and related refunds to the extent that "reasonable rates of return" are  exceeded. The complexities involved in determining reasonable rates of return  are substantial. Only four months have elapsed since the Supreme Court's  decision became effective, and hearings on the manner and procedures for  determination have already commenced. Thus, the hysteria about nothing having  been done about rates for a year is inappropriate.  </P> <P> What Proposition 103's supporters did not tell us is that reform is needed in  the tort system for insurance costs to be lowered. Some insist that insurers  reduce expenses by going after "fraud," but this brings us to two other  seldom-mentioned realities: Fraud is very difficult to prove, and nonpayment of  claims based on unestablished fraud may give rise to charges of "bad faith."  Bad faith claims create even greater exposure to the insurer than the  fraudulent claim, which, unhappily, is often paid because fraud cannot be  proven.  </P> <P> The simple truth is that the current tort system encourages fraud; it also  encourages costly and lengthy litigation over who is at "fault," and if both  parties are, which one bears the larger share of blame. This system returns  much more to doctors and lawyers than it does to insured people, and clogs up  our courts so that cases often have to wait years for trial.  </P> <P> The solution is not to terminate private enterprise in the insurance business  and set up a state monopoly or is it to create another layer of costs  associated with rate justifications and hearings. Things can be done to reduce  auto repair costs and fraud; however, legislation will be required.  </P> <P> Some people point to the state-run system in British Columbia as a model for  California. Essentially, that is a system in which claimants deal with their  own insurer (the state) regardless of who is at fault. California voters and  the Legislature have defeated "no-fault" measures that would eliminate much of  the doctors' bills and lawyers costs from claims. Such systems have resulted in  lower rates in New York and Florida and have been supported by many in the  insurance industry.  </P> <P> However, merely by enforcement of two existing laws, those of us who are  insured can stop paying for most of the bad drivers across the board. Because  of political considerations, there is little effective enforcement of the  mandatory insurance law, so many uninsured drivers remain among us. Those  drivers provide no reimbursement of costs paid by your company when they cause  collisions and injuries.  </P> <P> Those who are insured under "assigned risk" policies, forced by the state on  all auto insurers, pay premiums equal to about half of what your company pays  out for claims and administrative expenses attributable to those policies.  Again for political reasons, increases in assigned-risk premiums have been  consistently denied, even though the law requires that rates keep pace with  costs. Again, insured drivers subsidize the gap.  </P> <P> Regulation of rates does not mean lower rates; it means that rates are set to  permit a reasonable rate of return. Those rates may be lower or higher. If the  volume of claims and the costs of doing business continue upward, rates will  follow. Costs are increasing due to the rate-making process alone.  </P> <P> We need to take meaningful action to reduce fraudulent claims, require  insurance for all drivers, have assigned-risk policyholders pay their fair  share, permit negotiated arrangements between insurers and auto-body repair  facilities, and even reconsider adoption of a "no-fault" or modified negligence  recovery system. These will reduce costs arising from claims, and that will  result in lower rates.  </P> <P> There is no free ride -- refund and rollback entitlement cannot happen unless  rates exceed what is necessary to make a reasonable rate of return. Any other  result would be confiscatory.  </P> <P> Thus, we are left with the options of continuing to bash insurers for not  rolling back rates because they face increasing claims and costs, or really  doing something legislatively about reducing these claims and costs, thereby  permitting lower rates.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: No doubt, each Israeli attack on  Lebanese territory and citizens is also an attack on  international legitimacy, a violation of international law, and  a threat to the regional peace process.    By escalating its attacks in such a provocative manner  against Lebanon and its citizens, villages, and residential  areas, Israel not only shows disregard for the international  community's will, but also deliberately complicates and  aggravates the regional situation and pushes this region toward  the brink of an abyss so that Israel can implement its schemes,  maintain its occupation of the Arab territories, and evade the  obligations of a just and comprehensive peace.    Israel still refuses to withdraw from the occupied Arab  territories in accordance with the Security Council resolutions  and the land-for-peace principle. Beyond this, Israel is still  approaching the peace process as an occupying force that adheres  to the gains of occupation from an arrogant and dominating  position.    Israel has proven this through its hostility toward the  peace  process and through its maneuvering and tricks. By escalating  its attacks on Lebanese territory, Israel once again confirms  that it will not abandon its aggressive and expansionist  ambitions designed to annex the Arab territories and drag the  Arabs into making concessions and relinquishing their own rights  by mixing the regional cards and evading all that would make  Israel comply with the terms and components of the peace process.    More than two and a half years have passed since the peace  process began and there has been nothing yet to indicate that  Israel is ready to withdraw from the Golan and southern Lebanon.  Added to this is what continues to take place both in and with  regard to the occupied Palestinian territories before and after  the Oslo agreement.    All events and developments before and after the Oslo  agreement confirm that Israel only needs a group to follow its  orders, implement its instructions, and take part in repressing  the Palestinian people on their own territory, which iw exactly  what the Lahd mercenaries in southern Lebanon are doing against  the Lebanese people and their townships and villages.    The savage Israeli shelling of al-Biqa', the Israeli  military  buildup in the occupied part of southern Lebanon, and the Lahd  troops' joining of the Israeli forces in shelling the southern  Lebanese villages, townships, and cities have all revealed an  important fact that no one should forget; namely, that the  aggressive Israeli character, which practices abductions,  killings, and destruction, is placing the entire region in a  turbulent and feverish atmosphere and in a volatile situation,  especially since these practices recall the atmosphere which  Israel wants.    As Israeli aggressions has exceeded all limits, it is  necessary to confront this belligerence through an international  response that will end the policy of killings and destruction.  Moreover, the international community, which is eager to  maintain the peace process, should take the initiative and stop  the continuous Israeli encroachments and oblige Israel to comply  with the UN resolutions.    Israel's refusal to implement Resolution 425 and other UN  resolutions, which call for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied  Arab territories, is a flagrant rejection of international  legitimacy and disregards the principles of international law  through aggravating the situation in southern Lebanon, spreading  the atmosphere of war in it, and continuing the shelling of  southern Lebanese villages, townships, and cities.    Hence, confronting the aggressive Israeli character is not  only a duty and right for the Lebanese people--who have  emphasized the importance of, and need for, continuing the  resistance and rallying around it--but is also an Arab and  international responsibility that first stems from the need to  expose and foil the Israeli objectives and pressure Israel into  complying with the terms and components of the peace process,  led by full withdrawal from the Golan and southern Lebanon.</p>

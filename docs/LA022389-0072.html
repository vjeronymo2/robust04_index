			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: WAXING POETIC OVER THE WAIL OF THE COYOTE  </P> <P> My insistence that coyotes have a right to eat, too, has brought a flood of  support for that cunning creature.  </P> <P> Marjorie Kemper of Glendale lives on a hilly slope back of Forest Lawn, and  over the years, she writes, the proliferation of houses on the heights has  driven the coyotes down to hunt domestic animals and scavenge fallen fruits and  garbage.  </P> <P> "Frankly, I wish them luck. I should think in this era of a million laws and  municipal codes and home owner associations and Big Brother in all of his  unlovely guises that everyone would identify with the coyote, that symbol of  harassed individualism. I know I do."  </P> <P> Mary Peate of Westlake Village thinks my word howling is inadequate to describe  the coyote's song: "Indeed, I don't think one word could describe the sound  they make. There is a variety of noises -- a series of short barks; a  chattering chich-chich-chich sound; a high-pitched wailing and screaming; and  when they're in pursuit of their prey, a combination of screeching and  cackling, followed by the most daunting sound of all -- abrupt silence."  </P> <P> Ruth Kelley of Canyon Country writes that coyotes have taken so many of their  cats that they have finally given up on cats, "and are enjoying the now  proliferating quail, mockingbirds, doves, jays, hummingbirds, sparrows and  miscellaneous 'tweety-birds.' "  </P> <P> She encloses a poem written by her 80-year-old friend, Emma Lent:  </P> <P> </P> <P> I hear you, out in the windy darkness  </P> <P> Hurling your challenge against the wall of night  </P> <P> Defying traps and poisoned bait and guns  </P> <P> Taunting the house-bound dogs  </P> <P> I hear you. I applaud your affirmation  </P> <P> Freedom and hunger are better than chains  </P> <P> And a mess of pottage  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mrs. Kelley also encloses a prize-winning short story she wrote for children,  telling of their last surviving cat, Cleopatra, who outwitted the coyotes for  eight years, until a flood washed out her runways and hiding places and she was  finally caught.  </P> <P> Kathleen Collier of La Habra grew up in the mountains "where their nightly  serenade was a normal, if not somewhat mysterious and deliciously frightening,  part of my childhood experience."  </P> <P> To retain that experience she has written what she calls a "written photograph  -- something I could always have should the time ever come when their cry faded  altogether."  </P> <P> The beseeching cry  </P> <P> Of the coyote  </P> <P> Reaches out across the city night  </P> <P> Begging me to remember a once was  </P> <P> When the only accompaniment to his song  </P> <P> Was the soft breath of the wind in the leaves  </P> <P> And the only light to his path  </P> <P> Came from a compassionate moon floating  </P> <P> Amidst far away worlds  </P> <P> As gently I was coaxed towards sleep  </P> <P> By lyrics which enfolded me in all the mystery of creation  </P> <P> Delving deep inside me  </P> <P> To touch the furthermost borders of my soul  </P> <P> </P> <P> Such poetic sentiments tend to offset the meaner view of reader Bruce Lowry:  "Of course coyotes do not have to eat. Coyotes have a perfectly logical  alternative. They can become extinct. . . ."  </P> <P> Hal G. Evarts of La Jolla quotes a passage from "The Yellow Horde," a novel  written in 1921 by his father, Hal G. Evarts Sr: "He listened to the first  night sounds of the foothills. A coyote raised his voice, a perfect tenor note  that swept up to a wild soprano, then fell again in a whirl of howls which  carried amazing shifts of inflection. . . . Wild music to the ears of most men,  the song of limitless horizons freighted with a loneliness which is  communicated to man in a positive ache for companionship. . . .  </P> <P> "It moved Collins to quiet mirth . . . the first clamorous outburst of the  night. He read in it a note of deep-seated humor, the jeering laughter of the  whole coyote tribe mocking the world of men who had sworn to exterminate their  kind. 'The little yellow devils!' Collins chuckled. 'Men can't wipe 'em out.  There'll be a million coyotes left to howl when the last man dies.' "  </P> <P> There are rogue coyotes. Dell Kendall of Glendale chastises me for doubting  that coyotes carry off small children. She reminds me that a little girl was  seized from her doorstep and killed by a coyote in Glendale only a few years  ago, and that the story was widely publicized.  </P> <P> I'm sure that girl's family can hardly sympathize with my sentiments about  coyotes. All I can say is that children are not as much in danger from coyotes  as from drive-by shootings.  </P></p>

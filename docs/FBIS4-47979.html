			<p>BFN     [Text] Soldiers pulled the trigger in the city of Bie  [Cuito] yesterday, but the situation is now calm. Violence  broke out at 1300 when a Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party air force plane parachuted supplies for the  Luanda regime troops. Ironically the parachutes landed in the  area of the city controlled by the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola. Government forces were promptly  mobilized to retrieve the parachutes. The Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FALA] reacted against the provocation.  The People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA]  persisted in their designs and the clashes began. The clashes  were intense and there were dead and wounded, though it has not  been possible to make a final assessment of yesterday's  skirmishes. The situation was calm last night, but it is not  known whether FAPLA will mount new attacks.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Call for residuary mines body rejected MR TIM YEO, environment minister, yesterday rejected a call for a working party to examine the environmental threat of minewater flooding and pollution after pit closures, Chris Tighe writes. A delegation from County Durham, including Labour MPs, county councillors and officers, yesterday urged Mr Yeo to set up a residuary body to be responsible for abandoned mineworkings in the post-privatisation period. Mr Yeo said he believed a working party was not needed in view of existing contact between the National Rivers Authority and British Coal. Concern in County Durham over the risk of the water table rising, leading to polluted water supplies and possible subsidence, has been heightened by the rapid closure of local pits. This has led to fears that British Coal will cease its pumping operations that prevent water rising into abandoned workings.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Observer: Mildly mistaken A quick post-mortem on the research output of some of the world's top banks shows that even the bankers were as unprepared as the rest of us for the outcome of last weekend's Russian elections. Chemical Bank forecast, just two days before the vote, that 'pro-reform deputies will dominate the new parliament'. At least it mentioned Zhirinovsky as a 'political wild card'. Salomon was even more wrong-footed, predicting as late as December 9 that 'reformist forces will place strongly in the December 12 parliamentary elections'. Even David Roche, Morgan Stanley's east European supremo, got it wrong. 'We pusillanimously predicted either the constitution passes with a pro-reform parliament, or it passes with a fudged parliament. None of us expected what we have - a bloody awful parliament. None of us realised just how similar Russia is to the Weimar Republic.' Let's hope that Roche has got it wrong again.</p>

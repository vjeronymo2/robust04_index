			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Do well; feel bad The UK is enjoying a textbook-perfect, export-led recovery. It is unfortunate for the government that the public is unpersuaded of its merits. But that scepticism may also prove disastrous for the economy. A close connection exists between the excellence of the recovery and the sourness of the electorate. This is a recovery led by exports, not by consumption: in constant prices exports of goods and services rose 10.2 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 1994, while consumption rose only 2.2 per cent. It is a recovery led by manufacturing, not services: real manufactured output increased 5 per cent in the year to the third quarter, while services expanded 3.3 per cent. It is a recovery in which GDP has grown far faster than personal disposable income: GDP in constant prices expanded 4.1 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 1994, while real disposable income rose a mere 1.5 per cent. Neither the rate of growth nor its pattern was expected a year ago, but they are explicable. One side of the story is the indebtedness of the personal sector, the flat housing market and the sluggishness of borrowing. The other side is the unplanned devaluation of September 1992, reinforced by the unexpectedly rapid recovery of the European economy. Partly because the depreciation occurred when inflation was low and the recovery had just begun, partly because consumers were suffering from the after-effects of their excesses of the late-1980s and partly because Messrs Lamont and Clarke introduced increases in taxation amounting to 1.2 per cent of GDP in 1994-95 alone, this devaluation has worked - so far. One result is the improved balance of payments. The current account surplus of Pounds 0.8bn in the third quarter was the first since early 1987. Even the visible deficit was only Pounds 1.5bn (about 1 per cent of GDP), as against Pounds 2.4bn in the second quarter. So the economy is doing well and, as in a mirror, the public is feeling bad. But nothing could be better than such a recovery. Surges in exports promise an output expansion with consumption following, sustainably, behind. Nothing would be more disastrous than another rapid increase in consumption. That is why the latest interest rate increase and the tax rises to come are what the economy needs. They are not, however, what the public - or the Tory party - wants. The government has stumbled on the right mixture of a competitive exchange rate, flexible markets, and fiscal and monetary prudence. It has promised Nirvana before, been believed, and been wrong. Now it is not believed, but is right. Another U-turn is all too likely, however, precisely because it is mistrusted. If so, the sceptics would be proved right after all. It is a funny old world.</p>

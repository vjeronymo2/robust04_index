			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Shulman] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- Azerbaijan is prepared to  cease fire in the zone of the conflict at midnight April 27  provided Armenia makes the same decision, Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev said after the talks with Rasul Guliyev,  chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan, on Tuesday evening.    Pavel Grachev also told journalists that he would  immediately  inform the Armenian side of this decision and counted on mutual  understanding.    According to the Russian defense minister, during the talks  both sides also discussed some issues concerning putting under  Russian control of the Gabelin radar station which has great  importance for all Commonwealth countries. These issues will be  resolved at the inter-governmental level, the minister stressed.    It was almost impossible to foresee such an outcome of the  talks between the Russian defense minister and the head of the  Azeri Parliament. After all, the talks began from Pavel  Grachev's statement that the February 18 agreement on cease-fire  in the zone of the Armenian-Azeri conflict, reached between  defense minister of these two republics through the mediation of  the Russian minister was, to put it mildly, ignored, and did not  bring expected results.    At the same time, the minister said, Russia continues  intermediary efforts offering its version of cessation of the  armed conflict and transition to the elimination of its  consequences. According to Pavel Grachev, this version was  considered at the expert level at the end of March during a  meeting in Moscow with the participation of representatives of  the conflicting sides and, for the first time, the Minsk group  of Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).  The Russian defense minister also believes that this project  corresponds to the current situation, takes into account the  interests of both sides, and it is desirable that they consider  it. "We think that this would allow to essentially advance in  the settlement of the conflict," Pavel Grachev noted.    As for the problems of functioning of the mechanism for  control over the implementation of the Russian initiatives, the  minister said, both sides should establish joint headquarters.    Before the cease-fire in the zone of the conflict the  minister proposes to check up controllability of all armed  units, first of all stationed on the line of contact.  Uncontrolled military units should be moved to the rear,  forcibly disarmed and disbanded.    After the cessation of fire, combat operations and  disengagement of forces, Pavel Grachev believes, it is necessary  to create a mutual security zone. Joint headquarters, if they  are set up, should establish control over both sides' actions  and set up observation posts. Control over the withdrawal of  forces will be carried out by observers from the Commonwealth  countries and the Conference for Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE).    According to Pavel Grachev, he proposed to the Azeri side to  bring Russian troops to the line of contact and agreed that  these must be military units not stationed in Armenia. The  disengagement will be carried out stage-by-stage.    In accordance with the russian plan of the settlement of the  conflict, Armenian armed units must liberate all earlier seized  Azeri territories and return to Nagorno-Karabakh. If both sides  agree this region of Azerbaijan will be controlled by Russian  troops and international observers.    Pavel Grachev made great efforts to convince Rasul Guliyev  and parliamentarians accompanying him that the Russian plan of  the settlement of the problem is realistic, dispel their doubts  about the appearance of a new wave of refugees after the  withdrawal of the Azeri Army from the present positions, a  confidential source told ITAR-TASS.</p>

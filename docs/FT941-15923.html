			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian equities start new year in strong mood - Foreigners have led the buying A year which looked set to be overshadowed by political and economic uncertainty has started with fireworks in Brazil, where the main stock exchanges have gained some 20 per cent in US dollar terms since the start of the year. Aggressive foreign buying, especially from the US, has led to sharp price rises in a market which is thinly traded and illiquid by international standards. Although many in Brazil say that prices will go higher, some foreign observers appear to be turning cautious, especially after the market climbed more than 85 per cent in dollar terms last year. 'The market is concentrating almost wholly on the good news and to some extent has lost touch with reality,' according to Mr Stephen Rose of the eponymous London-based brokerage. Sao Paulo, the country's largest exchange, and its smaller rival in Rio de Janeiro rose 15.4 per cent and 18.5 per cent respectively in US dollar terms in the first week of January alone. In terms of cruzeiros reais, the inflation plagued local currency, the gains were about 30 per cent. The buying has continued this week, and yesterday Sao Paulo's Bovespa index of the 54 most active shares finished 602 points higher at 50,141. Popular stocks such as Petrobra, the government controlled petroleum monopoly, have led the charge, gaining nearly 40 per cent in dollar terms in just five trading days. Foreign money started to flow into Brazil last year and has accelerated in the first weeks of this year. According to unoffical estimates, up to one-third of last week's heavy average daily volume of Dollars 170m came from foreign buying, which includes non-resident Brazilians. Mr Robert Barclay, president of Baring Securities Brasil, estimates that foreign holdings have increased from about Dollars 3bn to Dollars 10bn in the last 12 months, of which only part has been due to the market's rise. 'We originally thought 1994 was going to be a bad year because of the overall uncertainty and tax rises. But the market is now looking ahead to what could happen in 1995 and beyond,' he says. On short term fundementals the Brazilian market looks unattractive. An already weak government runs the risk of becoming a lame duck ahead of presidential and congressional elections in November. Inflation, which passed 2,500 per cent last year, looks set to break the psychologically important 40 per cent a month mark this month. A 'shock' anti-inflation package announced last month by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister, introduced a number of tax rises which the private sector complained would hamper economic recovery. As a result, growth this year has been pencilled in by private sector analysts at between nil and 3 per cent. But according to the optimists, whose views have gained prominence in the local media since the new year, the bulk of Mr Cardoso's shock plan looks increasingly likely to be approved by congress. If so, a new currency anchor  -called the URV or unit of real value - will be introduced which, once linked to the US dollar, could lead to a sharp fall in cruzeiro inflation. And, the optimists add, Mr Cardoso's plan would lead to a balanced government budget and possible approval from the International Monetary Fund of a debt renegotiation with Brazil's commercial creditors. Under such conditions, the argument runs, market valuations would be revalued upwards from their present low levels of about 65 to 70 per cent of book values. These types of 'if' scenarios are alluring in Brazil. As the only major Latin American economy yet to stabilise its economy, and with a GDP roughly twice that of Mexico, a successful economic turnround could be spectacular. 'Undoubtedly some people are buying simply out of fear of being left behind,' according to one observer. But many remain unconvinced and argue that betting on Mr Cardoso's plan appears extremely risky given the murky underworld of Brazil's politics. Further, some analysts add, the market remains volatile and lacks long term investors to give it stable direction. As a result, last week's gains can be this week's losses. 'We are telling people to be very cautious and to remember Brazil can go down extremely fast too,' says Mr Rose.</p>

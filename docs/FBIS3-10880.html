			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rey Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] On 14 March, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina left  en route to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, the third stop on his Asian  tour, following a busy agenda in Myanmar.    In Phnom Penh, Robaina will meet with the president of the  National Assembly and the prime minister of the Kingdom of  Cambodia. This is the first official visit to Cambodia by a  high-level official of the Cuban Government following the return  to peace and stability in that nation.    In an exclusive interview with Radio Rebelde, Robaina spoke  about the first phase of his Asian trip.    [Begin Robaina recording] Nowadays, we cannot speak of a  worldwide diplomatic offensive that excludes such important  regions. When we speak of important regions, we cannot forget  this region, which is immensely wealthy, but which, in addition  to that, has experienced a significant economic boom in recent  years.    I believe that Cuba is in need today of many points of view.  Cuba has many needs and these needs are possibilities for  investment for many people. Undoubtedly, many of our needs  represent opportunities for investment by countries in this  region.    There is an undisputed economic boom in these countries that  we need to analyze. We need to do this to see what works, what  is truly adaptable to our circumstances. This is why I think we  need to talk about this region. I believe that knocking on such  doors as those of Indonesia, Malaysia, and India are venues,  alternatives, and possibilities for work and exchanges under new  game rules -- we are talking mutual exchange.    I do not want anyone to think that Cuba is going around  asking for a handout. Cuba has many needs, but also many things  it can offer the world and this region. I have found here great  interest in possibilities, great willingness to open exchange  possibilities in areas such as health, medicine, biotechnology,  and sports -- as odd as it sounds.    There are many things that have resulted from our social  investments that are of interest here, but have not been  successful here. [end recording]    After Cambodia, Robaina will visit India, Malaysia, and  Vietnam -- the last leg of his seven-country Asian tour.</p>

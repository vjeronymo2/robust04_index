			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Vickers in first export deal for new Challenger battle tank VICKERS, the British engineering group, has won its first export order for the new Challenger 2 battle tank with a contract from Oman expected to be worth about Pounds 200m. An initial deal for about 20 tanks is expected to be announced shortly and to be followed by a further order for a similar number. Vickers yesterday declined to confirm or deny the order. The deal will mark a breakthrough for the company after a series of setbacks on the export market. However, it will not be enough to bring more than temporary relief to its tank manufacturing division. One of its two tank production lines in Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne faces closure unless the company secures a larger export order or work from the British Ministry of Defence on upgrading the army's current-generation Challenger 1 tanks. Each of the two sister plants employs about 800 people. In the absence of any new order, a closure decision had been expected by the end of this year. Vickers won a Pounds 500m contract from the MoD in 1991 to supply about 140 Challenger 2s, after a long and bitter contest against rival US and German tanks. The UK order, sharply reduced from earlier plans, was decided partly on the strength of the export prospects that hung on it. The company suffered a heavy blow in October when Kuwait opted for the M1A2 Abrams, made by General Dynamics of the US, in preference to the Challenger 2 for a 236-tank deal worth about Pounds 1bn including spares and support. Vickers accused the Bush administration of using political leverage to secure the order in the run up to the US presidential election. Earlier last year, it was excluded from another Pounds 1bn contest in Sweden against the M1A2, Germany's Krauss-Maffei Leopard 2 and the new French Leclerc tank. Vickers had been unable to obtain a Challenger 2 prototype from the British army for trials in Sweden without breaking its UK government contract. Oman, which already has British Chieftain tanks, was considered the most reliable of Vickers' overseas prospects. The tanks are expected to enter service around 1995. Vickers is also competing for orders in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia involving a total of more than 600 tanks. However, in the UAE contest, expected to be for 390 tanks, the Challenger 2 is considered to be running third behind the Leclerc and the M1A2.</p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / People: Home help Benyon How would George Peabody have tackled the problems of London's homeless if he had been alive today? This is a question that William Benyon, the former Tory MP, will be increasingly asking himself as he takes up his new job in January as chairman of the Peabody Trust, London's largest housing charity. The problems of London's poor have changed considerably since George Peabody, the one-time supposedly heartless American banker, suddenly disarmed his many critics by setting up the Peabody Trust in 1862 with a Pounds 500,000 donation. However, the trust, which houses 25,000 Londoners on some 70 Peabody Estates, has not moved with the times as quickly as it might. A paternalistic organisation, for many years Peabody's main motivation seemed to be to keep the rents on its properties as low as possible. To this extent it has been very successful with average rents for two bedroom houses ranging from Pounds 25 in Haringey to Pounds 48 in Ealing. However, Benyon, who takes over his unpaid role from Hugh Astor, hopes that Peabody can come to play a far bigger role in tackling poverty generally, rather than just providing cheap housing. The problem is balancing the costs of a Pounds 200m ten-year modernisation of Peabody's existing old properties with wider plans to help the homeless and disadvantaged. He says that he has a number of ideas but refuses to be drawn on them because 'negotiations are very ticklish at the moment.' ***** NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK has appointed a new boss of its operations in London's West End a month after it sacked 185 staff. Andrew Blessley, 41, has been appointed regional executive director for the bank's West End region which puts him in charge of over 90 branches and more than 3200 staff in the heart of London. The bank says that there is no connection between Blessley's appointment and the sackings, which have caused considerable ill-feeling amongst the bank staff. Blessley's predecessor, Alan Thomas, 57, retired in May. Nevertheless, whilst all big banks have been operating voluntary redundancy schemes, NatWest has gone further than most by identifying the staff it wants to get rid of, as opposed to those who want to leave voluntarily, and summarily dismissing them. One of Blessley's first tasks will be to rebuild staff morale which Richard Lynch, senior London organiser for the Banking Insurance and Finance Union, says is at an all-time low. Blessley, who joined the bank after reading modern languages at Cambridge, has spent the bulk of his 20-year NatWest career on the international side. He spent three years in San Francisco, was seconded to Banco Nacional in Mexico City for six months, and worked in New York for several years. In October 1990 he was appointed assistant general manager of the group chief executive's office. ***** Ron Williams, NatWest's director of business operations, UK branch business, has been appointed ceo of EUROPAY INTERNATIONAL, the company created by the merger between Eurocard International and eurocheque International. ***** Hans-Dietrich Bauernfeind has been appointed a director of THORNTON ASIAN EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST. ***** Ted Lord, formerly head of financial engineering at Citibank Frankfurt, has joined BZW Frankfurt as a director of corporate finance. ***** Christine Shepherd, Julia Prescott, Rosamund Williams, Pavlos Stellakis, Jonathan Trower, John Ross, Christine Cottrell, Jonathan Daniels, John Davies, Mike Campion, Tom Murphy and Bruce Offergelt have been appointed to the board of HILL SAMUEL BANK. ***** Akis Karayiannis, formerly a vice-president at Citicorp, has joined LEHMAN BROTHERS INTERNATIONAL as an executive director and head of foreign exchange sales and trading in London. ***** Usha Kelly has been appointed technical director in the personal financial planning division of BAIN CLARKSON FINANCIAL SERVICES; Craig Stansfield is promoted to regional director. ***** John Pearce has been appointed a director of LONDON AMERICAN VENTURES TRUST. ***** Marilyn Fee White has been appointed director of marketing, based in New York, of Posthorn Global Asset Management, a London-based subsidiary of SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS.</p>

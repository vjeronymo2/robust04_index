			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's largest industrial company, BHP, says  it has been unaffected so far by the tension between Vietnam and  China over the disputed Spratley Islands in the South China Sea.  BHP is a partner in a consortium which is expected to begin  producing oil later this year from the Dai Hung field in the  Spratlys. The consortium leases the field from Vietnam.    Company's chief executive, John Prescott, has said in Hanoi  that nothing BHP was doing or plan to do in Vietnam was impaired  by the company's assessment of the political situation.  However, Mr. Prescott did express disappointment at new figures  on the likely oil reserves in the Dai Hung oil reserves in the  Dai Hung field which was originally thought to hold 800 million  barrels. The Dai Hung field is expected to produce up to 35,000  barrels a day when it goes into production next October.</p>

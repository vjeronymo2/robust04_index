			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (11): Lions lie down with lambs  -German Economy / Christopher Huhne on a left-of-centre viewpoint The Reshaping of the German Social Market by David Goodhart Institute for Public Policy Research, Pounds 7.50 83 pages The Germans gave us the word Schadenfreude - delight in others' misfortunes  -but this ignoble sentiment is by no means confined to its country of origin. Indeed, the Germans themselves have recently become the butt of rather too much Schadenfreude from their Anglo- Saxon cousins, some of whom relish the difficulties faced by the hitherto miraculous German economy. Reports of Germany's demise, however, are premature. Much of that analysis, spurred by the Germans' own taste for self-doubt, is no more than the product of the business cycle and the transient difficulties of reunification. Germany is emerging from a prolonged and deep recession, a time during which it is easy to gain an audience for the proposition that the present gloom will extend for ever. Yet the pessimists are usually just as wide of the mark as the optimists who see economic rejuvenation at the top of every boom. The truth is more interesting, as David Goodhart argues in a thought-provoking review of the German experience. The German model - what Michel Albert called the Rhine model of capitalism and what the Germans call the social market - is under strain. Its social safety net is being tested by an ageing population and the collapse of employment in the eastern Lander caused by monetary union at an ill-judged exchange rate. Germany's industries are facing low-wage competition not only from Asian newly-industrialising countries, but also from closer to home in Silesia, Bohemia and Moravia. Its reputation for fiscal orthodoxy has taken a battering at the hands of sky-high budget deficits. It is at least arguable, Goodhart concedes, that Germany's skills in mechanical engineering and a natural bent for incremental improvement were appropriate to a second industrial revolution of cars and consumer goods rather than the third revolution of science and technology. But German strengths should not be underestimated. This is a country with 345 industries that have a world market share of more than 10 per cent. Germany's wage-bargaining system has also delivered a fall in unit wage costs of 6 per cent since the start of 1993, an example of wage flexibility unparalleled in other European labour markets. There is, of course, a lot of politics wrapped up in all this. Goodhart is writing for a left-of-centre think tank and has set out to recapture the German social market as an example for social democrats rather than the Thatcherite right. He is persuasive. Germany is indeed characterised by a large number of institutions and relationships that Anglo-Saxon liberals of the well-brought up variety find intrinsically shocking. Lambs lie down with lions in the supervisory boards of German companies and this flirtation with corporatism extends through banks that own large slices of companies, centralised wage bargaining between employers and big sector-wide trade unions and employers' organisations that set training goals. Where Anglo-Saxons expect conflict, Germans serve up a puzzling degree of co-operation. Goodhart points out that firms benefit from a relationship of trust with their employees because they can invest in their knowledge and skills with less fear that they will walk out of the door. If Goodhart's analysis is to be faulted, it is that he does not lay enough stress on another aspect of the German model which may be less to the liking of the British left. Post-war Germany has been fiercely committed to competition in product markets, enforced by an admirably tough competition in law and by an aggressive Bundescartelamt that makes the Monopolies and Mergers Commission look as dangerous as an overfed tabbycat. With some notable exceptions in declining industries such as coal, Germany has also been thankfully immune from the belief that the government can usefully intervene in industry. Goodhart contends that Germany's style of capitalism will endure in spite of a gradual breakdown of union influence and widening pay differentials, some withdrawal of the banks from their position in corporate governance, a rise in the influence of the equity market and a shift of much high-labour content production outside Germany together with the growth of real German multinationals. Within Germany, the relatively small service sector ought to be able to grow rapidly to take up the slack. But what of the lessons on this side of the Channel? Britain's economic institutions have been travelling rapidly away from the Rhine model and towards the US one over the past decade, but that may not continue to be the case. Goodhart cites interesting evidence about the preferences of British managers for a 'stakeholder' company suggesting UK attitudes may be more in line with Germany than with the US. Goodhart rightly warns against too glib an import of German institutions, but he sets out three policy options that might nudge Britain in Germany's direction. The first is encouragement to institutional investors, which own more than 70 per cent of quoted Britain, to take a more active role in the companies they own, as the German banks do. The second is the introduction of supervisory boards with employee representatives. The third is to boost the training and enterprise councils  -now responsible for much of Britain's training effort - by making corporate membership compulsory for companies above a certain size. By the standards of recent years, these are radical proposals. But I doubt that the relative performance of Britain and Germany over the next 10 years will expunge them from the agenda. The Rhine model is not new. Its essential features were in place under Bismarck. It has delivered Europe's most enduring economic success for over a century and it is unlikely to stop now.</p>

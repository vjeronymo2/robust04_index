			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Panel censures two of Dowty's advisers THE NOT so gentle art of ear bending, whispered innuendo and off-the-record muck-raking that are part of all hostile bids took a knock yesterday when the Takeover Panel censured two of the professional advisers to Dowty, the aerospace group taken over by TI in June. The Panel reserved its most serious criticism for Burson-Marsteller, Dowty's public relations company, which it said had made 'serious breaches of the Takeover Code'. The unusual force of the Panel's censure was helped by a tape recording of a conversation between a Burson director and an independent analyst. The over-zealous Burson director was captured on tape saying that Dowty would make pre-tax profits of Pounds 55m in the year to March 1993, a forecast Dowty was not able to make formally under the terms of the Takeover Code. The same director said that Dowty had found a buyer for its information technology division, a statement wide of the mark and described by the Panel as 'material new information' but 'incorrect'. Lazards, Dowty's financial advisers, were also criticised for being 'unable to control the release of information by their client's public relations advisers'. Under pressure from TI five days before the offer closed, Dowty was forced to state that the Pounds 55m profits forecast being whispered at deafening levels around the market was not based on anything it had said. The Panel said it made no distinction between comments made by advisers 'off the record' and those made in a more formal manner. 'There are many ways of implying information and opinions during discussions without specifically stating such information or opinions', the Panel said. Such utterances were likely to represent breaches of the code.</p>

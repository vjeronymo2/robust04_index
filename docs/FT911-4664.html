			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar and sterling rally THE DOLLAR and sterling rallied in subdued foreign exchange trading yesterday. Against a confused interest rate background, the dollar moved higher as traders squared positions ahead of today's German Bundesbank council meeting and looked for further evidence about the timing of any cuts in US and Japanese rates. US trade figures for February will be published today and are expected to show a smaller deficit than January's Dollars 7bn, with some economists looking for a trade gap of less than Dollars 6bn. If this proves correct it would help to underpin the dollar, but would be regarded as largely historic and unlikely to clarify the timing of any US move out of recession. Attention has focused on interest rate trends and a possible rise in German rates at a time when the US and Japan may be about to ease. The Federal Reserve did not intervene on the New York money market yesterday. There had been some speculation that the Fed would add liquidity, to offset pressure at the end of a two-week maintenance period, but the authorities stayed out of the market as Federal funds traded at the assumed target of 6 per cent. Speculation has increased this week that the Bank of Japan intends to nudge short-term interest rates lower, but Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, said yesterday that there has been no change in Japanese monetary policy. Nervousness ahead of today's Bundesbank council meeting and rumours about lower Japanese rates pushed the D-Mark up against the yen. The German currency rose to Y81.50 from Y80.95 in London. The dollar held in a tight trading range but gained ground against European currencies and the yen. At the London close it had climbed to DM1.6725 from DM1.6650; to Y136.35 from Y134.80; to SFr1.4270 from SFr1.4175; and to FFr5.6550 from FFr5.6275. The dollar's index rose to 64.6 from 64.5. Sterling eased against the stronger dollar, but was otherwise firm. It stayed the second strongest member of the European exchange rate mechanism, supported by lack of pressure for any further cut in UK bank base rates. The pound fell 65 points to Dollars 1.7820, but rose to DM2.9800 from DM2.9775; to FFr10.0775 from FFr10.0650; to SFr2.5425 from SFr2.5350; and to Y243.00 from Y241.00. Its index was unchanged throughout the day at 92.9. The Spanish peseta was strong, at the top of the ERM. Tuesday's news that Spain has scrapped nearly all exchange controls, allowing residents to open foreign currency accounts while lifting the limits on lending pesetas to non-residents, failed to reduce demand for the currency. High interest rates in Madrid, and the failure of the Bank of Spain to ease its monetary stance, kept upward pressure on the currency.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sixth, the Order states that the Commission has decided to exercise its forbearance authority regarding several Title II provisions in order to maximize market competition. The Order finds that the Commission's forbearance actions will promote competition, and that application of the three-pronged test set forth in section 332(c) of the Act warrants forbearance from many Title II provisions. In general, the Commission has forborne from enforcing any tariffing requirements, and from exercising Commission authority to investigate into existing and newly filed rates and practices, to collect intercarrier contracts, to require certification concerning interlocking directorates, and to require Commission approval relating to market entry and exit (respectively, sections 203, 204, 205, 211, 212, and 214 of the Act). The Commission, however, did not forbear from provisions that are unrelated to Commission authority and regulatory obligations (section 210), are primarily reservations of Commission authority (sections 213, 215, 218, 219, and 221), or are consumer protection-related (sections 223, 225, 226, 227, and 228). In addition, in the case of cellular service, the Order states that the Commission will shortly issue a Notice of Proposed Rule Making to establish monitoring provisions applicable to the cellular marketplace. The Order further provides that the Commission will issue a Notice of Proposed Rule Making addressing whether the Commission should adopt further forbearance actions under Title II of the Act in the case of specified classes of CMRS providers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seventh, the Order requires local exchange carriers (LECs) to provide reasonable and fair interconnection for all CMRS because the Commission sees no distinction between cellular carriers to whom LECs are currently required to provide such interconnection and all other CMRS providers, including PCS providers. The Order also provides that if a LEC provides interconnection to CMRS providers while denying the same interconnection to PMRS providers, the carrier would bear the burden of demonstrating why such practice does not constitute a violation of Title II of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eighth, the Order concludes that Congress, in revising section 332, intended to preempt state and local rate and entry regulation of all CMRS. The Order establishes a range of procedural and other requirements states must meet if they seek to retain any existing CMRS rate regulation or initiate such rate regulation for the first time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Order implements provisions of the Budget Act that establish effective dates for the ``regulatory treatment'' amendment to the Communications Act and set forth deadlines for an orderly transition to the changed regulatory structure. The Budget Act established a three-year transition period during which ``any private land mobile service provided by any person before such date of enactment, and any paging service utilizing frequencies allocated as of January 1, 1993, for private land mobile service shall *&blank;*&blank;* be treated as private mobile service.'' With respect to private land mobile services, the Order interprets this language to mean that the three-year transition applies to all private land mobile licensees who were licensed, and therefore authorized to provide service, as of August 10, 1993. On the other hand, the Order provides that private mobile licensees who are subject to reclassification as CMRS and were not licensed as of the enactment date of the Budget Act, are not subject to the three-year ``grandfathering'' period, and will therefore be treated as CMRS as soon as the Commission's rules go into effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission concluded that Congress did not intend the transition period to apply in a rigid fashion to pre-enactment licensees and that it did intend some flexibility in the implementation of these transition provisions. The Commission determined, therefore, that it will allow grandfathered licensees to modify and expand existing systems and to acquire additional licenses in the same service for which they were licensed prior to August 10, 1993. In addition, with respect to non-grandfathered licensees, the Commission concluded that reclassification should be effective upon the effective date of the Commission's transitional rules for reclassified services; these rules will be considered in a separate rule making. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to paging services, the Order finds that the transition period applies more broadly. The Commission concluded that Congress specifically provided that all paging licensees ``utilizing'' private paging frequencies allocated as of January 1, 1993, are to be treated as private mobile radio service providers for three years. The Commission noted that the Conference Report accompanying the Budget Act explains that paging was treated separately to prevent states from attempting to restrict entry of paging licensees on private frequencies prior to the effective date of the Commission's preemption regulations, which do not go into effect until August 10, 1994. The Commission concluded that all private paging licensees are to be treated as private mobile service providers, regardless of whether they were licensed before or after the date of enactment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Ordering Clauses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, it is ordered that the rule changes made, as specified below, will become effective 90 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , pursuant to sections 4(i), 4(j), 7(a), 302, 303(c), 303(f), 303(g), 303(r), 332(c), and 332(d) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;154(i), 154(j), 157(a), 302, 303(c), 303(f), 303(g), 303(r), 332(c), 332(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is further ordered, pursuant to sections 4(i), 4(j), and 332(c)(1)(A) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 154(j), 332(c)(1)(A), that all commercial mobile radio service providers with tariffs on file with the Commission shall cancel such tariffs. Cancellation shall be by supplement effective upon five days' notice and the supplement shall reference this Order as authority for cancellation. For this purpose, &sect;&sect;61.58 and 61.59 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 61.58, 61.59, are waived. These cancellations shall be filed no later than July 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is further ordered that the Petition for Special Relief Concerning Enhanced Mobile Radio Applications and Authorizations filed by Bell Atlantic Mobile Systems, Inc., is denied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

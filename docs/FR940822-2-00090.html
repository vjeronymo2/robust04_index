When a Limited Partnership Rollup Transaction is Presumed Not to be Unfair or Unreasonable.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i), the NASD proposes to define a series of circumstances with respect to limited partnership rollup transactions which are presumed not to be unfair or unreasonable. In accordance with the Rollup Reform Act, it is presumed not to be unfair or unreasonable if dissenting limited partners are offered one of the following: an appraisal and compensation, retention of a security with substantially the same terms and conditions as the original limited partnership, approval of the rollup transaction by not less than 75 percent of the outstanding units of each participating limited partnership, or other comparable rights designed to protect dissenting limited partners. Protections for limited partners also include the right of limited partners not to have their voting power unfairly reduced, the right of limited partners not to bear unfair costs associated with a rollup transaction that is rejected, and certain restrictions on abusive changes in management fees and compensation. As noted above, dissenters' rights may be asserted only by a person who, on the date that rollup soliciting material is mailed to investors, is a holder of a beneficial interest in the limited partnership that is the subject of the rollup. The proposed rule change would require a transaction constituting a ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' to include one of the provisions set forth in Subsections (b)(6)(C)(i) a., b., or c., discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Compensation Based on Appraisal:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)a. provides that dissenting limited partners must receive compensation based on an appraisal made by an independent appraiser, unaffiliated with the sponsor or general partner of the program. The appraisal provided should consist of an accurate measure of the present financial value of the dissenting investor's ownership interest in the underlying assets of the limited partnership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Forms of compensation based on appraisal may include cash, secured or unsecured debt instruments, or freely-tradable securities. Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i) imposes several conditions upon the issuance of debt instruments to ensure that the debt issued is equivalent in value to the cash payment and, if readily marketable, would likely trade in an aftermarket at such value. <FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>  This is intended to prevent dissenting investors from being forced to accept debt instruments which, reflecting their below-market value, would immediately trade at a substantial discount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> All debt instruments must provide for a trustee and an indenture, and provide for prepayment with 80% of the net proceeds of any sale or refinancing of the assets of the entity. All debt instruments must provide the holders with a market rate of interest equal to at least 120% of the applicable federal rate and have a term not longer than 8 years. Unsecured debt instruments may be used only when the entity issuing the debt has a limitation on total leverage not greater than 70% of the appraised value of its assets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Freely-tradable securities may be utilized as compensation only if issued by a company which has been listed on a national securities exchange or traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market prior to the transaction. The number of freely-tradable securities offered in return for partnership interests would be determined in relation to the average last sale price of the securities in the 20-day period following the date of the meeting at which the vote on the rollup occurs. <FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>  If the issuer of the freely-tradable securities and the sponsor or general partner are affiliated ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  if it receives any material compensation from the issuer or its affiliates in conjunction with the rollup transaction or the purchase of the general partner's interest), and the securities issued as compensation are new securities, such securities must not represent more than 20% of the issued and outstanding securities of that class after issuance. The 20% limitation on the amount of securities offered as compensation by an affiliate helps to establish a threshold below which significant dilution could be presumed not to have not occurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In response to a comment by the ABA, the NASD clarified that the ``freely-tradable securities'' referred to in Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)a.4. would be valued at a 20-day period ``following the date of the meeting at which the vote on the limited partnership rollup occurs. The `vote' referred to may be a vote, consent, or authorization.'' See Amendment No. 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Receipt of a Security With Substantially the Same Terms and Conditions:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)b. provides that dissenting limited partners may receive or retain a security with substantially the same terms and conditions as the original issue if certain conditions are met. Retention of a security under the same terms and conditions as the original issue means the provision of a security that has the same characteristics as the dissenting limited partners' original limited partnership interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Comparable Rights: Supermajority Approval, Review by Independent Committee, and Other Comparable Rights:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)c. permits members and persons associated with members to participate in a limited partnership rollup transaction as long as the transaction includes ``other comparable rights'' provisions designed to protect the rights of limited partners. This Subsection is intended to provide flexibility for sponsors and general partners in structuring rollups, while at the same time providing protections for limited partners. ``Comparable rights'' may include the right to supermajority approval of the transaction, the right to review of the transaction by an independent committee, or such other rights as the NASD deems comparable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (i) Supermajority Approval. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  General partners will not be required to provide the right of compensation, as provided in new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i) where at least 75% of the outstanding units of each of the individual limited partnerships participating approve the rollup transaction. Any limited partnership that fails to reach the 75% threshold must be excluded from the rollup transaction. The proposed rule change, however, would permit a limited partnership rollup transaction to be consummated even though individual partnerships did not approve the transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (ii) Review by Independent Committee. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed rule change relating to review by an independent committee will require that the committee: (1) Be approved by a majority of the outstanding securities of each participating limited partnership; (2) have access to the books and records of the partnership; (3) prepare a report to the limited partners that are the subject of the rollup presenting its findings and recommendations, including any minority views; (4) have the authority to negotiate the proposed transaction with the general partner or sponsor on behalf of the limited partners, but not the authority to approve the transaction; (5) deliberate for a period no longer than 60 days unless unanimously agreed upon by the members of the independent committee or if approved by the NASD; (6) may be compensated and reimbursed by the partnerships subject to the limited partnership rollup transaction and have the ability to retain independent counsel and financial advisors to represent all limited partners at the limited partnerships' expense; and (7) be entitled to indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by law from the general partners, sponsors, limited partnerships, and rolled-up entities against claims, causes of action or lawsuits initiated by any party in interest, including limited partnerships or limited partners, related to any action or decision made in furtherance of their responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (iii) Other Comparable Rights. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Comparable rights for dissenting limited partners are not limited to supermajority approval or the establishment of an independent committee, but may include any other comparable right proposed by general partners or sponsors, provided that the general partners or sponsors demonstrate to the satisfaction of the NASD, or if the NASD determines appropriate, to the satisfaction of an independent committee, that the rights proposed are comparable. <FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The composition of such independent committee to review proposed alternative comparable rights under this provision may be different than the independent committee formed pursuant to proposed Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)c.2. Additionally, the criteria utilized by the independent committee to review proposed alternative comparable rights under this provision may differ from that required by the independent committee formed pursuant to proposed Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)c.2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3. When a Rollup Transaction is Presumed to be Unfair or Unreasonable. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Regardless of compliance with Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i), a limited partnership rollup transaction will be presumed to be unfair or unreasonable, pursuant to new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii) <FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>  if: (1) Certain actions taken by the general partner result in the unfair conversion and valuation of general partner interests in a limited partnership rollup transaction; (2) a limited partnership rollup transaction fails to protect the voting rights of the limited partners; (3) the transaction costs of a rejected limited partnership rollup transaction are unfairly apportioned or allocated; or (4) the payment of fees to general partners in connection with limited partnership rollup transactions are unfair, unreasonable, or inappropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 42 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Where a limited partnership rollup transaction is determined by NASD staff to include one of the arrangements considered to be unfair or unreasonable, the member bears the burden of rebutting the presumption by demonstrating that the arrangement is not unfair or unreasonable or that the arrangement does not come within one of the enumerated unfair and unreasonable arrangement provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The  sources said the decision will be formally announced at a  two-day international conference on Cambodia to be held in Tokyo  from March 10.    Japan allocated 8.4 billion yen in grant assistance to  Cambodia in the current fiscal year ending March 31. The fresh  funds will go toward such projects as rehabilitation of  Cambodia's national route 6, restoration of a power plant in  Phnom Penh and improvement of water supply and drainage in the  capital.    Tokyo has invited representatives of 31 countries, the  European Union and 12 international organizations to attend the  second meeting of the International Committee on Reconstruction  of Cambodia.    Japan pledged in 1992 to provide between 150 and 200 million  dollars to Cambodia over a three-year period covering fiscal  1992 to 1994. Foreign Ministry officials said Japan has since  disbursed around 190 million dollars, making it the largest  donor nation.</p>

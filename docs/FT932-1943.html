			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / SPD's leader in pledge to challenge Kohl MR Rudolf Scharping, the youthful new leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats, yesterday moved rapidly to consolidate his position, announcing his determination to challenge Mr Helmut Kohl for the chancellorship in next year's elections. His decision aims to end in-fighting within the troubled opposition party, and was announced with the public support of Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the deputy leader and state premier of the Saarland, who was the SPD candidate for chancellor at the last elections. Mr Scharping, aged 45, who is currently state premier of the Rhineland-Palatinate, made clear his determination to keep the important strings of party leadership in his own hands, by taking over as chairman of the committee to draft the party's 1994 election manifesto, under the heading Germany 2000, a job previously held by Mr Lafontaine. The new leader will be formally confirmed as party chairman on Friday, at an emergency congress in Essen, although the choice of candidate for chancellor will only be formally made next year. He said he would announce a government team by July 5. His move follows three sets of 'intensive talks' with Mr Lafontaine over the past week since Mr Scharping emerged as the clear victor from an unprecedented poll of party members to choose a new leader. In persuading his deputy to bury his own ambitions, he was undoubtedly strengthened by recent opinion polls, which showed Mr Lafontaine as one of the few SPD leaders whose popularity is actually lower than that of Chancellor Kohl. In the magazine, Der Spiegel, published yesterday, a poll suggested that Mr Scharping would narrowly defeat Mr Kohl by 39 per cent to 36 per cent in a battle for the chancellorship. If Mr Lafontaine stood, he would lose by 32 per cent to 46 per cent, it said. Although Mr Lafontaine is far more colourful than the cautious Mr Scharping, he is also far more controversial, and has never recovered from his disastrous election campaign in 1990, when he (quite correctly) warned of the economic problems certain to arise from German unification. At that time, the German electorate simply did not want to know, and voted for the optimistic chancellor.</p>

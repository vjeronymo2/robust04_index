			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Technology: Making monoclonal antibodies The first step is to inject a mouse with a disease-causing agent and extract antibody-producing cells from its spleen. These are fused in the laboratory with myeloma (cancer) cells to make hybridomas - immortal antibody-producing cells that grow and divide indefinitely in a fermentation tank. One hybridoma can produce billions of clones, all producing the same monoclonal antibodies. Such antibodies have occasionally been used on their own to activate the body's natural cell-killing mechanism. But researchers usually make them more lethal by linking them to a poison molecule or to a radioactive isotope.</p>

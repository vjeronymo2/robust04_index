			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 32 MILLION LIVE IN POVERTY, CENSUS BUREAU REPORTS  </P> <P> Nearly 32 million Americans lived in poverty in 1988, the Census Bureau  reported Wednesday, marking the second straight year in which the nation made  no significant inroads against poverty despite a continuing economic expansion.  </P> <P> "It looks like this is as low as it's going to get for a while, and it isn't  very low," said Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities, a private research group. "It is disturbing that, despite a sixth  year of economic recovery, both the nation's poverty rate and the income of a  typical household showed no significant improvement."  </P> <P> However, the Census Bureau found some cause for encouragement in the report,  pointing to a 1.7% increase in per-capita personal income last year.  </P> <P> "It's a year basically in which most groups stayed the same or improved," said  William Butz, the agency's associate director for demographics.  </P> <P> The poverty rate fell from 13.4% in 1987 to 13.1% last year, and the number of  impoverished people dropped from 32.3 million to 31.9 million.  </P> <P> Whites, blacks and Latinos made no significant gains in 1988, leaving wide gaps  between the three groups' poverty rates: 10.1% for whites, 31.6% for blacks and  26.8% for Latinos.  </P> <P> Both the number of poor people and the poverty rate have been inching down  since 1983, but each still exceeds the recent low points, set in 1978, when the  poverty rate was 11.4% and 24.5 million people were impoverished.  </P> <P> The poverty line last year was $12,092 for a family of four.  </P> <P> Greenstein said that there has been a lack of progress against poverty recently  because the benefits of the economic expansion are flowing disproportionately  to the wealthiest Americans.  </P> <P> The poorest fifth of the population received 4.6% of total national family  income in 1988, the lowest percentage since 1954, but the richest fifth  received 44%, the highest ever recorded, he said.  </P> <P> The Census Bureau reported also a jump in real per-capita income last year, to  a new high of $13,120. Blacks made bigger gains than whites but still lagged  far behind.  </P> <P> Income of whites rose 1.5% to $13,900; income of blacks increased 3.9% to  $8,270. Per-capita income of Latinos was virtually unchanged at $7,960.  </P> <P> There were notable income gains in certain parts of the country. Median  household income shot up 3.7% to $30,430 in the Northeast and rose 2.6% in the  Midwest to $27,540. Household income dropped 1.4% in the South to $24,610 and  0.6% in the West to $28,840, but neither decrease was considered significant.  </P></p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Property: Green belt in danger of buckling - Paul Cheeseright on pressures on the use of land in the UK's West Midlands region Planners in the West Midlands are waiting for Mr John Gummer, the UK environment secretary, to deliver his regional planning guidance, the document which will lay down the broad patterns of land use for the next 20 years. The West Midlands Forum of Local Authorities has given Mr Gummer its advice: it is anxious to regenerate the cities. The authorities have been expecting his response since April. He is probably still pondering the provision which ought to be made for new housing. But his guidance, when it comes, has broader implications than that. Mr Gummer has made clear his opposition to more out-of-town shopping centres. Beyond that, the guidance should make clear the government's view on how to balance the claims for economic development inside and outside urban areas. The guidance should set out how to cope with the trend towards decentralisation which has seen companies moving operations from larger centres to smaller ones. In that context, a crucial element is the treatment of the green belt, the area around the towns and cities where, if there is property development, there has to be a very good reason for it. Planners and property companies share, in general terms, the view that cities need a green belt around them. 'A key factor in achieving a pattern of sustainable development will be to maintain the region's two green belts. They are major regional assets that provide environmental benefits as well as aiding regeneration of the areas they surround,' the West Midlands Forum advised Mr Gummer. 'Like most sensible people we understand the general requirement - to prevent the coalescing of big urban lumps,' said Mr Anthony Glossop, chief executive of St Modwen Properties, referring to how Walsall on the north-east side of the Birmingham-Black country conurbation might sprawl to meet Cannock to the north. 'The green belt has been around since 1947. It has a valid role. It needs to be applied sympathetically and reviewed from time to time - which it is,' said Mr Nick Mason-Jones, managing director of Bryant Properties. It is these questions of application and review which stir the most argument, pitting the planners and environmentalists, against the market. 'We're saying that the emphasis throughout the West Midlands should be about urban regeneration,' said Mr John Finney, one of the planners at West Midlands Forum. That means that the green belt should be protected, that development should be drawn back into the cities rather than allowed outside them. But that is easier said than done. The West Midlands planners would like to draw development in to the north and west of the region, to the Black Country and Staffordshire, where the local economies are weakest. However, the commercial pressures for space are more evident on the south and east of the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation. 'There is a danger of overheating in the south and south-east, where there is the greatest pressure on areas of attractive landscape,' said Mr Finney. Ideally, planners want more activity to strengthen the north and west, while relieving the south and east. This, paradoxically, might put more pressure on the green belt. 'There is little, if any, land on the periphery of the conurbation that is not designated green belt. Over the past decade this has resulted in growth pressures jumping into the surrounding shire counties,' says Mr Joe Valente of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, chartered surveyors. The shire counties are now resisting growth. The effect will be to direct more growth into the metropolitan districts, 'some of which will have to be located within existing green belt areas,' said Mr Valente. It is the perception of the demand for space and the pervasiveness of the existing green belt which underlies the industry's demands for relaxing the green belt. The level of demand is difficult to quantify but, at Arlington Securities' Birmingham Business Park, south of the city and on land extracted from the green belt, space was being taken in the depths of recession as decentralisation continued. Mr Jim Johnston, Arlington's regional director, noted that companies such as Hewlett Packard, Honeywell, Norwich Union and Fujitsu Fulcrum, had moved or were moving from the inner city. Business park rents are lower than those of the central city, but the gap is narrowing. Inevitably, companies are governed by their own interest rather than that of the planners when they take space. To forbid development in one place is not to secure it for another. 'If it's not allowed to take place in Worcester, will it take place in Dudley?' asked Mr Valente. The West Midlands Forum is trying to have the best of both worlds. To satisfy business demands to get out of town, it has adopted a policy of premium industrial sites, to make good the deficiency of larger, high-quality sites in the conurbations, recognising that some of these sites may have to be in the green belt. The premium sites policy provides a safety valve; it gives away a little of the green belt, but keeps the mass. However, the West Midlands Forum observed that 'the property industry tends to equate premium industrial sites with the standard B1 Business Park, that is primarily out-of-town office development in campus form'. That is unacceptable to the planners who argue that 'only those activities which could not be located within existing urban areas will be permitted. However, development must be complementary to, rather than competitive with, urban regeneration'. There is plenty of potential dispute within that definition, establishing what Mr Glossop called 'the difference between principle and practice'. The more flexibility on green belt boundaries, the less the trouble with the industry and the more the trouble with environmentalists. Perhaps Mr Gummer will clarify how much room an elbow needs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- The director-general of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Peter Sutherland,  said here today that China should be part of the world trade  system rather than outside the system.    Sutherland made the remarks in a brief interview with XINHUA  on his arrival at the Beijing International Airport.    The GATT chief, invited by Wu Yi, Chinese minister of  foreign  trade and economic cooperation, will meet with Chinese leaders  to discuss China's resumption of its contracting party status in  GATT.    He said that this particular visit takes on particular  importance in regard to timing since it immediately follows the  Marrakech meeting last month, at which the overall documents of  the Uruguay Round talks were signed.    The world is on the eve of the creation of the new trading  order as a result of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round,  Sutherland said, and he hoped that the new order in terms of the  world trade organization would come into existence by the  beginning of next year.    The chief said that from the viewpoint of the rest of the  world, it is the desire that China should be part of the system  rather than outside it.    It has been said that the negotiation process is a difficult  one which has been pursued for years, but, he said, "we are very  anxious that the negotiation process should be pursued speedily,  constructively and with a view to finding solutions to any  difficulties that may remain."    And therefore, it is a matter of some urgency to speed up  the  negotiation process. All parties involved in the negotiations  have to cooperate to find solutions and bring China into the  world trade organization.    China's enormous importance, politically and economically,  to  the world is evident, Sutherland said, and China's integration  into the new world trade system will be helpful to world trade  development.    As it is the first overseas trip he has taken since the  Marrakech signing of the Uruguay Round, Sutherland said, it  shows the extreme importance with which the world's largest  trade body views China's re-entry.    Long Yongtu, assistant minister of foreign trade and  economic  cooperation, welcomed the chief at the airport.    Long said that China attaches much importance to the chief's  China visit and expects that the visit will help push forward  the negotiation process on the restoration of China's GATT  membership.    China's development needs the world and the development of  world trade also needs China, Long said, and China is willing to  make due contributions to world trade development.</p>

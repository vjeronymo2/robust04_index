			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KIDS AT MOVIES (CONT.)  </P> <P> After reading Dr. Joseph Herman's Dec. 10 letter criticizing Barbara Marcus'  desire to restrict children under the age of 5 from movie theaters, I strongly  regret that he wasn't sitting next to me last Saturday evening as a 3-year-old  boy in front of me talked throughout the entire funeral scene of "Steel  Magnolias." Then he, too, could have had the climax scene of the film  completely ruined.  </P> <P> As an early-childhood education teacher, I know the limits of young children. I  think it's cruel for parents to expect their toddlers to sit quietly and still  for two hours at a movie that holds no interest for them.  </P> <P> If we cannot restrict toddlers from movies, maybe the theaters could take a  lesson from restaurants ("smoking" and "non-smoking") and offer seating in  "talking" and "non-talking" sections.  </P> <P> SETH E. CUTLER  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

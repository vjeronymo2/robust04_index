Most  frequent cases were registered in Balti, Soroca and Chisinau.  Drug business is especially practiced by Gypsies from the  republic's north, who have a special conspiratorial layout.  According to the quoted source, drug addictions increased  between Gypsies. Last year, 12 hectares of poppy and 120  hectares of other plants have been discovered and liquidated.  Moldova is especially interesting for the "Balkan way," by  which the drug traffic is made from Asia to West Europe.  Attempts were made as Moldovan addicts do not have the needed  finances. Moreover, drugs produced in Moldova are of same  quality as the Asian. According to experts, one U.S. dollar  invested in drug business brings an annual income of $10,000.  Presently, one glass of poppy raw material costs 5 lei, and a  glass of acetylene used for preparing drugs costs 4 lei. The  Ministry of Health does not have the needed finances and a  special hospital to cure addicts. Vitalie Bruma added.</p>

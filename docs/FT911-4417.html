			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Peugeot shows resilience by holding fall to 10% PEUGEOT, France's largest car group which also includes Citroen, yesterday displayed its greater resilience to recession than some competitors, by announcing a 10.1 per cent decline in profits last year. Net earnings fell to FFr9.2bn (Dollars 1.64bn) last year, from FFr10.3bn in 1989, marking the end of five straight years of growth. Turnover rose by 4.6 per cent to FFr159.9bn from FFr152.9bn over the same period, while net profit margins shrank slightly to 5.8 per cent from 6.7 per cent. That is a much smaller decline and shows wider margins than Renault, the group's state-owned rival, which recently reported an 87 per cent drop in profits, reflecting its higher borrowings and greater exposure to the depressed truck market. However, Mr Jacques Calvet, Peugeot's chairman, said the group had missed several targets in a 'stormy' year, and confessed pessimism over the advance of Japanese competition and the general outlook for the European car market. 'European markets, which were in general on a gently climbing slope in the first four or five months of 1990, then went into a moderate slowdown which was expected before the Gulf crisis, while the end of the year was characterised by a steep drop in registrations, notably in November and December,' he said. European car demand fell by 4.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year, against the same period of 1990, and was heading for an overall average decline of 5 per cent for the full year, Mr Calvet estimated. Peugeot's European market share rose slightly to 12.9 per cent, below its 13 per cent target. Production was roughly unchanged at 2.2m vehicles - 1.4m Peugeot and 812,000 Citroen - while sales volumes fell slightly to 2.19m last year from 2.2m vehicles in 1989. Foreign sales accounted for more than 58 per cent of unit volumes, slightly more than the 56.9 per cent in 1989. Peugeot's break-even point, meanwhile, rose from annual sales of 1.12m vehicles to 1.5m, reflecting pressure on margins and irregular production flows. Productivity rose by 5.2 per cent, again below target, said Mr Calvet. Group debts rose from FFr1.9bn to FFr8.3bn last year.</p>

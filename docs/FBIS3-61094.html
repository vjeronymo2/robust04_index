			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Excerpts from an unpublished book by Sergey Plekhanov: "The </F> Man Who Stunned Everybody"]    [Text] Yes, of course, it is he--Vladimir Volfovich  Zhirinovskiy.    For some, he is an obvious fascist, extremist,  instigator.... Oh, my, how much more havoc will he wreck in  politics?    For others, he is a dark horse, who with a sudden dash  at the elections to the State Duma overtook the "overfed,"  self-confident trotters.    For still others, he is simply a favorite of fortune:  He came, promised the sky--and the gullible people fell under  the spell and voted for him....    One way or the other, the name of Vladimir Volfovich is  on everyone's lips these days. By publishing today an excerpt  from Sergey Plekhanov's book (not yet published, by the way, due  to a quite obvious attitude on the part of publishing houses  toward the author), we will attempt to appraise a figure who is  relatively new on the political scene. What is the Zhirinovskiy  phenomenon? What forces have brought this formerly obscure,  ordinary jurist to the crest of high power? Finally, does  Vladimir Volfovich have a future, and what then can Russia  expect from him?    Questions, questions.... This article--which, we want  to emphasize, represents only one viewpoint--will not answer  them all, of course. There may be other opinions. The editors  will be presenting them to RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA readers in the new  year.  <H5>  He Had Already Been a Presidential Candidate </H5>   I sit on a cheap, threadbare sofa next to an equally shabby  desk and look at a tall, large man in a tuxedo and a brilliantly  white shirt. He adjusts the knot of his tie in front of a mirror  attached to the closet door.    This gorgeous outfit is in jarring contrast with the squalid  surroundings, so painfully familiar from tens and hundreds of  dwellings of our compatriots that I have seen over many  years.... A man in a tuxedo, who looks like a messenger from  another world brought to the sorry, orphaned Russian soil by  some unknown force is nevertheless the owner of this sad  two-room apartment on the 14th floor of a regular Soviet  apartment house.    Vladimir Volfovich casts a last glance at himself in the  mirror before we leave for a television debate of Russia's  presidential candidates.    We all rise and file out of the apartment. The door opens,  and we are accepted into the belly of a typical Soviet elevator,  reeking of urine and covered with unprintable graffiti.    Downstairs, everything is also covered with drawings and  scribbles, bearing witness to the irreversible regression of  humanity since the times of the Neanderthals, who amused  themselves in the same way, by drawing on the walls of their  caves. Intermixed with them are announcements informing the  tenants about the distribution of sugar coupons, and the repair  and maintenance department's orders. Not a single indication  anywhere, however, that a man who lives in this wing is a  presidential candidate....    The aluminum door, with its broken combination lock, opens,  and we find ourselves in the street, facing a cortege of  varicolored cars. The most luxurious among them is  Zhirinovskiy's white Moskvich. Two old rustbuckets on worn-out  wheels accept on board members of the team of a contender for  the highest office in the country, and the cortege speeds up  along the road cutting through Sokolniki Park.    We disembark from the cars at the entrance to the television  center. The leadership of the information empire and television  debate moderator Igor Fesunenko hurry towards the prehistoric  autos.    Almost at the same time, black limousines with Ryzhkov's  team  pull up. The former prime minister with a firm step walks from  his Volga toward Fesunenko. A mutual introduction follows.    Two presidential candidates stand next to each other. They  are of about the same height, slender, dressed in black. But  Zhirinovskiy produces a better effect--whether it is the silk  lapels or his youth, but in comparison with yesterday's head of  government he looks more striking.... And my mind, for some  reason, flashes back incongruously to the small two-room  apartment, a den filled with motley furnishings, and a half-ajar  door bound with vinyl on the inside....    The calendar shows 11 June 1991. Tomorrow are the  presidential elections. I, however, think back to that August  day in 1989, when I for the first time heard in the telephone  receiver Zhirinovskiy's distinctive voice--a little raspy,  sharp, abrupt....    He called me after reading in the papers the appeal of  the organizational committee for the march of solidarity with  the Russian population of the Baltic countries. The idea of that  march was mine, and it was also I who took upon myself the  organizational side of it--arranged to pay for 10 buses, and  with the help of a people's deputy secured a motorized GAI  [state motor vehicle inspectorate] escort for the march.    Zhirinovskiy liked the idea of a demonstration against  the Baltic nationalist forces, and he said that he himself and  several of his confederates would participate. In the end, he  was not able to take the trip, however, because he had to leave  for Turkey during the time the march was held.    When at the beginning of May 1991 I heard on the radio  an interview with Zhirinovskiy, who by then was in the  presidential race, I immediately recognized his voice. So I  called the Moscow Hotel, where his headquarters were located.    Having learned that I was working on a book about the  right-wing movement in Russia, he immediately invited me to come  over....    The candidate's energy had a contagious effect on everyone  around him; as if, having entered a powerful magnetic field,  people sharply changed their routes. The same happened to  me--Zhirinovskiy listened to me and said abruptly: "Come ride  with me; we will talk on the way; you will see and write down  everything you need." And for a week, taking a detour from my  normal routine, I remained in his orbit.    A month later, when the presidential campaign was already  behind us, I was on a train, traveling on business. My fellow  traveler, a young female physician, chattered nonstop, telling  me about her hospital, its chief physician, her colleagues. Her  entire world was divided into Leos, Sagittarians,  Cancers--apparently she never read anything except horoscopes.  The chief physician, as one would expect, was the most prominent  character in her tales: "You see, he is a classic Pisces--  nervous, edgy.... You know, I once saw on television an  interview with Zhirinovskiy--I think he is a typical Pisces. Do  you know by any chance his birth date?..."    Even an astrology enthusiast did not remain unaware of the  political show organized in holy Russia in the first weeks of  June 1991....    Nevertheless, Zhirinovskiy is not a Pisces--he is an Aries.  He was born on 25 April 1946 in Almaty. His loud voice was heard  by the entire huge population of a three-room apartment, which  his family had received three years before his birth. During the  war, however, because of the influx of refugees, Vladimir's  mother and her five children had to make room for more people.    An impression of something many-headed, yelling, constantly  moving--this is Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's first recollection of  the world surrounding him. And this perception of life as a  bazaar, as endless hubbub, which came to him with the first  glimpse of self-consciousness, remained with him almost until  the age of 30: a childhood in a communal apartment; a child care  facility (five days a week with overnight stay); school, pioneer  camps, university dormitory, Army billets and dormitories. Only  at the age of 28, having purchased a cooperative apartment on  the outskirts of Moscow, did he gain peace and time for  contemplation....  <H3>  Many of Those Around Him Believed That Zhirinovskiy Was a  Loser </H3>   Asking Vladimir Volfovich questions about the years of his  childhood and youth, I was hoping to collect some vivid tidbits  that would help to present the process of his spiritual coming  of age. But my interlocutor kept emphasizing that he had lived  for decades in the stagnant and stifling atmosphere of universal  poverty, a human bazaar; not even a bazaar--a flea market. The  latter definition of our society reflects its nature  best--trading second-hand things, living off what had been  earned by previous generations.    In school, he was not a bright star, but did rather well.  Considering that this was the best school in Almaty, one would  assume that Vladimir Volfovich's classmates would have reached  prominent positions. Zhirinovskiy explained to me in an  easy-to-understand way, however, that this logic applies in  other geographic zones. The point is that the best school in  Almaty was a Russian school, and there was only one Kazakh in  Zhirinovskiy's class. Therefore, when old school friends  gathered together for a 20-year reunion, it turned out that no  one had achieved anything in this life: All the young talents  became good, ordinary engineers, doctors, teachers,  metalworkers, electricians, and drivers.... Had they been  Kazakhs, with all other conditions being equal, the classmates'  reunion would have looked different: ispolkom [executive  committee] chairmen, raykom [rayon party committee] secretaries,  high-ranking officials in the Council of Ministers or the  Central Committee of the local communist party, distinguished  figures in science, directors of trade warehouses and stores,  members of creative unions....    Over the decades of "reverse colonialism," the Russians  in all national-state entities on the periphery of the former  Russian Empire have become skilled servants of "indigenous  nations," which concentrated in their hands the land and its  output, the distributive functions and power. Suppression of  national self-consciousness of the Russians was carried out in  accordance with the Old Testament directives of the Bolshevik  center going back to the 1920's, when "international" dictators  were running the Kremlin. Swift and decisive confiscation of  property from Russians and a forcible placement of "national  cadres" in positions of power already by the end of 1930's had  formed the social conditions for the emergence of  national-communist regimes.    Today President of Kazakhstan Nazarbayev says:    "I openly admonish and warn adventure-seekers who are  suffering from nostalgia for our evil past: We will not allow  any changes in the borders between republics, which are  recognized as inviolable in interrepublic treaties and  declarations of state sovereignty. Neither will we allow to hold  on the territory of Kazakhstan any celebrations of anniversaries  of the Cossack service to the czarist regime, let alone  formation of Cossack units."    It looks as if no talk of the dignity of national  cultures and self-determination of nations reaches Kazakhstan.  On the contrary, entire villages that had never had anything to  do with this region are moving in from the territory of China  and settling in the lands of the Semirechnyy Cossacks. They are  Kazakhs, and in the logic of the local authorities, they possess  the right of primogeniture.  <H5>  National-Bureaucracy. What Is It? </H5>   A majority of the Russian population of the former Soviet  Union only now is haltingly learning of the existence of a  national-bureaucracy and the oppression of their kin in  "brotherly republics." Vladimir Zhirinovskiy belongs to that  minority, which experienced this relatively mild oppression  since childhood. For the first time the minority is gaining a  voice.    For a Russian who grew up in Russia, the notion of land as a  common good is automatically assumed; for a Russian living among  the aborigines of Asia or Caucasus, such a perception of the  world is impossible. A Russian who is by the fact of his birth  separated from ownership of land may be blown off the settled  place by the winds of enmity at any moment....    Going to the countryside here, in Russia, we perceive the  surrounding landscape as air, as native language--this is  something that cannot be separated from our very being. A  Russian going to a countryside over there sees the  world with completely different eyes. This may explain why our  compatriots living in those parts are strictly urban folks  deprived of the life-nurturing connection  "countryside--land--city," which one way or the other defines  the being of a full-fledged nation.    The suffocating atmosphere in which Russian "guest workers"  grow up and the impossibility of jumping outside of the social  status preordained for you result for most in a loss of national  dignity; people of this kind become patriots of the climate and  material supply, ready to go on for hours bragging about prices  at a farmer's market and describing what and how much they have  stored for the winter. There is no worse a creeping Philistine  than a Russian who has accepted his role of second-class  citizen. The usual topics of his conversation do not transcend  the canning--clothing--housing concerns. And only a small number  among those millions of Russians who have been dispersed by the  hurricanes of history over the Asian and Western outskirts of  the former empire find themselves able to overcome their "white  slavery...."    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy came to Moscow after graduating  from high school, with a firmly established interest in  international politics. The Moscow University's Institute of  Oriental Languages [IOL] was one of the few institutions of  higher learning that opened to its graduates a road into this  sphere. These same institutions also traditionally had been the  breeding ground for the elite.    The Turkish studies group, where Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  was accepted, consisted of only six students: a general's son, a  deputy minister of foreign affairs' son, the son of a  high-ranking official in the CPSU Central Committee, and the son  of the chief of a main administration of the State Committee for  Foreign Economic Relations. A boy from a poor family, who made  his home in a dormitory on Lenin Hills and who was barely able  to make ends meet thanks to the modest amounts of money sent by  his mother, could not, of course, count on becoming friends with  young bon vivants. They had money and fashionable rags; they  could use their parents' cars and dachas, where they could  entertain girls.    In 1964, when Zhirinovskiy came from Almaty, flared  pants had just become a fad in Moscow, and the future  administrators of international policy spent much more time  talking about them than about the fall of Khrushchev, which  occurred on the second month after they began their studies.  Over all the years in school, the everyday priorities of the  "golden youths" have practically not changed, while Zhirinovskiy  eagerly absorbed the new and gradually began to show himself as  a personality. By the end of his studies, instead of a shy,  unsure provincial boy, his classmates discovered an independent  and even obstinate young man.    An internship trip to Turkey was the first peak in  Zhirinovskiy's life. Having worked for several months as a  translator at various objects of Soviet-Turkish economic  cooperation, he saw both big cities and backwaters. In those  times the Soviet Union was not yet in such neglect as it is  today, while Turkey had not reached its current stage of  Westernization; therefore, one may assume that a stay in that  country would not have instilled in an IOL student a great  reverence for Western civilization. But neither did he engage in  communist propaganda here. Both mutually exclusive accusations,  however, have been thrown at Zhirinovskiy: first by those who  had secretly made the decision to bar a specialist in Turkey  from any more foreign travel, and then by the knights of freedom  from the emboldened Soviet press....  <H5>  Can You Believe This? He Engaged in Communist Propaganda </H5>   The episode when the Turkish police arrested the  student-intern for distributing Soviet pins was interpreted by  such mass media in a manner worthy of Goebbels: He engaged in  communist propaganda and was properly punished.    It appears that this old episode involving Zhirinovskiy made  an indelible impression on the official Soviet authorities. When  in 1988 I went to Turkey as a member of a writers group, at the  then-compulsory briefing I heard the incantation: Under no  circumstances are you to give away pins with Soviet symbols;  better still, none at all, to avoid problems with the police.    I do not know whether this incident had any bearing on  Zhirinovskiy's subsequent career, but the fact remains that  despite excellent grades in his diploma, instead of exotic  countries he was sent to the Transcaucasian Military District.  Two years wearing a lieutenant's shoulder boards was not the  destiny of those connoisseurs of fashion, wine, and female  beauty riding in the parental limousines--they had their futures  laid out for them regardless of the results of their exams.    Two more years of barracks and dormitories, and Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy regained freedom of action. He came to the Soviet  Peace Committee, where he would eventually deal with Western  Europe. He was fed up with the East and gladly began studying  German. In addition to foreign language courses, he also took on  another burden, enrolling in the evening study at the MGU  [Moscow State University] School of Law. Despite all his  academic and linguistic successes, however, the road to the free  world remained closed to him.    His peacekeeping activities did not last long--only two  years. He had to surrender his job to a niece of the then  secretary of the CPSU Central Committee. She immediately began  hopscotching all over the world--nobody even asked her whether  she were a member of her powerful uncle's party....    Zhirinovskiy, meanwhile, had to take a job at the trade  union  movement higher school, where he worked for a short while in the  bursar's office handling the affairs of foreign students. Then  he moved to the Inyurkollegiya [the Foreign Legal Collegium  under the Moscow City Bar]. All these jobs seemingly were  associated with international affairs; nevertheless,  Zhirinovskiy was still not permitted to travel abroad: perhaps  because he was not a communist party member, or perhaps for some  other reason....  <H5>  That Is What Is Amazing: He Was Never Ahead of His Time </H5>   This dreary, grounded life went on for decades. For many  years he made a living as legal counsel of the Mir publishing  house. The 40-year watershed he approached without any  particular achievements--no dacha; no decent car.... Had it not  been for the changes that began after 1985, Zhirinovskiy, as  millions of middle-rank intelligentsia like him, would be  looking at an unenviable fate, with a 120-ruble pension and a  six-hundredths of a hectare garden plot as the crowning  achievement of his life.    When he said at rallies: I am one of you; I live in the  same kind of two-room apartment, am paid the same 200-ruble  salary--he told an absolute truth. That is why a study of the  Zhirinovskiy phenomenon can contribute much more to the  understanding of the political potential of an ordinary Soviet  man than a figure reflecting a rating of some or other public  figure.    When I asked Vladimir Volfovich from what age he began  to feel himself a "political man," realized that his views were  different, contrary to the officially imposed ideology, he said  that he divides his spiritual evolution into three stages. At  about the age of 21 he felt the need to formulate his views.  Another 10 years passed before he could tell himself that he was  not satisfied with the political situation in the country--this  more or less coincides with the adoption of the 1977  Constitution.    But the true awakening of his political temperament  Zhirinovskiy dates to the beginning of perestroyka. His  evolution at that time was again typical for the main masses of  the intelligentsia. During the first years of liberalization he  unquestionably supported Gorbachev, sympathized with Yeltsin as  an underdog ("I was very upset when he was not elected to the  Supreme Soviet at the first congress of people's deputies," says  Vladimir Volfovich). It was only at the end of 1990 and the  beginning of 1991 that Zhirinovskiy believes his divergence from  the official reformers' political course began.    Thus, he was never ahead of his time--he did not serve time  in prisons, did not participate in the dissident movement, did  not write "for the drawer;" like huge numbers of people of his  circle, he habitually grumbled about obviously stupid things  committed by the Soviet system, told jokes, occasionally praised  the "rotting" [capitalism]. He did not create the current  situation--it created him as a politician.    And this is very important, since Zhirinovskiy has,  figuratively speaking, the same blood type, the same arterial  pressure, the same pulse as the middle class, with a middle-age  population, who have reached the zenith of their life with empty  pockets.    Unlike those dissidents who, like Sakharov, Gleb Yakunin,  Sergey Kovalev, or Revolt Pimenov, found themselves sort of  living relics at the get-togethers of communist conformists, who  have created a number of illusory parties, Zhirinovskiy does not  feel himself an honorary general at well-attended rallies. While  for "democrats" the presence of such persons is a necessary  condition to prove the legitimacy of their gatherings,  Zhirinovskiy strives to earn this legitimacy from his own  compatriots who, like him, have had collectively participated in  both the good and the evil of their time.    It is indicative that he practically never turns to any  authorities to reinforce his claim on power. None of the holy  names of the democratic love-ins are dropped in his speeches.  And those historic figures he does refer to as personification  of his political ideal--Count P.D. Kiselev, P.D. Milyutin, S.Yu.  Witte, P.A. Stolypin--signal to the audience: You have in front  of you an intellectual, an expert on history, and a politician;  he is a step above his competitors from the official camp. They  started as tractor drivers or construction brigade foremen, and  then for decades studied the science of meanness and servility  in obkom [oblast party committee] corridors, while I, an  ordinary intellectual pushed to the back seat of society,  devoted decades of my outwardly ordinary life to the task of  developing my mind: I studied the French, English, German,  Turkish, and Arabic languages; I am a specialist on Eastern  cultures and have a jurist's diploma; I have studied in depth  the past of our country; I am knowledgeable in the most complex  political issues, ethnic and social. I am familiar with modern  economic theories. Hence, I am made from different ingredients  than those who lay claim to power, although they had a lot of  time to show their abilities. Refuse them your trust; give the  mandate to run the country to a new politician--someone who  understands problems big and small that each of us faces, who  does not carry on his shoulders the burden of mistakes and vices  of the old elite....    If we analyze the makeup of Zhirinovskiy's supporters,  it will turn out that the majority of those who voted for him  are young people--those who look up not so much to authorities  as to themselves. Language and terminology understandable to  them make Zhirinovskiy sharply different from his competitors,  who are used to talking to the audience either in the wooden  language of bureaucracy or in the bird language of intellectual  gatherings.    While the press was taking apart Zhirinovskiy's  biography, relishing a few spicy episodes such as spending time  in a Turkish prison, the ordinary voter was deciding for himself  a simple question: "Do I or do I not like him?" In the final  analysis, all components of the image--appearance, manner of  speech, language--gradually form a personal attitude to a  politician. Zhirinovskiy, who did not have the support of the  press, enjoyed the highest "personal taste" rating: People  either adored him or rejected him.  <H5>  Still, Why Do People Listen to Him Attentively? </H5>   Now the time has come, however, to give thought to that  complex of ideas he drew on--after all, in a political struggle,  the heat of emotions is in direct correlation with the  radicalism of statements and their correspondence to the  frequency to which the masses are tuned. In this respect,  Zhirinovskiy has also turned out to be a phenomenon.    First, nobody expected of him the words that sounded in his  speech at the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia and on  television. Neither those who bet on Yeltsin nor communist  dogmatists nor patriotic forces. For all of them Zhirinovskiy's  statements were like a cold shower--all competing programs  looked, when compared to the election manifestos of the totally  unknown upstart, like a collection of platitudes. He was  brighter, bolder, and easier to understand than all the regular  actors on the perestroyka scene, and the solutions for political  and economic problems offered by him looked actually  implementable.    The LDP [Liberal-Democratic Party] leader made the main  issue  of his program the issue of national-state system. He traced all  the country's troubles to 1922, when by Lenin's scenario the  Bolshevik authorities conducted an administrative reform as a  result of which Russia was dismembered into a score of large and  small quasi-state entities according to ethnic principle. In  those times, creation of such structures was not dictated by an  outbreak of nationalism, as one would think projecting into the  past today's situation. On the contrary, it was a very difficult  task to carry out in illiterate precivilization areas, populated  by nomads. The uninformed cattle-breeders had to be dragged by  their ears into newly formed structures. Which means that  Lenin's design was not aimed at pacifying local separatists  thirsting for independence.    In order to rule over the enslaved people, the new masters  needed the support of those who under no circumstances could  claim the right to power under the normal course of  events--lumpens and foreigners; they needed to create on a broad  scale all-encompassing state structures, which were filled with  those promoted from the lower strata and so-called national  cadres. If the former could become at the initial stage the  bulwark against a potential restoration of a Russian ethnic  elite, the latter became a counterbalance against such a  development on a more long-term basis.    The Bolshevik dictatorship could not last very long,  because it did not have in its set of tools anything except  violence and organized lowering of the culture. But if the new  rulers managed to split the subjugated country by ethnic  attribute, then the new bureaucracy, which would receive power  from them, would become a reliable ally, because the Russian  nation in this case became their common enemy. Its suppression  was conducted in a hidden form--it was impossible to keep it  from moving into positions of leadership, but a capitulation of  nationality of sorts could be made a condition of it.    No strictly Russian institutions of power were created  in the country--even the ruling party, which was built on the  territorial-administrative principle, for some reason "did not  notice" the largest republic; what was permitted for the big  Ukraine and the small Estonia was not permitted for the enormous  RSFSR. And any attempt to create a Russian Communist Party was  an offense subject to capital punishment (the latest  example--the "Leningrad affair" in the end of the 1940's).    The newly created system of quasi-republics begat multistage  structures manned by "national cadres," and today, in the  environment of disintegration of the totalitarian regime, these  hierarchies lacking vitality should have, as many thought,  disintegrated, together with the machine of power that had  produced them. Strange as it may be, however, the latter-day  "democrats" do not even consider breaking up the parasitic  entities that feed numerous ranks of all sorts of "political  statesmen," "scholars," and "cultural figures." This entire  semifeudal guard could not be competitive within a framework of  a modern pluralistic society and would have to inevitably give  way to more capable and socially useful people in all spheres of  activities.    In the northern areas of Kazakhstan, where the presence  of the indigenous population measures in several percentage  points, the "Leninist national policy" used to border on the  ridiculous. A terrible commotion in a Karaganda construction  trust--there is no suitable candidate for a trade union  committee chairman: The director is a Ukrainian, the party  committee secretary--a Russian, so the third member of the  "triangle" cannot possibly be a non-Kazakh. It so happens,  however, that in the entire trust there is not a single son of  the steppes! Finally they find a semi-literate Kazakh woman who  works as a timekeeper, and ceremonially present her to the  bosses. A common sigh of relief is heaved: A national cadre is  in place, and nobody will be able to find fault with  them....    Zhirinovskiy has said what the democrats, who at every  convenient occasion branded the vices and crimes of the  communist regime, has never dared to say; this politician said  for all to hear that the fallacious system of promotion by  ethnic criteria should be scuttled; that it is necessary to  dismantle Lenin's construct of 1922. This is the root of all the  problems of today's Russia.    Zhirinovskiy's recipe is simple: In order to overcome the  permanent crisis, we need to get rid of the artificial division  by the national-territorial criteria and restore the old  principles: The province is the main unit of administrative  division of the country; nations' rights to self-determination  are realized in the sphere of culture; individual rights take  priority over the rights of a nation.    The LDP chairman has not invented anything new--these  sensible foundations already realized in democratic states  ensure stability and individual freedoms. No other country has  ever had as burdensome a bureaucratic apparatus and all sorts of  national subunits in science, culture, and the political sphere  as the Soviet Union did. Neither the multiethnic India nor  Indonesia nor African countries populated by tribes speaking  different languages--none have adopted the principle of  national-territorial division, because it represents a ticking  time bomb capable of destroying the state at the time of any  crisis. Let alone the fact that none of the modern democratic  constitutions contains a clause on the right of individual  territories to secede from the state.  <H3>  History Is the Best Teacher. But for Some Reason There Are  Few Good Pupils </H3>   By various estimates, there are between 1,500 and 3,000  peoples and languages in the world, but only a little more than  150 sovereign powers. This means that the self-determination  principle is not universal at all; not every ethnic group is  capable of creating a vital state. Besides, the prevalent trend  in the most cultured regions of the planet is rapprochement of  countries and people for the sake of solving economic, social,  and ecological problems. And an increasing number of global  crisis phenomena makes such a movement toward unification  irreversible.    Naturally, no historic lessons and objective trends set an  example for flaming patriots of minute "fatherlands"--especially  keeping in mind that their personal destiny depends completely  on the realization of separatist dreams. Still, it would be  useful to look into the recent past, for then we would see that  all of this already has happened and all turned out much ado  about nothing....    The Austro-Hungarian, as well as the Ottoman, Empire  was perceived as a "sick man of Europe" in all the capitals of  the world long before the advent of the twentieth century. The  question of its disintegration had been massages in the press  for decades. The first crack in the Habsburg empire formed in  the course of revolutions of 1848. In order to assuage the  nationalist aspirations of Hungarians, the German dynasty  decided to change the state formula: The Eastern Empire  (Osterreich) was replaced by a two-in-one monarchy. But this  step did not stop the centrifugal tendencies: The Slavic  population of the empire thirsted for independence. There was  some talk about a three-in-one formula; even some names were  tried on for size: "Austro-Slavo-Hungary" or something along  these lines. But the "sick man" problem was resolved in a much  easier way--as a result of a military defeat, the empire was  pulled apart piece by piece with the benevolent consent of the  victorious powers.    Former Austro-Hungarian provinces went over to Poland,  Soviet Ukraine, Romania, Yugoslavia, and so on. A community of  nations turned into a bevy of small states, which for two  decades warred among themselves, and then were occupied by the  Third Reich. The map of the world was recut once again, and the  former Austro-Hungarian provinces again found themselves under  the thumb of an empire--this time a communist one. And now we  witness a new chapter in their history.    Yugoslavia has disintegrated; the former parts of the  Austrian reich--Croatia and Slovenia--separated from it. And we  hear increasingly loud voices in favor of restoring a long-dead  superpower--at first perhaps in the form of a confederation. The  first participants are identified: It is unlikely that Austria  and Hungary, Croatia, and Slovenia can exist for long as  autonomous entities....    So the question is: Why was it necessary to spill seas of  blood? For what gain did the political demagogues of the end of  the past and the beginning of the current century push nations  toward a disintegration of their common house? Anyway, it is an  idle question--there is no one to be held responsible.    We are, however, able quite consciously to address our  doubts  to modern Masariks and Pilsudskiys: Are they certain that in  seven or eight decades, having drunk the cup of suffering, the  nations they lead will not condemn their names, and the wheel of  history will not creakingly make a full turn and the buried  empire will not rise again like a sunken continent?</p>

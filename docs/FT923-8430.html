			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Day of misery for equities in Europe and Tokyo SHARPLY FALLING share prices in Tokyo set the tone for a day of European stock market misery yesterday. Equities closed substantially lower on European bourses as local factors added to the gloom. On Wall Street, the falls on overseas markets unnerved investors when trading in New York opened, but by the close the earlier losses had been recouped. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 5.4 at 3,337.58. Japan's 225-share Nikkei average lost 2.91 per cent to close at 15,066.34, its lowest level since April 1986 and more than 61 per cent down from its record high in December 1989. In the UK, the FT-SE 100 index fell to an 18-month low, losing 24.4 to 2,325.7. Germany's DAX 30 index lost 26.95 to 1,582.55, its lowest level since January 8. Other Continental bourses saw even sharper losses. In Tokyo, private investors ignored an attempt to talk up the market by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, and continued to move out of equities on fears about the country's economic outlook. The Nikkei continued its downward trend in early trading today, shedding more than 60 points after half an hour. In London yesterday , the 1 per cent drop in the FT-SE index was small compared with the falls on many continental exchanges. In Germany the DAX index dropped 1.7 per cent as foreign funds sold equities. Fears of weak six-month profit figures and company staff cuts fuelled concern that the country might be heading for recession. The Milan and Oslo stock mar kets both lost 2.6 per cent of their value. As Italian investors continued to react unfavourably to last week's discount rate cut, worries surfaced that the government will be unable to raise its planned 7 trillion lire from privatisations and asset sales.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran will not take part in  the Western-inspired arms race in the Persian Gulf. The  commander of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Navy [Rear Admiral  'Ali Shamkhani], who is currently in Bandar-e 'Abbas, announced  the above today and added that Western news agencies' propaganda  that Iran is competing with other countries in the region in the  purchase of arms and military equipment is false. He said: The  arms race Westerners have started in our region is more  profitable to them than arms races in other parts of the world.  In fact, this is plundering the wealth of the Muslim people of  the region.    The Navy commander also said: The Islamic Republic of Iran  has to gain enough strength to protect 2,000 km of its marine  border, but it believes it can strengthen its defensive  capabilities by relying on its internal strengths and  capabilities.</p>

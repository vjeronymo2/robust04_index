			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AD SLUMP CONTINUES FOR MAGAZINES AS TV GRABS A BIGGER SHARE  </P> <P> The recession that gripped the magazine industry earlier this year showed  little sign of easing in the second quarter, according to figures released  Tuesday by the industry's leading trade group.  </P> <P> Total advertising pages, off 3.5% in the first quarter from the year-earlier  period, slid 3.3% for the first six months of 1990, the Magazine Publishers of  America said.  </P> <P> The figures are derived from a survey of 173 member magazines.  </P> <P> The continued weakness was a disappointment for industry officials who have  predicted that the slump would be no more than a brief interruption in growth.  </P> <P> The two categories of advertising that were most to blame for the weakness  showed no improvement in the second quarter. Tobacco advertising, off 25% in  dollar value for the first quarter, was off 27% for the first half. Auto  industry advertising, down 7.4% for the first three months, was off 12.5% for  the first six months.  </P> <P> Magazine analysts said that in a year of generally flat advertising budgets,  many major advertisers have been apportioning more to television, to keep up  with cable's expansion and the increase in network TV rates.  </P> <P> "To keep pace on the TV side, advertisers don't have as much to spend on  magazines," said David Lehmkuhl, an independent magazine consultant in New  York.  </P> <P> Among the top 10 revenue-producing magazines, the ad page comparisons for the  six-month period were:  </P> <P> Time, down 8%; People, down 10%; Sports Illustrated, down 17%; TV Guide, down  10%; Newsweek, down 9%; Business Week, down 9%; Forbes, up 8%; Good  Housekeeping, up 7%; Fortune, down 6%, and U.S. News &amp; World Report, down  4%.  </P></p>

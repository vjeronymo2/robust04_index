			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Teodoro Petkoff: "Caldera and the MAS Now"] </F>   [Text] During the electoral campaign, there was an effort  to discredit the participation of the MAS [Movement Toward  Socialism] in the game by noting the similarities to the  operations, seen so often in Venezuelan politics, carried out by  certain political forces that have leaned against the strongest  tree solely in the hope of surviving. In this connection, it  would be well to remember that the closer relations between the  MAS and Caldera began in 1989. It was then that the idea was  gaining ground among us that a break between Caldera and his  party--barely perceptible at that time--would inevitably mean a  significant change in the Venezuelan political-party picture,  creating the conditions for the development of a wide breach in  the bipartisan wall. This strategic option took on an additional  dimension after the events of 4 February, when it became clear  that the bar could be set even higher. Caldera's candidacy could  serve as the focus of a confluence of forces capable of  defeating bipartisanism, rather than simply breaching it. And so  then, as of 1990, the country began to see movement toward  creating an alliance. There were sporadic and calculated  statements by some MAS leaders, as well as Caldera himself,  indicating willingness to attend a meeting. There was the noisy  presence of Caldera at the MAS convention in Los Caracas in July  of 1990 (when the group of leaders gathered there  enthusiastically made it clear how far their preferences went,  and Caldera made a point of his conviction that an agreement  with the MAS would not by any means displease him). And there  was even the folkloric detail, in the best sense of the word, of  the domino game with Caldera, which said more than 100 articles  ever could have.    It is clear, then, that Caldera's victory constituted a  political success of no small importance for the MAS--perhaps  the greatest in its history, along with the achievement of its  own birth. Prejudices, misunderstandings, and a certain leftist  inertia had to be overcome both within and outside the MAS to  make possible the crystallization of that strategic achievement  represented by the perception of the tremendous potential in the  "non-COPEI [Social Christian Party]" candidacy of Caldera. But  it should be noted that the veteran leader also had to face  prejudices, misunderstandings, and a certain conservative  inertia in order to facilitate a convergence with the MAS, and  then with other lesser forces, without which he knew perfectly  well he could not win. In this connection, Caldera's vision of  the breadth of the alliance and his courage in maintaining his  standards, although he knew that his adversaries would attempt  to exploit his alliance with "the communists" to discredit him  with his traditional supporters, provide the measure of the  courage of this leader and statesman.    In all of his speeches and televised appearances, Caldera  took pains to emphasize the presence of each of his supporters.  He began with the MAS, and always ended with a respectful and  very courageous reference to the PCV [Communist Party of  Venezuela]. This provided a lesson not only for a country that  urgently needed to put sectarianism and subordinate quarrels  behind it, but also, most certainly, for those who were not  clear in their own minds that his victory would only be possible  if the votes of every little faction, however modest, were added  together. The result could not have spoken more eloquently. Of  all the votes for Caldera, 35 percent were "orange" and nine  percent represented the other groups and parties in the  alliance. Without that 44 percent of the total, Caldera could  not have become president. The veteran leader made no mistake,  then, when, despite the efforts made to ridicule his  undertaking, he tried to avoid excluding anyone, however  unimportant he might be.    The MAS participated in this alliance without imposing any  type of bureaucratic conditions, so traditional in the rigid  structure of Venezuelan politics. We drafted a strategy and we  implemented it. The important thing was to triumph over  bipartisanship, to release the country from the paralyzing AD  [Democratic Action]-COPEI straitjacket, to adapt the political  structure, and to encourage the implementation of policies  different from those that at the end of a 35-year period had  plunged the country into its deepest crisis. The measure of our  success was Caldera's victory, and not the size of a certain  bureaucratic quota to which we might have aspired on the basis  of the political traditions imposed by the AD and the COPEI. In  fact, the MAS does not have the slightest intention of involving  itself in those ignoble bureaucratic tangles that have  contributed so much to discrediting the Venezuelan political  system.    However, that having been said, it is not hard to understand  that the MAS presence in the government is necessary. It is  required in order to face up to the tremendous demand for  political change expressed by the combined votes of the Caldera  alliance and La Causa R. The country voted against the AD and  the COPEI. The country gave new protagonists a mandate. The  country would lose confidence in a government that failed to  express, in a realistic and cautious measure, the collective  desire that other people assume leadership responsibilities.  Fortunately, Caldera understands this perfectly, as was the case  with the alliance to the creation of which he contributed in  order to win. The futile effort to blackmail him with the  presence of the MAS in the alliance, which, had it been  successful, would have led to his defeat, will not sit well now  either. Where the MAS is concerned, just as it knew how and was  able to participate in the campaign without trying to steal the  show, aware that in the final analysis, it was certainly a  relatively weak faction, it will also know how and will be able  to make its presence felt in the government without creating  unnecessary vulnerabilities. As for the rest, God will provide.</p>

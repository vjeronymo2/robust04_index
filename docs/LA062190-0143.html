			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HITACHI TO MERGE SOUTHLAND SALES, PRODUCTION UNITS  </P> <P> Hitachi Ltd. will merge two Southern California divisions in a move to  strengthen its position in the highly competitive U.S. consumer electronics  market, company officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Anaheim-based Hitachi Consumer Products of America Inc. and Hitachi Sales Corp.  of America in Compton will be merged in October into a new company to be called  Hitachi Home Electronics of America Inc., based in Compton.  </P> <P> The new unit will combine Hitachi's television and videocassette recorder  manufacturing plants in Anaheim and Tijuana, Mexico, with its sales and  marketing force in Compton.  </P> <P> Takehiko Kataoka, president of Hitachi Sales, the Japanese-based parent's U.S.  marketing arm, said an official announcement of the merger will be made today  in Tokyo. Company sources said Kataoka is expected to be named president of the  new company.  </P> <P> The merger will not result in any major changes in management or employment at  the Anaheim, Compton or Tijuana operations, Kataoka said, adding that "no one  will be fired."  </P> <P> A Hitachi executive, who asked not to be identified, said the merger includes  moving some production of 27-inch and larger TVs from Japan to the United  States, where demand is strong for large-screen TVs.  </P> <P> The Anaheim and Tijuana plants will continue to make VCRs but will cease  manufacturing of 19- to 26-inch TVs. Production of those models will be moved  to the Far East, the Hitachi executive said.  </P> <P> Last year, the Anaheim and Tijuana plants produced 20,000 color TV sets, mostly  19- and 20-inch models. Hitachi manufactures about 90% of the large-screen TVs  it sells in the United States in Tokyo, Hitachi officials said.  </P></p>

He was speaking to about  12,000 people attending an ANC rally at Bisho Stadium, site of  the 1992 massacre of 28 ANC supporters by Ciskei Defence Force  troops.    "It is not easy to talk about peace in that situation. In  spite of that we want to heal the wounds of the past, we want  reconciliation, because without reconciliation we will not be  able to give our people a better life."    He had spoken to Ciskei military leader Brig Oupa Gqozo  several times before the massacre and "literally begged" him to  work with the democratic movement. He had also spoken to  Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope and was going to speak to  the kwaZulu chief minister on Tuesday.    The bloodshed and the political and economic uncertainty in  the country could not continue. "That is why, with all  humility, I am talking to every leader in this country. I will  not stand on dignity or prestige or any popularity that might be  enjoyed by our organisation. I will go down on my knees to beg  those who want to drag our country into bloodshed and to  persuade them not to do so."    This was why he was going to meet Chief Buthelezi in Durban.  "I want him to participate in this election."</p>

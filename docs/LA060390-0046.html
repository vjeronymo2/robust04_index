			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE MOVIES: THE WEEK'S OTHER PRIME-TIME FILMS  </P> <P> Steven Bauer is wasted in the silly, old-fashioned 1984 Thief of Hearts (KCOP,  Sunday at 6 p.m.) as a sleek burglar who falls for a high-tech interior  designer (Barbara Williams) when he reads the drivel in her stolen diaries.  </P> <P> Michael Apted's well-made but thin 1984 Firstborn (KCOP, Monday at 8 p.m.)  finds Teri Garr's vulnerable, well-fixed divorcee falling for an  all-too-obviously dangerous loser (Peter Weller), viewed by Garr's sons with  increasing horror.  </P> <P> Sunburn (KTTV, Wednesday at 8 p.m.) finds Charles Grodin as a cocky, nebbish  insurance investigator looking into a death in Acapulco and renting Farrah  Fawcett to cover as his wife. Sloppy, witless, forced, characterless.  </P> <P> The deft Back to the Beach (KCOP, Wednesday at 8 p.m.) imagines that Annette  Funicello and Frankie Avalon of all those "Beach Party" movies of the early  U60s got married and settled down in Ohio. The film is nostalgic without being  embarrassing and knowing without being either cruel or cynical.  </P> <P> Richard Franklin's 1981 Road Games (KTLA, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a nifty  Australian thriller starring Stacy Keach as a truck driver and Jamie Lee Curtis  as a hitchhiker who are pursued by a killer across a vast desert. Nice  Hitchcock touches along the way.  </P> <P> Battle Beyond the Stars (KTTV, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a "Star Wars" carbon with  a "Seven Samurai" plot; cut-rate but blessed by a sense of humor.  </P> <P> Terence Malick's 1978 Days of Heaven (KCOP, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is one of the  most beautiful color films ever made, a poetic turn-of-the-century love  triangle set against a wheat harvest in the Midwest and involving Richard Gere,  Brooke Adams and Sam Shepard. Nestor Almendros won an Oscar for his glorious  70mm camerawork.  </P> <P> The Kidnapping of the President (KTLA, Friday at 8 p.m.), a not-bad 1980  theatrical production that was sold directly to TV, stars Hal Holbrook as a  U.S. President who fails to heed the warning of Secret Service deputy director  William Shatner that a group of South American terrorists may be planning to  disrupt his visit to Canada. With Van Johnson and Ava Gardner.  </P></p>

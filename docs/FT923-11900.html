			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / SPD puts embargo monitoring in doubt GERMANY'S continued participation in the allied monitoring of the UN embargo on Serbia and Montenegro was thrown into doubt last night by a challenge from the Social Democrat (SPD) opposition. A meeting of the SPD Bundestag members voted by a large majority for the issue to be put to the federal constitutional court. Before yesterday's round of talks, which will be followed by an emergency Bundestag sitting today, some members wanted a ruling from the court which would force the government to withdraw the destroyer Bayern and three surveillance aircraft ordered to join the allied monitoring force last week. Some, including Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, parliamentary party chairman, claimed the aim was simply to clarify a 'grey area' in the constitution, while others supported the government line that Germany should be prepared to play its full role in international affairs. At issue is a vague clause in the constitution which has in the past been generally accepted as confining German armed forces to within the Nato area. It has not yet been tested in court. The SPD, outraged that the government ordered forces to join the UN and Western European Union monitoring exercise without consulting parliament, appeared to be in danger of damaging its already fragile consensus. Mr Hermann Heinemann, an SPD minister in the North Rhine Westphalia state government, denounced the attempt to have the court rule, saying Germany could not stand aside from measures aimed at securing peace.

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Kepco lists Dollars 300m of ADRs in New York Korea Electric Power has become the country's second company to list on the New York Stock Exchange, raising about Dollars 300m in a global equity offering of 14.9m American depositary shares. The move by Korea's biggest company by capitalisation further signals a trend by Asian and Latin American companies to raise capital through ADSs or global depositary receipts - paper which represents underlying shares. Kepco issued 14,906,832 ADSs in its offer, which was co-ordinated by Lehman Brothers. They were priced at Dollars 20 1/8 , a premium of 5 per cent over the last local share price, but fell to Dollars 19 3/4 in early trading. Each ADS represents two common shares. Pohang Iron &amp; Steel Company (Posco), the world's second largest steelmaker, was the first Korean company to issue ADSs when it raised about Dollars 300m in New York earlier this month. Korean companies were recently given permission by the government to list their shares in New York, London and Tokyo. Korean companies have been active in the GDR market, with seven issuing Dollars 473.9m in GDRs this year (compared with three issuing Dollars 328.2m in 1993), according to figures produced by Euromoney Bondware. Total GDR issues by Hungarian, Turkish and a range of Asian and Latin American companies have amounted to more than Dollars 5.5bn compared with Dollars 2.1bn in 1993, according to the same source. Indian companies have topped the league of GDR issuance this year, raising about Dollars 2.39bn.</p>

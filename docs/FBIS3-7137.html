			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-chun: "We Mean What We Say"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. warmongers are escalating the policy of  crushing [apsal] the DPRK. As has been known, U.S. President  Clinton on 22 March ordered Patriot missiles to be deployed to  South Korea and, accordingly, some 40 missile launch vehicles  and the Patriot missile battalion consisting of 800 troops began  to move from Texas toward South Korea on the same day.    On the same day, the U.S. Government reviewed instituting  new  military steps, such as dispatching additional U.S. troops to  South Korea, forward deployment of an aircraft carrier on the  sea off the Korean peninsula, and arming the U.S. forces in  South Korea and the South Korean puppet army with new  antichemical military equipment.    Along with these steps by the Clinton administration, the  hardline conservative forces in the U.S. Congress as well are  making bellicose outbursts aimed at crushing us by force of  arms. According to foreign press, Richard Gephardt, Democratic  Party floor leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, urged  the U.S. Government to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea,  to resume the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise, and to dispatch  additional U.S. troops to South Korea.    In the meantime, Robert Dole, Republican minority leader of  the U.S. Senate, also babbled about economic sanctions against  us and said that the United States should urgently take the next  stage steps, such as the resumption of the Team Spirit joint  military exercise and additional dispatch of U.S. troops to  South Korea in order to send necessary signals to North Korea.    These bellicose remarks by the leaders of the two major U.S.  parties of both houses of the U.S. Congress show that not only  the U.S. Government authorities but also the U.S. congressmen  are following a more reckless road. What is more important, the  hardline conservative forces of the U.S. Congress raved about  so-called necessary signals to our republic.    These bellicose maneuvers of the U.S. Government authorities  and other high-level political figures are leading the situation  on the Korean peninsula to a situation where a war could break  out at any time.    As has been reported, the U.S. Navy fleet consisting of 30  ships is positioned on the sea from which it can reach the  territory of our republic in no more than 24 hours. On 22  March, the Japan Self-Defense Forces openly conducted a field  maneuver of Patriot missiles on the Shariki base in Aomori  Prefecture, Japan. TOKYO SHIMBUN dated 23 March reported that  the missiles in this base are aimed at our republic.    Some time ago, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] of the seven-party ruling coalition, who  is known to be a behind-the-scenes controller of Japan's  Hosokawa government, said that Japan cannot sit still if a fire  breaks out in a neighbor's house, asserting that Japan  Self-Defense Forces can participate as UN Forces in case of  emergency on the Korean peninsula. From this we can infer that  the said field maneuver with Patriot missiles by the Japan  Self-Defense Forces manifests the fact that Japan is  accelerating full-fledged preparations to participate directly  in the Korean war. This is a military move which we must regard  as very serious.    Meanwhile, in South Korea as well, traitor Kim Yong-sam held  a meeting of chiefs of staff of the three services of the puppet  armed forces on 22 March and ordered the entire puppet armed  forces to enter an alert posture. In the wake of this order,  frantic war exercises are continuing all over South Korea aimed  at our Republic.    The peace-loving people of the world are expressing deep  concern over this tense situation created on the Korean  peninsula and are urging the United States to give deep thought  to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. However, the  United States does not listen to this demand, but continues to  follow the road of confrontation and war.    However, no matter what political and diplomatic pressure  and  military threat and blackmail the United States may employ, they  are unworkable to us. The more the United States puts pressure  on us, the tougher our will to defend our sovereignty will be.  This will of ours will turn out mightier than the U.S. nuclear  weapon.    As we have already made clear, we will regard any U.S.  sanctions as a declaration of war against us, and will strongly  deal with it [kue kangnyokhi taechohae nagalkosimnida]. We mean  what we say [urinun kyolko pinmarul haji anssumnida]. The U.S.  hardline conservative forces should see the trend of the  situation squarely and act with discretion.</p>

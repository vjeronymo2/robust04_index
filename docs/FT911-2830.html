			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pension chaos ALMOST A year ago, the European Court of Justice, in the Barber judgment, established the principle that company pension schemes have to provide equal benefits for men and women. However, it has not resulted in universal equality within all company pension schemes. There is complete confusion over whether the judgment brought in immediate equality for all, or whether employees would have to wait 40 years before achieving full equality. This week, the Department of Social Security announced that it was giving financial backing to a test case - the wind-up of the Coloroll Group Pension Schemes - that could resolve this confusion. The problem arises because the court stated that the judgment would only apply to pension entitlements after May 17 1990 - the date of the judgment. The ambiguity concerns the various interpretations of entitlements. It could mean that: Employees would only have equality in respect of benefits earned after the date of the judgment. Under this interpretation, inequalities would gradually disappear over the next 40 years - the usual period needed to acquire the maximum pension of two-thirds of earnings. Full equality only applies to employees retiring after the date of the judgment. All benefit payments received after date of judgment must be on an equality basis, including spouses' and dependants' pensions, irrespective of when the pensioner retired. The judges at the European Court had hardly finished delivering their judgment before it became apparent that this ambiguity needed to be resolved quickly. Unfortunately, the obvious course of returning to the Court and asking the judges for clarification is not available. Instead, a separate case  - Coloroll - is needed to clarify the decision. Coloroll went into administrative receivership on June 7, 1990 - a few weeks after the Barber judgment. Two independent trustees were appointed with the task of winding-up the various group schemes. Those trustees need to know how the Barber judgment will apply in order to ascertain the correct benefits for the scheme members. So the trustees are applying to the High Court for directions and it is almost certain that the High Court will refer the matter to the European Court of Justice. However, many employees and pensioners have not waited for clarification from the European Court. They have initiated complaints of sexual discrimination through local industrial tribunals and various chairmen are putting their own interpretations on the Barber judgment. The DSS talks of being able to get the hearings quickly. But that merely means a couple of years (early 1993) rather than decades. It took 10 years to get the Barber judgment - during which time Douglas Barber died.</p>

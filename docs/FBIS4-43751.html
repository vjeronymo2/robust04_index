The official talks between the two  countries' delegations were also held in Ankara today. Demirel  and Niyazov signed a memorandum of understanding incorporating  the possibilities for cooperation between the two countries.    This morning Niyazov first visited the Ataturk Mausoleum,  where he laid a wreath, observed a moment of silence, and signed  the guest book. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin accompanied the  visiting president.    Niyazov then met with Demirel at the Cankaya Mansion.

At the end of the talks, Demirel and Niyazov signed a  memorandum of understanding, incorporating the possibilities for  cooperation between the two countries and displaying their  political will to develop cooperation.    In a speech after the signing, Demirel declared that  Turkmenistan, which gained its independence following the  bloodless dissolution of the Soviet Union, has always  entertained good relations with Turkey. Stressing that the  peoples of the two countries are brothers, Demirel said:  Turkmenistan is our motherland, and Turkey is the second  homeland of the Turkmen people.    Demirel explained that the most important project between  the  two countries is the natural gas pipeline and that during the  talks the sides reached an agreement on the realization of the  project as soon as possible.    Niyazov, in turn, said that agreement was reached during the  talks in Ankara on several issues. Underlining that he shares  all of Demirel's views with regard to bilateral relations,  Niyazov expressed gratitude for the support accorded to his  country until now.    The memorandum of understanding signed between the two  countries envisages cooperation on infrastructure projects such  as highways, railroads, and ports, as well as cooperation in the  fields of industry, agriculture, and energy. The memorandum  stresses their determination to realize the pipeline project for  transporting Turkmen natural gas to Europe via Turkey. Under  the memorandum, the two countries also grant most favored nation  status to one another.</p>

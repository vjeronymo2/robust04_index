			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Letter: A quick 'fix' will not resolve problems in electricity supply Sir, Your leader ('Extra time for British Coal', January 14) was a useful review of a possible subsidy for British Coal, but it said nothing about the fundamental elements of the problem. The present situation has arisen directly from the decisions made on restructuring the electricity supply industry for privatisation. lf generation had had a different structure (eg five or six fossil-fuel generators instead of two) and if a different approach had been taken on pricing - such as using the pool only as a merit order rather than a price-setting mechanism - different decisions would have been made on new investment and fuel selection. A quick 'fix' in the form of a subsidy for British Coal will do nothing to address the fundamental problems in electricity supply, which have given rise not only to the problems in coal but also to excessive price increases which are damaging British industry. As major electricity consumers, and indeed as citizens, our members look to the government to tackle the fundamental problems, so that we can progress to a situation in which sensible decisions are made on fuel selection, and electricity is supplied to industry at competitive prices.

Ratiyev and head of the  union's general staff V. Kamshilov was circulated here today by  the current information center of the Russian president's  administration.    The statement runs as follows:    "The Union of Cossack Troops of Russia and Abroad, which  unites over 15 million people living in various Russian regions,  is ready to sign 'the agreement on civic accord in russia' and  carry its share of responsibility for the agreement fulfilment.    "In this connection we consider inadmissible attempts of any  parties, including the Agrarian Union to voice a different  opinion on behalf of those who actually live and work on the  land.    "We, Cossacks, can estimate ourselves the significance of  the  civic accord agreement for peace and tranquility on lands  traditionally populated by Cossacks".</p>

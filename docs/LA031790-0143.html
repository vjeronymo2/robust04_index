			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEAL COMPLETED TO ESTABLISH CARL'S JR. IN 9 PACIFIC NATIONS  </P> <P> As expected, Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. announced Friday it signed a  licensing agreement with a Malaysian partner to bring the Famous Star hamburger  and the other offerings of its Carl's Jr. restaurants to nine Pacific Rim  nations.  </P> <P> Karcher signed the deal with MBf International, a financial services company  based in Kuala Lumpur.  </P> <P> MBf plans to open a Carl's Jr. restaurant in Malaysia next year and others  later in Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong. The company also hopes to expand  the fast-food chain into Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan and New  Zealand.  </P> <P> Steve Kishi, Karcher's vice president for international operations, said that  MBf will put up the money for the project and pay royalties to Karcher.  Anaheim-based Karcher will lend the Carl Jr.'s name, products, know-how and  marketing expertise to the venture.  </P> <P> As a licensee, Kishi said, MBf will have greater flexibility in developing new  products than the 550 company- or franchise-owned Carl's Jr. restaurants in  California, Arizona, Nevada and Oregon.  </P> <P> That feature could prove important in markets such as Malaysia, a predominantly  Muslim nation where pork is generally not eaten. Given such local tastes, he  said the chain's "western bacon cheeseburger" may be reformulated for the  market.  </P> <P> "We may get the product with same taste but without the pork bacon," he said.  </P> <P> Already, Kishi noted, the Pacific market has such all-American favorites as  McDonald's, Wendy's and White Castle. He added, however, that Carl's Jr.  restaurants should be successful with a more upscale line of fast-food that  will cater to the growing affluence of Pacific Rim nations.  </P> <P> The deal with MBf marks Karcher's second move into the Far East. In 1988,  Karcher teamed up with Friendly Corp. of Osaka, Japan, to bring Carl's Jr. to  that nation.  </P></p>

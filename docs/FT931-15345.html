			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Dutch announce Pounds 5bn defence cuts THE Netherlands is to abolish conscription by 1998 and cut its armed forces by nearly 45 per cent over the next seven years, as part of wide-ranging measures to adapt its security apparatus to the end of the cold war and the growth in peacekeeping operations. The proposed measures, presented to parliament yesterday, will produce total spending cuts on defence of around Fl 14bn (Pounds 5bn) between 1994 and 2003 and will involve the closure of many military barracks across the Netherlands. The proposals, to be debated by parliament in March, go significantly further than a government white paper in early 1992 which had called for a 30 per cent reduction in the Dutch armed forces. Under the Defence Ministry's 'priorities review' paper, the Netherlands' combined armed forces will drop to 70,000 personnel around the turn of the century, from more than 125,000 at present, with the army scheduled to face the biggest cuts because of the move to an all-volunteer force on January 1 1988. The Netherlands now has 48,000 conscripts who each serve 12 months. Mr Relus Ter Beek, defence minister, said the sweeping cuts had been agreed with the Netherlands' Nato partners. The Netherlands would remain prepared for large-scale conflict but its armed forces would concentrate mainly on readiness to handle crisis management, along with humanitarian and peacekeeping operations. If a serious conflict blew up the Netherlands would be able to swell its 70,000-strong forces to about 110,000 by calling up reserve personnel.</p>

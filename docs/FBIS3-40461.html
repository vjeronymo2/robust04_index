(SJAC, Chairman Isamu Kawai) has proposed to the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) that it start basic  research on supersonic passenger aircraft in January 1994. Their  ultimate goal is to develop the technology required to produce  lighter airframes for non-stop flights between Tokyo and the  east coast of the United States. According to the mid-term  report submitted at the end of 1993 by the Next Generation  Aircraft Investigation Committee of SJAC, the future demand for  supersonic aircraft between the years 2005 and 2015 is estimated  to reach a maximum of 1,000 aircraft worldwide. The project,  which can realize the dream of connecting Tokyo and New York in  about 4 hours, is about to draw considerable public attention.    Noise is a major problem during supersonic flight. Shock  waves, or sonic booms, could reach the ground in an intensity  adequate to break windows. In order to minimize this problem,  SJAC plans to establish a route between Tokyo and the U.S. east  coast that detours out over the Atlantic Ocean rather than  flying the shorter Great Circle route over Canada. Planes  traveling this route will require a cruising range of more than  12,000 kilometers. U.S. Boeing, UK British Airways, and French  Aerospeciale are all carrying out projects on supersonic  aircraft with cruising ranges of about 10,000 kilometers,  considerably shorter than that planned by SJAC.    Lighter airframes are essential for longer cruising  distances. SJAC plans to propose government/industry joint  research on the development of heat-resistant composite  materials.    The Engineering Research Association for Super/Hyper-Sonic  Transport Propulsion System, a consortium of  Japan/U.S./UK/French manufacturers, has already produced a  prototype engine for supersonic aircraft. Successful operational  tests were made in November 1993.    Success in airframe development, in addition to this  successful engine test, is likely to propel supersonic aircraft  development into a mega project for the 21st century.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, June 9 (TANJUG) -- Albania side refused to  sign Thursday in Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] an inter-state agreement with The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.M.) on cooperation in the  areas of agriculture, water resources and forestry, all due to  misunderstandings over the name of this republic.    As set out by Skopje radio Thursday, the Albanian side  refused to sign the memorandum on cooperation bearing the  "constitutional name of Macedonia."    The radio recalled that only a few days ago, during the  meeting of the F.Y.R.M. and Albanian presidents -- Kiro Gligorov  and Sali Berisha -- in Podgradec (Albania) and Ohrid (F.Y.R.M.),  the name Macedonia was not disputed by either side.    An Albanian Government delegation, headed by Agricultural  Minister Hassan Halili, stayed on a three-day visit to F.Y.R.M.    Macedonia was given a temporary name of F.Y.R.M. because of  a  dispute with Greece. Greece opposes most strongly the name  Macedonia as it sees in it territorial pretensions of this state  towards the northern Greek province of the same name.</p>

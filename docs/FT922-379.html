			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cash calls: how to cope with the crisis OVER THE coming weeks several thousand Names who have been hit hard by the market's record losses of 1989 and cash calls for 1990 will face the prospect of finding very large sums of money. Advisers say those in this situation should not panic, but should seek expert advice. The first thing any Name should do is to look closely at his or her finances and draw up a cash-flow chart to see how much is needed and the most tax-efficient way of raising that sum, says Robert Saunders, of Smith and Williamson, private bank and chartered accountants. Names should be especially cautious about using the resources of family members to meet losses because of the tax implications of doing this. Saunders says that the Inland Revenue's treatment of loans taken out to meet Lloyd's losses has become more generous. Citing a hypothetical case of a Name facing a Pounds 100,000 loss who has a mortgage of Pounds 130,000 and Pounds 100,000 of savings in the bank, he says: 'The worst thing the Name could do would be to use the savings to pay off the losses.' Saunders suggests that the savings should be used to reduce the mortgage and more money should be borrowed to pay the losses. Interest on the new Pounds 100,000 loan can be offset against the Name's marginal tax rate. Max Lehrain, of Grimston Scott, also says that it is better to borrow rather than to sell assets, and warns that Names who panic and sell their shares are likely to face a large capital gains tax bill. Grimston Scott has organised lines of credit with building societies with interest rates in the region of 9.5 per cent to 10 per cent. However, some Names are so badly affected that restructuring their finances will not be enough. Lehrain says that for those who are doing their best to meet their commitments, it is possible to arbitrate informally with the agents in order to delay paying off all the losses at once. Failing that, Names can seek hardship relief from Lloyd's, or apply for bankruptcy. Those who opt for hardship relief agree to restructure their debts to Lloyd's, with their unpaid loss converted into a loan at a commercial rate of interest. Terms are confidential and negotiated on a case by case basis, but generally Names are allowed to retain a home of around Pounds 125,000 in value and an annual income of about Pounds 14,000. Lloyd's is negotiating extra funding of some Pounds 50m from agents and brokers which could lead to easier terms, but so far hardship has not proved to be a popular option. Only 39 Names who have approached the Hardship Fund committee, chaired by Dr Mary Archer, have accepted the arrangements proposed. 'Some Names may not have realised that the Hardship Fund means just that,' says Michael Voller, Lloyd's specialist at BDO Binder Hamlyn, chartered accountants. He says that bankruptcy - despite the social stigma attached - is a preferable option for some Names. 'At least it wipes the slate clean.' However, all the advisers believe that those Names who are tempted to resign from Lloyd's should think again, because by doing so they will cut themselves off from potential future profits.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Moscow, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Visiting French Defense  Minister Francois Leotard on Thursday [3 February] pressed  France's call to mount air strikes against Serb forces to open  up Tuzla airport in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina.    At the same time, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said  during a trip to Athens that the facility must be opened within  a month.    Leotard briefed Deputy Defense Minister Andrei Kokoshin and  Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Mikhail Kolesnikov on the  idea of "air strikes at close intervals" so humanitarian aid  could be brought in to suffering civilians, but the Russians  remained "very cautious," Leotard told a news conference.    However Leotard added that he believed despite "differences  in analysing the situation and on what action to take... we are  not very far apart." [passage omitted]    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) last month  reaffirmed the principle of using air strikes to reopen the  airport, if necessary. Since then, Russia, a traditional ally  of the Serbs, has come out against the idea.    France thinks "there must be air cover and that if air raids  are ever carried out, they must be for protection, not  aggression," the defense minister said, but "The Russians think  such action could cause a slide into war."    The Russians, who "undoubtedly" have influence over the  Serbs, "are very cautious at the moment," he added, but "talks  must be continued with them."    Leotard is on a three-day official visit to Russia.    Meanwhile Juppe, on a visit to Athens, set a deadline of  about "a month" to reopen Tuzla airport.    During an official 24-hour visit, he said that both that  operation and NATO's decision to relieve Canadian UN  peacekeepers in the eastern town of Srebrenica, where Serb  forces are preventing them from leaving, must "be implemented as  quickly as possible."    He said he did not want to name a date because "this would  sound like an ultimatum" but that it should be "on the order of  a month," adding, "things should move quickly now."    Juppe added, "that's what we're going to try to do Monday"  during a meeting of European Community foreign ministers in  Brussels.    "If within a month or two," he added, "things have not moved  on the diplomatic level, we must really draw conclusions."    Juppe said the belligerents should be given "one last chance  to (reach) a political settlement" which could only be based on  a peace plan proposed by the European Community, bringing in  more directly the United States and Russia.    Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias said he "agreed  entirely" with the idea of carrying out air strikes, but only to  bring in aid.    Earlier, international peace negotiators Lord Owen and  Thorvald Stoltenberg during a visit to Bucharest expressed "full  support" for air strikes to protect UN peacekeepers in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

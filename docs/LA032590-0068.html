			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARGAIN CORNER: SEEING SPAIN AND PORTUGAL AT REASONABLE PRICES  </P> <P> If you'll be traveling to and within Spain and Portugal you'll have several air  and rail options to explore.  </P> <P> Renfe, the Spanish rail company, has introduced a flexible non-consecutive-day  pass that allows you to select which days you want to travel. The new 15-day  Spain Flexipass provides unlimited rail travel during any four days out of a  15-day period. The pass costs $99 for first-class travel, $75 for second-class.  </P> <P> Consecutive-day passes are also available. You can get an eight-day pass, with  the clock ticking from the first use, for $145 first-class and $105  second-class. A 15-day pass, also on a consecutive-day basis, goes for $235  first-class and $165 second-class.  </P> <P> The Spain Flexipass has to be bought in the United States, while the pair of  consecutive-day passes can be bought in the United States or Spain. Contact  travel agents and/or the National Tourist Office of Spain, 8383 Wilshire Blvd.,  Suite 960, Beverly Hills 90211, (213) 658-7188.  </P> <P> The Portugal Tourist Ticket offers three consecutive-day passes. The seven-day  pass costs about $70, a 14-day pass is $120 and a 21-day pass goes for $175.  Each pass allows unlimited rail travel on any class of service and on any type  of train.  </P> <P> The Portuguese rail passes have to be bought in Portugal. More details are  available from the Portuguese National Tourist Office, 590 Fifth Ave., New York  10036, (212) 354-4403.  </P> <P> If you're traveling by air, Iberia has a Visit Spain Airpass that allows you to  fly to any of its destinations in Spain, including Majorca and Ibiza in the  Balearic Islands, during a 60-day period. The pass costs $249. For an extra $50  you can add flights to and between the Canary Islands.  </P> <P> Passes have to be bought in the United States in conjunction with round-trip  transatlantic Iberia flights.  </P> <P> If you fly Iberia to Madrid by May 31, and pay for your tickets on an American  Express credit card, you're entitled to a complimentary companion ticket. You  need to buy a full-fare ticket on either first- , business- or economy-class,  and you have until May 30, 1991, to complete the round-trip flights.  </P> <P> TAP, the Portuguese airline, doesn't have an air pass within Portugal, but  passengers who buy a full-fare business-class seat on a transatlantic flight  out of Los Angeles can get a companion seat for 50% off the regular rate.  </P> <P> With both the Iberia and TAP programs, the companion has to travel with you on  each segment of your flight.  </P> <P> Contact travel agents, Iberia at toll-free (800) 772-4642 and TAP at (800)  221-7370.

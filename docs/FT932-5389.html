			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / OECD to open its doors to Mexico: OECD, Paris 1993 THE world's leading industrial countries yesterday decided to allow Mexico to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in a move that will expand the membership of the 'rich nations club' for the first time in 20 years. The announcement, coming at the end of a two-day ministerial meeting in the French capital, added an upbeat note to proceedings that had already received a boost from progress towards completing the long stalled Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. These two events offset in part the gloom caused by the continuing rise in unemployment in the organisation's 24 member-nations towards a forecast 36m by the end of this year. The ministers 'invited' Mexico and the OECD to examine 'with Mexico the terms and conditions of its membership with a view towards early entry'. According to Mr John Dawkins, the Australian treasurer who chaired the meeting, Mexico could be the 25th OECD member state in 12 to 18 months. The OECD also held out the prospect of South Korea becoming a member at a later date, to be followed at some point further in the future by Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. Mexico's application for membership was supported strongly by the US and Canada and came after the rejection of a move by Germany to accelerate the entry of the east European countries into the organisation. The meeting also recommended a catalogue of macroeconomic, structural and labour market policies to encourage non-inflationary growth and ease unemployment. However, Mr Dawkins acknowledged that 'nobody suggests it (cutting unemployment) will be easy or the remedies quick'. He said, nevertheless, that the determination shown by the OECD countries to complete the Uruguay Round by the end of this year should boost business confidence. According to Mr Peter Cook, the Australian trade minister, the communique contained 'probably the strongest commitment yet' of the OECD countries to completing the round and was a reflection of their 'steely determination' to have an agreement by the year's end.</p>

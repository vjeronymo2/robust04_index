			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Palestinian prisoner in a Negev desert jail for Arab security prisoners  killed two inmates, the army said, and police suggested that the victims may  have been suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities. Israel Radio  said a prisoner confessed to the slayings, which raise to four the number of  inmates killed by fellow prisoners in the last two weeks. Meanwhile, aides to  Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he will meet with Arab leaders from the West  Bank and Gaza Strip next month to discuss his election plan. In the occupied  lands, troops wounded at least 29 Palestinians, including four 11-year-olds,  when they opened fire on stone throwers.  </P></p>

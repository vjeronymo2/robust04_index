			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MASSACHUSETTS;  </P> <P> UNIVERSITY STUDENTS BOYCOTT CLASSES  </P> <P> Most of the 25,000 students at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst  boycotted classes and several hundred of them set up picket lines around campus  to protest repeated budget cuts in higher education. The students, joined by  some professors, began picketing outside several academic buildings at 8 a.m.  and said the strike will continue until the Legislature meets their demands for  a progressive tax package and stops cuts in education funding, including no  additional faculty or staff layoffs.  </P></p>

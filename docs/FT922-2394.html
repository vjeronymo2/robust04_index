			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (5): Hotelier caters for tourists - Profile of Dionisio Pestana DIONISIO PESTANA, like his father Manuel, has an instinct for a good business venture, especially if it involves breaking new ground. Imagination and hard-nosed management have helped make him one of Madeira's leading entrepreneurs. His Group Pestana, with net assets of about Pounds 95m in tourism, property, air travel and offshore activities, is the island's biggest. By his account, it has also become Portugal's largest hotel group in terms of assets. Mr Pestana, 40, was brought up in South Africa and only discovered his ancestral homeland in his 20s. His father emigrated to Mozambique nearly 50 years ago in search of a better life. He built up property interests in southern Africa, and then, in 1966, spotted Madeira's tourism potential, buying a hotel in Funchal which was rebuilt as the group's flagship, the Carlton. His son, armed with a business degree from Natal University, visited Madeira on a working holiday in 1976. He never looked back. It was just two years after the Portuguese revolution, and this gave the young outsider an edge. 'The potential was so great,' he says. 'We were really enthusiastic about doing things and buying, and the Portuguese were very conservative and afraid. They had lost confidence completely.' In those days, bricks had to be brought from the mainland, and the island had little infrastructure. 'It took four years to build,' he says. 'The progress since then has been like day and night. Today we can build faster than on the mainland. We're building a 200-room hotel in one year.' As well as the Carlton, the group owns the five-star Casino Park Hotel and the concession for the adjacent casino, designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemayer. It has built timeshare and freehold apartments and in 1988 acquired 20 per cent of the Portuguese charter airline, Air Atlantis. That year the group also took the unusual step for a Madeiran business of investing on the mainland, buying 25 per cent of the Salvor Group, which has five hotels in the Algarve. Current projects include an 800-bed hotel in an 18th century palace in Lisbon, to be opened in 1994, a smaller resort hotel on the Estoril peninsula close to the capital, and three hotels in Madeira. 'If all goes well, we'll open an hotel every year for the next five years,' says Mr Pestana. 'That would double our capacity.' The idea behind the mainland investments is to market a 'Pestana package' to tour operators, giving credits for all the group's hotels so that holidaymakers can spend time in Lisbon and the Algarve, as well as in Madeira. Mr Pestana's success, and the ease with which he has been able to develop, especially in the much sought-after waterfront zones of Madeira, has not made him universally popular. But he appears confident of his ground, attributing the sector's dynamism to Mr Alberto Joao Jardim, the regional president. 'If it's an investment that will get people employed, he will endorse that project, and he doesn't want to see any stumbling blocks.' With tourism now the island's mainstay, the industry is debating where best to focus next. Mr Pestana voices the dilemma: 'Madeira used to be a winter resort. But summer is the best time, with late sunsets and the youth back here from university. We need to capitalise on that.' That means more night entertainment in the capital. But Funchal is overcrowded, and new hotels should be developed elsewhere on the island. There's the rub. 'The more we decentralise,' he says, 'the less chance we have of creating the entertainment.' To diversify, the group bought 70 per cent of the Madeira Development Company when it was established in 1988 to manage the island's offshore business centre and free trade zone. That investment gave rise to another Pestana novelty - windmills. Taking advantage of the tax-free environment, and the 50 per cent European Community funding for energy-saving projects, the group plans to build 18 wind machines with a total capacity of 3MW. The electricity company will buy the energy for the island grid, the group's Pounds 1m annual electricity bill should be halved, and, Mr Pestana concludes proudly, 'the project should pay off in three to five years.'</p>

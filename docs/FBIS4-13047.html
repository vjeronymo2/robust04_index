			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 17 Apr (MENA)--Palestinian and Israeli  negotiators meeting for talks to eliminate the obstacles  impeding the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord on  self-rule have wound up their first session, during which they  continued the discussion of security issues.    Khalid al-Qidrah, a member of the Palestinian delegation,  told MENA that the Security Affairs Committee held a two-hour  meeting chaired on the Palestinian side by Brigadier General  'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya and on the Israeli side by Uzi Dayan,  head of the Israeli Army's Planning Department. He added that  the purpose of the meeting was to discuss issues concerning  crossings between Gaza, Jericho, and Israel; joint  Palestinian-Israeli patrols on parallel roads; the settlements'  security; and other security topics. He said the Civil Affairs  Committee, which will basically deal with water and  communications, and the Legal Affairs Committee will meet later  today.    Al-Qidrah said that during the previous round the Israeli  side presented a working paper to the Palestinians on the legal  jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho. He affirmed that the paper  has been rejected because it is not in line with the regional  sovereignty of the self-rule authority.    He added that during this round the Palestinian side on the  Legal Affairs Committee will submit a working paper on the legal  and judicial jurisdiction and regional sovereignty. He noted  that the Palestinian side demands full jurisdiction and  sovereignty over the Palestinian territories.    He said: The Israeli paper, which was presented to us at the  end of the last round, was not discussed. He affirmed that the  Palestinian side rejected it completely.    Al-Qidrah rejected Israel having any legal jurisdiction in  Gaza and Jericho, even on non-Palestinians as long as they are  present in the territories under the Palestinian self-rule  authority, noting that the Israeli proposal is incompatible with  international law.    This round of negotiations, which opened this morning, is  expected to last until Thursday.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Russia crisis timing a test for Globex WHEN Boris Yeltsin's dissolution of the Russian parliament hit the news after 5pm London time on Tuesday, European futures exchanges had already closed. It was a case of bad timing for traders, but a vital chance for Globex, the 24-hour futures trading system, to prove its worth. Globex, developed by the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Reuters, was conceived as a vehicle for global, 24-hour trading. However, in practice futures markets tend to be liquid only during the time zone of their domestic market. When the Russian news broke on Tuesday, the Chicago exchange floors were still open, but France's Matif products were available only through Globex. In the event, the Matif traded its second heaviest Globex session, recording more than 61,000 contracts. By contrast, the CME traded just over 3,000 contracts and the CBOT 1,730. Volume in CME products has risen from an average of 1,993 contracts in August to 2,755, partly reflecting the introduction of equity index products earlier this week. Nevertheless, the Chicago exchanges are a long way from their reported target of 50,000 contracts per US session on Globex by next April. If this target is not reached, the main backers of Globex could pull out, according to reports of the contract between them. Even though there has been an encouraging increase in CME's volume, that target still seems a long way off.</p>

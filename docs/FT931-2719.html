			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Letter: Budget whittles away at pensions and penalises with ACT changes (2) Sir, What the chancellor did not say in his Budget speech, but should have done, was: 'Some of our multinational companies have a problem with surplus advance corporation tax. I propose to help them at the expense of the shareholders of all UK companies by reducing the latter's gross dividends by 6.25 per cent. In addition to helping those multinational companies, I shall benefit by some Pounds 1.2bn per year.' One hopes that the need to help the Treasury and the multinational companies concerned will be appreciated by: 1) those who do not use up their personal allowances and who will face a 20 per cent-plus fall in their tax rebates on dividends; 2) higher rate taxpayers whose higher rate tax on their net dividends will rise by 25 per cent; and 3) employers whose pension funds will require larger contributions to compensate for the reduction in their gross UK dividend income of 6.25 per cent. Jenny Nelder, Bruce Sutherland &amp; Co, Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire GL56 0AT</p>

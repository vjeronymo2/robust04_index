			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oman wants fishermen to cast their nets wider - Decades of over-exploitation of inshore waters have hit stocks hard OMAN'S FISHERMAN are casting their eyes - and nets  - a little further afield these days. They are venturing into the fertile continental shelf, beyond the narrow strip of inshore water off the Omani coast where for decades fishermen have practised their trade. This concentration of activity in inshore waters has led to huge over-fishing, notably of high-value lobsters and abalone in the south. The continental shelf offers a relative bounty: plenty of high-quality king-fish, tuna and Spanish mackerel. Official concern at the over-fishing in 1990 prompted a joint survey by Oman and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation of the country's 200-mile exclusive zone. The report will 'form the basis of determining the total catch in Omani waters', says Mr Thabit Zahran al-Abdul Salaam, director of the Marine Sciences and Fisheries Centre, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries' research arm. 'After so much over-fishing, we need to manage our resources in a more responsible manner otherwise they will be depleted; we must encourage fishermen to exploit the richer fields further away,' he adds. Poor quality wooden houri (boats) have for decades confined fishermen to inshore waters. In any case, few boats possessed any form of modern cooling and processing equipment, necessary for longer journeys. Also, lobsters and abalone, among the more sedentary fish in inshore waters, were easy targets for fishermen reluctant to change the ways of a lifetime. Nevertheless, the government has over the past two decades tried to change age-old ways. It has offered generous incentives and loans for the purchase of high-quality fibre-glass boats; distribution and marketing of fish has been improved; and several 200-tonne government-funded cold storage centres have been set up, some recently sold to the private sector in a bid to make it play a more active role in the industry. Leading the way is Oman Fishing Company (in which the government has a quarter share), which was formed in 1989 with subscribed capital of OR12.5m (Pounds 18.65m). Better boats and more developed on-shore infrastructure have, however, only served to highlight the problem of over-fishing. Apart from periodic exhortations, the government's immediate response has been to introduce permits for fishermen (initially being enforced only for larger companies) and to reduce the fishing season. For lobsters, the season has been reduced from six months to two (December and January). Quotas have been imposed on industrial vessels. Hardly surprisingly, these measures have proved unpopular with many of the country's estimated 18,500 self-employed fishermen whose efforts help to make fish Oman's biggest non-oil export. Many protested and indeed won concessions from the ministry; initially the authorities had proposed a total ban on lobster fishing. 'For decades the industry has been unregulated. But the time has come to limit entry,' says Mr Abdul Salaam. 'Our measures do affect their livelihood but we have to take the long term view,' he insists. The long term view - outlined in the current five-year plan  - includes an ambitious programme to build eight small, self-contained harbours (at al-Jazar in the south and Shines in the north-east, for instance). These will mainly service small fishermen who last year accounted for some 85 per cent of the total haul of 119,000 tonnes, earning revenues of some OR17.8m. The rest was caught by industrial vessels. Some 20 per cent of the total catch was exported to neighbouring states and also Japan. Large-scale port development is also planned at Sur and Qurayat in the north-east, enabling them to accommodate industrial vessels and ease pressure on Mina Qaboos. Industrial vessels - including some from Japan with which the authorities have signed fishing concessions - caught some 10 per cent of the total haul in 1990. All the ports will boast enhanced processing and cold storage facilities. The work is expected to be finished by 1994, completing the transformation of an industry which was once as conspicuous for its foul smells as for its delicious catches. Southern fishermen's haul of sardines - later sold as fertiliser  - would be left to dry on the southern beaches. The fumes were a reminder when the boats were in. Today, though there is some concern among traditional fishermen who fear for their livelihood, it is the general air of optimism that is more striking. For most fishermen realise that their government is making a huge investment in an industry whose importance will grow given Oman's very limited oil reserves.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Sport: Hard but fair - Golf TOM Watson was trying to explain what he thought of Carnoustie as a golf course. Watson pondered and then said he likened the course to an ugly old woman who at least is honest with you. 'When you add up your score after your round, she tells you what she thinks of you,' he said, smiling that gap-toothed signature grin of his. What does he think of Muirfield, site of the Open championship that will start on Thursday? 'I have good thoughts about Muirfield,' Watson said. 'I love playing links courses and Muirfield is a links course. In fact, it is one of my favourite courses. What you see is what you get. There is not a weak hole on the course.' It was at Muirfield in 1980 that Watson won his third Open and in 1987, Faldo's year, only a poor fourth round, a 74, stopped him challenging once again for the game's oldest major championship. The home of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, whose 13 articles, written down in 1744 were the first rules of golf, Muirfield is generally held to be the fairest and best of the courses on the Open rota. (Carnoustie, where Watson won his first Open, in 1975, is a sterner test of golf but cannot offer the requisite number of bedrooms for the caravanserai that comprises an Open championship). It is laid out on land that has been golfing terrain since the Honourable Gentlemen moved east from Musselburgh in 1891. Though it lacks the coastal setting of Turnberry, the ruggedness of Royal Birkdale, the deadening weight of history of St Andrews, the universal appeal of Muirfield comes largely from its peaceful setting. To appreciate it stand outside the clubhouse and look around to all points of the compass. To the north sand dunes in the foreground lead the eye on to the Firth of Forth in the middle distance and, beyond, to the faint outlines of Fife. To the east are the gnarled and windblown trees of Archerfield wood and, in the distance, like a gigantic upturned thimble, is the volcanic mound of North Berwick Law. Archerfield was the setting of The Pavilion on the Links, by Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote: 'on summer days the outlook was bright and even gladsome; but at sundown in September, with a high wind and a heavy surf rolling close along the links, the place told of nothing but dead mariners and sea disaster.' To the west towards Edinburgh is Gullane Bay and to the south rolling away endlessly are the rich farmlands of East Lothian. 'Muirfield,' says Ben Crenshaw, an American golfer with a keen interest golf's history 'has no trees, water hazards or dramatic elevation changes. It is hardly picture postcard material. Still, it is probably the most straightforward, honest golf course in the world.' In July 1966, when the club was staging its tenth Open, the most honest golf course in the world presented a terrifying sight. The late Gerald Micklem, then chairman of the championship committee of the Royal &amp; Ancient golf club, ordered the rough to be grown in some places to waist height and the fairways to be narrowed to as little as 20 yards. This was the most ferocious rough ever at an Open. Jack Nicklaus said it looked 'like a wide expanse of wheat whipping in the wind'. Doug Sanders was reluctant to leave the clubhouse until he was reassured 'there ain't no Apaches out there.' There will be no Apaches this week, though I dare say a few who attend the 121st Open will complain of being scalped. Bernard Darwin once wrote, apropos Muirfield, of 'curlews hovering over a championship crowd and crying eerily amid a religious silence.' There will not be much silence this week. From Greywalls, the Lutyens designed hotel over the wall from the course, to the back tee of the sixth hole, the northernmost point of the course, Muirfield will echo to the sounds of a modern Open, the seventh here since the war. It has a history of producing the greatest champions - Player, Nicklaus, Trevino were among the predecessors of Watson and Faldo. One hopes the sequence continues and that in eight days' time a truly worthy champion holds up the famous trophy and basks in the acclaim of the crowd. Muirfield deserves no less.</p>

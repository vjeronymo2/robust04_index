			<p>BFN     [Text] Our editorial office has received a declaration by  the Romanian Government on the launching of the process for the  stability pact in Europe. The document reads as follows:    The proceedings of the inaugural conference on the stability  pact in Europe concluded in Paris on 27 May 1994. Thirty-nine  states and five international organizations adopted a political  document whereby they reasserted their pledge to make a  contribution to the efforts aimed at ensuring peace in Europe by  promoting and expanding relations of cooperation and  good-neighborliness. Teodor Melescanu, minister of state and  minister of foreign affairs, headed the Romanian delegation at  the conference of initiating a stability pact in Europe.    The Romanian Government reasserts its support for the basic  goals of the stability pact in Europe, the first initiative of  foreign policy and joint security of the European Union. The  draft initiated by France and promoted by the European Union is  part and parcel of the actions aimed at preparing the  integration of the Eastern and Central European states that  today enjoy the status of associate members of the European  Union in the European and Euro- Atlantic structures. Romania's  participation in the stability pact, the act of signing the  Partnership for Peace, and the status of associate partner in  the Western European Union are important steps to ensure our  country's integration in European and Euro-Atlantic structures.    The endorsement of the initial declaration is the result of  the joint efforts of the states that are members of the European  Union, associated states -- including Romania -- and of the  other countries interested in European stability. Romania has  participated in a constructive manner and embarked on the  process of defining the orientations of this initiative, that  has a pragmatic character of preventive diplomacy.    Romania's Government displayed its political will to  contribute to the success of this initiative by continuing  negotiations on the conclusion of bilateral treaties with its  neighbors, by including in the pact those treaties that have  been concluded so far and by organizing certain meetings that  are specific to the process of the pact regarding the rights of  people who belong to ethnic minorities and the improvement of  transportation and communication infrastructure. The future  pact of stability in Europe is based on the principles generally  accepted by the United States, the CSCE, and the Council of  Europe.    Romania's Government learned with satisfaction that this  ample project promoted by the European Union is aimed at putting  value on the already established institutions and mechanisms,  and the CSCE institutions first of all. Romania's Government  believes that the endorsement of the Paris Declaration will give  an impetus to the continuation of negotiations on the conclusion  of basic treaties with neighboring countries, taking into  account the principles expressed in the initial document of the  pact. Romania's Government believes that stability in Europe is  directly determined by the success of the transition processes  in the eastern and central parts of the continent. Therefore,  it believes that direct support granted to the process of reform  in the countries whose economies are in the middle of transition  must be one of the major lines of action of various European  structures. This will also lead to the creation of the  necessary conditions for integration into the European Union.  The whole process, by emphasizing its economic dimension, can  lead to the consolidation of European stability, of prosperity  of all states in our region, and to the creation of the  appropriate conditions for practicing the rights and fundamental  liberties of each citizen.</p>

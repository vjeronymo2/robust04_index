He was opening the committee meetings of  the Global Coalition for Africa (GCA) in the Beninois economic  capital.    The committees are governance and democracy chaired by Soglo  and economic reform polices chaired by Ghana's finance and  economic planning minister, Kwesi Botchwey.    Soglo said African countries are currently facing economic  and financial crises of an unprecedented dimension. He said all  the political and economic reform efforts and sacrifices so far  made by them have been reduced to nought. "Our countries are  facing an imminent social upheaval and we are left with no  choice but to unite or perish," Soglo told delegates attending  the four-day GCA meeting.    Launched in Kampala, Uganda, in 1990, the GCA seeks to  improve the working partnership existing between African and  developing countries in economic and development-related fields.    Soglo said the recent devaluation of the CFA franc which was  not originally on the meeting's agenda was placed at the last  minute because of its obvious implications for economic reform  in the countries concerned. Pegged to the French franc since  1948, the CFA franc which the common currency for 14 francophone  countries in West and Central Africa and the Comoros, was  devalued in January by 50 percent, seriously hurting the already  fragile economies of these countries.    The Beninois president said despite follow-up measures taken  including debt reduction, increased investment and reasonable  control of price increases, the situation remains "extremely  serious." Soglo said a devaluation of this magnitude is  difficult to manage and is bound to cause social tension. "We  should exchange ideas and experiences to make the devaluation of  the CFA a positive change and a new opportunity for economic  development instead of considering it as catastrophe."    Soglo said his committee will present a comprehensive study  on self-evaluation of governance and democracy. The document,  which will be presented to African governments, contains  concrete measures to meet the challenge of effective governance  and transition to democratic rule.    The committee on economic reform policies is excepted to  discuss structural adjustment and economic reforms and a  strategy for agricultural development in Africa.    More than 100 delegates are attending the committee  meetings.  Also in attendance are three former heads of state -- Amadou  Toure of Mali, Pierre Buyoya of Burundi, and Aristides Pereira  of Cape Verde.</p>

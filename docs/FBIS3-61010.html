Afanasyev under the rubric "By Reader </F> Request": "The `Lunar Theme' After N1-L3"]    [Text] Readers of our journal who have become  familiar with the N1-L3 project (AVIATSIYA I KOSMONAVTIKA No. 12  of 1991 and Nos. 1, 2 and 9 of 1992) have noted that the story  of the Soviet lunar program was seemingly broken off in  midsentence. Taking into account the wishes of I. Konyukhov from  Leningrad Oblast and R. Gnatyuk from Ukraine, among others, we  are continuing to cover the work on lunar topics that was  conducted in the USSR after the events described earlier.    V. Mishin, who headed the Central Design Bureau for  Experimental Machine Building [TsKBEM] after the death of S.  Korolev, facilitated the pursuit of the lunar program with all  of his strength. But the leadership of the sector and the  country, under the impact of the successful landing on the moon  by the American astronauts, felt the accomplishment of the N1-L3  project in its initial version to be without prospects. The  rapid shutdown of the program did not follow, however, owing to  the enormous amount of work that had already been done, even  though the financing and pace were reduced sharply. They were  evidently still nursing the hope "on high" that something would  throw off the Americans, and then it would be possible to make  up what had been omitted and "jump ahead" with a vigorous push.    The aimlessness and ambiguity of this position were obvious.  In order not to lose accumulated experience and simultaneously  to reach the assigned goal--to land on the moon--the TsKBEM  developed, at the suggestion of V. Mishin, a variation of a  lunar space-rocket system--the N1-L3M. It was broadly proposed  to speed up the N-1 launch vehicle and create a new ship for the  flight according to an original, dual-launch system. The  preparation of the necessary infrastructure for the emplacement  of a lunar base in the not-too-distant future and the  performance of expeditions of moderate duration (up to three  months) was planned, instead of short-term visits to the surface  of the "night luminary." It turned out that a real possibility  of the fulfillment of the new program could appear as early as  1978-80, and under financing that did not go beyond the bounds  of the budgetary appropriations for the N1-L3.    The insufficient reliability of the docking of the lunar  orbital craft (LOK) with the lunar craft (LK) launched from the  surface of the moon was deemed to be one of the weakest areas of  the N1-L3 project. The fault for that was the poor capabilities  of the electronic systems of the craft, the insufficient extent  of the study of the conditions of navigation close to the moon  and the impossibility of giving the cosmonauts comprehensive and  prompt support from Earth, as was done in the docking of craft  in near-Earth orbit. New approaches were required.    A flight according to the "direct configuration" without  dockings in orbit would have been simple, but not economical.  The whole ship makes the landing on the moon in that case. After  the fulfillment of the research program, the returnable portion  of the craft launches from the moon, while the re-entry craft  (SA) separates from it as it approaches the Earth and enters the  atmosphere with second escape velocity, with a controlled  descent and parachute landing. A launch vehicle (RN), however,  had to be created for such a flight, using even the simplest and  lightest craft, that would have had approximately one and a half  times the lift capacity of the N-1.    The possibilities for the gradual augmentation of the mass  of  the payload had been made inherent in the N-1 project from the  very beginning, but only the acceleration of the first stage of  the N-1--which would add only about 10--11 percent to the  payload mass--was realistic in the near future.    It was thus decided to stick with a modified version of the  "direct configuration," in which the lunar craft and the braking  rocket unit would be launched into near-Earth orbit separately  with their own N-1. Each would then first reach flight  trajectory to the moon with the aid of its own starting and  braking engines (RTB), and then selenocentric orbit where the  docking would occur. If the docking were to fall through, the  cosmonauts would return to Earth. The braking unit would be used  for the descent of the LK from lunar orbit and to shed speed,  and it would then separate at a certain height above the moon's  surface. A soft landing took place with the aid of the engine  installation (DU) and the landing struts of the LK. The  separation of the landing adapter and liftoff with the engine of  the LK operating at full thrust were necessary for return. The  ship was to enter a selenocentric orbit after launch from the  moon, from which it would take a heading toward Earth or shift  at once onto a return trajectory.    The use of the "direct configuration" made it possible to  equip the craft with a complicated system of more advanced radio  gear for the precise and reliable performance of maneuvers  connected with searching, meeting and docking in lunar orbit.  Such a larger LK would moreover have had greater freedom of  maneuver close to the surface to select a landing site.    The creation of some new elements of the system was  envisaged  in this project, along with the widespread utilization of the  work that had been developed under the N1-L3 program. While a  somewhat modified D unit from the L-3 could have been used as  the braking unit, the craft itself and the RTB had to be created  virtually anew.    The RTB, replacing the G unit and partially the D unit of  the  L-3 system in the N1-L3M project, was to become the first Soviet  high-energy stage. The installation of four oxygen-hydrogen  ZhRDs [liquid rocket engines] was proposed, and their  development entrusted to the OKB [Experimental Design Bureau] of  A. Isayev in the second half of the 1960s. And while only  drawings had come out for the RTB, the ZhRDs were brought to the  stage of live ground tests. The first Soviet cryogenic engine,  built according to an improved, self-contained configuration,  proved to be very economical and reliable. It surpassed the  analogous American ZhRD, developed by the firm of Pratt and  Whitney for the upper stage of the Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle.  The design bureau continued to improve the engine despite the  shutdown of the lunar program, making it competitive in the  world markets. Several of the first flight models of this ZhRD  and the technical documentation for its manufacture under  license will thus be sent under contract to the India Space  Agency.    The craft itself for the N1-L3M project was outwardly  somewhat reminiscent of the L-3 LK system. It consisted of a DU  that was, as a whole, analogous to the Ye unit of the LK of the  L-3 project, with the lunar landing installation attached  underneath and the cocoon-shaped habitation module (OB) above.  The engines of the DU were backed up, operated on long-term  storable, self-igniting fuel and had the capability of thrust  regulation across a broad spectrum. The OB had the re-entry  craft, with an airtight instrument compartment in the lower  portion. The cosmonauts were to leave the SA and operate within  the internal spaces of the OB during various operations in  flight and on the lunar surface, providing not only freedom of  access to the control instruments but also a good view, easing  the choice of landing site. The separation of the OB and the  departure of the SA from it occurred when approaching the Earth.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-001C-21A>           N-1F, Vulkan and Energiya </FIG>          After the successful completion of th Apollo program, the  Soviet lunar project lost its prestige in whatever form it was.  Money for the N1-L3M variation was not allocated. The program to  assimilate the moon was moreover re-oriented toward unmanned  flights, with a gradual reduction in the number of launches of  automatic stations and the subsequent curtailment of that  program under the slogan "The study of the moon is completely  finished," owing to delays in the flight testing of the N-1  rocket.    The work on the N1-L3 had effectively been reduced, under  pressure from the Ministry of General Machine Building, to the  development of the N1 rocket since the very beginning of the  1970s, so as to at least create a launch vehicle. All four of  its launches were unsuccessful, which had a depressing effect on  the executors of the program and one of Schadenfreude  for the opponents of the rocket, of which there were more than  enough by that time. The creators of the N1 were being "called  onto the carpet" more and more, and they had to prove their  correctness each time. The rhythm of the work was disrupted  owing to the confusion, and rumors were circulating in the  corridors of the "firms" of the supposedly imminent "shutdown"  of the N1.    The work on the N1 at the newly formed Energiya NPO  [Scientific-Production Association] was curtailed completely a  very short time after the removal of V. Mishin from the post of  head of the TsKBEM and the designation of V. Glushko for the  post in May of 1974.    Academician Glushko proposed the creation of a number of new  launch vehicles even before coming to the TsKBEM, formed via the  parallel combination of various quantities of standard units. He  planned to install a ZhRD with a thrust of more than 1,000  tonnes of force in each of them, in which all of the advanced  ideas in the realm of engine building and the great experience  of the GDL-OKB that he came from would be employed.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-001C-22A>           Lunar expeditionary craft </FIG>          The specialists of the OKB of S. Korolev had criticized that  idea as early as the beginning of the 1960s from the standpoint  of the non-optimal division into stages, the utilization of  toxic components and the lack of conformity to the criterion of  cost-effectiveness. The academician, however, skillfully  manipulating the terms "reusability" and "universality,"  convinced the leadership of the country of the necessity of  replacing the N1 rocket, which had not proved itself, with a  "universal series of reusable launch vehicles," which were to  become the foundation of the new conceptual model of the space  transport system of the USSR. The staffers of the department  developing the N1 spent a whole year after the designation of V.  Glushko to the post of head of the Energiya NPO trying to prove  to the new general director the irrationality of creating a new  generation of launch vehicles. He was implacable, however, and  in October 1974, submitting a comprehensive plan for the  association for the next few years, he gave it to be clearly  understood that there was no place in it for the N1. But the  developers did not get started on the design engineering of such  a system, reminiscent of the Glushko "series" only in the most  general outlines, until 1976.    One could have thought that V. Glushko shut down the lunar  program, but that is not so. He "killed" just the launch  vehicle. The academician had an entirely different opinion of  the lunar program. One of the paragraphs in his 1974  comprehensive plan envisaged the creation of a long-term  scientific-research base on the moon. V. Glushko proposed the  lunar expeditionary craft (LEK) as the principal means of  transport for delivering cosmonauts and payloads. He proposed it  instead with the colossal Vulkan launch vehicle. The new rocket,  which went beyond the prior notions of Glushko, was clearly  inferior to the N1 in aesthetic terms, even though it won out in  characteristics. It had a launch mass roughly 60 percent greater  than the N1, could insert a payload of 200 tonnes into  near-Earth orbit or deliver 54 tonnes to Venus and 52 tonnes to  Mars. The delivery of the LEK to a selenocentric orbit was  proposed to be accomplished using the Vezuviy cryogenic unit  using an oxygen-hydrogen ZhRD with small thrust but high  specific impulse.    N-1F, Vulkan and Energiya Launch Vehicles   Characteristics of the    N-1F            Vulkan           Energiya  launch vehicles   Launch thrust,            5,070           7,520            3,600  tonnes-force   Launch mass, tonnes       3,025           4,700            2,400   Payload mass:   --in near-Earth orbit,    105             200              102  tonnes   --to fly to moon,         34              65               35  tonnes   --for lunar orbit,        22              43               23  tonnes      The LEK was created to perform an expedition according to a  purely "direct configuration," and consisted of three  units--landing and liftoff stages and a habitation module. The  landing stage, equipped with a powerful main and four steering  ZhRDs, was reminiscent in configuration to the eight-sided  descent stage of the Apollo lunar module. The OB and the liftoff  stage were similar to those units on the N1-L3M.    One version of the expedition would have the crew launched  in  an SA located inside the habitable unit of the LEK. The launch  of the crew to an unmanned LEK, with the subsequent docking of  the craft and transfer of the cosmonauts to the OB of the lunar  craft, using a Soyuz placed in orbit separately was proposed,  however. The flight of the LEK was otherwise standard for the  "direct configuration": launch from near-Earth orbit and entry  into lunar orbit with the aid of the Vezuviy RTB, then  separation of the LEK from the empty unit and descent to the  surface with the aid of the engines in the descent stage. Later,  after the cosmonauts had concluded their business on the moon,  the takeoff stage was to put the OB onto a flight trajectory to  Earth using its own engine. The SA would separate from the OB  before entry into the atmosphere.    The country's leadership had no enthusiasm whatsoever for  the  "new" lunar program, and did not rush to allocate funds to  implement the plans of V. Glushko. The task of creating a  reusable transport craft that faced domestic space science in  those same years pushed the projects on lunar topics into the  background. Glushko tried to convince the "higher-ups" of the  necessity of financing the program to assimilate the moon until  the very last days of his life, but he was not able to do so,  even though the development of individual portions of the system  reached the preliminary design engineering stage.    In answering the question of whether the possibility of  manned flights to the moon exists today, one may say that the  Energiya space-rocket system, even in its current state, makes  it possible to send a craft to the moon that is greater in mass  than the L3. Today, however, there are neither realistic plans  for such craft nor the financial underpinnings for such  expeditions.    COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.</p>

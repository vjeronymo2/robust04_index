			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Kim Myong-chol] </F>   [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- Increased international  competitiveness and stable and steady growth are the goals of  the government's economic plan for 1994, announced Tuesday.    The plan, formulated about a month later than in previous  years because of a cabinet reshuffle affecting the economic  planning minister and other ministers with economic portfolios  in December, puts stress on developing the rural economy and  putting vigor into the private sector.    In a conspicuous departure from past practice, the  government  left its forecast of macroeconomic indicators such as growth and  inflation rates out of the plan.    Instead, the plan contains forecasts of such indicators by  the Korea Development Institute, the Bank of Korea and private  research institutes that put average growth at 6 percent to 7  percent, inflation at 6 percent and the current-account surplus  at anywhere from 1 billion to 2 billion U.S. dollars.    The government does have its own forecasts, but did not  include them in the plan to avoid criticism if the forecasts  turn out to be wrong. But this creates the impression that the  government is shirking its responsibility.    If the plan included the government's macroeconomic goals,  the government would then feel impelled to drive the economy to  achieve the goals regardless of how unreasonable such a drive  may be, as it did in the past, Economic Planning Board (EPB)  officials say. But without the government goals, the business  community has no way of knowing exactly what the government is  aiming at in its economic management plan.    An EPB official says the government wants 7-percent growth  and 6-percent inflation in this year, but farm market opening as  a result of the Uruguay Round trade talks has caused the  government to put stress on rural development programs.    These programs combine with others for boosting the private  sector, expanding infrastructure and balancing development of  the country to give the impression that the economic management  plan for 1994 focuses more on growth than on stability.    Chang Song-u, the EPB planning officer in charge of the  plan,  says that the plan's macroeconomic emphasis is on stability and  its microeconomic emphasis is on programs to maximize business  activities of the private sector. To stabilize prices, the  government will control the total money supply on a stable basis  and restrain earlier implementation of public works projects.    To increase industry's international competitiveness in the  severe trade war expected as a result of the Uruguay Round trade  accord, the North American free trade agreement and the European  economic area, the plan envisages five programs -- agricultural  restructuring, deregulation for a higher spirit of enterprise in  the private sector, expansion of infrastructure, increased  adaptation to trends of globalization through market opening and  price stabilization.    The rural development programs include both government and  private investment for developing rural areas into a complex of  primary, secondary and tertiary industries, and for this the  government will in July begin raising 1.5 trillion won a year by  establishing a new tax for several years.    Deregulation will include the privatization of state-run  enterprises and the opening of the public works market to  private capital.    For price stabilization, prices of rice and 29 other daily  necessities will be kept from rising more than 4 percent, on  average, in the coming year, while prices of 140 monopoly and  oligopoly items will be placed under strict controls.    The economy, which bottomed out last year, looks bright in  the new year. Increasing international competitiveness through  substantial growth is the task facing the government's economic  team, headed by Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok. Also  pressing on the team are price stabilization and industrial  peace, because without these two industry can hardly compete  well on the world market.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Premier hints at possibility of political reform: Shifting of emphasis in the Chinese leader's attitudes FOR THE FIRST first time since the 1989 Tiananmen troubles, a hint of political change has dawned in China. Li Peng, China's usually hardline premier, declared at a State Council meeting this month that economic reform should be 'matched with political reform.' This follows the initiative launched by Deng Xiaoping, the country's supreme leader, to boost economic reform, which is currently sweeping the country. Deng spent time in south China and Shanghai last month praising the 'open policy' and the capitalist features of the Special Economic Zones. These SEZs, set up to attract foreign investment, display economic growth far beyond that elsewhere in China. Diplomats in Beijing said it was unlikely that Li's remarks meant he was calling for a more pluralist system. He was more probably referring to the administrative reforms China had tried to launch in the mid-1980s. But as one diplomat noted: 'Once this kind of thing is on the agenda, it's likely to stray further afield, further than the leaders want it to.' Li's comments are the latest and most important sign yet of reformers in China's long-running battle with the conservatives. But the trend had already begun. Towards the end of last month even the People's Daily, for the 33 months since Tiananmen the chief mouthpiece for a tough line demanding Chinese-style socialism, switched to urging boldness and experiment. Reports have even surfaced of the possible rehabilitation of Zhao Ziyang, the party leader dismissed because of his soft line towards the demonstrators in the Tiananmen protests. One party insider was reported as saying that Zhao, who has been virtually under house arrest since June 1989, had recently been consulted on economic policy. Even the hardliners seem reluctantly to have agreed that economic reform is required to maintain stability, since growing living standards mean less discontent. Deng's speeches in the SEZs of the south are now being studied throughout China, in preparation for the session of the National People's Congress, the rubber-stamp parliament, later this month. The evaporation of Marxism-Leninism in the formerly socialist world may have something to do with this new approach. Deng was probably speaking for all worried officials when he reportedly noted in Shenzhen, the SEZ adjoining Hong Kong: 'Everything can collapse very quickly if mismanaged. Did east Europe and the Soviet Union not crumble overnight?' Deng has apparently not minced words in his battle against the conservatives for economic reform. In his speeches reportedly conveyed to the enlarged meeting of the politburo in mid-February by Jiang Zemin, the party leader and Deng protege, he declared: 'Some comrades have opposed opening up right from the start ..not just once, but consistently.' All this year the Hong Kong Chinese press, which often has excellent contacts inside China, has been awash with tales of disputes between him and the old guard. The elders are fighting for more than their own positions. They plan to ensure their children will inherit power on their demise since they can probably be trusted to continue the party line. Many hold key jobs in the hierarchy, unsurprisingly in a society where the concept of family holds sway. As the conservative patriarch Chen Yun said a few weeks ago, 'the children will not pull down the monuments of their parents.' Chen Yun's son, Chen Yuan, is a vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank. Wang Zhen's son Wang Jun is a director of the key China International Trust and Investment Corporation. Deng's own children are in top positions, with a son-in-law controlling a major part of China's arms sales. More than half the potential central committee candidates (to be elected at the forthcoming party congress) are the offspring of high-level officials, the 'party of princes,' as the Hong Kong Chinese press ironically calls them. This does not mean they share the political views of their parents (foreigners who have met them believe they are more liberal than the previous generation) but they are certain to support the power of party rule since it confers privilege. The leaders, Deng included, draw a sharp distinction between economic and genuinely political issues. But since all the previous bursts of economic reform have been followed by rising political demands, it remains to be seen whether Beijing can successfully ride the tiger. The leader of far west China's predominantly Moslem region has announced a crackdown on worsening 'sabotage and subversive activities,' according to an official report, AP reports from Beijing. Tomur Dawamat, chairman of the government of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, voiced fears held by Chinese leaders that the break-up of the Soviet Union and independence for its former republics would encourage China's own restive minorities, most of whom live in remote, border areas. 'The changeable international situation has affected and is still affecting Xinjiang's social stability,' Tomur said. Xinjiang borders the newly independent republics of Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan and Tajikistan, and many Xinjiang residents share the same culture, language and blood ties with residents across the border.</p>

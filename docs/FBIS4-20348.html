			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Special Columnist Wang Li (3769 5461): "Three </F> Highs, Three Fevers, and the Rest--1993 Economic Determinations,  Prospects for 1994 Trends"]    [Text] In 1993 Chinese economic life exhibited a few  major characteristics: a high investment growth rate, a high  rate of industrial production, and a high rate of inflation; and  real estate fever, stock fever, and development zone fever. In  addition, the financial order was chaotic and exacerbation of  the uneven development among regions and systems of ownership  and between industry and agriculture was more obvious than in  previous years. The year 1994 will be a year of policy  adjustments and intensified reform. We hope that textile  enterprises, while comprehending the macroeconomic situation,  will better grasp the helm of enterprise reform.    In 1993 China's national economy remained on the fast track.  In the first half of the year, the economy achieved exceedingly  high 14.1 percent growth. In June the state adopted a series of  macroeconomic control measures. In the second half of the year,  financial order turned around somewhat, the scale of investment  came under control to a certain extent, and the domestic  economic environment clearly improved.    Compared with the last few years, 1993 still could be  considered a rapid-growth year. Annual gross national product  (GNP) is expected to break 3 trillion yuan, calculated according  to comparative prices, the growth rate will be about 13 percent.  The total value of output of industry at the township level and  above is estimated to have grown by 30.2 percent in the first  half of the year. In the second half of the year, the growth  rate tended to slow, and the annual increase over the previous  year is expected to be about 21 percent.    Fixed asset investment still maintained an exceedingly high  growth rate. This is directly related to the chaotic financial  situation. A great many units by short-term loans in violation  of the rules carried out different forms of arbitrary raising of  funds without the permission of the authorized departments. The  resulting financial confusion caused a decrease in banks'  sources of funds, making it difficult for them to support the  requirements of production and circulation and forcing the state  to issue a large amount of currency. Cash issuance rapidly  increased. In the first half of 1992, 2.1 billion yuan in  currency was withdrawn from circulation, but in the same period  in 1993, an additional 52.8 billion yuan was issued. The  difference between the decrease and the increase was 50.7  billion yuan.    Financial chaos also led to enterprises' circumventing state  macroeconomic controls and raising a large amount of funds to  guarantee projects, expanding the scale of investment. In the  first half of 1993, fixed asset investment grew by 60 percent.  Within that, investment in fixed assets under the ownership of  the whole people grew by 70.7 percent. After the state adopted  macroeconomic control measures in the last half of June,  financial order improved somewhat and the chaotic situation of  arbitrary short-term loans, arbitrary raising of funds, and  arbitrary establishment of financial organizations was  essentially curbed. The rate of development was slowed somewhat,  restraining new starts to a certain extent. In the second half  of the year, the investment growth rate will decline somewhat,  but still maintain an exceedingly high rate of growth. It is  estimated that annual fixed asset investment for the whole  society could reach 1.15 trillion yuan, an increase of about 46  percent over the previous year, becoming the year with the  greatest increase since the 1980s. Its major characteristics  were that the share of investment in the state budget further  declined and the share of investment outside the budget  (domestic loans, self-raised funds, and the use of foreign  funds) rose further.    But enterprise shortage of funds still is rather pronounced,  causing serious difficulties for normal enterprise production  and operations. A great many enterprises, because they lack  funds, have no way to purchase raw materials, affecting the  production of products that the market urgently needs and making  them stop production or partially stop production. In September  the production growth rate of state industrial enterprises was  only 6.8 percent. Some enterprises were in arrears on staff  wages. "Triangular debt" staged a comeback and mutual loan  arrearage among enterprises still exists. The main cause of the  shortage of enterprise funds is that money was tightened, which  created a new batch of triangular debts. From June through  August, the banks recalled a large amount of short-term loan  funds, but precisely during the same period in 1992, they put  out a large amount of short-term funds. The increase and the  decrease actually reduced the utilization of funds. Moreover, a  large portion of the short-term loan funds recalled were  enterprise circulating funds. With the decline in the growth  rate of the economy and the lowering of the intermediate demand,  some enterprises lacking in competitiveness naturally could  encounter sales difficulties on the cooling market, and reserves  could rise with corresponding stagnation and waste of some  funds. With the "three fevers" (real estate fever, stock fever,  and development zone fever), banks loaned funds to subordinate  companies to speculate on real estate and the central bank  demanded repayment in a limited time. Actually, it could not be  repaid. So, some banks could only block enterprise liquid  capital as a stopgap. In some places, enterprises with savings  in the bank could not take money out.    The income and the consumption of residents both rose and  the  market was stable in the midst of overall prosperity. In the  first half of the year, residents maintained worth by competing  to buy, but in the second half of the year this essentially  disappeared. Prices of imported home appliances and gold jewelry  went back down somewhat. As regards the overall supply and  demand for consumer items on the market, the supply remained  greater than the demand. It is estimated that the annual social  commodity retail sales figure will reach 1.35 trillion yuan, an  increase of about 23 percent over the previous year. Deducting  the price factor, the actual increase is about 9 percent. The  disparity between the rural market and the urban market is  rather great. Increases in the income and the consumption level  of rural residents still are clearly lower than the national  average. Income of rural and urban residents continues to  increase and the standard of living has improved somewhat, but  the disparity between the incomes of urban and rural residents  is gradually widening. According to preliminary calculations,  the ratio of the actual annual income of urban and rural  residents will expand to about 6:1 from 2.8:1 in 1992. It is  estimated that the annual per capita living expenses of urban  residents will reach 2,350 yuan. With the price factor deducted,  this is an actual increase of about 12 percent over the previous  year. The per capita net income of rural residents is about 860  yuan. With the price factor deducted, it is an actual increase  of about 2 percent over the previous year. The fact that  increases in farmers' income are not much, is the crux of the  difficulty for overall agricultural production and favorable  development of the national economy.    The inflation rate remains rather high. Since 1993, with the  "overheating" economy beginning to cool, prices exhibited an  overall rise, climbing from month to month. In the first three  quarters, retail prices rose 12 percent on average and the  prices of residents' living expenses rose 14 percent, with those  in 35 large and medium-sized cities rising about 20 percent. The  economy continuously cooled, but prices remained high. The main  reason was that prices are a delayed indicator. Although the  economy had cooled, the delayed effect of the economic  overheating in the previous stage continued to act on the prices  of consumer items. This round of price rises came mainly from  the state's making rather large adjustments or freeing up the  prices of some items and services necessary for living such as  grains; non-staple foods; fuel; rent, water, and electricity  fees; transportation fees; and tuition while macroeconomic  controls lacked the necessary complete measures, driving overall  price levels up. With residents' income gradually rising and  classes of consumption gradually opening up, some high consumers  gave impetus to the rise in the prices of consumer items. The  exchange rate of the renminbi for the U.S. dollar changed,  causing the prices of import and export commodities to soar. In  addition, such factors as increased wages also encouraged price  rises. It is estimated that annual new increases in issuance of  renminbi still will reach 145 billion yuan, and retail prices  will rise about 13 percent over 1992 and prices of residents'  living expenses will rise about 15 percent with prices in 35  large and medium-sized cities rising about 19 percent.    Foreign trade formed a deficit and the international balance  of payments was unbalanced. According to preliminary  calculations, 1993 exports totalled about US$92 billion, an  increase of about 7 percent over the previous year; and import  totals will break US$100 billion, an increase of more than 24  percent. Foreign trade imports greater than exports led to  greater foreign exchange expenditure than income and state  foreign exchange reserves declined for a foreign trade deficit  of approximately US$7.5 billion, the first in the 1990s.    The imbalance in the international balance of payments  exacerbated. The main reasons were that, beginning in 1993,  prices on the domestic market rose rather high and foreign sales  did not equal domestic sales. Some traditional large quantity  export products declined greatly and export transactions also  declined rather greatly, causing export reserves to be  inadequate. Rapid economic growth, flourishing domestic demand,  and the clearly rising reliance on imports, along with reduced  import tariffs caused rapidly increased imports of raw materials  in tight domestic demand such as rolled steel, copper, and  aluminum. The continuous delivery of large batches of equipment  ordered by large purchasing delegations that China sent to  Europe and the United States in 1992 also were a cause of high  import growth.    In 1994 China is in transition to the market economy  and a policy adjustment period. The economy has already entered  sustained, rapid, healthy development. It is expected that the  rate of economic growth will recede somewhat and the rate of  growth of the national economy will be lower than in 1993,  maintaining the rather high level of approximately 10 percent,  which to a certain extent could relieve restraint on development  of the national economy from the transportation "bottleneck" in  recent years and curb large price rises, creating a good  economic environment for adjustments in the economic structure  and avoiding the occurrence of large rises and large falls in  economic development and giving 1994 a "soft landing."    Improved structural adjustment and maintenance of  appropriate  investment. Because of the influence of several factors, it is  estimated that the rate of increase for fixed asset investment  in the entire society will decline somewhat in 1994. Total  investment will exceed 1.35 trillion yuan, but the actual growth  rate for investment will be 1-2 percentage points higher than  the actual growth rate of the GNP. Because in 1993 the state  adopted macroeconomic control measures, generally eliciting the  attention and the praise of people in foreign economic circles,  in 1994 the maintenance of constant growth in the scale of  foreign investment in Chinese fixed assets and the steady growth  of the national economy will play an ever more important part.  So, the maintenance of appropriate investment will help to guard  against economic slippage and the intensification of the  disparity between overall supply and overall demand will help to  rationally adjust the economic structure.    Given impetus by costs from the previous stage and affected  by the delayed effect of excessive issuance of currency, it will  be very difficult to curb inflation. It will be extremely  difficult to think about maintaining price rises at 6 percent or  under. Retail prices for the whole society in 1994 are expected  to approach 10 percent. Urban resident cost of living price  indices could exceed 10 percent. So, in 1994 we should adopt  effective measures to keep prices down and avoid social problems  caused by loss of macroeconomic controls and promote improvement  in the economic environment.    The economic environment has improved somewhat, helping to  develop foreign trade exports. In 1994 China will be restored as  a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT). Based on the consideration of being restored to GATT, at  the beginning of the year, China announced a merging of the  exchange rates. Because the world economy will tend to recover  in 1994, the international market demand will increase somewhat,  and the Chinese government will encourage increased exports, the  1994 domestic economic environment can be expected to be  somewhat better than 1993. In addition, there is the devaluation  of the yuan and the impetus to foreign trade that can come from  that, especially the development of the export trade. But it  still will be rather great difficult to increase the export  trade to realize a balance of trade in 1994. It is estimated  that in 1994 foreign trade will grow at the rate of about 16  percent and total growth will still be held down by the high  rate of increase of foreign imports. Within that, imports will  increase by about 21 percent over the previous year and exports  will increase by about 10 percent over the previous year, and  the annual trade deficit will be about US$10 billion.</p>

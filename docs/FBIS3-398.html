Arde] </F>   [Text] Durban March 4 SAPA -- State President F W de Klerk  on Friday welcomed the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] decision to  provisionally register for the April elections. Speaking at a  National Party [NP] meeting in Chatsworth, south of Durban, the  NP leader said the party's decision, before the midnight Friday  deadline, indicated the "strong possibility" of Inkatha's  participation in the elections.    However, Mr de Klerk said: "I would have preferred  registration full stop with no strings attached".    The NP leader was addressing thousands of supporters on the  last leg of his two-day election roadshow through Natal.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Fang Sheng, of the Chinese </F> People's University, by staff reporter Gao Lu (7559 6424):  "Market Economy and Opening to the Outside World" -- first  paragraph is JINGJI RIBAO introduction]    [Text] Fang Sheng, whose original name was Chen Shi, was  born on 9 October 1925. His native place is Lianjiang County,  Fujian Province. In 1946, he entered the Taiwan University to  study agroeconomy. After graduating from the first political  economy graduate class of the Chinese People's University in  1952, he took up teaching work in that university. He was  transferred to Shenzhen University to become a vice president of  the university from 1983 to 1986. At present, he is a professor  of economy of the Chinese People's University and concurrently a  member of the university committee, a part-time professor of the  teaching team of Zhongshan University and the China Association  for Science and Technology, an executive director of the China  Taiwan Studies Society, the president of the Beijing Taiwan  Economic Studies Center, an executive director of the China  Market Economy Studies Society, and a director of the China  Comprehensive Development Academy. His studies on economic  theories involve the commodity economy, the market economy, the  individual economy, the special economic zone economy, Taiwan's  economy, and opening to the outside world, and he has put  forward distinctive ideas. He has published more than 100  academic theses. Major works published by him (including works  for which he acted as the chief editor and works he wrote  together with others) include: Economic Reform in China  (published in 1980, and translated and published in the United  States), The Issue of Socialist Economy in China, Studies on the  Economy of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, Issues of the  Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, Opening Up Economy in China, and  so on.  <H3>  Opening Up to the Outside World Is Liberating and Developing  the Productive Forces </H3>   [Gao] Comrade Deng Xiaoping made some important remarks in  the south from 18 January to 21 February 1992. On 23 February,  you published in RENMIN RIBAO a long article, "Opening to the  Outside World and Utilizing Capitalism," which attracted  extensive attention at home and abroad. You were really beating  the drum of the times!    [Fang] That article had been written two to three years  before it was published. That it was able to be published at  that time was related to the publication of the important  remarks in the south by Comrade Xiaoping. Opening up to the  outside world began after the Third Plenary Session of the 11  CPC Central Committee. With regard to the past practice of  closing the country to international intercourse, opening up to  the outside world is undoubtedly a reform and an even more  profound reform at that. Like other reforms, it is to liberate  and develop the productive forces.    [Gao] This important role of opening up to the outside world  is related to its content. Therefore, there is a question of  understanding and knowledge, and explanation and interpretation  are needed.    [Fang] The first is to introduce funds and develop the  productive forces. Shortage of funds is an important factor  restraining socialist modernization in our country. In the  past, we thought of solving this problem by relying on ourselves  alone. As a matter of fact, having no domestic or foreign debts  was not an expression of superiority, but only tied us up. It  was not conducive to developing the productive forces. Since  the beginning of reform and opening up, we have made use of more  than 100 billion yuan of foreign funds, most of which have been  used for key construction projects in agriculture,  communications, telecommunications, and the energy and raw  materials industries, and for strengthening some weak links in  the national economy. To develop foreign-invested enterprises  is an important way to introduce advanced foreign technology, to  use foreign scientific management methods for reference, and to  develop the market abroad.    The second is the introduction of advanced foreign  technology. Science and technology are the first productive  force. Much of the science and technology of our country is  already in a leading position in the world, but on the whole,  there is still a certain gap with the developed countries.  Since the beginning of reform and opening up, the introduction  of technology has been carried out on a large scale in our  country. By the end of 1992, we had introduced more than 18,400  technical transformation projects, which increased the output  value by 874.2 billion yuan, and increased profits and taxes  handed over to the state by 103.5 billion yuan. The  introduction of technology also has laid a foundation for new  industries and has promoted the development of high- and new-  technology industries so that many traditional products have  caught up with those at the international level.    Then comes the introduction of modern economic management  methods and the use of such methods for reference. In our  country, economic management is backward and is a far cry from  the demands of large-scale social production and modernization.  Without changing the backward situation in management and  without modernizing economic management, the entire national  economy will be seriously impeded. An important task in opening  up to the outside world is to introduce and use for reference  the management methods and ways of operation of developed  foreign countries. In the past dozen years and more, we have  learned from the experience of foreign countries in scientific  management, effectively improved the management system of our  country, and promoted the development of social production  through channels, including sending personnel abroad, inviting  personnel to come, and setting up foreign-invested enterprises.  <H5>  The Market Economy Demands Opening Wider to the Outside World </H5>   [Gao] Opening up to the outside world is an important means  to promote rapid economic development. Today, when we are  determined to establish the socialist market structure and  practice the market economy, the importance and practical  significance of opening up to the outside world are even more  prominent.    [Fang] We still lack experience in practicing the market  economy. We have to learn the practice of other countries  through opening up to the outside world and in exchanges and  contacts with countries all over the world, particularly with  modern capitalist countries. We should explicitly put forward  the necessity of learning from, making use of, and using for  reference, the useful market-economy knowledge and experience of  capitalist countries that have practiced the market economy for  several hundred years. Capitalist countries have accumulated  rich experience in their economic activities over a long period.  Acute competition demands that they concern themselves with  changes in the supply and demand relationship and in commodity  prices in the market all the time, and that they readjust their  own production and operation activities in good time; the threat  of bankruptcy compels them to try a hundred and one ways to tap  potential, lower production costs, and improve quality so that  they may defeat their rivals in the market -- a merciless  battlefield; and the pursuit of profit urges them to constantly  improve management and operation, carry out careful calculation  and strict budgeting, and pay attention to economic results. In  a word, their immediate interests make them work hard to enable  their enterprises to meet the needs of the market. Only in this  way can their enterprises have vitality and attain the goal of  making profits. In this respect, some of their practices are  quite worthy of learning.    [Gao] The market economy itself is of an open type. If we  say it is still possible to close the door of our country to  practice the traditional planned economy for a period of time,  it seems totally impossible to close the door to practice the  market economy.    [Fang] I think so. We should not and cannot close the door  in developing the socialist market economy and in establishing  and perfecting the socialist market economy structure, but must  open the door of our country, establish closer ties with the  world economy, and further develop economic relations and trade  with various countries of the world. The world today is an open  one, and it is also a large unified international market. No  country can isolate itself from the world economy and the  international market. With the in-depth development of the  world's new technology revolution, the international division of  work is being carried out at a deeper level, the international  market is constantly expanding, and the economic ties between  countries are becoming closer and closer. To enable our  country's market economy to keep abreast of this new historical  tide of the world, we must energetically take part in the  international division of work, and plunge ourselves into the  competition in the international market. While formulating the  strategy for developing the domestic market economy, we must  take into consideration the trends of development in the world  economy, understand the laws of change in the international  market, and seize and make timely use of international  opportunities that are conducive to us.    [Gao] In the world today, the modern market economy seems to  have become a world system.    [Fang] A world market economy system has been formed. The  economies of various countries have been brought into this  system to varying degrees, and cannot be independent of this  system. Likewise, China's socialist market economy has to be  geared to the world and become a part of the world's market  economy system. Therefore, we must respect international norms  and act in accordance with them. However, it is also necessary  to gradually understand and master ways of using international  norms in the practice of opening up to the outside world.  International norms mean customary practices accepted by the  majority of countries and regions in international exchanges.  Although they are not in a written form, they have a binding  legal force. Viewed from the angle of developing our country's  market economy and of promoting economic exchanges between our  country and various countries of the world, the study and use of  international norms in economy and trade have even greater  significance.  <H3>  Re-Entry Into the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade  (GATT) Requires the Establishment of a Market Economy Structure </H3>   [Gao] China's application for the restoration of its status  as a GATT signatory state, that is, what people usually call  re-entry into GATT, is undoubtedly an important move to open  wider to the outside world, to enable China's economy to move  toward the outside world, and to join the great international  market.    [Fang] The purpose of applying for re-entry into GATT is to  promote the development of China's foreign trade, close economic  ties with various countries of the world, a better grasp of  international economic information, and more rapid development  of the export-oriented economy. Since the beginning of reform  and opening up, the Chinese economy's moving toward the outside  world has become a trend. For various reasons, however, trade  conflicts often have occurred. This requires the coordination  of world- acknowledged principles, and each country should  undertake responsibility while enjoying rights. This is the  only way conducive to further expanding China's economic  relations with foreign countries and to the Chinese economy's  really moving toward the outside world.    [Gao] Seven years has passed since 1986, when China applied  for re-entry into GATT, and talks concerning the matter are  still being held. The factors affecting China's re-entry into  GATT are very complicated. In addition to political factors,  obstacles in the economic aspect are also worthy of examination.    [Fang] One of the fundamental issues is that GATT is based  on  the market economy, but China has practiced a highly  centralized, unified planned economy for a long time. The two  are incompatible as far as the economic structure is concerned,  and it is difficult for the two to be in tune. This cannot but  become a serious obstacle affecting China's re-entry into GATT.  This issue once more shows that if we still do not change the  old traditional economic structure and establish a new market  economy structure, how much we will be out of step with the  times; and if some people still have doubts and worries about  China's practicing the market economy, and even take a negative  attitude toward this, how greatly they have gone against the  tide of historical development. Following the reform of the  economic structure for many years, we have greatly reduced the  scope of mandatory planning and gradually have expanded the role  of market regulation. To date, we have explicitly put forward  the necessity of developing the socialist market economy and of  establishing the socialist market economy structure. This will  make it easier for China's market economy to converge with the  world's market economy, to meet the requirements of GATT, and to  create very favorable conditions for re-entry into GATT.  Following the reform and opening over the past 10 years and  more, China's economy has now developed the strength to  participate in international economic activities. A relatively  stable international trade environment is needed for speeding up  the socialist modernization of China and for developing the  socialist market economy.  <H5>  Do Not Copy Mechanically </H5>   [Gao] It is an unavoidable task to study the experience of  foreign countries and use it for reference, including experience  in practicing the market economy. In recent years, you have  stressed somewhat the "opening wider to the outside world and  correctly making use of capitalism." What is "correctly making  use of capitalism" in your view?    [Fang] First of all, we must study and understand foreign  experience and capitalism. Without understanding them, we  cannot learn well. For example, a traditional view holds that  in capitalist countries, where the market economy is practiced,  it is possible to manage individual enterprises in a planned and  organized manner, while the entire social production is in a  state of anarchy and the state can accomplish nothing.    [Gao] A conclusion opposing the market economy or a  conclusion opposing macroregulation and control can be deduced  from this view. Please tell me something about the actual  situation in this respect.    [Fang] This common failing of capitalist countries did exist  in history and it remains serious in some countries today.  Since World War II, however, relatively great changes have  taken place. The state has strengthened intervention in the  economy and has done something to deal with the problems brought  about by the market economy. To restore their war-damaged  economies, some capitalist countries even once put the economy  under very strict control. Countries practicing the five-year or  ten-year plans, which are regarded as the patent of the planned  economy, are not rare. Is this not macroregulation and control  of the market economy, if it is put in our way of saying things?  Of course, their control of this kind is not usually carried  out by means of administrative orders, but by economic and legal  means. In particular, such control is guaranteed by  legislation. In fact, the market economy of Western countries  today is not a totally free market economy without any restraint  or planning.    [Gao] All this is worthy of our attention. In the course of  establishing the market economy structure, the government should  change and improve the means for carrying out macroregulation  and control, and also should strengthen its functions in  macroregulation and control.    [Fang] Moreover, it should proceed from China's realities,  and should not copy mechanically. This is not just because the  socialist market economy is essentially different from the  capitalist market economy in terms of social nature, but also  because we are still in the initial stage of socialism, and  although many measures adopted by economically developed  capitalist countries in developing the market economy are  neutral in nature and without class character, they are  implemented in a specific social system and are bound to have  the characteristics of their respective societies. We cannot  copy mechanically, even what is effective in the capitalist  system, and we should integrate such measures within China's  realities.    [Gao] We are practicing the market economy under socialist  conditions. This is the most important reality.    [Fang] Therefore, the most important thing is that we must  uphold socialism and must guard against and overcome rightist or  "leftist" deviations. In addition, I think that Shenzhen's  experience in studying foreign experience and using it for  reference should be properly studied and made use of.</p>

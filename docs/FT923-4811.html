			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / British unions seek Blackpool illumination: Next week's TUC meeting will hear demands for the organisation to develop a more focused role Is there any point in having a Trades Union Congress? The 1,000 delegates who meet in Blackpool next week for the 124th annual gathering of Britain's 'parliament of labour' must be tired of hearing that question from sceptical outsiders. But it is not an unreasonable one, even from people who believe that trade unions continue to have an important role in industrial life. Indeed, it is a question that the congress will debate this year, albeit in coded form. The TUC is, confusingly, both the annual seaside gathering and a bureaucracy based in London with regional branches. The latter employs about 230 people and attempts to define and communicate common union standpoints and enforce certain club rules, such as those banning the poaching of members by rival unions. Consideration has been given to making the seaside gathering a biennial affair but the idea was rejected on the grounds that it is, in the words of one TUC official, a 'unique PR opportunity'. That might seem an odd notion given that for several years, and this year more than ever, pre-TUC media coverage centres on when Mr Norman Willis, the jovial but ineffectual TUC general secretary, will resign. Almost all industrial countries have a central trade union body similar to the TUC. Some, such as France, have the misfortune to have two, based on historic religious and political rivalries. Common sense suggests that as long as there are unions there needs to be some body to co-ordinate their actions and views. 'We are the glue for the unions,' claims Mr John Monks, the TUC's deputy general secretary. He should take over from Mr Willis within the year if the leaders of the big unions are prepared to translate their private criticism of Willis's leadership into action. But does the TUC, even after the recent 20 per cent cut in staffing, really need the same staffing levels as it had in 1979, when there were more than 12m trade unionists, as opposed to today's 7.5m? And does it need the myriad of committees producing papers which have little impact? More important, should it take up the time of senior trade unionists, who might be better occupied seeking ways to run their own unions more efficiently? The answer of leading 'rationalisers' such as Mr Gavin Laird, the general secretary of the AEEU craft union, has for many years been a loud 'no'. Many other general secretaries, bruised from painful rationalisations within their own unions, also resent contributing so much to the Pounds 8m that the TUC will receive from its affiliates this year. Some of them, such as Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU general union, talk about a far more compact 'centre of excellence' providing important information on European Community directives, health and safety, the environment and other subjects that unions may find difficult to research on their own. The problem in the past has always been that nobody could agree on what the TUC should cease doing to allow it to become that 'compact centre of excellence'. That excuse no longer holds, if it ever did, thanks to three developments: The fourth consecutive defeat for the Labour party and another Conservative government hostile to union views mean the TUC's traditional lobbying function on national issues looks almost redundant. The function will not disappear entirely; one side-effect of the recent abolition of the National Economic Development Council has been to open the doors of the Treasury and other Whitehall departments to discreet delegations from the TUC. But there seems little point in the TUC laboriously producing an alternative Budget every year or, as it is currently planning, duplicating the work done by the unemployment pressure groups. The emergence of 'super unions' threatens some of the TUC's functions. The three or four large unions which will be established from the current spate of mergers, and which will account for more than two-thirds of TUC members, are likely to need only the TUC's core activities such as trade union education, and health and safety work. The small unions, which most need the TUC's services, will be outvoted over trimming services. This may eventually drive them into the arms of the super unions. The government's intention to abolish the TUC's Bridlington agreement, which regulates the competition for members between unions. This is arguably the TUC's most important role in a country with multi-industry unions. Under the government's plans, workers will be allowed to join any union. As a result, the TUC's regulatory function will be severely impaired and a new round of internecine warfare between unions could further damage their standing. At next week's conference there will be much talk of refocusing the TUC and a motion will be passed which will cut its official priorities from 17 to just six, including health and safety and relations with Europe. But when asked what the TUC would stop doing as a result of the motion, a senior TUC official could only say that 'some committees will analyse things in less depth'. This will not be a watershed congress for rationalising the TUC. But coming in the wake of Labour's election defeat the organisation is edging towards a broader based politics and a a more disciplined emphasis on delivering services to members. The TUC is also making an effort to find more common ground with employers and hence it has invited Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, to address the congress. However, it is hard to see anything meaningful coming out of this new relationship. The TUC and the big unions are well aware that the tide of industrial and political affairs is working strongly against them but so far they have been impotent to do anything about it. In the short-term things will get worse as the government's latest reforms of the unions and public services - the heartland of trade unionism - further diminish numbers and influence. Yet the paradox for the TUC and the big unions is that if they wish to have national influence again they will only do so by becoming far less political. Union leaders are prepared to see some loosening of the Labour link but they are loathe to see it cut completely. The unions cannot be written off. Strikes are at an all time low but strikes are not necessarily an indicator of union power. More than a third of employees are unionised, more than two-thirds in the public sector, and more than half are covered by collective bargaining. But if the unions are to maximise their potential influence they need to be better led. An important test of the unions' ability to achieve this will be the extent to which they can put their own house, the TUC, in order.</p>

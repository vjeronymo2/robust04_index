			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RUNNING DEL MAR FOR THE BETTOR;  </P> <P> OPERATIONS CHIEF ALSO FOUND EXCITEMENT AS NFL REFEREE  </P> <P> The pictures on Harry (Bud) Brubaker's wall tell the story of his life --  autographed mementoes from Babe Ruth, Bing Crosby, Hank Aaron, Willie Shoemaker  and baseball manager Sparky Anderson, whom Brubaker coached at Dorsey High  School in his native Los Angeles.  </P> <P> At one time, Bud, as his friends call him, was on a first-name basis with  Marilyn Monroe -- "a shy, gorgeous woman," he calls her -- and former FBI  director J. Edgar Hoover -- whom he remembers as "a mysterious man, an aloof  man."  </P> <P> One thing Monroe and Hoover had in common, Brubaker said, was that they both  loved horses.  </P> <P> Brubaker, 79, is director of operations for the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club. He  oversees racing at the Del Mar Race Track, where he has worked since 1945 and  which ends its 50th season today. Brubaker also is still a consultant to the  National Football League. He worked as a referee from 1950 through 1970,  officiating some of the biggest games in professional football.  </P> <P> He is also a longtime resident of North San Diego County, which he considers  "just a notch below heaven." He's lived here every summer since 1945 and  continuously since 1976. His current postmark is Encinitas.  </P> <P> As Brubaker reviewed eight decades of change, he had a kind, cherubic face and  a quick, easy laugh  </P> <P> About the increasing congestion in San Diego County: "I swear we're getting to  be like L.A. The traffic is just incredible."  </P> <P> A few minutes later, he's marveling over the speed, size and strength of  today's pro athlete. He says pro football will end in the next century because  it will be humanly impossible to take the punishment required to play it.  </P> <P> "The size and speed will finish off the game," he said. "The human body wasn't  meant to take all that. Nobody in the defensive line weighs less than 275  pounds any more, and they all run 40 yards in less than five seconds. All quick  as cats, too."  </P> <P> Brubaker still scouts potential referees for the NFL. He has his eye on a  "terrific ref" in the Pacific 10 conference but knows he can't recommend him  because he's only 4-foot-10.  </P> <P> "I have nothing against short people," he said, "but, these days in the NFL,  you've got to have a presence on the field. If you don't, they'll walk over  you."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Intimidation, NFL style  </P> <P> Brubaker recalled that more than one player has tried to do that to him.  </P> <P> "In one game in Dallas in the late '60s, the Cowboys were driving," he said.  "They had the ball near the other team's goal line. They were playing in the  Cotton Bowl then -- what a crazy, noisy old place that was. Well, somebody  fumbled the ball into the end zone, and it rolled out of bounds.  </P> <P> "The rule in those days was for the other team to get the ball back. It was  ruled a touchback and came to the 20-yard line. Don Meredith (then the Cowboys'  quarterback, later a commentator on ABC's 'Monday Night Football') just came  unglued. He was yelling, 'How could that be? That's ridiculous!' And the crowd  just went bananas. He and I went 'round and 'round for quite a while -- one of  those games that lingers in the memory."  </P> <P> After the 1968 NFL championship game between Baltimore and Cleveland, won with  stunning ease by Baltimore, Brubaker and the officiating crew he headed were  speculating as to how severely the Colts would hammer their next opponent, the  New York Jets, the American Football League champions in Super Bowl III.  </P> <P> "We all said Baltimore would kill 'em," he said, which, of course, didn't  happen. After brashly saying that he "guaranteed" a victory, Jets quarterback  Joe Namath pulled it off, a gesture and a game Brubaker remembers as a turning  point in NFL history.  </P> <P> Brubaker never refereed a Super Bowl game, but he did oversee several NFL title  games.  </P> <P> </P> <P> It's the Excitement  </P> <P> He loved officiating and watching football for the same reason he loves going  to the track each day and doing his job -- supervising the parking lot  attendants, the ticket takers, the program sellers, ushers and gatemen.  </P> <P> "I admit it," he said. "I love excitement."  </P> <P> He's seen people win as much as $200,000 in one day, and he's seen the sadness  of someone losing that much.  </P> <P> He said a frequent bettor at the track was Pete Rose, whom Brubaker got to know  through Sparky Anderson, who managed Rose when both were with the Cincinnati  Reds in the 1970s.  </P> <P> "Every time the Reds were in town to play the Padres in a night game, Pete was  at the track during the day," Brubaker said.  </P> <P> Ever a man who adheres to rules, Brubaker sighed.  </P> <P> "Pete knew the rules," he said. "If he bet on baseball, he must have known it  would come back to haunt him. Why did he do it?"  </P> <P> When Brubaker started refereeing NFL games, he got $100 a game. When he  finished almost 20 years ago, he was paid $450 a game. He said that now, if a  ref is a 10-year veteran, he makes $2,000 a game.  </P> <P> "You have to enjoy it," he said, "and you have to have the highest integrity.  I've had people ask me, 'When players say those things about you, doesn't it  bother you?' And quite honestly, it didn't bother me. But I've seen a lot of  guys quit because they couldn't stand the criticism."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Instant Replay Endorsed  </P> <P> Officiating now is different than when Brubaker did it. He thinks the  relatively new innovation of instant replay is a good idea "because everyone  makes mistakes. Even though I do think it hurts a ref's confidence knowing that  thing is up there."  </P> <P> When Brubaker stalked NFL hash marks, officials who threw flags couldn't say  "sorry" and retract their intention -- as they're permitted to now.  </P> <P> Did Brubaker ever make a call that cost a team a game?  </P> <P> "Probably several times," he said with a laugh. "There were more than a few I  wish I'd had back. But most of the mistakes a ref makes are never picked up by  the crowd or anyone else."  </P> <P> One of the best decisions he ever made was coming to work at the track. He's  proud of what he said is one of the largest "handles" in the nation: With  off-track betting, Del Mar averages $7.2 million a day in proceeds. He said  that racing at Del Mar, minus off-track revenues, averages $3 million a day  during the season.  </P> <P> Brubaker is often asked whether he likes horses and whether he ever wins any  money on them.  </P> <P> "Oh, once in a while I bet," he said. "Sometimes, I'm lucky; sometimes, I'm  not. Knowledge is a great thing, but I'm hardly a confirmed horse bettor. I've  been around too long and too much to spend all the money I make betting  horses."  </P> <P> On the rare occasions that he's around horses, Brubaker is apt to appear  tentative, something he never was on a football field staring at the likes of  Big Daddy Lipscomb.  </P> <P> "Mine is a front-side, not a back-side operation," he said. "Horses are on the  back side. I handle the people who come to the races. I don't dislike horses,  but I've never ridden very much. People, much more than horses, are my cup of  tea."  </P> <P> In the off-season, Brubaker helps to oversee off-track betting at the  fairgrounds.  </P> <P> With such growth, a lot is gained, but a little bit is lost, Brubaker said,  just as it is with NFL linemen who in no way resemble ordinary men. Del Mar is  now "more serious," he acknowledged. People have to work harder, whether  they're managing the track, riding a horse or scrambling to make a buck by  picking a winner.  </P> <P> Somewhere along the way, everyone seems to have gone a little bit crazy over  fun and games.  </P> <P> Brubaker recalls fondly the days when he would greet Betty Grable or Harry  James in the Turf Club. He played softball with James and often shared a joke  with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, who he said were as side-splittingly funny  in person as they were in the movies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Joe Frisco, Funnyman  </P> <P> Out of all of the people he knew -- Crosby, Bob Hope, Mickey Rooney, Jimmy  Durante or Pat O'Brien -- Brubaker said the funniest was a comic named Joe  Frisco.  </P> <P> "He was one of those guys you find yourself thinking about 40 years later,"  Brubaker said. "Maybe it was the way he said things, off the cuff all the time.  He'd stick his hands in his pockets, pull out a dollar and say, 'I must be  wearing somebody else's pants.' Or he'd check into a cheap hotel by the beach,  gaze out at the Pacific Ocean and say, 'Well, at least for a little place, they  do have a nice pool.' He kept everybody in stitches all the time. He just never  became a big star like Crosby."  </P> <P> What he remembers about those days is that there seemed to be more cookouts on  the beach, more laughs, less intensity. But he wouldn't trade any of it, then  or now, for anything.  </P> <P> "Mainly," he said, "it's all been a lot of fun."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGS DEAL MAKELA TO SABRES, GET BUSKAS IN WAIVER DRAFT  </P> <P> As the Kings made one of their many trips through customs last season, an  airport official stopped left wing Mikko Makela when the hockey player  attempted to put his camera through an X-ray machine.  </P> <P> "What is that camera's ASA?" she asked.  </P> <P> Obviously unsure what the official was talking about, the Finnish-born Makela,  hoping to gain immunity through his status, declared, "I'm with the team."  </P> <P> No longer.  </P> <P> After struggling unsuccessfully for a year to become an effective part of the  team, Makela was traded to the Buffalo Sabres Monday for left wing Mike  Donnelly.  </P> <P> The Kings sent Donnelly to their New Haven farm team.  </P> <P> Hours later, the Kings picked up veteran defenseman Rod Buskas from the  Pittsburgh Penguins in the NHL waiver draft.  </P> <P> Each club was allowed to protect 18 skaters and two goalies. The Kings,  drafting 12th, got Buskas, but didn't lose anybody when the other 20 teams  failed to select one of their unprotected players.  </P> <P> The Makela experiment began with high hopes when the Kings traded Ken  Baumgartner and Hubie McDonough to the New York Islanders last November for  him. In a little more than four seasons with the Islanders, Makela scored 95  goals and 219 points. His best year was 1987-88, when he scored 36 goals and  had 76 points.  </P> <P> But the old Makela never was seen with the Kings. Even playing on Wayne  Gretzky's line, Makela did not find his old form.  </P> <P> He played 45 games with the Kings, scoring seven goals and assisting on 14.  </P> <P> By playoff time, Makela was little more than a highly paid tourist, shooting  pictures of the Banff countryside while the Kings prepared for the Calgary  Flames.  </P> <P> "He had the one great year," said King General Manager Rogie Vachon. "He had  all the tools, but, for some reason, he lost his touch around the net and then  lost his confidence. He was not good defensively, so if he didn't have the  offense, he couldn't help you much."  </P> <P> A 5-11, 185-pounder, Donnelly spent the better part of the last two seasons  with Buffalo's Rochester farm team.  </P> <P> With their season opener Thursday, the Kings sent goalie Mario Gosselin,  wingers Keith Crowder, Brian Lawton and Kyosti Karjalainen and center Mikael  Lindholm to their Phoenix farm club.  </P></p>

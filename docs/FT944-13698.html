			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index struggles to hold the 3,000 mark - Market Report The fortunes of the dollar and the US bond markets continued to undermine equities in London yesterday. The market plunged through the FT-SE 3,000 mark at the opening and although the Index managed to struggle back to this benchmark at the close, the mood remained depressed. The recovery in the second half of the session reflected the rally in New York bonds. The final reading of 3000.9 on the FT-SE Index showed a fall on the day of 28.2 points, but the Index had been down to 2,985.6. The weakness in Federal bonds, reflected in the move above 8 per cent in yield on the key long bond, overwhelmed all other factors in UK equities yesterday morning. However, the stock market also reacted uncomfortably to the latest survey of business opinion from members of the Confederation of British Industry, which referred to expectations of higher prices. This fuelled fears that the next rise in base rates might come before the end of the year, especially if US bonds continue to exert similar upward pressures on global rates. Although trading volumes remained moderate yesterday, one leading US investment bank was believed to have lost money heavily after taking on a very large sell programme which had to be passed on into the market after share prices had fallen heavily. The programme, displayed on the trading screens just before the close of dealing, included substantial tranches of stock in such leading names as BTR, RTZ, Reed International, British Gas and Abbey National. The programme also took in a large number of small-capitalised stocks, which are notably difficult to unload when markets are weak, and are likely to have cost the US bank dear in yesterday's conditions. Trading programmes have become high risk operations in a volatile market. Stock index futures provided the impetus for much of the action in equities. The FT-SE Index opened nearly 30 points down and gave further ground as bonds slid lower. Turnover in equities was fairly restrained at first, with market traders unwilling, to venture into the market. The Seaq total was swollen later when the sell programme was printed and the final total of 569.7m shares was nearly 25 per cent up on the previous session. Non-Footsie business made up around 56 per cent of the total business. Losses among the dollar-earners played a significant role in depressing the FT-SE 100 Index; City analysts calculate that that around one fifth of aggregate profits of the Footsie -listed companies are influenced by the dollar's fortunes. However, oil shares proved relatively resistant to dollar pressures and utility stocks strongly outperformed the market on dividend optimism. Base rate nervousness showed itself in weakness among the retail and consumer stocks, where most of the high street store groups gave ground. There were few beneficiaries, however, from the CBI report's stress on investment plans among British companies. Traders stressed that the sharpness of the market's bounce when New York steadied - the Dow Average was 7 points up in UK hours - implied that London could open higher today if US bonds extend their recovery. This afternoon brings the disclosure of the latest monthly US durable goods figures, which have in the past proved highly significant for US bond trends. Analysts are predicting a small fall after the 6.1 per cent gain in the previous monthly data, a trend which could prove helpful for bond markets. But confidence will be tested later this week when Washington releases statistics on unemployment claims and third quarter gross domestic product. Markets are also nervous ahead of tomorrow's meeting at the Bundesbank.</p>

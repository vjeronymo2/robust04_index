			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / New test for ERM parities YESTERDAY'S Bastille Day holiday in France provided no respite for the European exchange rate mechanism, with the French and Danish currencies under renewed pressure. Central banks in the Netherlands and Denmark intervened in support of the Danish krone as it reached its lower intervention point against the guilder in the ERM, while the Bundesbank again bought French francs in an attempt to limit its slide. Hopes of more substantial support through a cut in official interest rates at today's Bundesbank council meeting were damped after the bank said it would not be holding a press conference. The terms at which it elected to lend funds to the German domestic money market yesterday also did little to encourage expectations of lower rates. The volume of funds provided as a result of the Bundesbank's latest repurchase tender was at the upper end of expectations. But the rate at which the money was provided - 7.28 per cent - was only marginally lower than the 7.30 per cent charged previously. There is no reason to doubt that German, French and EC monetary officials have been sincere this week in declaring that they see no fundamental reason for speculative pressure against the franc. But if the Bundesbank relaxes its policy in response to external pressure, it could damage its long-term credibility as an inflation fighter. The krone closed at DKr3.8951 to the D-Mark, close to its floor of DKr3.9016, while the franc closed in London at FFr3.417, down from the previous day's FFr3.414.</p>

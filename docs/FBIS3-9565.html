			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Defense Ministry spokesman reports that the  press organs and mass media have recently presented the news on  the lifting of the U.S. embargo against Albania, which also  applied to former communist countries.    The Defense Ministry of the Republic of Albania received  official confirmation from the press secretary's office in the  White House. In Presidential Act 94/18, dated 22 March 1994,  U.S. President Bill Clinton states: In continuance of  prerogatives granted to me from Part 503-A of the Law on Foreign  Assistance dated 1961, with amendments, and from Part 3-A,  Article 1, of the Law on Control of Export of Arms, I define  that the supply with articles and defense services for the  Governments of Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,  and Romania will strengthen the security of the United States  and encourage world peace.    This decision by President Clinton is another expression of  the successful development of relations between Albania and the  United States and is a clear indication of the extension of  close political, economic, and administrative relations, as well  as those in the field of defense. This news has been welcomed  by the military and all the Army staffs, as well as by the broad  public of our people.</p>

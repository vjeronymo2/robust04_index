			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cray revamps production lines Cray Research, the world's leading supercomputer company, plans to revamp its manufacturing operations to speed production. The initiative will cut 382 jobs, plus about 1,000 temporary lay-offs. The company said yesterday it would temporarily suspend some production operations in Wisconsin to install new equipment and 1,000 workers would be idle for up to eight weeks. Cray said it would take a charge in the fourth quarter of about Dollars 8.5m, or 25 cents a share, to cover severance charges and costs for idle production. Cray is facing competition from makers of massively parallel supercomputers that are less expensive than traditional supercomputers. IBM's entry into the market has increased competitive pressures on Cray. Mr John Carlson, Cray chairman and chief executive, said the new manufacturing system would cut production time in half, to about 16 weeks, reduce inventories and cut costs. 'We are retooling our operations unit to serve tomorrow's market place and to grow,' Mr Carlson said in a letter to employees. The actions are 'unavoidable,' he said. 'Our customers have choices today they didn't have just a few years ago. 'If we don't reduce the cost of our products to customers, they will simply do business with suppliers who can. We must grow; it is our only hope for a successful future.'</p>

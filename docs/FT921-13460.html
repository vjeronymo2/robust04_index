			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Bankers face new loan for WPP BANKERS are braced to receive a demand for a new loan of up to Pounds 100m from WPP less than a year after the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 555m) debt of the world's biggest advertising group was rescheduled. Bankers said they expected a formal request for new money from WPP in the next few weeks and admitted that some of the group's 40 banks may be outraged at having to provide the additional credit so soon. But the biggest lenders are adopting a philosophical approach: 'It is disappointing that the business appears to need new money,' said one of the group's leading bankers. 'But we are not pushing the panic button.' Another banker said the banks are only likely to provide the funds if WPP gives a commitment on a timetable for disposing of 'non-core businesses'. But they are not expected to insist that WPP sells one of its two worldwide networks of advertising agencies, the JWT Group and Ogilvy Group. 'There is no doubt that WPP took on too much debt when it bought JWT and Ogilvy,' said a banker. 'But it would be disastrous to sell them, since they are its only businesses capable of generating significant earnings.' The bank lenders to WPP - led by the US banks JP Morgan and Bankers Trust, Barclays of the UK and Germany's Deutsche Bank - have been kept closely informed of the advertising group's progress since the rescheduling was completed in April. Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, has been reviewing WPP's monthly management accounts on behalf of the banks. The banks are aware that WPP's businesses have performed below budget since the refinancing. But one banker said: 'It is encouraging that WPP has not breached its banking covenants (or conditions of the loan).' Nonetheless he expected that the company would make a formal request to its banks for a short-term facility of more than Pounds 50m later this month or in early February. Advertising industry analysts highlighted a number of possible disposals for WPP: They said the company's preferred option was likely to be the flotation on the Tokyo Stock Exchange of a minority stake in its Far Eastern advertising interests, which could raise up to Pounds 40m. Daiwa, the Japanese investment bank, is believed to have done preliminary work for a possible flotation. Analysts also expected WPP to accelerate negotiations on the sale of its US advertising agency, Scali McCabe Sloves. WPP is believed to have received an offer from Interpublic, the US advertising group. Disposal of all or part of its successful market research subsidiaries - Millward Brown International, MRG Group and Research International - is probably a last option. At the end of 1990, WPP became concerned that it was likely to breach covenants on its medium-term loans, so it renegotiated its borrowings with a co-ordinating committee of lenders, led by JP Morgan. It put in place a new medium-term facility of Dollars 400m, which is to be repaid or refinanced by June 1993. In addition, a Dollars 604.5m term loan is to be repaid in semi-annual instalments over four years from June 1993.</p>

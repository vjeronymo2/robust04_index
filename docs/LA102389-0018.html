			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> From his point of view, Johnson in his "A Return to Colton" tells in graphic  detail how Los Angeles-produced smog has nearly destroyed his hometown. From my  point of view as a Los Angeles resident, I see my air fouled and streets  clogged by endless hordes of suburban commuters who are coming into the city  from ever-longer distances.  </P> <P> So I'll make all the suburbanites who feel they have been victimized by smog  from Los Angeles a deal: I'll keep my daily commute under 10 miles if they will  also do the same.  </P> <P> MIKE EBERTS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

Raja Mohan: "U.S. Arms for Pakistan </F> Operations in Somalia"]    [Text] Washington, Dec. 2--The Clinton Administration is  considering transfer of arms worth $45 millions to Pakistan  apparently to augment the operations of Islamabad's forces in  Somalia. The American military transfer, free of charge, to  Pakistan, is part of a proposed $106 millions of military  assistance to the U.N. forces in Somalia.    Sources in the State Department are unwilling to reveal the  details of the proposed transfer to Pakistan, but have told THE  HINDU that the transfer is under active consideration of the  Clinton Administration. State department sources insist that the  arms are only for the use of Pakistani troops deployed in  Somalia and they would not be entitled to take it back with them  to Pakistan when they leave Somalia.    The sources are also reluctant to reveal the nature of the  military package that is being proposed to be transferred to  Pakistan. But they suggest that it consists of equipment that  will facilitate the operations of the Pakistani contingent in  Somalia. The equipment could include anything from a handful of  advanced tanks to auxiliary equipment.    The American decision to transfer arms to Pakistan via the  U.N. peace-keeping and peace-making operations is not entirely  new. State Department sources say that the Clinton  Administration transferred some armoured personnel carriers and  transport equipment to Pakistani forces in Somalia last summer.  But they are unwilling to comment on the exact value of that  transfer.    The Clinton Administration's plans to provide arms to  Pakistan through the U.N. peace-keeping route has angered the  U.S. Congressional leadership. In a letter sent last week to the  U.S. Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher, a group of  Senate Republicans, led by minority leader Bob Dole and Jesse  Helms, have criticised the Administration's proposal to provide  military assistance to the U.N. forces in Somalia.    The Senators said they were "deeply troubled" by the  Administration's plans to transfer weapons to the Pakistani  contingent in Somalia. The Republican Senators said such a  transfer would circumvent the 1985 Pressler Amendment, which  bars economic and military assistance to Pakistan because of its  nuclear weapon programme.    But the Administration insists that such arms transfers to  Pakistan do not violate the Pressler law. Since early 1992, when  it presented a new interpretation of the Pressler Amendment, the  State Department has been arguing that only direct  government-to-government military sales are prescribed by the  Pressler law.    They have suggested, in a clever but tortuous legal  argument,  that commercial sales of military equipment to Pakistan do not  come under the ambit of the Pressler Amendment. The Congress in  general and Senator Larry Pressler, in particular, have objected  to this interpretation of the non-proliferation law; but the  Administration has stuck to its guns.    Liberating itself from the constraints of American  non-proliferation law, the U.S. Government has resumed the sale  of military spare parts and other equipment to Pakistan since  1992. But the administration told the Congress, notwithstanding  its new interpretation of the Pressler Amendment, that it will  be cautious in considering arms transfers to Pakistan.    The U.S. Government says all such transfers will be on a  case-by-case basis, and Washington will not let Pakistan enhance  its military capabilities either through upgradation of the  military equipment or an increase in its numbers. However, the  Administration has often said that it will not allow a  deterioration in Pakistan's military capabilities.    The military significance of the proposed American arms  transfers to Pakistan is clearly limited. The political message  emanating from Washington may be more important. That Washington  is prepared to find any means--including the United Nations  peace-keeping operations--to launder military equipment to  Pakistan, signals a new political resolve in the Clinton  Administration to revive the strategic relationship with  Islamabad and reinvigorate its ties with the military in  Pakistan.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;  </P> <P> CITY LICKS CHOPS OVER ALISO VIEJO  </P> <P> Officials of the recently formed city of Laguna Niguel are considering the  annexation of Aliso Viejo, a 6,600-acre planned community owned by the Mission  Viejo Co., according to a city report.  </P> <P> This plan was mentioned in a March 22 letter sent to the Local Agency Formation  Commission as part of Laguna Niguel's application for initial approval to annex  two small parcels of land north of the city. The request was denied on  Wednesday.  </P> <P> In the letter, Mayor Patricia C. Bates said that as a combined city of Laguna  Niguel and Aliso Viejo, both communities would be able to deal more effectively  with regional issues and save money by avoiding duplication of city services  and administration.  </P> <P> "Based on preliminary studies that have been done on including the Aliso Viejo  Planned Community in the city of Laguna Niguel, there are various factors which  indicate this would be to the mutual benefit of the citizens of Laguna Niguel  and the citizens of Aliso Viejo," Bates wrote.  </P> <P> Bates added that the two adjacent communities are already linked because they  share schools, recreation facilities and open space.  </P> <P> Officials of the Mission Viejo Co. and the Aliso Viejo Community Assn. were  quick to criticize the idea of annexation, saying that Aliso Viejo should be  allowed to develop into a separate city. The 11-year-old community of Aliso  Viejo now has about 4,000 residents but is expected to grow to about 50,000  residents by 2005.  </P> <P> "You don't want to take pieces of it and give it to adjoining cities," Mission  Viejo spokesman Richard Watson said of Aliso Viejo. "We want to allow it to  mature."  </P> <P> Don Swift, director of the Aliso Viejo Community Assn., said in a March 15  letter to Bates that the annexation would "seriously hinder the natural  evolution of Aliso Viejo from a planned community to cityhood."  </P> <P> "I wouldn't support it," Swift added Wednesday. "We (the two communities) are  just too different."  </P> <P> LAFCO denied Laguna Niguel's request to include the two parcels in the city's  "sphere of influence," a step that precedes the formal request for annexation.  One of the parcels is within the boundaries of the proposed city of Laguna  Hills, and the other is in Aliso Viejo.  </P> <P> Commission members denied the "sphere of influence" request pending a decision  about whether the Laguna Hills cityhood issue will be placed on the November  ballot.  </P> <P> The Laguna Hills cityhood application still must gain the approval of LAFCO and  the County Board of Supervisors to make the ballot.  </P> <P> Bates said city officials would wait until after the election before pursuing  either a second try to take control of the two small parcels or opening a  dialogue with Aliso Viejo officials on creating a single city out of the two  communities.  </P> <P> "We would not presume to intrude on their desire for self-determination," Bates  said, adding that the city has taken no official stand on the Aliso Viejo  annexation proposal.

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bourne End in US link to buy Pounds 71m portfolio Bourne End Properties has formed a joint venture with the Whitehall Fund, a US property investment fund managed by Goldman Sachs, to buy a Pounds 71m portfolio. The venture will be 25 per cent owned by Bourne End and 75 per cent by Whitehall, which has assets of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) but only recently started investing in the UK. Bourne End is placing 5.4m shares at 74p each to raise Pounds 4m - its maximum capital commitment under the deal. The rest of the consideration will be met from equity committed by Whitehall and a Pounds 58.5m term loan. The portfolio of 45 office and retail properties, mostly located in London and the south-east, is being acquired from William Pears Group, a privately owned property investment company. The properties generate rental income of Pounds 7.2m, suggesting a yield of about 10 per cent at the acquisition price. Bourne End said it hoped rents could be increased to Pounds 7.6m within the next year as a result of reviews and letting of vacant space. Bourne End will receive 25 per cent of profits and a management fee. The partners intend to liquidate most of the portfolio over the next three years. Whitehall's investment style is based on active trading of its assets, which it typically holds for less than 10 years. After three years, Whitehall has an option to sell its stake in the joint venture to Bourne End or buy out the minority interest. Mr David Roberts, a director of Bourne End, said it had looked at buying assets from William Pears earlier in the year, but concluded that it needed a partner.</p>

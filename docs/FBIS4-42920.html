			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Giovanni Masotti; </F> passages contained within quotation marks are recorded]    [Text] Once again Silvio Berlusconi spoke about the  controversy concerning media and press freedom. Berlusconi paid  a visit to the Saxa Rubra television studio today in order to  take part in a European election debate. Giovanni Masotti  reports:    [Masotti] There were smiles after the controversy: Silvio  Berlusconi said that he felt at ease during his visit to the  RAI. At Saxa Rubra he met Claudio Dematte and Gianni Locatelli,  the chairman and managing director of the company, and  immediately afterward was besieged by television cameras.  Berlusconi was asked whether President Scalfaro's speech on  freedom of information was a direct reference to his remarks:    [Berlusconi] "No, I do not think so because if there has  been  one thing that the newspapers have not done during these past  few days, it is to take dictation [from the government]. If  they were writing in this way there would certainly have not  been the arguments following what I said, for example about the  RAI."    [Masotti] The prime minister is not worried by the imminent  lapsing of the RAI regulation on 28 June. He said the  government had not yet dealt with the RAI issue.    [Berlusconi] "As of next week we will begin to talk about  the  RAI and we will be begin to discuss the RAI with an attitude  that will be completely open and with the respect that is owed  to a company that has many advantages."    [Masotti] The prime minister said that he had never  envisaged  exerting control over the RAI.    [Berlusconi] "This idea has never even entered my mind. I  have never thought that the government could want to have a RAI  that was pro-government. This would be squalid if it were to  happen."    [Masotti] Berlusconi, who does not rule out the possibility  of selling off parts of Fininvest, defended Giuseppe  Santaniello, the media ombudsman.    [Berlusconi] "The ombudsman has always fulfilled his mandate  with a great independence and with, I must say, a lot of  balance."    [Masotti] The prime minister was friendly and open. In  contrast, the atmosphere at the assembly of RAI employees that  was taking place nearby, was less so. There was concern and  great alarm. The editorial committees of the three channels  stressed that public service broadcasting had to represent the  whole country and all sections of society. They said that the  right of citizens to the media was at stake.</p>

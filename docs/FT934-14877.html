			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: An evolutionary route into equity sectors - Christopher Price on the latest batch of warrants aimed at attracting a new breed of investor THE LAUNCH of two warrants in the past week aimed at the UK equity market mark an inventive step by stockbrokers to encourage investors into areas which they might otherwise be reluctant to enter. SG Warburg yesterday issued a multi-media warrant, which gives holders the option to buy the underlying media shares at a future date, aimed at investors wanting exposure to the new frontiers of technology. Last week, BZW launched a warrant on a basket of food retail shares. It is also looking at several other underperforming areas of the UK equity market for similar launches, which could include sectors such as pharmaceuticals and food manufacturing. However, the rarity of sector warrants and other similar derivative products in UK equities is testimony to the cool reception afforded them by investors in the past. Derivatives specialists and fund managers will be watching the progress of this latest product closely. The BZW warrant acts as a 'call' option, which attempts to anticipate a rise in the share prices on a basket of food retail stocks. Investors buy the warrant at a price struck by the issuer. They can exercise their option to buy the underlying shares from the issuer at the price on the day of the warrant's purchase. This can be done at any time over the period of the warrant. Each of the warrants cost Pounds 2.30 on the October 4 launch day for shares worth Pounds 18.80 in the seven leading supermarket groups, which are weighted by market capitalisation. The warrants, which had an underlying stock value at issue of about Pounds 100m, are exerciseable over the next 18 months. Should the basket price rise 20 per cent, for example, over the full life of the warrant, it would reach Pounds 22.56. The Pounds 3.76 rise in the value of the shares would equal the approximate cost of the warrant at expiry. This sum less the Pounds 2.30 original cost would give a profit on the warrant of some 63 per cent. Investors are likely to hold the warrant for a highly geared return, with the option to buy into the underlying stocks if the outlook for the sector holds up. Investors can also trade the warrant, the market being made by the issuer with the price moving relative to the underlying stock prices. Yesterday, for example, the food retail warrant had a mid-price of Pounds 2.37 with a basket price of Pounds 18.82. For the issuer, profiting from the exercise will require effective 'dynamic' hedging. Although neither BZW nor SG Warburg discuss their risk management techniques, typically a warrant issuer will carry about 60 per cent of the underlying stock - the hedge ratio - of the number of warrants issued. The broker will also make continuous use of the options market as part of its hedging operations on the underlying stock. Getting the hedge ratios right will ensure the success of the warrant. The higher the sector rises, the bigger the increase in the ratio to compensate. Problems can arise with a sudden and significant movement in the sector which would leave the issuer exposed to taking a hit on the underlying stock. A warrant issued on the water stocks before the last year's general election was upset by a one-day surge of 20 per cent in the sector, leaving the US issuer exposed and some investors out of profit. Mr Lenny Barshak, director of derivatives at Smith New Court, says that market volatility is the biggest threat to a warrant's success. But as important is institutional investor wariness in using derivatives. 'If the demand from customers is there, we are always ready to create the product to suit their needs,' he says. 'But in general, the response to new product launches in the UK market has been patchy.' Mr Gary Wolens, managing director European equity sales at Salamon Brothers, agrees. 'Although there is a steady acceptance in the willingness to use derivatives in the UK, it will be an evolutionary not revolutionary development.' Derivatives brokers complain that part of the reason for this is the conservative investment culture among UK institutions. Fund managers argue that restrictive regulations together with the pricing of some products has proved discouraging. Mr Jim McAfferty, a former fund manager at NatWest Investment Bank, and now at Hoare Govett, says: 'The standard view among institutions is that it is difficult to get approval from trustees for the extra risk of taking out warrants or options.' BZW hopes to get round investor reluctance through more aggressive marketing and keener pricing. 'There's no point is issuing a warrant that will not sell,' says Mr David Roden, the broker's head of derivatives. 'We place a high premium on our corporate relationships, so selling them a good product at a reasonable price is very important.' Mr Roden says that the new warrant 'offers a different risk profile' for investors who are interested in exposure to the recovery potential of a sector without the full financial commitment. The launch was designed to coincide with BZW's research team turning more positive on the food retail sector, which has underperformed the rest of the stock market by 30 per cent in the past six months. Mr Mark Beilby, European media analyst at SG Warburg, says: 'We are trying to introduce an investment vehicle which transcends sector and country boundaries to enable investors to access new industry trends.'  ---------------------------------    BZW FOOD SECTOR WARRANTS*  ---------------------------------                               %  --------------------------------- J Sainsbury                40.0 Tesco                      21.0 Argyll                     17.5 Asda                        8.5 Kwik Save                   5.5 Wm Morrison                 4.0 Iceland                     3.5  --------------------------------- *approx weightings of stock  ---------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------    WARBURG'S EUROPEAN MULTI-MEDIA SECTOR WARRANTS*  ------------------------------------------------------                                           %  ------------------------------------------------------ Thorn EMI (UK)                         28.9 Pearson (UK)                           24.8 Generale des Eaux (Fr)                 15.7 Polygram (Neth)                        13.8 TF1 (Fr)                                9.1 VNU (Neth)                              7.7  ------------------------------------------------------ *approx weightings of stock  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

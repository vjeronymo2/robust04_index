			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Musa] </F>   [Text] A senior security source at the Interior Minister  has disclosed stunning details about terrorist plans to attack  public figures and former and current security officials with  the use of modern techniques obtained from abroad.    According to the source, 'Adil Siyam, slain leader of the  al-Jihad terrorist group, personally supervised the initiation  of the group's new members. The latter, the source revealed,  underwent a 30-day period of brainwashing, during which each new  member was locked in a room and could not leave it until the  initiation process was over. The initiation was geared toward  bolstering the members' ability to sustain psychological and  physical pressure.    Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Alim, an accomplice of the slain  terrorist,  told investigators that Siyam's death is a terrible blow to the  group. Siyam was the group's mastermind and the man who held  all the strings. The group's members obeyed his orders blindly.  One of Siyam's instructions was that members should commit  suicide rather than be captured by the police, 'Abd-al-'Alim  said.    According to the same source, police success in cracking the  terrorist ring came after prolonged monitoring of foreign cash  transfers received by local terrorist leaders. The State  Security Intelligence Service has been keeping tabs on checks  involving considerable dollar and sterling payments to the  terrorists.    A vicious plot against Egypt is being hatched abroad, the  source said. He added that certain countries are responsible  for the terrorist operations taking place here. We have  conclusive evidence about this foreign involvement through the  confessions of the defendants and the documents seized by the  security organs.    Confessions by members of al-Jihad groups shed light on  terrorist plans. The terrorists prepared cells in the Bilbays  area in which they planned to hold any individuals they may  abduct in order to force the government to release imprisoned  terrorist leaders. Police have inspected the location of these  cells in Bilbays' farmland.    The terrorists also confessed that they planned to rob  [al-satw 'ala] a number of key installations, disguised in  police uniforms that were found in their possession.  Investigation into the case is continuing under the supervision  of Public Attorneys Raja' al-'Arabi and 'Abd-al-Sami'  Sharaf-al-Din.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / How To Spend It: Designs for men that keep women in mind - A look at the development of male underwear and the struggle to reconcile conflicting demands of fashion and comfort ACCORDING to the magazine Men's Wear in 1935: 'Underwear should have the grace of Apollo, the romance of Byron, the distinction of Lord Chesterfield and the ease, coolness and comfort of Mahatma Gandhi.' Since then, designers and manufacturers have been struggling to reconcile these conflicting demands. Certainly, none of those men would have been happy with the underwear of the 1960s and 1970s. That was the era of pouches, thongs, tangas and mini-briefs. Morals were loose, underwear was tight. And it was made of figure-hugging nylon, until it emerged that the consequent rise in body temperature could induce sterility. Underwear also was coloured, in hideous purples and greens. Yet, it was plain white underpants that made a comeback in the '80s. And by entering the fray alongside boxer shorts, they really defined the battle between grace and distinction, between Apollo and Lord Chesterfield, which marks today's bottom line. As the 1980s' fitness movement emerged in New York, Calvin Klein hit the market with his classic, combed-cotton, plain white Y-fronts. In a brilliant US advertising campaign, he displayed this classic underwear on female models. A stunning black-and-white Bruce Weber photo of a girl in white briefs dominated Times Square, and women as well as men rushed to make the line a sell-out. Klein always has been allied with a clean-cut, healthy and athletic American image. His simple white underwear took on the same image by association. When Jockey introduced the Y-front, the company proclaimed it was 'scientifically perfected for correct masculine support.' In Calvin's hands, that athleticism became a symbol of the work-out generation. Yet, on the other side of the Atlantic, Britain was working to a different brief. In the UK, the late 1980s was the era of the boxer shorts. As with so much of British menswear, boxers represented a return to tradition, a harking back to the wardrobe of the classic gentleman of the 1930s. If you wore braces and brogues, then boxers were the obvious accompaniment. And it was ace designer Paul Smith, of course, who first realised the comic potential of the boxer shorts. You could actually print their flat sheets of cotton (or new-money silk) with anything from polka dots to pigs. There are few items of clothing with which a man can be a little witty; even a humorous tie can raise eyebrows rather than smiles in a sombre office. So, the new breed of City boys, straining against the traditional dress code of the Square Mile, had fun with their unseen underwear. Serious Money and frivolous boxers were a fashionable 1980s combination. Alongside nostalgia and naughtiness, though, perhaps the biggest single influence on the rise of boxer shorts was their popularity with women. It takes a good physique to make Y-fronts look sexy, whereas boxers hide a multitude of sins. Female taste is a significant factor in male underwear; not only do women buy a great deal as gifts but they are also the people men generally want to please when they get down to their basics. And so, despite the fact that they completely fail to offer the physical support of briefs, boxers shot to popularity. Form had conquered function. As we go into the 1990s, the two poles of underwear style are locked in combat. They give out different messages but both are equally fashionable. Last month, Luke Perry and Jason Priestley, teen heart-throb co-stars of the US TV series Beverly Hills, 90210, dropped their jeans for Vanity Fair. One was wearing white Calvins, the other paisley boxers. Klein, pushing the sporting image to the maximum, now markets a range called Athletic, available in London at Harrods and Selfridges and described as 'engineered to excel in the realm of active sport.' With five per cent spandex in the cotton fabric, to provide extra support, the designs are based on sports kit; hence, the vest is a 'sport tank' (Pounds 24.95) and the briefs a 'cycling short' (Pounds 17.95). Those two are combined in a one-piece 'body tank' (Pounds 29.95), which looks as if it could be maneouvred on and off only by an accomplished gymnast. Jockey also has introduced three 'sports' underpants containing five per cent Lycra (Pounds 5.99 to Pounds 9.99). But the company, which patented the Y-front during the First World War, retains that traditional design in briefs, 'midways' (thigh length) and 'thermal longs' (Pounds 3.99 to Pounds 8.99). And Jockey is traditional at heart; any 'sports' range which goes up to a 38-inch waist is not aiming at serious athletes. Meanwhile, at Knickerbox there is a range called New England, which seems to take tradition back to somewhere around the First World War. Ankle-length long johns in grey ribbed cotton (Pounds 14.99), long-sleeved vests with three-button necks (Pounds 16.99) and the return of button flies - all push underwear back to our grandfather's day. As the nation's biggest underwear outlet, Marks &amp; Spencer naturally is keeping its options open. Its Active range mimics Klein by putting three per cent Lycra in the mix and proclaiming that the underwear 'can also be a sport accessory.' Athletics vests and trunks are Pounds 6.99 each. Traditionalists, meanwhile, can get Disney characters on their M&amp;S boxer shorts (Pounds 5.99) or pursue the new trend for old-fashioned button flies with cotton knitted trunks (Pounds 5.99). So, which is to be - Apollo or Chesterfield, athlete or aesthete? Personally, function is more important than form in the end. Klein has my support, just as I have his.</p>

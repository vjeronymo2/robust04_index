			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mario Jovel from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] The government has reacted promptly to differences  within the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]  legislative bloc. On Tuesday, President Alfredo Cristiani  asserted that the differences among the various FMLN groups only  confirm his prediction on the night of 24 April, when ARENA  [Nationalist Republican Alliance] celebrated its presidential  victory.    President Cristiani believes the differences that have  appeared among the FMLN deputies because of the election of Ana  Guadalupe Martinez and German Cienfuegos as Legislative Assembly  vice president and secretary, respectively, simply confirm the  divisions that have always existed in this political party, as  was pointed out by his government and ARENA a long time ago.    [Begin Cristiani recording] The FMLN is an association of  five groups with ideological differences, which -- and let us  put it this way -- got together to fight a war. Now that we no  longer have a war and now that politics prevail, those  differences have come out in the open. [end recording]    According to the president, the differences among the former  guerrillas will increase in future debates at the Legislative  Assembly, because there are different ideological positions  within the FMLN.    Referring to the peace accords, Cristiani reiterated that  the  assignment of 5,700 PNC [National Civilian Police] policemen  will conclude before October. He confirmed, however, the  National Police's demobilization will take a bit longer.    [Begin Cristiani recording] A great deal depends, of course,  on the Public Security Academy's graduations. We cannot go  faster than the academy that graduates the policemen. We  believe, however, that the transition period will have to be  extended at least six months. [end recording]    Cristiani admitted that there has been no agreement with the  FMLN to extend the National Police's demobilization. According  to the president, this is because the front has refused to look  for alternatives with the government and Onusal [UN Observers  for El Salvador] so that Calderon Sol's administration will not  encounter public security problems. If no agreements are  reached this month, the president-elect will be the one to  decide whether or not the total demobilization of the National  Police will be extended.</p>

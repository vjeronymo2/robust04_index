			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Ocean to Pounds 51m OCEAN GROUP, the marine freight and environmental services conglomerate, yesterday revealed a 6 per cent increase in 1991 profits helped by acquisitions and a lower interest charge following last year's rights issue. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 48m to Pounds 51m on sales up 22 per cent at Pounds 1.35bn. Stronger performances in the freight and distribution and marine divisions were offset by a halving of the contribution from environmental services. Earnings after the Pounds 88m rights issue fell to 24.6p (27p) and a final dividend of 9.62p makes a 14.33p (14.2p) total. Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, said organically the group grew 5 per cent. The group took market share to expand freight and distribution division operating profits by 7 per cent to Pounds 23m despite City fears that this was a prime candidate to be hit in recession. Operating profits at MSAS, the freight forwarding company, and at McGregor Cory, the storage and distribution company, rose 15 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. In the marine services division, profits grew 20 per cent to Pounds 30.9m, a result that was unlikely to be repeated this year as cash flow constraints hit exploration, Mr Barber said. Gearing at year-end had fallen to 10 per cent, compared to 50 per cent in December 1990, and Mr Barber expected the level to be about 20 per cent by the end of 1992 assuming a capital spend broadly unchanged at about Pounds 50 to Pounds 70m. COMMENT One might not choose to be in freight forwarding and energy related businesses with recession stalking the OECD countries and oil prices languishing below Dollars 20. Yet Ocean has been remarkably resilient, a credit to the management that has turned the old asset-heavy Ocean Transport &amp; Trading into a leaner mini-conglomerate. The turn down in North Sea activity since September will not help but Ocean has locked in 60 per cent of 1992 offshore revenue with long term charters and is anyway well positioned in more profitable locations like south-east Asia. On the distribution side, McGregor Cory's new sites should benefit the group just when freight forwarding's growth through increased market share might be expected to be petering out. Nevertheless, in the absence of a dramatically higher oil price and OECD growth rate, Ocean is unlikely to excite. Analysts estimate pre-tax profits this year only marginally higher at Pounds 54m, giving earnings of 24.5p and a fully priced prospective multiple of 13.</p>

Drobnjak: "Terrorists Trained in Turkey"] </F>   [Text] Details of a dark scenario to organize an armed  rebellion in northern Montenegrin municipalities and to create a  so-called state of Sandzak have been slowly reaching the public.  They all indicate that the key player was Harun Hadzic,  president of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) for Montenegro  and vice president of this party for Sandzak. However, his  closest collaborators, who were assigned subversive-terrorist  activities, are of no less importance.    Thus, Isad Skenderovic, a 29-year-old biology teacher by  training from Berane, commander of the security sevice for this  municipality, had one of the more important roles in the plan to  organize an armed rebellion. He already went far ahead in  performing his task and formed terrorist groups and a crisis  headquarters for operations in a state of war.    According to the most recent findings of the investigation,  Isad Skenderovic, together with Hamdija Latic and Muarem  Skrijelj and an additional 80 persons of Muslim nationality from  northern Montenegrin municipalities, completed a  subversive-terrorist course in the Turkish town of Urla. The  training was conducted by Turkish officers to whom the students  gave information on locations and organizations of airfields, a  weapons factory, military barracks, and other significant  facilities in Montengro and Serbia. After the completion of the  course, Skenderovic was paid 5,000 German marks in cash for the  construction of dugouts for the storage of weapons, food, and  people.    According to the statements given during the investigation,  the training in the Turkish army was very specialized and  rigorous. It started with the taking of an oath in which the  terrorists vowed to liquidate without mercy those persons in  their ranks who were hesitant. Groups of three men, dressed in  special uniforms, were tasked with tailing and, in the event of  an immediate danger of war, liquidating prominent personalities  in northern Montenegrin municipalities. The investigation  further showed that they planned to destroy bridges and block  roads, and that, what is most important, they wanted through  these actions to draw the attention of the West to the allegedly  threatened position of the Muslims in Yugoslavia.    Otherwise, it has been learned that 10 more people from the  Pljevlja and Rozaje region were imprisoned yesterday and today.  It has also been learned that the public prosecutor will submit  a request tomorrow to conduct an investigation of them.</p>

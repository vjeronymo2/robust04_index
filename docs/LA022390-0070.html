			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOMB-LADEN TRUCK DEFUSED ON WESTSIDE  </P> <P> Bomb experts disarmed and removed five 55-gallon steel drums filled with  explosive chemicals near an Internal Revenue Service office in West Los Angeles  Thursday, ending a daylong threat that forced evacuation of thousands of people  from their homes, kept hundreds away from work and created massive traffic  jams.  </P> <P> The detonator-equipped drums, loaded into the back of a pickup truck,  apparently had been set to go off early Thursday when the truck was found  burning on Colby Avenue near Olympic Boulevard, police said. The truck had been  ticketed several times, indicating it had been parked there for some time,  police said.  </P> <P> "It did have the potential of being a very large explosion, perhaps the largest  we've ever had," said Assistant Los Angeles Police Chief Robert Vernon.  </P> <P> "We can't say at this moment that it would have flattened so many blocks, but  we have to assume the worst," Vernon said earlier.  </P> <P> There were no injuries, although the truck containing the explosives was  heavily damaged by the fire.  </P> <P> While bomb experts cautiously examined the suspicious drums near the 15500  block of Olympic Boulevard, police officers ordered residents out of a 16-block  area, going house-to-house later in the day to warn them about a "dangerous  bomb." Residents were allowed back in the area after 6 p.m.  </P> <P> The original evacuation area straddled Olympic, extending a block north to  Mississippi Avenue, a block south to Tennessee Avenue, east to Sawtelle  Boulevard and west to Barrington Avenue. By early afternoon, the zone had been  extended and traffic restrictions tightened.  </P> <P> Police blocked intersections, snarling traffic on one of the most heavily  traveled corridors in the city. Motorists, diverted to side streets from busy  Olympic Boulevard, moved slowly through the evacuation area during the morning  rush hour.  </P> <P> While authorities could provide no motive for the potential bombing, they noted  that an IRS office, with up to 350 employees, is located on the fifth floor of  the nearby six-story Olympic Plaza. The complex also houses the City National  Bank Building.  </P> <P> The same office building was rocked by explosions in September, 1988, when five  separate bombs were set off in a stolen car in an underground parking garage.  Police said they were left without direct leads to suggest a motive or a  suspect. No one was injured in the blasts.  </P> <P> "We are not ignoring similarities between this and the other bombing incident,"  police spokesman Fred Nixon said Thursday.  </P> <P> But he declined to discuss details of the investigation.  </P> <P> IRS spokesman Rob Giannangeli said he thought it was a "natural assumption"  that the federal tax-collecting agency might have been the target of Thursday's  incident.  </P> <P> "It's the second incident at that building," Giannangeli said. "We have a  tendency to believe that would be the case, just from the nature of the work we  do. But until someone is apprehended, I don't think we'll ever know.  </P> <P> "Southern California's had a history of the tax protest movement, and some of  these people are not exactly enamored (of) us."  </P> <P> But, Giannangeli said, there is also a possibility that the motive is that of  "some disgruntled guy who was turned down by the bank for his loan."  </P> <P> The bomb threat developed from what seemed at first a relatively minor incident  that began to unfold at about 2 a.m. Firefighters extinguished a burning pickup  truck parked on Colby Avenue near Olympic Boulevard, just across the street  from Fire Station 59.  </P> <P> Jeff Nord, a 21-year-old tow truck driver, said he was going to breakfast  Thursday when he saw firefighters pouring water on the burning truck. As the  truck burned, Nord said he heard popping noises that sounded like "shotgun  blasts."  </P> <P> The truck fire had burned out and firefighters had gone when Nord returned  between 3:30 and 4 a.m., he said.  </P> <P> When authorities examined the charred remains of the truck about two hours  later, however, they became suspicious that the metal drums in the bed of the  pickup might contain volatile liquids arranged with detonators to explode.  </P> <P> They immediately ordered the evacuation of the area, setting off a day of  confusion and concern for nearby residents and workers.  </P> <P> Hundreds were forced to park blocks from their offices and walk to work, only  to be turned back by police and fire lines and warnings of a possible bomb in  the area.  </P> <P> One of those who reached her office on foot, Geegee Auger, 43, secretary in a  law firm down the block from Olympic Plaza, said police came in shortly after 1  p.m.  </P> <P> "First they strongly suggested that we leave," she said. "Then we were told  that we must leave. They didn't say why."  </P> <P> As the day wore on, a command post was set up at Stoner Playground, about half  a mile northwest of where the truck had burned. Hundreds of police officers and  firefighters moved into the neighborhood and were joined by FBI and Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents.  </P> <P> Police and fire officials brought in large portable command posts. Dozens of  fire engines were assembled and half a dozen paramedic units stood by.  Motorcycle officers patrolled the evacuation area.  </P> <P> At mid-afternoon, specialists opened the drums and found an unidentified liquid  inside, Nixon said. The barrels were lifted out of the bed of the burned truck  with a forklift and taken away for analysis and disposal.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Darrell Dawsey, David Ferrell and Richard Beene contributed  to this article.  </P></p>

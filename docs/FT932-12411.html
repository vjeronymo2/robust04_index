			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Bonds: Osaka Gas turns attention to dollar sector THE BIGGEST transactions in the Eurobond market yesterday were in the US dollar and French franc sectors, where investor appetite appears to be strong. Osaka Gas, the Japanese utility, tapped the US dollar sector with a Dollars 250m five-year bond bearing a 5 3/4 per cent coupon. The borrower has a large capital expenditure programme and is keen to establish a benchmark for further bond issues, according to Goldman Sachs, lead manager for the issue. The proceeds, which will be swapped into yen, will go towards the building of new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and pipelines. The deal was launched at a spread of 57 basis points over the five-year US Treasury bond, and the spread tightened slightly to 56 basis points, the lead manager said. Osaka Gas has a AA2/AA- credit rating, and last tapped the Eurobond market with a CDollars 200m five-year deal in September 1991. The trend for collared floating-rate notes, which have proved a popular form of issue over the past year, continued yesterday as Citicorp launched a Dollars 200m 10-year deal. Citicorp's issue, lead-managed by Kidder Peabody, was quickly increased in size from Dollars 100m in order to meet strong demand from Tokyo, Hong Kong, the Middle East and Europe. Dealers pointed out that the Eurobond market has seen a steady stream of collared FRN deals. The flow started with a handful of top, triple-A credits leading the way. 'Although the top credits initially led the way, investors now seem willing to buy less outstanding credits,' said one syndicate manager. Citibank is rated BAA3/BBB+ on its subordinated debt. The lead manager said the collared FRN route provided 'a great opportunity to raise capital cheaply in the European markets', and added that the 5 1/2 per cent floor was considered very generous given that three-month Libor is currently around 3 1/4 to 3 3/16 per cent. A Dollars 300m, 12-year bond for Export-Import Bank of Japan attracted criticism as some syndicates complained about the maturity, arguing that the yield pick-up was not much better than they would have seen on a 10-year bond from the same borrower. The bond has a coupon of 6.25 per cent; the deal was launched at 33 basis points over the 10-year Treasury bond and managed to hold its spread.</p>

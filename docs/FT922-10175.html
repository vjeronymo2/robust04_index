			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / International Company News: Spanish bank to sell domestic offshoot BANCO Santander, the Spanish commercial bank, is negotiating the sale of its last remaining domestic subsidiary, the Banco de Murcia, to Bancaja, a Valencia-based savings bank, for Pta17bn (Dollars 163.46m). The deal fuels speculation that the Santander group, which owns 10 per cent of the Royal Bank of Scotland and 13.5 per cent of First Fidelity Bancorp in the US, is preparing for further international investments. Foreign assets accounted for 27 per cent of the group's Pta75bn net profits last year. Mr Emilio Botin, Santander's chairman, said earlier this year he wanted to lift the non-Spanish contribution to the group's income. The sale of the 66-branch Banco de Murcia network is expected to be completed within three months. Banco Bilboa Vizcaya (BBV), the big Spanish retail bank, became the first large domestic financial group to report a first-quarter slide. It announced net profits of Pta18.5bn, 4.5 per cent down on the Pta19.4 in the first three months of last year.</p>

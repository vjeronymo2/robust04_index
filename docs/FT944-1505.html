			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Companies face bridge snub The Scottish Office is likely to reduce the role of the private sector in drawing up and promoting the project for a second road bridge across the Firth of Forth. It is expected instead to design the project itself and submit it to a public inquiry before a decision is taken on whether to proceed. The change of strategy, expected to be announced early in the new year, is likely to be seen as a climbdown by the Scottish Office in the face of strong opposition to a new bridge, mainly from people in Edinburgh and other parts of Lothian. It may also be viewed as a setback for the government's private finance initiative, under which the government wants big construction projects to be designed, financed and built by the private sector as far as possible. Studies of the area around the Firth of Forth for the Scottish Office of transport have concluded that a second road bridge would be needed in the first decade of the next century. The government was widely expected to announce that it had decided a package of road and public transport improvements  - including a new bridge  - and to invite tenders from private sector consortia to design, build, finance and operate the improvements. The entire scheme would almost certainly have faced a public inquiry when finalised, although this was never made clear by the government. Instead it appears likely that the transport scheme, including a new bridge, will be developed by the Scottish Office and submitted to a public inquiry before a decision is taken on whether to go ahead with it. If the public inquiry concluded that a second road bridge was necessary, the project would be put out to tender to be built and financed by the private sector, with the risk borne by the private sector reduced. Scottish Office ministers are understood to be drawing lessons from the Birmingham northern relief road project, where the private-sector consortium of Trafalgar House and Iritecna (of Italy) is facing a second public inquiry which further increases the risk that the project will not go ahead, as well as involving extra costs. Four consortia of leading UK and European construction companies, as well as banks, have registered an interest in tendering to build the bridge.</p>

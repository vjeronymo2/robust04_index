			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: US influence in Europe's new issue business grows - International offerings The German government is poised to announce which bank is to lead worldwide sales of Deutsche Telekom shares when the company's DM10bn-plus capital raising exercise goes ahead in 1996. Deutsche Bank and Dresner Bank seem assured of a role in the sale, but if - as is widely expected - a US bank is awarded the role of 'global co-ordinator' it will confirm European fears that the Continent's banks are losing out to US rivals in business stemming from the wave of new European equity issues. Goldman Sachs has this year been 'book-runner' in five separate European deals and after selling eight tranches of shares worth a total of about Dollars 2.5bn sits at the top of a league table of European issues, compiled by IFR Securities. Deals include INA, the Italian insurer and - with UBS - Tele Danmark, the Danish telecommunications group. Other US banks are also prominent in the table. Lehman Brothers, for example, was book-runner in the sale of Banca Commerciale Italiana, the Italian bank. Morgan Stanley - with CSFB and Warburg - shared a similar role in the sales of KPN, the Dutch telecoms company, and (with CSFB, Warburg and Goldman) led the sale of Endesa, the Spanish energy holding company. Merrill Lynch has led sizeable equity issues for a number of Scandinavian companies, and is global co-ordinator for the sale of Enel, the Italian energy company. European banks continue to be strong in their domestic markets. The French banks have won chunky deals in France (Paribas heading sales of Elf Aquitaine and UAP, BNP leading on Renault). On the Continent as a whole US influence seems to be growing. Goldman's market share of European deals has doubled since 1993. Bankers say that in some earlier privatisations UK banks have been asked to advise the government and a US bank to lead the sales effort. But that, too, could be changing. Morgan Stanley, for example, will advise the Italian government on the sale of Stet, the telecommunications concern. European bankers say governments have been too easily impressed by US bankers' claims they can more easily access US investors, especially at the retail level. They also suggest that Europe has been the important source of demand for sales of European equities, with London-based fund managers making many of the important decisions. Against that, US banks claim their success reflects recent investment in training, research and sales. 'US banks are covering the sectors on a global basis. if you look at investment the US banks have put in place in past five years it is is multiples of what any European bank has done. That is not lost in the eyes of a government,' says one US bank executive. US bankers also argue that they are more familiar than their European counterparts with book-building, a technique for distributing shares which has long been common in the US but relatively new in Europe and being eagerly embraced by governments embarked on privatisation. One European banker says that US banks promise 'the earth' and then 'try to manage expectations after they have won the mandate'. Nevertheless, he says US success is principally a product of better research and a more tightly focused approach. 'They also have a relentless focus on the transactions they want. They have nailed down every individual in the decision-making process for a long time,' he said.</p>

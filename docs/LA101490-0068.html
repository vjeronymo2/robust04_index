			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PACOIMA GROUP MEETS TO BUILD RELATIONS BUT FEUDS OVER NAME;  </P> <P> COMMUNITY: THE COALITION ELECTS 13 BOARD MEMBERS IN AN EFFORT TO BRIDGE  DIVISIONS AMONG BLACK CIVIC LEADERS.  </P> <P> A new coalition whose purpose is to heal a rift in Pacoima's black community  elected 13 board members and picked a name Saturday, but not before its members  exchanged a few heated words.  </P> <P> The disagreement among about 25 people who attended a community meeting called  by the coalition was over what to call the group and who should be allowed to  join it.  </P> <P> "How are we going to come together if we can't even get past the name," said a  frustrated William Huling, a longtime community activist who chaired the  meeting.  </P> <P> The selection of a name was the first item on the agenda. But it was Huling who  started the disagreement when he said that Marie Harris, head of the Pacoima  Property Owners Assn., did not favor one of the three suggested names -- the  Pacoima African-American Coalition. Harris did not attend Saturday's meeting.  </P> <P> "There is no reason we should be ashamed to identify with Africa," said an  angry Thomas Montgomery, who identified himself as Democratic Party chairman of  the 39th Assembly District, which includes Pacoima.  </P> <P> "Every other ethnic group has its own organization," said Montgomery, waving  his arms. "Why can't we? I'm proud to be black."  </P> <P> Ultimately, Pacoima African-American Coalition was selected unanimously over  the other two names -- Pacoima Advisory Council and Pacoima Action Council.  </P> <P> "This shows we are in total agreement at last," Huling said, sighing.  </P> <P> The rift among Pacoima's black leaders surfaced last month when the Ministers'  Fellowship of the San Fernando Valley threatened to mount a recall drive  against Los Angeles Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who they claim reneged on a  campaign promise to appoint a black field deputy.  </P> <P> Instead, Bernardi appointed Richard Packard, head of the Black American  Political Assn., as a field representative, a position that ranks below a  deputy.  </P> <P> Bernardi supporters sharply criticized the ministers group, which represents  about 40 churches in the northeast San Fernando Valley, for its attack on the  councilman. One critic said the ministers should stay out of politics and  remain in the pulpit.  </P> <P> The ministers group has since backed off on its threat to recall Bernardi and  has pledged to work with the coalition and Packard.  </P> <P> Huling, a counselor and psychology professor at Cal State Northridge who was  elected spokesman of the coalition, said the organization represents the first  step toward "a total community effort. The black community was too fragmented."  </P> <P> On Saturday, Huling repeatedly silenced those who tried to criticize the  ministers. "All that's behind us now," he said.  </P> <P> The reason for the objection to the name, Pacoima African-American Council, he  said, was that Harris wanted other ethnic groups to be able to participate.  </P> <P> "I don't see that this will exclude anyone," said Jose de Sosa, head of the  state and San Fernando Valley NAACP, referring to the new organization. He  noted that people of different ethnic backgrounds belong to the NAACP, even  though it "has the word 'colored' in its name."  </P> <P> Michael Augustus, a coalition organizer, said he envisioned a black coalition  because "we've first got to learn to live among ourselves."  </P> <P> The 13 board members include representatives of nine community groups and four  individuals. They will now meet to write bylaws for the coalition. The bylaws  will be voted on at a community meeting next month.  </P> <P> "Congratulations," said Huling, as the meeting ended. "You now have an  organization -- finally."  </P></p>

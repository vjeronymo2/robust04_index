			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Corfu (DPA) -- With only a few days before the  German presidency of the EU [European Union] Council begins,  Britain has thrown the EU into a new crisis and maneuvered the  Federal Government into an extremely awkward situation. At the  EU summit on Corfu on Saturday [25 June], in the controversy  over nominating a new EU Commission president, British Prime  Minister John Major defied all other EU partners and vetoed the  designation of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene.    Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has been particularly  committed to the nomination of Dehaene, is now forced to settle  the dispute on the succession to current President Jacques  Delors at a special summit in Brussels on 15 July. "As far as  the chances of success are concerned, I cannot say anything  right now," Kohl said at the conclusion of the Corfu summit. He  would have much rather announced a decision "than having this  problem now dumped in front of our front door." [passage  omitted]</p>

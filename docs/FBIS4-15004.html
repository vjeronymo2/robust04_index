			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Kononenko article incorporating interview with </F> presidential aide G. Satarov; place and date not given:  "Kremlin Hopes for Success of Peace Agreement. Immoderate  Opposition Continues To Gamble on Confrontation"]    [Text] The Agreement on Civil Peace in Russia is expected  to be signed on 28 April. By then, in addition to "Russia's  Choice" representatives, all leaders of State Duma factions will  have been to the Kremlin. The president's next consultation  will be with representatives of parties of a centrist  persuasion. B. Yeltsin will then hold a second meeting of the  working group, which will determine the procedure for signing  this document and the mechanism for implementing it. In  addition, he is also expected to meet with heads of  administration and the leaders of the Russian republics, who  will evidently also participate in signing the agreement at the  second stage (it is envisaged that at the first stage the  document will be signed by the approximately 25 main political  forces in Russia).    Since the text of the document is still being kept secret,  numerous questions arise. Including: Can it be acceptable to  political forces with diametrically opposed ideologies? And the  recent report, citing I. Rybkin, that the State Duma will not  examine the proposed version of the agreement pending the  preparation of a new one has caused confusion and a wave of  speculation. It was immediately interpreted as a rejection by  the State Duma of the ideas and provisions embedded in the  document. This report drove presidential aide G. Satarov to  telephone I. Rybkin. His answer was unexpected: "It's a fake.  I said nothing of the kind," I. Rybkin stated.    I assumed that I would hear from G. Satarov about clashes in  the course of the work on the document, but the president's aide  was upbeat. He has already consulted with many factions in  parliament -- both those of a democratic persuasion and those on  the opposite flank. As yet he has not had occasion to hear any  terms or ultimatums expressed.    Such a constructive approach by parliamentarians, including  from the opposition camp, who only recently were stirring up  society with their decision to amnesty the participants in the  October putsch, puts you on your guard. But the explanation for  this phenomenon in the presidential entourage is as follows:  The opposition sees the agreement as a guarantee of the  stability which it needs to implement its long-term plans -- to  attempt to come to power in the 1996 elections in a calm  atmosphere by constitutional means.    But it is obvious that the immoderate opposition is  continuing to gamble on confrontation. This is confirmed by A.  Rutskoy's PRAVDA interview. "What accord? And with whom....  These games involving consensuses and agreements must be  stopped...."    "What is the current state of readiness of the Agreement on  Civil Peace?" I asked G. Satarov.    [Satarov] I sent the latest version to the State Duma 4  April. It has already been distributed to committees for study  and further work. It has proved possible to work out a scheme  which promises to make the document viable. I am talking about  a permanently operating mechanism for building accord. Such  accord is only possible when specific problems in public life  are singled out. In this connection the document provides for  the creation of a conciliation commission, which is called upon  to keep the situation in the country under review. If conflicts  emerge "roundtables" will be held to conduct a collective  analysis, and ways to solve the problems which arise will be  sought by a working group involving all interested parties.    Disputes and conflicts on the path toward seeking accord  could arise if someone attempts to "reconcile" various  ideologies in this document or to incorporate elements of party  programs in it.    To date not one of the parties represented in parliament has  opposed the inclusion of measures of prohibition in the  agreement. And they are indeed present; in particular, there is  a provision for prohibiting political parties, movements, and  commercial structures from creating any kind of armed formations  and for the renunciation of illegal attempts to involve the  power structures in supporting political objectives.</p>

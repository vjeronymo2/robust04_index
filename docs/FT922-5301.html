			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (7): A softer approach - Politics SINGAPORE'S leaders describe themselves as a team determined to keep their country ahead 'in the race of nations'. In late 1990, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, in power for more than 30 years, handed the baton of office over to Mr Goh Chok Tong. Mr Goh called on Singaporeans to support a new generation of leaders who would build a fit, cultured but rugged society. 'Together', said Mr Goh, 'we will run the next lap.' During his first months in power, Mr Goh sought to establish his own style of leadership. The stern, authoritarian approach of Mr Lee would be replaced by a softer style: Mr Goh talked of being more accommodating and of the need to build a consensus. There were some small signals of change. Rules prohibiting nude scenes in films were relaxed. Some mild satire of Singapore's leaders was allowed - including the sale of a book of cartoons entitled 'Hello Chok Tong, Goodbye Kuan Yew'. The press indulged in some slight criticism of government policies. Last August, Mr Goh called an election - to establish his leadership credentials at the polls and also to win backing for his new more open style of government. The results were not good for either Mr Goh or the People's Action Party, in power since Singapore's independence. The PAP's vote shrank to 61 per cent - the lowest the party had polled since 1968. The two opposition parties, the Singapore Democratic Party and the Workers' Party, won four seats, compared with only one at the last election in 1988. The election results sent shock waves through a governing team that has always viewed any opposition or dissent with acute suspicion. Some members of the government interpreted the results as a sign that the conservative Singaporean electorate was not in favour of Mr Goh's more open way of doing things. On the other hand, some analysts felt the PAP could have lost more votes if Mr Goh had not embarked on his strictly limited glasnost policy. More seriously, there were signs that the PAP had lost support among the Chinese working class - its traditional support base. Mr Lee, still senior minister and head of the PAP, felt the government had neglected the concerns of this group. 'I think it was a sense of being squeezed out of the mainstream, that they were no longer getting the kind of attention that, as the majority, they should have. . I think that caused the switch,' said Mr Lee. Mr Goh acknowledged that the PAP had become too remote and should strive to be less elitist. Part of the reason for the PAP's poor showing in the August election was also due to clever opposition tactics, particularly by the Singapore Democratic Party which won three out of the four opposition seats. The opposition only fielded candidates in a limited number of constituencies, thus ensuring the continuance of the PAP in power. Voters were offered the chance of registering their dissatisfaction without threatening the government's survival. 'The voters want to keep the PAP in power, but they also want a strong opposition to keep an eye on the government,' says Mr Chiam See Tong, leader of the Singapore Democratic Party. 'It is a sign that Singapore's democracy is growing up.' The next challenge facing Mr Goh is a series of by-elections due to take place in the coming months. Among those standing is likely to be Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam, the leader of the Workers Party who has been disqualified from parliament for the past five years. If Mr Jeyaretnam wins a seat and the PAP once again loses votes, then Mr Goh would be under considerable pressure from the more hard-line section of the party led by Mr Lee Hsien Loong, deputy prime minister and son of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Another possible contender for power is Mr George Yeo - like Mr Lee junior an army man - at present minister for information and the arts. But Mr Goh is a political fighter and he can be tough. As Mr Lee's right hand man for many years, he played an active role in monitoring dissent in Singapore. 'If people behave in a manner that will threaten the wider interests of Singapore,' said Mr Goh recently, 'they will feel the firm smack of the government.'</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Bank chief more confident on Japan economy Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday slightly upgraded his view of the economic outlook, after a quarterly meeting with regional branch managers. 'The economy is brighter and close to hitting bottom,' said Mr Mieno, a mildly less cautious choice of words than his pronouncement last week that the conditions for recovery were falling into place. He said his view had 'delicately' changed in the light of a three-day day meeting with 33 branch managers, ending yesterday. Branch managers told Mr Mieno that corporate sentiment had improved and that executives were discussing the size, rather than the timing, of a recovery. Japanese companies had made steady progress in winding down surplus stocks and in restructuring. Exports were improving in response to a rise in overseas demand led by the US, said Mr Mieno. 'Improvements in domestic activities are spreading,' he added. There was only a 'slim' risk that these signs of economic improvement would evaporate, as did a phantom upturn this time last year, he maintained. However, he warned that the yen's continued strength, the impasse in trade talks with the US and staff reductions by Japanese companies might still harm the economic outlook.</p>

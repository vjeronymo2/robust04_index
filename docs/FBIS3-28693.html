In a monthly economic diagnosis virtually unchanged from the  previous month's, the agency said, "The Japanese economy is  going through an adjustment phase and showing an overall slump."    The agency said both consumers and corporations remain  tight-fisted, despite a few signs in personal spending which  some analysts say might indicate a pickup. An agency official  briefing reporters on the report said there are some such signs,  such as upturns in household spending and recovery in department  store sales and in durable goods sales.    But all of them are unconvincing as they are caused by  temporary factors rather than by a steadfast change in the  consumer trend. "We have to watch these more carefully," the  official said.    The EPA report also noted that inventory reductions have  hardly progressed recently, leaving industrial production  sluggish. With their finances under a squeeze, corporations are  pessimistic over the future of their businesses, it said.    On the labor front, the jobless rate has steadily increased  while job offers have decreased, particularly in the  manufacturing sector.    The only bright spots, the report said, are public works  spending, boosted by the government's efforts to galvanize the  economy, booming housing construction, resulting from low  interest rates, and stable prices.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / OECD growth rate edges up Economic growth in the 25 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development this year is expected to be slightly higher than the 2.6 per cent increase in gross domestic product forecast in July, according to officials at the organisation. Mr Tsutomo Tanaka, vice-chairman of the OECD's economic policy committee, said OECD economic developments had been generally favourable. He declined to make a new forecast, but said growth was expected to edge up to 2.7 per cent. For 1995 and 1996, Mr Tanaka said growth would be about 3 per cent. The improved outlook partly reflects a stronger performance in continental Europe. 'The recovery has picked up and is now better established,' said Mr Tanaka. The Japanese economy is also reviving, albeit slowly, the OECD said. The trend partly reflects maintained easy monetary conditions and a series of short-term fiscal stimuli. In the US, however, the pace of expansion has slowed, according to the economic policy committee. But it said that this was appropriate given the risk of overheating and the general desire to see a sustained expansion of output and employment.</p>

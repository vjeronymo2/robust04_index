			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INFANT MORTALITY AND UNWED MOMS  </P> <P> Nicholas Eberstadt ("Out of Wedlock and Into Danger," Op-Ed Page, Nov. 3) was  correct in bringing the issue of the health and welfare of our children to the  attention of your readers. The statistics on infant mortality are alarming  indeed. According to the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment, the  U.S. ranks 17th, well behind most industrialized countries in this regard.  Children are also the largest single group of Americans who are living in  poverty.  </P> <P> However, his attack on "illegitimacy" is misguided and mean-spirited. While it  is true that children who are born to single mothers are at risk for a variety  of deleterious conditions, one is compelled to take issue with placing the  blame on the "parental behavior" that accompanies single parenthood. Life is  not as simple as Eberstadt presents it. How can he blame parents while the  issue of parenthood by choice is being viciously attacked by a powerful  minority in our country? The attack on sex education and family planning is  advanced by the same conservative forces of which Eberstadt is a member. How  can he place the blame on parental attitudes and behavior when the programs  needed to ensure that all children are cared for are being systematically  savaged?  </P> <P> Poverty, unemployment and underemployment, lack of opportunity, failure of the  government to respond to the needs of families, sexism, racism, and  mean-spirited attacks all contribute to the decimation of family and community  integrity. Eberstadt ignores or discounts these factors and simply blames the  victims. If you have any doubt of this thesis, just ask yourself why Eberstadt  employs the term "illegitimate babies" in his article. Can we seriously believe  that anyone who thinks that one baby is less legitimate than another merely  because his parents were not married accepts the American values of equality,  liberty and justice for all?  </P> <P> The real issue is that we have yet to accept the idea that our youth are our  greatest national treasures. The larger society must engage in a partnership  with all families to ensure that they have the tools and resources with which  to nurture their children. Finally, our society must commit the resources that  will permit this. Without them, we are responsible for wasting millions of  lives.  </P> <P> ALAN J.

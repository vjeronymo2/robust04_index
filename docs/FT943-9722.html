			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Surprising claim about market testing in efficiency study Sir, I have read few government reports that are more damning than the study carried out to determine whether the civil service is getting value for money from its use of consultants ('Whitehall could save Pounds 130m on consultants', August 5). The main findings, that a staggering Pounds 500m is being paid out in fees to the private sector for a miserable return of just Pounds 12.5m each year, is little short of scandalous and should be fully investigated by the Public Accounts Committee. I was surprised that the report also claims, on a more positive note, that consultants have been instrumental in the 'success' of the central government market testing programme. Is this not the same policy that was deemed to be so 'successful' that the recent white paper on the civil service quietly announced that departments and agencies would no longer be obliged to continue with the initiative. Only under this government could we have had a senior civil servant, Sir Peter Levene, rather than an accountable minister, being fielded to deal with the media and explain away the shocking waste of taxpayers' money. The report shows once again that the government is obsessed with the private sector and cares little that the public servants can often do the same work a lot more cheaply.

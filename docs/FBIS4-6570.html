			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- U.S. Defense Secretary  William Perry's three-day visit to South Korea was a war  monger's trip aimed at examining the war preparations against  the North on the spot and giving a new order to the puppets.    During his trip, Perry held military confabs with the  traitor  Kim Yong-sam, the puppet defence minister and the puppet foreign  minister and framed a series of dangerous intrigues such as  resumption of the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers this  year, reinforcement of U.S.-South Korea combined forces,  strengthening of a "cooperation system" and promotion of  "sanctions against the North" at the United Nations Security  Council.    This was an unpardonable criminal act which would bring the  situation on the Korean peninsula to a crisis and might cause a  dangerous event.    Perry did not forget to cry over the "provocation" of the  North. But this was intended to justify the aggressive design of  the United States.    It goes without saying that the military provokers on the  Korean peninsula are the United States and the South Korean  puppet clique that deployed new-type Patriot missiles in South  Korea and plan to extensively introduce tanks, howitzers,  multiple rocket vehicles and other means of war.    The warhawk Perry's visit to South Korea and war confabs  show  well that the U.S. authorities have no willingness to settle the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and  negotiation but they are working hard to stifle the DPRK with  strength.    It must not go unnoticed that the Kim Yong-sam group invited  the U.S. defense secretary for a "close cooperation system" and  held war confabs with him against fellow countrymen. This  eloquently shows that the Kim Yong-sam group is a gang of  never-to-be-condoned traitors hell-bent on war provocations  against the North with the sinister intention to slay fellow  countrymen in collusion with outside forces as a war servant of  the United States.    Although the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet  clique are trying to strengthen the "cooperation system" and  overpower the DPRK with strength, it is a foolish dream.    The U.S. imperialists and the "civilian"-veiled warmaniacs  must refrain from rash acts, clearly mindful that their  persistent line of war and confrontation will lead to their own  destruction.</p>

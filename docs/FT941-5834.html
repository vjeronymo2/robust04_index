			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Passenger talks back Sir, Sitting in a 757, I read with interest the article about wide-ranging consultations conducted by Boeing during the design of its 777 aircraft (Technology: 'The century's last take-off', March 1). It would seem that the only interested party not consulted was the PBP - the Poor Bloody Passenger. I suppose we have to take what's given to us.

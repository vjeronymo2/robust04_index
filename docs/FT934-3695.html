			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: German-French telecoms tie-up is seen in global strategy terms - A regulatory riddle for the European Commission The joint venture between Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom unveiled yesterday presents the European Commission with a regulatory conundrum. The companies have already been talking informally to Brussels and will now present formal proposals for a joint venture to the competition authorities. Their hope is that they will receive clearance from the Commission before the end of the first quarter of next year. The companies believe the Ecu1bn partnership - to offer advanced telecoms services to business customers - should be examined in the context of a rapidly developing global market. They are also eager to stress that it amounts to the best chance Europe has of gaining a strong strategic foothold in that market. By linking up, 'we are contributing to the pan-European fusion of cultures and markets, and we are helping to create jobs in a fascinating industry and to secure Europe's position within global industrial competition,' Mr Helmut Ricke, Deutsche Telekom's chairman, said yesterday. If the Commission accepts that the Franco-German alliance should be judged against the largest telecoms companies in the world - particularly from the US - then it is unlikely to block the deal on anti-trust grounds. Even judged by more restrictive standards, the two companies claim only 10 per cent of the European market for advanced services, although they admit the figure is based on guesswork. As Mr Marcel Roulet, France Telecom's chairman, said yesterday: 'We think that the Brussels authorities are aware that it would be somewhat paradoxical if their rules led them to block a partnership between large European players, while approving partnerships between players from different continents.' First, however, the Commission will have to decide whether the Franco-German deal falls under its jurisdiction. In September, the Commission decided it could not examine the proposed joint venture between British Telecom and the US operator, MCI, under its 1990 merger regulations - which allow for a fast-track procedure lasting less than six months - because the deal was too small. Instead, it has decided to look at the alliance under wider European anti-trust rules, and that investigation is continuing. BT is already concerned about its joint venture being confused in regulatory terms with the Franco-German alliance. The British company argues that a joint venture between two state-owned companies - which are simultaneously resisting any acceleration of the European liberalisation process - cannot be compared with its free-market joint venture. However, the coincidence of the two inquiries would also allow the Commission to develop its policy towards such mergers at a stroke. Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom hope for a reasonably flexible interpretation of the rules. They stressed yesterday that their alliance - at least at this stage - covers only those areas which have already been opened to wider European competition. The alliance sends a mixed signal to telecoms ministers, who were meeting in Brussels yesterday to discuss the ground rules for the liberalisation of the European industry. The French and German governments have thrown their weight behind the deal. But other ministers may oppose a strong new joint venture, which would challenge the ability of their own state-owned telecoms groups to compete on the liberalised market. However, a flexible interpretation of European competition rules would chime with the Commission's overall vision - contained in its White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment - of a new 'information society,' serviced by strong telecoms and information technology companies.

This agreement was expressed in the joint communique  issued by the foreign secretaries of both countries in Islamabad  on 3 January after the two-day talks. Mr. Shaheryar Khan,  Pakistan's foreign ministry secretary, said that additional  talks at any level will be hold only after the situation in  occupied Kashmir improves and the practice of human rights  violation is ended. Mr. J. N. Dixit, the Indian foreign  secretary, referred to his meeting with Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto on 2 January in his briefing to the Indian news  correspondents and hinted that he expected the prime ministers  of India and Pakistan to meet in the near future. To pave way  for the leaders' meeting, one or two divisions of the Indian  army now in Kashmir will be transferred to another area. There  is also the possibility of giving permission to the  representatives of some international human rights agencies to  visit Kashmir and stay in Srinagar. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao  has decided to call a conference of the leaders of Indian  political parties this month to see how far India should move  towards conciliation when the Pakistani prime minister visits  Delhi. The Indian prime minister will also discuss the proposal  suggested by the United States, Europe, and Japan to put Kashmir  under UN administration and establish a caretaker government  under a UN appointed administrator with representatives from all  Kashmiri groups in this proposed conference.    A Kashmiri leader who supports independence of Kashmir has  returned after finishing his jail term in Belgium. He is busy  assuring Pakistani leaders that the proposed independent Kashmir  will have the same relationship with Pakistan as is between a  younger and elder brother. Although it was Pakistan's prominent  lawyer S.M. Zaffar who defended and won freedom for Amanullah  Khan, chairman of Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), from  the Belgian jail, the JKLF members believe that moral support  from more than one Western nations played an important part in  this release. The JKLF chairman appeared in Islamabad when the  foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan were holding talks,  and began to publicize his proposal of an independent Kashmir  through his speeches and statements in the newspapers. Mr.  Amanullah Khan said in an interview that Pakistan was not in a  position to get all of Kashmir through diplomatic pressure or  the use of strength. That is why the JKLF is demanding an  independent Kashmir. The JKLF believes that the proposed  independent Kashmir will always be a friend of Pakistan and it  will have the same attitude as of a younger brother. The younger  brother will want to have a defense pact with the elder brother  and will assure that river water coming from Kashmir will always  keep the great land of Pakistan green and fertile. Referring to  historical records, the JKLF chairman recalled that when Quaid-e  Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah had talked about the independence of  states, he had presented the case of freeing former Hyderabad in  the U.N. Security Council and had recognized the right of states  to independence. Dr. Mehbub-ul Haq, a former finance minister in  Pakistani government, is also in Islamabad after visiting the  United States. He is advocating putting Kashmir under UN  administration for the interim period.    When the announcement to hold talks with India at foreign  secretaries level were made while the curfew was still imposed  in Srinagar's Hazratbal shrine and human rights were still being  violated rampantly in occupied Kashmir, the rationale was given  that the consortium of the nation that was to issue aid and loan  to Pakistan was meeting the following month and Pakistan's  request would be considered with full sympathy. Despite any  progress in the talks that concluded on 3 January in Islamabad,  since our government has promised to continue this series of  talks, it is expected that we will be rewarded and new loans  worth two or two and one-half billion dollars will be approved.  It should be remembered that our foreign ministry had announced  India was being given a last opportunity through the Islamabad  talks.    The leaders of Pakistan should not make statements on  declare  positions that they cannot keep or make promises they cannot  fulfill. Such caution will assure that Pakistani people are not  embarrassed again. Pakistan perhaps is relieved to hear that the  Indian foreign secretary did not refuse to discuss the Kashmir  issue. He was also pressured as the United States, some European  nations, and Japan had insisted on starting discussions on  Kashmir. India could not deny their order. These nations are  investing nine billion dollars annually in India and it was  important to obey them to make sure the investment continued to  flow in. Perhaps India will tell these investors that the order  to start negotiations has been fulfilled and it is their  responsibility now to admonish Pakistan and prepare it for some  understanding. The two points of understanding that are being  publicized are mentioned in beginning of this article. Kashmir  is basically the problem of the Kashmiri people and the majority  of them live in occupied Kashmir. The people of that region are  the ones that are fighting and making all kinds of sacrifices.  It would be appropriate if Pakistan finds out from the freedom  fighters if they approve the idea of an independent Kashmir or a  Kashmir under the UN administration. There are 37 groups in  occupied Kashmir and they have formed the All Parties Hariat  Conference. If the United States convinces most of the groups in  this organization to let Kashmir be put under the UN  administration, it would be impossible for Pakistan to retain  its declared stand after that. Pakistan will have to change its  stand and face the embarrassment that will go with it. If the  majority of the conference insisted on a referendum, then it  will be important to know whether the proposed referendum will  be limited to the choices of joining India or Pakistan or will  there be additional options. If the Kashmiris are the ones who  will give the opinion and the decision on Kashmir's future will  be made according to their wishes then it is their right to  increase the choices for a referendum. The United Nations will  also have to accept their wishes. The United States will be very  happy if the Kashmiris decide to remain under the United Nations  for five or six years before the referendum is taken. India will  not be any less pleased as it would get rid of a major problem.  *</p>

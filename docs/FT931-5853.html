			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Peers prepare for battle on leases TORY PEERS have begun drawing clear battle lines for the revolt next week against the government's plans for leasehold reform by tabling amendments to the bill aimed at restricting the proposals. The plans, which would give about 750,000 holders of long leases the possibility of buying the freehold of their properties provided they meet certain conditions, have already led to high-profile disaffection among Tory peers, most notably the decision by the Duke of Westminster to leave the party. Two worries for the government are that the amendments have gained some support from independent peers on the cross-benches as well as from some Tory rebels, and that those Tories who have taken the lead in tabling amendments so far are not the great landowners but party loyalists, including former ministers. Lord Peyton of Yeovil, a former minister, has put down amendments which would make it more difficult for tenants in blocks of flats to meet the criteria for clubbing together to buy the freehold, by raising from two thirds to three quarters the majority needed before the purchase can proceed. Lord Boardman, another former minister, and Lord Clark of Kempston, a former MP nominated by the government as a working peer last summer, have put down a measure to restrict the eligibility for buying the freehold to tenants for whom the leasehold property has been the main or sole place of residence for the past three years. The bill will return to the Lords next Tuesday, and the leasehold reforms will dominate the beginning of its discussion.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Haydari and Faysal Makram in </F> Sanaa and Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah in Aden]    [Excerpts] Responsible political sources in Sanaa yesterday  expressed their fear that Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas' visit to the United States for medical treatment is a  political maneuver to impede the government sessions in Sanaa.  [passage omitted]    Yemeni political quarters in Sanaa and Aden considered the  sudden departure of al-'Attas, prime minister and member of the  Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], an evasion  from holding the Yemeni Government meetings expected to resume  in Sanaa next Wednesday [20 April]. The cabinet held a session  in Aden three weeks ago and in Ta'izz one week ago.    These quarters say that the sudden departure of al-'Attas  for  medical treatment in the United States arouses suspicion,  especially since the members of his government knew nothing  about his trip for treatment, which he began the day before  yesterday following his meeting in Aden with U.S. Ambassador to  Yemen Arthur Hughes.    Yemeni political quarters, including members of the dialogue  committee, expressed extreme concern about what it terms as  al-'Attas' attempt to abort the role of the Yemeni coalition  government in implementing the accord document and to abort the  efforts aimed at reunifying the constitutional institutions in  Sanaa. These quarters linked al-'Attas' trip with the visit to  Britain by Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the YSP Political  Bureau and the Presidential Council, following his Arab tour.  The quarters considered this an evasion on the part of the YSP  from the commitment to reunify the institutions in Sanaa,  particularly the Presidential Council and the Cabinet. The  Presidential Council was expected to convene in Sanaa in the  presence of Salim Salih Muhammad following his Arab tour, during  which he conveyed messages from YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim  al-Bid to a number of Arab leaders.

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LITTLE COMPETITION -- LESS ACHIEVEMENT;  </P> <P> THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SHOUT ABOUT AMONG ORANGE COUNTY'S DELEGATES IN SACRAMENTO  </P> <P> Democrat Howard Adler, opponent to Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach),  jokingly identifies his campaign materials as coming from "The Committee to  Please Don't Elect Howard Adler for Assembly." It's a wry recognition of his  decision merely to occupy a place on the ballot in the overwhelmingly  Republican 70th District, which Ferguson is expected to win easily. Indeed,  with one exception, all of Orange County's state legislative incumbents are  expected to sail through the Nov. 6 election with barely a need for  campaigning, or comment.  </P> <P> Still, the election provides a good time to evaluate Orange County's delegates  in Sacramento. There's not much to shout about.  </P> <P> At the bottom of the list is Ferguson, who uses his seat as a soapbox for his  extreme viewpoints. He reached a low point with his resolution defending as  "militarily justified" the mass roundup and detention of Japanese-Americans  during World War II. After a bitter floor debate, it was soundly defeated.  </P> <P> That same debate, however, provided Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad),  who spoke against it, with one of his finest hours. But Frazee, whose district  covers part of Orange County, also disappointed when he took vacation during  last summer's deadlock over the state budget.  </P> <P> As for the others:  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) focused on gill net legislation which,  while worthy, was puzzling, given her landlocked district. Assemblyman John R.  Lewis (R-Orange) concentrated on GOP political strategy but had his troubles  over the unauthorized use of then-President Reagan's signature on campaign  literature. Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach) voted against  oil-spill legislation in the wake of one of the worst spills in Orange County  history. Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson (R-La Habra) spent his energies  managing an unruly GOP caucus. Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who  faces a stiff challenge from Democrat Tom Umberg, did little in his freshman  term.  </P> <P> On the state Senate side, only Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) is on the ballot.  There's not much to say other than things could be worse.  </P> <P> Neither of the county's best legislators -- state Sens. John Seymour  (R-Anaheim) and Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) -- is up for reelection. Both  are able, work hard and are oriented to issues. They set the standard against  which the county's other legislators fall short.  </P></p>

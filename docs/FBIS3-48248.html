[Asahina] In your opinion, what are the merits and demerits  of postwar bureaucracy?    [Ishihara] No doubt, there are more merits than demerits.  The status of government officials has become stable under the  postwar public service law, thus creating the administration's  stability. The cabinet system has its own merits as each  ministry takes its own part in carrying out important policies  with responsibility and competing with one another. However, if  the competition becomes excessive, it causes jurisdictional  disputes among the ministries creating various harmful effects  on the bureaucracy. Working for the prime minister's office, I  have had many opportunities to observe such undesirable aspects.  Frankly speaking, importance tends to be placed on the profit  of a particular ministry rather than on national profit.    [Asahina] How do you attempt to lead them?    [Ishihara] My most important duty, after all, is to persuade  the ministries to avoid competing for power, to avoid  jurisdictional issues, and to make them carry out policies even  if the policies are not necessarily welcomed by them. I think  the Structural Impediments Initiative [SII] that took place at  the time of the Kaifu cabinet was a good example. Although  there was serious resistance by the ministries as the tasks  required by SII were all disagreeable to them, we were finally  able obtain their cooperation. I make it a rule to remind a  newly appointed administrative vice minister that, while he  represents a particular ministry, he is also representing the  country as a whole. In that sense, I highly appreciate the  behavior of the vice ministers and councilors of the Ministry of  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in dealing with the recent  rice issue. I really think they, as high-ranking officials,  acted in a most desirable way.    [Asahina] They gave priority to national profit. Is that  what you mean?    [Ishihara] They are most familiar with the rice growers'  present conditions. And they were in agony as they also had the  best knowledge as to what was happening in Geneva where the  Uruguay Round was taking place. For the officials of the  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the easiest  path was to stick to the standpoint of protecting the farmers.  But such an attitude would have put the country into trouble.  While faced with a dilemma, they gave priority to the profit of  the country as a whole. It was also the administrative vice  ministers who made the final decision at the time of SII.    [Asahina] Do you think more than half of the administrative  vice ministers obtain passing marks?    [Ishihara] Well, I am not sure if the number is half, but I  know there are a number of vice ministers who have made  excellent choices while faced with hard situations.    [Asahina] Are there many of them?    [Ishihara] Yes, and I am sure because I have been working  with them for six years.    [Asahina] Are there certain vice ministers who take  different attitudes?    [Ishihara] Definitely, yes. They persist in following the  standpoints of their own ministries. Though they may be praised  for their efforts by their seniors and juniors within the  particular ministry, they cause trouble for the country. If  such a situation occurs, I try to talk directly to the  administrative vice minister to give my advice.    [Asahina] What is your opinion of the practice of  amakudari [landing a well-paid job in a semigovernment or  private corporation] among government officials?    [Ishihara] I think criticism of the practice of appointing  the officials to chartered corporations is reasonable, to a  certain extent. I think the practice should be changed  gradually, using the change of political regime as momentum. We  hear the same opinion voiced within the coalition government.  We also hear the view that senior positions should be open not  only to senior officials, but also to people in the private  sector and to staff members who have given loyal service to the  corporation. It is necessary to reconsider the share held by  each ministry.    [Asahina] We also hear criticism of the practice of sending  a number of officials from the central government to the local  government to hold executive posts.    [Ishihara] A person who has working experience with various  self-governing bodies sometimes proves extremely useful. It is  very important to have a staff member with experience of doing  things in a different way. It is not desirable to either shut  out central government's officials or to hold too many of them.  The best idea is to maintain a mixed personnel structure.    [Asahina] The number of prefectural governors who are former  officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs is increasing. What  would you say if asked to give advice to your juniors?    [Ishihara] People who have been bred in the field of  administration tend to be ignorant of the feelings of the  general public. Though there are minimal differences between  employees of large enterprises and government workers, workers  at medium and small enterprises generally work under the  uncertainty that their company might go out of business. People  who run private enterprises or shops, or who work in agriculture  etcetera, are in the same position and we should make every  effort to listen to their opinions and take their feelings into  consideration. I have the experience of working as director of  the commerce and industry division of the Okayama prefectural  government, and I learned very good lessons in that position by  talking to the owners of medium and small enterprises.    I feel, however, that although a governor can appear fresh  and initiate new policies for up to three terms, he tends to  fall into a rut once he enters his fourth term.    [Asahina] I understand you yourself are expected to become  governor of Tokyo?    [Ishihara] I cannot comment on that. Please allow me not to  make any comment about myself.</p>

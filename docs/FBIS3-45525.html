			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 13 (CNS)--The Bank of China, a  professional bank specializing in foreign exchange in China,  will gradually shift from being a state-owned professional bank  into a state-operated commercial bank centering on the building  up of an internal management system employing self-discipline.  This was made public by chairman of the board of directors of  the bank, Mr. Wang Qiren, at a meeting of heads of branches of  the bank across the country.    Mr. Wang gave details of the reform including first, the  establishment of an internal management mechanism for capital in  renminbi featuring unified regulation and control as well as  clear classification of responsibility. The aim is to set up a  sound capital management mechanism.    Second, the practice of ratio of assets to liabilities and  risk management of assets will be carried out within a specific  scope of loan volume. Application of capital will be subject to  capital source which will also govern the time limit for assets  and liabilities, a sound interest rate structure, the bettering  of assets, and diversification of risk. An auditing system will  be worked out and improved, thereby formulating an effective  self-discipline mechanism.    Third, policy-oriented finance must be separated from  commerce-oriented finance while attention will be paid to the  good coordination of business operation in the course of the  change in the system as well as when a policy-oriented bank is  set up. This is aimed at avoiding any adverse effects on  economic development resulting from some operations deviating  from the reform process. Economic results and risk must be given  serious consideration when policy-oriented credit business is  undertaken.    Fourth, a certain amount of credit allocated from within the  system will be used for the purchase of national treasury bonds  and for financial debt held by the policy-oriented bank while at  the same time it will also be put into the money market.</p>

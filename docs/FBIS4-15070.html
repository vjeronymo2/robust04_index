			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 05, BNS - A special group of experts  has been set up to the Lithuanian working group for talks with  CIS to recover Lithuanian archives kept in Russia. The group is  headed by Gediminas Ilgunas, director general of the Lithuanian  State Archive.    The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry has sent a note to Russia  requesting to set up a similar commission.    The return of archives was discussed March 31 at a meeting  between Nikolay Obertyshev, Russia's ambassador to Lithuania,  and Albinas Januska, Lithuanian deputy foreign minister. The  ambassador reportedly said that Russia has no legal or historic  grounds to return archives to Lithuania and sees no purpose to  create a commission for talks in order to deal with the problem.  Januska said Lithuania reserves the right to negotiate the  matter at interstate talks.    In an interview with the RESPUBLIKA newspaper, Ilgunas said  the Russian ambassador's statement contradicts the international  principles of archiving, according to which, archives must be  kept where they are created.    Ilgunas said Russia began taking out Lithuanian archives in  the times of the czarist empire. In his words, a collection of  legislative acts of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and documents  of Lithuania's provinces were taken out before 1915. Lithuania  archives were also taken out after the Soviet occupation in  1940. The Soviets took a number of documents of the pre-war  Lithuanian republic, the archives of the president's office,  including the Feb. 16, 1918 Independence Act. Archives were  last taken out in 1989-1991 from the KGB building in Vilnius.    KGB criminal and filtration files of the 1940's were  recovered in 1992. Russia later said that the files were used  against persons mentioned in them, but Ilgunas declined to  comment on these allegations.</p>

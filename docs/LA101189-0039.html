			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL BACKS WATER RATE INCREASE  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council committee on Tuesday endorsed a water rate increase  that will raise the average customer's bill by 5.9%, despite a report from city  analysts that the increase is not needed.  </P> <P> Duane Georgeson, a Department of Water and Power assistant manager, said the  increase is needed to generate $12 million for the remainder of the current  fiscal year and $19 million next year, a revenue increase of at least 6.5%.  </P> <P> The rate hike is intended to pay for a variety of new projects, rehabilitate  aging DWP facilities and pay for the increased cost of water from Mono Lake and  the Owens Valley, as well as offsetting standing debts, Georgeson said.  </P> <P> But officials with the city administrative office said in a report that "the  financial condition of the water system would remain sound without a rate  increase this year."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MATURE TRAVELER: AIRLINE COUPON BOOKS OFFER A GOOD WAY TO FLY  </P> <P> It's important to comparison-shop when purchasing airline coupon books, which  can be a good deal for the mature traveler.  </P> <P> Nine carriers now sell the discount coupon books to those age 62 and older.  </P> <P> Each coupon, sold in four- and eight-coupon books, is good for a one-way coach  trip at significantly reduced rates. Most can be purchased at an airline office  or by mail. Travel agents can accept orders but cannot issue books; they must  be sent by mail.  </P> <P> There are restrictions on the coupons and significant differences between the  coupons offered by various airlines.  </P> <P> Like all deep discount fares, senior coupon travel is "capacity controlled,"  which means only a limited number of seats are reserved on each flight for use  by coupon holders. Thus, early reservations and the flexibility to shift travel  plans are important.  </P> <P> In general, reservations must be made 14 days in advance, travel is restricted  to midweek and the coupons are not valid on holidays.  </P> <P> A coupon is good for each one-way flight, including connections, only on the  issuing carrier and its affiliated commuter lines. And the coupons are good for  a limited period of time -- usually one year from date of purchase.  </P> <P> Just because a coupon book has the lowest price tag doesn't mean it's the best  buy. Check the carrier to see if it flies to the places you are most likely to  travel.  </P> <P> Don't use a four-coupon book for travel to Hawaii from the West Coast. Since  all carriers require two coupons each way, other Hawaii package trips usually  offer a better deal.  </P> <P> Due to the fact that some carriers put a 2,000-mile cap on each coupon, you  must use two coupons for long flights, such as from the West Coast to the East.  Continental does not have a mileage cap, nor do Delta, Northwest and USAir. TWA  imposes a mileage cap from mid-May to mid-September.  </P> <P> Here's a brief list of the nine carriers and major variations:  </P> <P> American Airlines: Four coupons for $420; eight, $720; 2,000-mile cap; two  coupons for flights from Los Angeles to Hawaii and Alaska.  </P> <P> America West: Lowest priced, with four for $348; eight, $598. This competitive  edge is offset by the fact that America West serves fewer destinations than any  of the other airlines offering coupon books.  </P> <P> Continental: Four for $384; eight, $640. No mileage cap. Two coupons for  flights to Hawaii and Alaska. May be purchased through travel agents, but books  come through the mail 10 days to two weeks later.  </P> <P> Delta: Four for $420; eight, $720. No mileage cap, two coupons required each  way for travel from Los Angeles to Hawaii and Alaska.  </P> <P> Eastern: Four for $368; eight, $616. Good in the continental United States,  plus San Juan and the Virgin Islands. Seniors can also purchase books for a  companion of any age, as long as they both travel together.  </P> <P> Northwest: Four for $384; eight, $640. Good in the continental United States  and its Canadian destinations. Two coupons for travel to Hawaii and Alaska. You  may also purchase one $96 bonus coupon for a companion of any age. To purchase  coupons, you must be a member of Northwest's World Horizons Club, but the $50  membership fee is returned in a flight coupon.  </P> <P> TWA: Four-coupon book for $379, with optional fifth coupon for one round-trip  flight to Europe at $449 or $649, depending on the season. Mileage cap only in  summer. No coupon travel to Hawaii from May 15 to Sept. 15; two coupons per  flight, otherwise.  </P> <P> United: Four for $420; eight, $704. Mileage cap and two coupons per flight for  Hawaii and Alaska.  </P> <P> USAir: Four for $420; eight, $704. No mileage cap but two coupons per flight  for Hawaii and Alaska.  </P></p>

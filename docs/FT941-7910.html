			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Gasprom added to list for privatisation Gasprom, Russia's state-owned gas-producing monopoly, is to be partially privatised under the government's sweeping sell-off of state assets which aims to put 80 per cent of the country's industrial capacity into private hands by July 1, a Gasprom official confirmed yesterday. The official, who is responsible for securities at Gasprom, told the Financial Times that 15 per cent of the giant company was already being offered to company employees who had begun acquiring shares with privatisation vouchers distributed free to all Russian citizens. A further 28.7 per cent would be offered to Russian citizens across the country. Although he gave no dates, he said shares would be offered at privatisation auctions around Russia. An additional 5 per cent would be offered to ethnic minorities in the gas-rich Yamal-Nenetsk peninsula, in the far north. Gasprom would be allowed to sell 10 per cent of the shares directly to investors, including foreigners, for cash which it would be allowed to keep for investment in the development of Yamal-Nenetsk's gas reserves. Given the strategic role of Gasprom, The state would keep a 40 per cent stake in the company, which is as a big export revenue earner, for at least three years. According to government statistics, Russia exported 96bn cubic meters of natural gas outside the former Soviet Union in 1993, worth Dollars 7.2bn (Pounds 4.9bn). Total production last year amounted to 618bn cubic meters. However, it is beset with problems, including non-paying customers, and former Soviet republics which regularly get their supplies cut off for non-payment. Despite the fact that Gasprom has money in the bank, workers in individual regions have on occasion had to strike to get their salaries paid. Although it is considered to be a relatively smooth operation, another problem is inefficiency and under-investment plaguing most of Russian industry. Experts at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development estimate that leakages and low pressure contribute to waste equivalent to Belgium's annual gas consumption. Gasprom, previously headed by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, has in the past resisted attempts by the privatisation ministry to include the company in its radical campaign. Critics of voucher privatisation argue that it does not raise badly-needed cash for companies but gives their shares away for a song. Mr Chernomyrdin himself last year compared the privatisation programme to Stalin's collectivisation of agriculture.</p>

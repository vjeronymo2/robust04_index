			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev by an </F> unidentified correspondent in Sofia on 13 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] The Government Press Center has  announced that Prime Minister Professor Lyuben Berov is in  quarantine and is not allowed to have any contact with other  people over the next few days.    Professor Berov took part in the work of the cabinet on 7,  8,  and 10 April, but on 11 April developed clinical symptoms that  aroused suspicions that he had hepatitis. Laboratory tests are  now being conducted to confirm this, and the results will be  announced tomorrow or on the following day, the Government Press  Center announced.    According to acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev,  Professor Berov will be in quarantine for seven or eight days.  He said that Professor Berov's state of health did not prevent  him from having two lengthy conversations with the prime  minister today.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] If I may comment on the  delicate fact of the deterioriation in the prime minister's  health, in this aspect, was the decision for him to come back to  work not made somewhat prematurely, so as to serve a particular  political situation?    [Matinchev] I always maintained that what Professor Berov  wanted to prove was beyond his powers. He is a man who during  the period of his recuperation -- even if the process is 90  percent complete -- a man must always take account of the fact  that in such a case, anyone's health is extremely fragile.    [Correspondent] Nevertheless, the public has been left with  the conviction that it was not a question of his own decision  but a decision imposed from outside.    [Matinchev] Precisely in connection with everything that  people have started saying about this, I can tell you that it  was the prime minister's own personal decision. If you were to  ask me what my own personal attitude is, I advised him that he  simply must limit his contacts to a minimum and leave to me and  my colleague the matters concerning the administration of the  Council of Ministers.    [Correspondent] It would follow that his return to work  simply saved the cabinet.    [Matinchev] No, I would not say this is so. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Arts (Openings): Verbier The western Swiss alpine resort of Verbier is the unlikely venue for a new festival, linked to a summer academy for talented young instrumentalists. The opening concert tomorrow is given by Zubin Mehta and the Young Israel Philharmonic, which will serve as the festival's resident orchestra. Over the next two weeks, some of the world's busiest soloists will make their way to Verbier to enjoy the mountain air, share their experience in masterclasses and give recitals.</p>

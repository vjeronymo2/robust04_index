			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The downswings that should worry us all ONE OF the phrases spoken most often during the recession is 'What goes down must come up.' But how far down, and how soon up? The optimistic assumption is that we are in a short cycle recession of 10 or 11 years, so that we are repeating the recession of the early 1980s and will have another mid-to-late decade boom before long. Unfortunately, there is good reason to think that there are also two longer cycles at work. The first, the downswings of which are nasty enough on their own, is the Kuznets or long swing, some 18-19 years in length. The long swing is notable for movements in land prices and in building and credit. The upswing encourages land speculation, driving up asset prices and producing a bubble of over-expanded borrowing. When the bubble bursts, there is a very sharp contraction of credit. Growth can resume only after a painful sequence: a long fall in land and asset prices; the return to health of corporate and personal balance sheets; and, finally, the return of confidence. The last Kuznets downswing began with the crash of 1973-74, and the early 1990s certainly resemble the mid-1970s in the land and financial markets - with one important difference. Then, inflation brought borrowers' real debts down quickly and land prices back up, so the upswing could resume. There is no reason to expect such a foreshortening of the downswing this time. But this downswing, like the last, will take place within the same downswing of the Long Wave. The Long Wave, or Kondratiev cycle, is a matter of more debate. Many economic historians deny its existence altogether. But there is an ominous resemblance between the slowdown in world growth since 1974 and that of the inter-war period. Both long-wave downswings began with an international crisis (1914 and 1973) which dealt the first blow. Meanwhile, a technological revolution was nearing completion which, for a time, enabled one leading nation - the US then, Japan now - to drive forward while others were faltering. The early diffusion of the new 'technological style' helped to stimulate growth during a Kuznets upswing (mid-to-late 1920s, mid-to-late 1980s) but it exacerbated a dangerous trend to inequality. This was manifest internationally. The technological leader became creditor to the world, and the poorer countries got mired in a debt crisis. It was also developing domestically, with the rich getting richer and the poor poorer. 'When the rich get too rich, and the poor too poor, something happens,' as the Chinese proverb says. Demand becomes insufficient, for the rich do not spend as much of their income as the poor. Even the rich suffer from the poor's inability to buy what they sell. Second, the suffering of the poor affects the supply side. Poor countries cannot afford to keep up their previous rate of investment, nor can poor people invest in education, training, and even physical and mental health. Growth slows, unemployment increases, and the inequalities grow worse. The effects of these increased inequalities were delayed internationally by the recycling of oil revenues after 1974, and domestically in Europe and the UK by the deregulation of credit in the 1980s. In both cases, it was a bargain of Faust: when it was time to pay, the devil charged double. The third world and eastern Europe have been in stagnation and crisis since the early 1980s; now is the turn of the weaker northern countries. Here, internal debts and external deficits intersect. Governments which want to reflate their economies can scarcely do so because of the effects on budget and trade deficits. The Kuznets swing is most violent in countries where financial institutions are regulated least tightly. In Japan, frenzied speculation drove land and stock prices to extraordinary heights. In 1990-91, the bubble burst with a vengeance. The parallels between the Japanese slide and the US slump after 1929 are alarmingly close: a financial implosion is taking place in the world's greatest creditor. At least governments and central bankers understand better what to do the second time around. This factor may, however, be cancelled out by another. After 1929, the US was one of the worst sufferers from its crash, and so had a strong interest in action. This will not be true in Japan for some time. The implosion will not cause mass Japanese unemployment, nor does it pose an immediate threat to the major industrial companies. Within Japan, it is almost being welcomed as a overdue purgative. It is the effect outside Japan which is terrifying: Japanese trade surpluses, previously recycled by private capital outflows, will soon be huge and the outflows much diminished. Japan's trading partners will see their deficits rise further and their activity levels fall. If the implosion causes a massive withdrawal of Japanese funds, their financial systems will be gravely weakened. It is only the reaction of trading partners which will inflict real pain on Japan's main decision-makers and drive them to fundamental restructuring. Meanwhile, the agony of the double downswing will be compounded. The Kuznets downswing eventually will work itself out naturally; but to end the Long Wave downswing will require fundamental reforms. What they should be is another story.

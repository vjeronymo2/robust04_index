			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Catalan Premier Jordi Pujol by Carlos Elordi </F> in Barcelona; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Elordi] Judging by the  latest reports, you would say that the Catalans now virtually  want independence....    [Pujol] Over and above the spectacular reports, I have  always put the problem in virtually identical terms, and I have  been working for the same things for 40 years. And so I say  that Spain is a multinational, multilingual, and multicultural  state. Inside that Spain, Catalonia is a nation, with its own  language, culture, historical awareness, and traditional  institutions. All that we ask is that this fact be acknowledged.    [Elordi] But you have also said that Catalonia is like  Slovenia.    [Pujol] Yes, but I also added that Spain is not Yugoslavia.  Slovenia was also inside a multinational state, but a very  artificial and recent one. Spain's unity has now lasted for  centuries, and Spain has been able, much more than Yugoslavia,  to create a kind of "common home" for the peoples comprising it.  That is, even though Slovenia is a nation like Catalonia, the  solution to Catalonia's problems will come not through secession  but by organizing Spain in such a way that the country's  multinational nature is respected.    [Elordi] And for you the time has come to make a  considerable leap forward in order to achieve this....    [Pujol] This is not exactly the case. The fact is that our  autonomy statute and the Spanish Constitution were conceived 15  years ago in a very different manner from what, in a very  reductionist way, has since been applied, and it is that  reductionism which we wish to change.    [Elordi] Is this the "turnabout in autonomy" which you are  demanding of Felipe Gonzalez in order to continue to support his  government?    [Pujol] It is not I who spoke of a "turnabout." I do not  like this word, because it has too demanding a ring. All that  we wish to do is to negotiate two things with the Socialists:  On the one hand, a substantial change in economic policy --  something that we have achieved in the past few months -- and,  on the other, making the same interpretation of the statute and  the Constitution that was made when the two documents were  promulgated and which was much more generous than that which is  now being made. I am convinced that there is scope for all our  demands within the Spanish Constitution.    [Elordi] On one occasion you recalled the situation which  existed before 1714, when the Catalan Government dealt directly  with the king of Spain. Would that be the solution to the  current problems?    [Pujol] I do not believe that we can return to before 1714,  but I am convinced that Catalonia's autonomy must be political  -- not just administrative. If I recalled that historical  situation, it was in order to emphasize the political content of  our demands for greater autonomy. The problem is not a direct  relationship with the king but creating a structure which will  acknowledge, without limits, Spain's multinational reality.    [Elordi] Could not that "more generous" interpretation of  the Constitution place Spain's poorer regions at a disadvantage?    [Pujol] I frankly do not believe so. In Spain there is an  economic solidarity between the regions, and we want it to  continue. We can argue about the amounts which the country's  richer areas should contribute to the less developed areas. We  can also argue about the way in which this process is applied  right now in order to avert the dangers which it could entail  for the development of the regions with a higher level of  prosperity. These are arguments similar to those which occur in  Italy, but perhaps we have done things better here, and I  believe that they are less serious in this matter than in Italy.  The situation is more balanced. There is a problem in this  respect, but not a drama.    [Elordi] To what extent have the difficulties now  threatening the process of European unity, of that "Europe of  the peoples" in which an autonomous Catalonia would have found  its own place, revived the tension between Barcelona and Madrid?    [Pujol] We Catalan nationalists have always been  pro-European, and in the past we were the only people who  maintained that stance. Europe has been part of the Catalan  identity for centuries: Catalonia originated as part of the  Carolingian empire, and our capital was not Toledo but Aachen.  We have always wished to form part of Europe -- not of a  somewhat sidelined periphery -- but the Catalan nation's  political problems must be resolved in Madrid -- not Brussels.  This has always been the case.    [Elordi] What will the Catalan nationalists do if Madrid  does not accept their demands?    [Pujol] I do not share the feeling of tension which some  people are creating in this respect. We wish to negotiate  peacefully the recognition of our rights, and it must not be  forgotten that many very important laws approved by the current  government over the past few months exist not because they had  the backing of any master of Spanish patriotism but thanks to  the Catalan nationalists' support.</p>

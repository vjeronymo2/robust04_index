			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Iraq to repay debt in oil Iraq has agreed to repay a Dollars 1.5bn debt to Bulgaria, mostly with oil supplies, after the United Nations embargo is lifted, Bulgaria said yesterday. The debt was run up under the old communist regime when Bulgaria, like other countries in eastern Europe, supplied Iraq with arms and other goods on credit during the war with Iran. Under an agreement signed in 1990, Iraq was to cover part of its debt by supplying Bulgaria with 4.75m tonnes of oil by 1994 but the invasion interrupted the deal.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (10): Where bankers fear to tread - The Leasing Professionals THE UK leasing industry has turned into a highly professional and entrepreneurial operation. It thrived on the financial deregulation of the 1980s and has adopted innovative practices developed in the US leasing market. Since the merger of the Finance House and the Equipment Leasing Associations at the start of 1992, the full membership of the new Finance Leasing Association (FLA) is 106, accounting for around 80 per cent of all leasing companies. Mr Tony Mallin, chairman of the FLA and vice-chairman of Hambros Bank, believes that, for small and medium sized companies coming out of recession, leasing offers a cheap and stable form of asset finance. 'Leasing is one of the few forms of finance that is fixed to the total cost of the asset and covers a reasonable period of time,' he says. Banks would rarely lend small companies funds for 100 per cent of the asset value, over say, a five-year period. But the leasing industry specialised in doing this for the full working life of the asset, he said. When the going got tough for a small company, a bank could quickly call in the overdraft, and put it into receivership. But, says Mr Mallin, 'we are committed for the life of the project.' Mr Mallin has seen the business change dramatically in the last 15 years. In 1978, he joined the leasing department at Hambros Bank as a member of its marketing and business development operations. In 1981, he moved to Australia to develop an asset finance and leasing unit in Sydney, and worked on the last leverage lease in the country - a Boeing 747 leased to Cathay Pacific. By 1985, he was back in the UK and was made managing director of Hambros Leasing. And by 1991 he was made vice chairman of the bank and in May 1993 chairman of the FLA. 'The industry is moving towards service-oriented financing,' he says. Previously (in the period of 100 per cent capital allowances) it was mostly passive finance. The loss of the full tax allowance made lessors far more pro- active in taking on residual risk. Now they were 'embracing service into the financing of an asset'. The industry's best years were in the mid-1980s despite sombre forecasts that the industry would never recover from the loss of the full allowance. Mr David Melville, managing director at Kodak Finance, agrees: 'I remember seminars then with people saying that this would be the end of leasing as the tax-based incentives weren't there. But, instead we went into our boom years.' As the economy turns, the professional lessors are confident that they are best placed to re-equip the small and medium-sized manufacturers cost-effectively. According to Mr John Callender, managing director of Barclays Mercantile Business Finance, 'the middle business market is a very important area for us  .. Demand, though not storming ahead, has picked up a little bit mainly in the north, north-west and the midlands.' Kodak's Mr Melville goes further, saying that if the UK did not have a leasing industry, 'it would be in serious difficulties in respect to the amount of investment, as banks have not been prepared to lend to small or medium-sized businesses to the extent necessary'. All the professionals, however, have been chilled by the experience of questionable practices in the photocopier market and recognise it has tarnished - unfairly they say - their image. 'In the financing market you will always get fringe operators who will indulge in excesses. But the job of the industry is to regulate itself. Once we are aware of the problem it will be dealt with efficiently,' says Mr Mallin. The FLA has now set up an independent tribunal and conciliation service to hear complaints against its members. If the member is found to have breached the guidelines, the FLA will revoke its membership. Recent proposals by the Accounting Standards Committee to decide which leases are included on the balance sheet are also a bone of contention among professionals. And pointing to the failures of operating leasing companies such as Atlantic Computers, Blackspur, ICS and GPA, Mr Mallin says the real problem lay with income recognition and not whether the lease was on or off-balance sheet. 'If the accountancy profession starts to put stringent rules on leases, this will cause banks and financial institutions to rein back just at the time when the economy is picking up,' he warns. For the future, the leasing professionals are watching developments in the public sector privatisation. They want their share of the action - but know that, despite promises, the government has so far been slow to act. British Rail privatisation still remains fraught with difficulties. Many professionals are worried by how the government is going to help ease any 'sweat points' that arise from a change in franchisee. 'Everyone would like to see it work, but I think there are still a number of issues to be ironed out,' says Mr Peter Torrance, director of marketing of business finance at Lombard North Central. But more immediate is the November 30 Autumn Statement, and Mr Mallin has his own list of proposals for the chancellor: Relax the restrictive legislation on export leasing to enable lessors to lease off-shore. He believes the Inland Revenue's current legislation was 'a sledgehammer to crack a nut' - ie it was far too restrictive. The FLA had now made several proposals aimed at preventing leakage but also leave room for UK manufacturers to set up leasing agreements with overseas customers. Deregulation to be extended in the financial markets, because restrictive practices in the corporate sector had a 'dampening' effect on the growth of the leasing industry. Allowances for research and development would be 'very helpful', Mr Mallin says. There are already allowances for scientific research, but small and medium-sized companies lack the tax base to absorb the full costs of R&amp;D. To continue the 40 per cent tax allowance, and consider 'an enhanced incentive package for manufacturing industry'.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Beijing opens way for development of new Hong Kong BEIJING has given the go-ahead for a Hong Kong-led consortium to develop a special free port zone on Hainan Island, off the south China coast, to create a 'second Hong Kong'. Development costs over 15 years are estimated at Dollars HK18bn (Pounds 1.3bn). The news is further affirmation of China's commitment to rapid economic reform. Although the new Yangpu Development Zone will remain under China's sovereignty, the land use will be controlled by the group of overseas investors under a 70-year lease. Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong), the Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of the Japanese construction giant, will combine with a group of investors to provide a basic infrastructure for the Yangpu Zone, building a power station, roads and sewage works. The group will then sell land for development by local or foreign investors. The zone will be segregated from the rest of Hainan by a customs frontier, and aim to concentrate on developing export-oriented industries, making use of a deep-sea port. Enterprises in the zone will receive tax benefits above those current in the existing Special Economic Zones, including Hainan Island itself. No external policy will be laid down on the level of recruitment or wages in the zone. Development will be in three phases, phase one requiring investment of Dollars HK2.5bn and providing services for a 75,000 population. But Kumagai aims for a population of 250,000 and employment for a further 150,000 temporary residents, at the end of 15 years. Kumagai has paid a Dollars HK40m deposit for the land and will pay out a total of Dollars HK140m for the site. Kumagai has been negotiating to set up the Zone for more than four years. The final line-up of the Yangpu consortium has yet to be finalised, but analysts believe Kumagai will be the main shareholder, with possible support from its parent company.</p>

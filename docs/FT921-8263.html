			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'No reason' for LME prices, says analyst TRADERS WERE using confusion over Russian metal exports as a cover to squeeze the London Metal Exchange aluminium and nickel markets, some analysts suggested yesterday. This was after the LME nickel price jumped to its highest level for six months, while aluminium edged up to a seven-month peak. 'This is crazy. There is no reason for prices to be at this level,' said Mr Robin Bhar, analyst with Carr Kitkat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez group. He said metal consumers were staying out of the market and, with more than 1m tonnes of aluminium and 17,000 tonnes of nickel in LME stocks, 'no-one could claim there were shortages'. Mr Bhar pointed out that the contango (premium for three-month over cash metal) for aluminium and nickel had narrowed sharply. He added: 'The LME should nip this potential technical squeeze in the bud.' Meanwhile, traders said the Russian government, under pressure from producers, had cut the new export duty on metals from about 500 to 290 Ecus (Pounds 206) a tonne. Metal sold for funds to buy essential raw materials might be entirely exempt from duty. This would help Russian aluminium exporters, it was suggested, because much of their metal was sold to purchase raw materials. However, nickel was sold mainly for foreign currency and producers were having difficulty. Reuter reported Raznoimport, the Russian trading company, as saying that Russian commercial banks were prepared to finance pre-payments of nickel export duties but wanted to charge 60 per cent annual interest. Fund buying lifted three-month nickel prices to Dollars 8,245 a tonne at one stage yesterday. By the close it had slipped to Dollars 8,207, up Dollars 52.50 from Friday, while cash nickel was up Dollars 165 to Dollars 8,195. Three-month aluminium reached Dollars 1,340 a tonne before closing at Dollars 1,322.50, up Dollars 11. Cash aluminium ended at Dollars 1,297, up Dollars 9.50.</p>

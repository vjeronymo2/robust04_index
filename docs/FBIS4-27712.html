			<p>BFN     [Text] On 1 June, Khan Savoeun, Prince Ranariddh's  self-appointed general and former commander of a military  division in Stoung District of Kompong Thom Province, ordered  aircraft to bomb and strafe Soeng and Rumchang [former bases of  FUNCINPEC -- National United Front for an Independent, Neutral,  Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia -- near the Thai border],  alleging that Khmer Rouge were present. However, the bombing  and strafing hit the wives and children of the Para soldiers  [former non-communist resistance forces], killing or wounding a  number of them, instead of the Democratic Kampuchean forces.    The Para soldiers were very angry and condemned Khan  Savoeun,  Prince Ranariddh, and other FUNCINPEC ringleaders, and fired  heavily at the aircraft.</p>

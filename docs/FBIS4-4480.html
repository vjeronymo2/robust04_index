			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Japan will provide 4  billion yen to help improve safety at Kathmandu airport, where  two plane crashes occurred within two months in 1992, government  officials said Thursday [31 March]. The Japanese and Nepalese  Governments have agreed on a program to equip the accident-prone  airport with radars and other facilities as well as train air  controllers, the officials said.    The Transport Ministry sent a controller and an engineer  Thursday to Kathmandu for training the Nepalese. The government  also plans to invite 30 to 40 controllers from the airport to  Japan for training.    The planned refurbishing of the control facilities will be  completed around fall in 1996.    The poor safety level at the airport came into the spotlight  in 1992, when two plane crashes within a two-month period killed  nearly 300 people.    On July 31, 1992, a Thai Airways Airbus crashed into a  Himalayan ridge after trying to land at the airport, killing all  113 people on board, including 21 Japanese.    On September 28, a Pakistani airliner carrying 167 people  crashed in a rainstorm near the airport, killing all aboard.    Kathmandu airport is considered tricky by pilots, who have  to  spiral down to the runway to avoid surrounding mountains. The  airport has no radar and planes are guided in by radio beacon.</p>

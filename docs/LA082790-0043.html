			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BAGHDAD, SLOGANS OF WAR, TALK OF HARDSHIPS;  </P> <P> IRAQ: PEOPLE APPEAR FIERCELY LOYAL TO SADDAM HUSSEIN. BUT THERE ARE BREAD LINES  AND A GROWING BLACK MARKET.  </P> <P> In a dusty field at sunset Sunday, hundreds of balding Iraqi teachers,  white-haired office workers and paunchy professionals practiced going to war  with America.  </P> <P> Dressed in fatigues and armed to the teeth, they practiced firing mortars. They  shouldered powerful new rocket launchers, and they charged invisible enemies  with empty machine guns, shouting all the while such slogans as "Ask the sky:  Saddam is beloved. Ask the sky: We will fight. Ask the sky until we die."  </P> <P> Meet Saddam Hussein's reservists, Iraq's volunteer Popular Army that is among  the sights and sounds of a city preparing for war -- perhaps against the entire  Western world.  </P> <P> It was a publicity event, to be sure, a photo opportunity organized by the  Iraqi government for the handful of Western television crews and newspaper  reporters who have been permitted to report on the Persian Gulf crisis from  inside the country at the heart of it.  </P> <P> But the Popular Army's evening training camp was among the stark images that a  Times reporter saw during the first day behind what may well become enemy  lines, and it helped illustrate the depth of control President Hussein and his  monolithic Arab Baath Socialist Party still appear to enjoy in this sprawling  capital of 5 million people.  </P> <P> There certainly was no shortage of symbolic imagery of that omnipresence.  Hussein's first larger-than-life portrait appears on the roadside just a few  miles out of Saddam International Airport, his right arm outstretched in  greeting a few hundred feet from a second billboard that declares, "Welcome to  Baghdad. Capital of Arab Saddam."  </P> <P> And throughout Baghdad, there are literally hundreds of Saddam Hussein  billboards, some picturing the Iraqi leader in uniform and beret, others in a  traditional Arab kaffiyeh, still others in a business suit, but, in all of  them, smiling and relaxed.  </P> <P> Even at the Ishtar Sheraton Hotel, where the journalists are staying, a  6-foot-high portrait of the Iraqi president smiles down on the lobby, and the  only hint of crisis is a sign outside the rooftop elevator announcing, "Please  be informed that the nightclub will be closed until further notice."  </P> <P> Outside, in the souks and shopping centers that provide the Iraqis' daily  bread, there are few signs on the surface that the world's economic  stranglehold on Iraq is having an immediate effect.  </P> <P> Most shops were well-stocked with dry goods, canned food and general consumer  products, and traffic appeared to be moving normally on the city's broad lanes  and boulevards.  </P> <P> Just beneath the surface, though, there was talk of growing hardship. Bread  lines were seen in parts of the city, a byproduct of a strict government policy  warning that food hoarders will be shot. There was evidence that the  black-market economy is growing. And, in sunbaked Baghdad, where day  temperatures soar to well over 100 degrees, one of the biggest sacrifices of  daily life is ice cream -- the Arab summer staple that requires two key  commodities that are running low, sugar and powdered milk.  </P> <P> But there is little evidence of any dissent against an iron-willed president  who has led Iraq in war during most of the past decade. Taxi drivers,  shopkeepers and civilians approached on the street all voiced strong support  for Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, for his image of defiance and for the tough  stand he is taking against the West.  </P> <P> "You can ask any Iraqi, and he will tell you that we feel Kuwait is a part of  our country that was taken away from us," said Moyat Sayed, a 55-year-old  English teacher, who similarly said he believes Iraq should possess chemical  weapons because the Americans and Soviets possess them.  </P> <P> "The mentality is different here," he added, in explaining that Iraq also feels  justified in keeping Westerners as virtual hostages in Baghdad and Kuwait  because the Americans forced Japanese into U.S. internment camps during World  War II. "The Arab people support Iraq's invasion," he said, "only some Arab  governments don't agree because they don't represent their people."  </P> <P> Perhaps not by coincidence, that is the same line broadcast several times daily  on government radio and television and carried in the state-run newspapers in  what, taken together, ranks among the world's most effective propaganda  machines.  </P> <P> A case in point was Sunday's edition of the government's English-language  daily, The Baghdad Observer, which led with the headline: "President Hussein  Says U.S. Occupation of Arab Sacred Land Is a Crime." Another prominent story  reported the government's decision to permit the 52 wives and children of  American diplomats stopped here en route from Kuwait to Turkey to leave Iraq.  And, throughout the paper, the editors clearly sought to whip up anti-American  sentiment.  </P> <P> "Arab-Americans Harassed, Threatened With Death," shouted a front-page headline  over an obscure wire story from Boston reporting on a 41-year-old American of  Arab descent who received death threats in that city. Another front-page story  reported on anti-American demonstrations in many Arab and European capitals and  quoted a Jordanian Islamic leader as shouting "Death to America, death to  Israel, death to the emirs (Kuwait's exiled rulers)!" Surprisingly, though,  very little such sentiment seems to have reached Baghdad's grass-roots. A taxi  driver at the airport, for example, asked The Times reporter his nationality.  </P> <P> "American," he answered.  </P> <P> The driver beamed and held out his hand. "America very good. America good.  Welcome. Welcome."  </P> <P> Then he paused for a second and added, "Well, America so-so. There are some  problems there, but inshallah (if God wills) they will soon be gone, and we  will be friends."  </P> <P> Although hardly as effusive, even members of Hussein's Popular Army took time  out from their training exercises Sunday night to explain that the gulf crisis  is not yet a confrontation between Iraqis and Americans, but between  governments.  </P> <P> Modhaffar Abad, a 48-year-old professor at Baghdad College, leaned his AK-47  assault rifle against his leg and said, in fluent English, that he spent two  enjoyable years in New York on a scholarship in the early 1980s. "American  people are very friendly," he said.  </P> <P> "Would you now fight America?" Abad was asked.  </P> <P> "In fact, yes," he said.  </P> <P> "Would you kill Americans?"  </P> <P> "If the soldier will come to my country, yes. If somebody should come to your  house and try to enter by force, you must kill him.  </P> <P> "Look, I'll be frank with you. We are not against anybody. We are not against  any person. We are against anyone who says Iraq is going to get put down.  Personally, we have to defend our country.  </P> <P> "And if my friend in the United States is going to be a certain person invading  my country, I will kill this friend to defend my brother. You are my friend  now, but if you are going to take this machine gun and kill me, my brother will  use it to kill you. That is the way here."  </P> <P> More on Gulf Crisis  </P> <P> SOVIET STANCE -- Foreign Minister Eduard A.

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (33):  The promise of truly integrated systems - Analysis / Spreading the productivity advantages of personal computing  across an enterprise demands a new approach to applications software. Groupware offers a promising way forward THE drive for productivity has always been one of the main justifications for the use of information technology. The first computer systems were used to speed up mundane clerical tasks like the calculation of the company payroll and issuing sales invoices. In the last decade, personal computers have helped to boost personal productivity. It ought to be a simple task to spread these personal productivity gains to an entire business enterprise: install a network, connect the personal computers to it and watch efficiency increase and costs fall. Unfortunately, it is not that simple. The physical connection of personal computers to a corporate network is not enough in itself to bring productivity gains. A multi-level software infrastructure is also needed. Network management software, communications software and usable 'front end' software - such as graphical user interfaces  -must be in place before the network can be exploited fully. There is also a need for a different type of applications software. The traditional approach to personal applications is inadequate because it assumes that there is only one user of the system, working in isolation. If networks of personal computers are to be used effectively by groups of people, the applications software must be able to cope with the interactions between users and control them. This is where groupware comes in. Groupware is an extra level of applications software which aims to create genuine interaction between people through a computer network. 'The personal computer has given people individual power, but stand-alone personal computers are not aimed at getting people to work together - even if you put them on to a network,' says John Matthews, a consultant at management consultancy, Infact. 'Groupware should do this - but it needs something more. You have to give people an incentive to use the technology properly. The telephone is a primitive groupware tool - some use it well and some use it badly,' he adds. Mr Matthews sees the growth in the use of groupware as a management issue - a view shared by others: 'Groupware is a bit like a mirror - an awful lot of work in an organisation is already group-oriented. Most of the technology is available - so the issue is a management one, rather than a technical one,' says Michael Skok, chairman of European Software Publishing (ESP), UK distributor of the Beyond Mail groupware package. 'It is a simple evolutionary step from electronic mail. Instead of just sending messages, you can share all sorts of information across the network. You can put some intelligence into the system and begin to automate workflow and office procedures,' he continues. The idea of groupware has its roots in research into computer-supported co-operative work (CSCW) in the US, dating back to the 1960s. Among others, Douglas Engelbart (the originator of the ubiquitous 'mouse' pointer) and his team at the Stanford Research Institute carried out pioneering work in CSCW with a system called On-Line System (NLS). This system was designed to support a team of people drawn from different disciplines and the software included a set of core tools such as a text editor, graphics programs and data managers. The research on NLS later influenced the work at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre (PARC) which led eventually to the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows. Engelbart's original aim was to 'augment individuals doing knowledge work.' But as networking became available, NLS was extended to support groups of workers who could communicate via the network - making it the first groupware. NLS let researchers work together on a project and develop ideas by co-operating with each other through the system. This has been the aim of 'office automation' systems for many years and it could be argued that groupware is just another name for an old idea. Office automation systems such as IBM's Officevision and DEC's All-in-one package provide many of the features that would be expected in a groupware product - including electronic mail, file-sharing and personal computing facilities. But although traditional office automation systems and groupware share many similar features, true groupware goes much further than just providing an application environment within a network. It must enable co-operation between staff and extend the productivity gains from the desktop personal computer to the whole enterprise. 'The problem with office automation systems is that there is a tendency for people not to use them - they can be a distraction because people have to learn all sorts of new skills,' says John Matthews of Infact. 'But with some of the groupware products, a lot of the problems are overcome. A product like Filenet, for example, provides automated access to mainframe resources - getting rid of what has been somewhat of a burden for users who do not know the complexities of logging on to these systems.' In its most advanced form, groupware can be used to co-ordinate an entire product design operation - with the software providing links between marketeers and designers, production engineers and cost-accountants. The theory is that this will speed up the process of bringing a new product to market and give a company a competitive edge. This is a far cry from traditional office automation systems and has only been made possible because of changes in the technology infrastructure. The emergence of 'intelligent' buildings, which are wired up for networks, coupled with advanced workstations which can handle different types of data, has created the physical environment to make modern groupware possible. Advances in software have also contributed to the infrastructure. Graphical user interfaces such as Apple's Macintosh and Microsoft's Windows have made it easier for users to access and manipulate information on a personal computer. Improved networking and communications software, based on accepted 'open systems' standards, has let different types of computers 'talk' to each other. Innovative approaches to the design of computer systems - often referred to as the 'architecture' - have also helped. The client/server approach - where the system is separated into components which either use or offer services encapsulated in a 'black box' - lends itself to groupware applications. The increasingly-popular object-oriented design approach - which builds on the client/server model - also offers an excellent foundation for groupware. Modern software environments can also provide mechanisms to link data across programs and databases. Microsoft Windows, for example, includes a feature called Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). This enables up-to-date data from one source to be connected to another. So a word processing document can include a reference to a spreadsheet and, through DDE, ensure that it is kept up-to-date. Any changes in the spreadsheet will be reflected in the document automatically. But groupware applications can go much further. They can also control the flow of work through a company or a project. Practical examples include, say, the fulfilment of an insurance policy or a loan application. Both tasks are subject to procedures which have been laid down by the company, involve a number of staff and require different levels of authorisation. A full groupware package, like FCMC's Staffware or Lotus Notes, can be used to devise the rules to control the flow of the documentation through a system and ensure that all of the procedures are correctly executed. The groupware package can channel the documentation to the right person at the right time and prompt staff to carry out further action. Most documents produced in business spend more time in people's 'in' trays, awaiting approval, than they spend actually being worked on, observes David Carew-Jones of Uniplex, based in the UK, and one of the world's leading vendors of Unix-based office systems. The electronic mail capabilities of Uniplex will distribute complex compound documents anywhere in the world, instantly, to any number of people for approval, notification and editing - 'the result is a faster turn-round for the creation of documents which require input or approval of more than one person,' says Mr Carew-Jones. Groupware means a fundamental change in the use of information technology in business and creates a different corporate culture which is less geared to the individual and more directed at the enterprise as a whole. It follows that such systems emphasise co-operation in place of competition. The depth of this change means that groupware must be introduced into an organisation very carefully. There are two approaches, according to Michael Skok of ESP: 'You can use groupware for specific projects or you can use it for the whole enterprise. But we recommend starting with simple tasks and evolving slowly. If you go too far - say with an enterprise-wide system - it is too much of a revolution.' The project approach, says Michael Skok, is the way that most companies will take their first steps into groupware: 'Project teams probably already have natural ways of working which mean sharing data and resources. Groups of about six to eight people seem to work well.' John Matthews of Infact notes that the state of most companies' technology infrastructure will dictate the project-oriented approach anyway: 'It is going to be limited to a single department at the moment because most of the products are based on a single technology - such as Unix or OS/2. If you want to get into groupware which cuts across departments, you will usually have to deal with more than one technology,' he explains. 'There is also likely to be some resistance because of the control aspects of groupware. We have looked at systems in Germany and Scandinavia, where the use of groupware is more advanced, and found evidence of this.' Like all technological progressions, the introduction of groupware into an organisation must carry the users with it. They must be able to see the benefits to themselves and to their companies so that they will be encouraged to make it work. After a decade of fragmentation caused by the spread of personal computing throughout industry and commerce, groupware offers the promise of truly integrated systems which combine the benefits of personal productivity and improvements in corporate efficiency. Groupware could be the basis of a revolution in the use of information technology which is as significant as the one caused by personal computers.</p>

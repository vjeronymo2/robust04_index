			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: CNC tools 'could make anything' BRITISH and German engineers said yesterday that it was impossible to prevent equipment of the type sold by Matrix Churchill to Iraq from being used for military purposes. 'Machine tools are general-purpose machines,' said Mr Michael Bright, chairman of FMT, a Brighton company that was building equipment for Matrix Churchill to fulfil Iraqi orders. 'They can be programmed to make anything.' FMT's order was frozen when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In spite of what is common knowledge among engineers, government documents in 1988 show that export licences for machine tools were granted. Departmental committees had determined the equipment consisted of 'civilian items of general purpose not destined for a military end use'. Iraq bought computer-controlled machine tools, usually called CNCs (computer numerically controlled). They were of two types: CNC lathes, in which a piece of metal revolves so that cutters shape it into a cylindrical object such as a shell casing, or CNC machining centres, where the cutters move around a stationary block to create, for example, gun parts. Baghdad chose CNC machines because of their flexibility. In 1990, Matrix Churchill sent engineers to Iraq to oversee a switch to making automotive parts, said Mr Paul Henderson, formerly managing director of Matrix Churchill. But CNC machines are slower than equipment dedicated to making one item. Iraq's solution was to buy a lot of machine tools: BSA, for example, sent 50 lathes valued at Pounds 6.9m. Iraq also ordered from Wickmann Bennett, a Coventry manufacturer, 15 lathes for Pounds 11m and another 141 from Matrix Churchill worth Pounds 19m. There were other Iraqi orders for German and Swiss companies, said Mr Henderson. BSA, Matrix Churchill and others then trained Iraqi engineers to programme the machine tools. This meant that even if a machine tool began life making car parts, a technicians could re-programme it using a computer keyboard and simple instructions to make weapon parts. 'It's easy to say a machine tool is for one purpose and use it in another way,' confirmed Mr Klaus Friedrich, export consultant at the VDMA, the German manufacturing equipment association. 'To stop everything that might be used by foreign armies, you would have to control the exports of 50 per cent of industrial production.' German machine-tool manufacturers were at the forefront of sales to Iraq. Germany is Europe's biggest supplier of machine tools and the Iraqi embassy in Bonn became the Iraqi government's buying office, according to Mr Bright. Mr Keith Bailey, chairman of BSA, argued that how the equipment was eventually to be used was guesswork.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Algeria's hardline defence chief appointed head of state General Lamine Zeroual was yesterday appointed Algeria's new head of state by the High Security Council which has ruled the country since multi-party elections were suspended two years ago. Born in 1941 in Batna, at the foot of the Aures mountains from where the war of independence was launched on November 1 1954, Gen Zeroual was not trained in the French army as was the case of many of his peers. He attended military schools in the former Soviet Union and France and is one of the most respected senior officers in the Algerian army. He has commanded a number of military regions, notably the Tindouf on the sensitive south-west frontier with Morocco, the military academy at Cherchell and the land forces. He resigned from the latter post after the bloody riots of October 1988. He was recalled from retirement last July to become minister of defence, a portfolio he will retain. In a rare interview last October, Gen Zeroual said the army would not 'get involved in partisan infighting. Its purpose is to help forge a national consensus'. Such remarks suggest a willingness to open dialogue with the now banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which was headed for victory before Algeria's first multi-party parliamentary elections were cancelled in January 1992. The battle against the Islamic fundamentalists, which has cost more than 3,500 lives since the elections were scrapped, has been left to Gen Lamari. Given his credentials as a hardliner, Gen Zeroual could be better placed to seek some accommodation with FIS leaders to bring an end to the violence. Algeria's fifth president since independence in 1962 faces two challenges. The first is to end the growing civil strife, either by talking to the FIS or by 'eradicating' fundamentalists, as some of his peers would wish. The second is to reach agreement with the International Monetary Fund on reforms and to loosen the noose of foreign debt repayments which, in 1994, will absorb 10 per cent of the country's oil and gas export revenue. Iran's official radio yesterday said the appointment of Gen Zeroual as Algerian head of state would deepen the conflict with Islamic militants. 'This has placed the crisis-ridden country of Algeria on a path that is even more uncertain than before,' Tehran Radio said soon after Gen Zeroual's appointment was announced. 'The ruling High State Council which cancelled parliamentary elections two years ago and took power illegally has now violated Algeria's constitution once again,' said the radio. Algeria last year broke off diplomatic relations with Iran, accusing it of supporting the Moslem fundamentalists. The radio said some military units had joined a newly formed Islamic Liberation Army in Algeria.</p>

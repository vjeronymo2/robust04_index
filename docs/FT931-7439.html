			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Dassault electronics unit sees return to the black THE ELECTRONICS arm of the Dassault group believes it will return to profit this year on a rising trend of military exports, including its share in providing on-board computers for the 400 Leclerc tanks that France is selling to the United Arab Emirates. Dassault Electronique made a consolidated loss of FFr250m (Dollars 45m) last year, largely as a result of paying for redundancies announced last summer. The company, which also makes automatic banking machines, forecast that its turnover would not change substantially over the next two years from its 1992 level of FFr3.87bn. However, after that time lag, its turnover would reflect the increase in orders. These orders would rise from FFr4.05bn last year to FFr5.5bn this year, the group forecast. At the end of last year, the company's order book stood was worth FFr7.75bn.</p>

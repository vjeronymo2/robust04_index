			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Dehua (2621 1795 5478) ] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Shen  Daren, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Jiangsu  People's Congress, said here yesterday that Jiangsu, as one of  the provinces whose economy has developed rapidly, resolutely  supports the financial and taxation reform launched by the  central government.    Over the years, Jiangsu has been one of the provinces  delivering a large portion of its revenue to the central  government. In 1993, Jiangsu's gross national product [GNP]  totaled 255 billion yuan, an increase of 18.5 percent over the  previous year. Per capita income in the year amounted to 3,270  yuan. The province delivered 7.6 billion yuan to the state last  year.    Shen Daren, who has held the offices of member of the  Ningxia  CPC Committee and secretary of the Jiangsu CPC Committee for 17  years, told this reporter that Jiangsu's 1994 economic growth is  set at 12 percent, 3 percentage points higher than the country's  average. At the same time, Jiangsu will seek unity of economic  efficiency and growth.    Shen Daren said that the purpose of the system of  revenue-sharing between the central and localities, which came  to effect commencing 1 January this year, is to enhance the  state's capability of macroeconomic regulation and control.  This will offer reliable guarantee for China's sustained,  rapid, and steady economic growth. Thanks to this reform,  Jiangsu and many other provinces will be in a relatively fair  position for competition. However, it will also temporarily  affect the interests of some parts of Jiangsu. To this end,  Jiangsu's attitude is that local and partial interests should be  subordinate to those of the central. Jiangsu will resolutely  maintain the authority of the central government and proceed in  all cases from the overall situation. The leaders at all levels  in Jiangsu should explain this to the broad ranks of the people  and seek unity of thinking.    As the country's reform has entered a crucial stage,  Chairman  Shen said Jiangsu will implement the reforms introduced by the  central government in a down-to-earth manner.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Hu Guangyao (5170 0342 5069) and Li Zheng </F> (2621 2398)]    [Text] Colombo, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- In an interview with Sri  Lankan journalists here, Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and  concurrently foreign minister, said China stands for  establishing a new international political and economic order,  which should be founded on the basis of the Five Principles of  Peaceful Coexistence.    In response to a reporter's question about the role China  will play in the future world, Asia in particular, the Chinese  foreign minister said: "If we say that China can play a certain  role in this process, China should be a factor for promoting  world peace and economic development."    Touching on Sino-Sri Lankan trade and economic relations,  Qian Qichen said: In recent years, China and Sri Lanka have  seen new features in their economic and trade activity, that is,  both countries have pursued a policy of economic reform and  opening up and their economic developments have accelerated.    He pointed out: Under such circumstances, bilateral economic  exchanges should not be limited to those between the  governments. Greater emphasis should be placed on exchanges  between nongovernmental sectors. They can explore various  investment and cooperation opportunities.    When asked by a reporter about China's experience in  economic  reform, he said: China has been quiet successful in its economic  reform. Over the past 15 years, a market economy has been  gradually instituted in China and the economic growth has  continued. Meanwhile, the basic socialist system has remained  unchanged. He added: In the process of reform, although China  has learned from some advanced experiences of foreign countries,  it has proceeded from the realities in the country and taken its  own road.</p>

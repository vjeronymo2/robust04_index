			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GULF WATCH: DAY 130;  </P> <P> A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS;  </P> <P> HOSTAGE FRONT:  </P> <P> A U.S.-chartered Iraqi airliner carrying about 175 Americans touched down early  today in Frankfurt, Germany, after a flight from Baghdad, the day after a  smaller group of freed hostages touched down in Texas. Another jet carrying  about 160 Italians and a sprinkling of hostages of other nationalities arrived  in Rome, and a British-chartered jet is scheduled to leave today.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diplomatic Front:  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to  meet with him by Jan. 3, noting that the Iraqi suggestion of Jan. 12 is only  three days before the U.N. deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.  </P> <P> Baker, anticipating a peaceful end to the crisis, said that U.S.-led  multinational forces would remain in the region during possible negotiations  later between Baghdad and a restored Kuwaiti government.  </P> <P> Baker also said the United States is working to avoid an international  conference on the Palestinian issue now because that would imply a linkage with  the gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Jordan's King Hussein proposed a peace plan that calls for  compromise, for talks among Arabs and for linking other regional problems, such  as the Arab-Israeli conflict.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Military Front:  </P> <P> An American soldier became the 53rd serviceman to die during Operation Desert  Shield when the tractor-trailer truck he was driving overturned during a  routine water supply mission.  </P> <P> In London, the Observer newspaper said Iraq appears to be redrawing the  Iraqi-Kuwaiti border by putting up a barbed-wire fence around the northern part  of Kuwait, a sign that Saddam Hussein may be planning a partial withdrawal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Western Europeans Still in Iraq and Kuwait:  </P> <P> Britain: 1,200  </P> <P> France: less than 300  </P> <P> Ireland: 140  </P> <P> Netherlands: 133  </P> <P> Italy: 25  </P> <P> Denmark: 15  </P> <P> Germany: 15  </P> <P> Portugal: 8  </P> <P> Switzerland: 7  </P> <P> Norway: 6  </P> <P> Spain: 6  </P> <P> Sweden: 5  </P> <P> Finland: 4  </P></p>

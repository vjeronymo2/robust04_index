			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 5, IRNA -- Various sectors of the  people from Tehran and the provinces here today commemorated the  anniversary of the 15th of Khordad (June 5, 1963), the bloody  uprising and the beginning of the Islamic revolution.    The uprising which led to Imam Khomeyni's arrest by the  monarchial regime and subsequent exile, was the first spark of  the Islamic revolution, which 15 years later in February 1979,  illuminated Iran and the world with millions lining the streets  to welcome home their triumphant leader.    Since then, the teeming millions have continued their  faithful presence on the scenes, setting up new records at his  funeral service in 1989, and yesterday, as in past years, they  once again made their presence felt at his mausoleum.    Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad 'Ali Ansari, head of the  headquarters for organizing the fifth anniversary of Imam  Khomeyni's departure, said the people of Iran who, by their  presence on the scene from the outset, had carried out the  directives of the father of the Islamic revolution will continue  in the same path by obeying the orders of the leader of the  Islamic republic Ayatollah Khamene'i.    In today's ceremonies that was observed in an atmosphere  permeated with grief and sorrow the mourners of Imam Khomeyni,  beating their chests, wept on the anniversary of the great loss,  and also praised the martyrs of the June 5, 1963 uprising for  their valor and courage in confronting the oppressive monarchy.    Praising the solid presence on the scene on the occasion of  the anniversary of the June 5 uprising, Hojjat Ansari recalled  the infamous storming of the Feizieh theological school by  soldiers of the Shah who killed and wounded many students, and  analyzed the crucial role of Imam Khomeyni from the beginning of  the Islamic movement.    He said at a time when the so-called white revolution of the  Shah was being bandied about with demagogical slogans, Imam  Khomeyni, fully knowledgeable about the plots being hatched  entered the political scene and proved to the Muslims of Iran  and the world that the Pahalvi monarchy was against Islam.    On behalf of Imam Khomeyni's son Hojjat ol-Eslam Ahmad  Khomeyni, Ansari thanked the people as well as foreign guests in  Iran for their participation in Saturday's ceremonies.    The anniversary of the June 5 uprising was also observed in  other towns and cities throughout the Islamic republic Sunday.    In Ilam Province and its border towns and cities, people  marked the uprising and remembered the role of the imam.    In Sari, Mazendaran Province, head of the Culture and  Islamic  Guidance Commission of the Majles Hojjat ol-Eslam Reza Taqavi  said at the Babol theological school that June 5 was a turning  point in the history of the Islamic revolution.    In Isfahan, member of the Association of Theological  Teachers  of Qom, said many elements were responsible for the victory of  the Islamic revolution, but the most important of them was the  leadership of the Imam and his efforts to captivate the people's  hearts.    Similar ceremonies were observed in all towns and cities  throughout the country at which ulema and other personalities  spoke.</p>

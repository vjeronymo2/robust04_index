He  pointed out that the Foreign Ministry is considering the NATO  ultimatum as "illegitimate and contradicting with the U.N.  decisions".    Lavrov told parliamentarians that "the Russian Federation's  representative in the U.N. Security Council had received  instructions to object to air strike on Sarajevo". He said that  at Russia's request a commission of the U.N. security Council  was set up to investigate the explosion at the marketplace in  the Muslim part of Sarajevo on February 5.    Lavrov said the special presidential envoy of the Russian  Federation Vitaly Churkin reported from the former Yugoslavia  that "the agreements reached by the Serbs and the Muslims a few  days ago are being implemented, heavy equipment is being  transferred to the U.N. forces or pulled out of Sarajaevo".  Even limited air strikes of the NATO aviation on positions of  the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo would mean qualitative changes  in the military political situation not only in Bosnia, but all  over Europe, a high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax on  Wednesday.    In his words, such air strikes "would put an end to the plan  of peaceful settlement of the Bosnian conflict, because they  would embitter the Bosnian Serbs and make the Muslims even more  irreconcilable".    The diplomat also said that the special envoy of the Russian  president, deputy foreign minister Vitaliy Churkin, who is in  the Balkans now, left Zagreb for Belgrade on Wednesday to meet  again with the Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. The  diplomat did not go into details about this unplanned trip  noting only that it was urged by "supreme interests".</p>

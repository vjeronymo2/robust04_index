			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Sunset &amp; Vine posts a 25% reduction Sunset &amp; Vine, the independent television production company involved in sponsored sports programmes, reported a 25 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 330,000 to Pounds 246,000 in the six months to end-December. Turnover in the period was up 46 per cent to Pounds 1.88m (Pounds 1.29m) but the outcome was affected by an increase in the cost of sales to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 768,000) and greater administrative expenses of Pounds 497,000 (Pounds 335,000). There was also a decline in interest receivable to Pounds 108,000 (Pounds 145,000). The group moved up to the main market from the USM in September, and an extraordinary charge of Pounds 77,000 (nil) represents the expenses incurred. The interim dividend is unchanged at 1.5p and comes from earnings per share of 3p (4.3p).</p>

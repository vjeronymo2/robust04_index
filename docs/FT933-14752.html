			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Technology: Drivers on the button - Almost any car could dispense with its gear lever It would probably never occur to most drivers of non-automatic cars that changing gear might be possible by pressing a button instead of having to reach down and move a lever. Imagine being able to operate the gears as easily as turning on the lights or windscreen wipers. The technology is there, but has yet to be put into widely available form. However, a start is being made by Prodrive, the UK motor sport engineering concern which prepares some of the world's leading race and rally cars. It has developed a road-going version of the press-button, semi-automatic gearboxes hitherto confined to leading grand prix teams and the world championship rally cars Prodrive operates for Subaru of Japan. Although the system will make its off-track debut this year in one of Italy's best-known makes of exotic sports car, it could be added to almost any car's conventional manual gearbox. 'There is no reason why it should not be cheaper than, say, power steering,' according to David Lapworth, managing director of Prodrive's engineering services subsidiary. In its current road-going form, the system is being tested by Prodrive in a Subaru Legacy saloon. No modifications have been made to the car's conventional gearbox. Instead, the normal clutch operating cylinder is supplemented by an actuating mechanism whose operation is managed by an electronic control unit (Ecu) and an air tank and small compressors located remotely - in the Legacy's case, in the boot. The actuating unit is about a foot long. Along with the valve system it is small enough to have been installed in the Legacy's transmission tunnel without modifying the bodywork. The driver selects gears by touching buttons on the upper and lower surfaces of the steering wheel. Specific buttons do not select specific gears. Instead, any button on the upper surface takes the car up a gear, and any button on the lower surface takes it down. Repeated pressing takes the car sequentially up or down through the gears. The clever bit lies in what the Ecu does on receiving a gear change instruction - relayed electronically - from the driver. For upshifts, the driver simply presses the button without either lifting his foot from the accelerator pedal or operating the clutch pedal. The Ecu throttles back the engine at the same time as ordering the compressor to operate the clutch. The resultant upshift is as fast as any achievable manually by a Nigel Mansell or Ayrton Senna. The principles are the same for downshifts - except that the Ecu prevents the engine being strained through over-revving, should the driver seek to change down too early. In this event, the Ecu is capable of both 'blipping' the accelerator and delaying the clutch operation until gear and engine speeds are compatible. What are the benefits? In the area of performance motoring, gears can be changed with optimum efficiency while preserving maximum control over the car by keeping both hands on the steering wheel. Clutch wear is also minimised and manual operation of the clutch is required only when starting or stopping. Prodrive's Legacy test model retains both its clutch pedal and the conventional gear lever - a function of its close kinship to the rally cars, which can revert to manual clutch and gear changing as a competition 'fail safe'. On the back roads near Prodrive's Banbury, Oxfordshire, headquarters, it is disconcerting to have the gearshift seemingly operating itself while the driver uses the press button system. But, as Lapworth stresses, neither clutch pedal nor gear lever need be retained for non-sporting applications. Preoccupation with competition - the bulk of Prodrive's business - meant the company could not start on a road version until early last year. The development programme has three phases: First is the Legacy system, fitted as an aid to enthusiastic driving. Second is a system which selects the gears itself at the appropriate moment, depending on accelerator position - in effect a fully automatic gearbox. This system also allows drive-away from rest. This second phase still involves adding equipment to existing transmissions, and would be applicable in areas such as cheaply converting ordinary cars for use by the disabled. But the logical final phase, points out Lapworth, would be for car makers to manufacture gearboxes specially designed for the system. The unit cost of these could be much lower than for conventional manual gearboxes because - thanks to the 'autoshift' ensuring that gear and engine speeds are compatible during changes - synchromesh and all its complicated cones and other components could be dispensed with. There are rival transmissions, however, which their proponents might argue are a still more sophisticated answer to the average motorist's needs. Chief among these is the continuously variable transmission (CVT). Already fitted to some Ford, Fiat, Volvo, Rover Group and even Subaru models, the CVT provides an infinitely variable number of gear ratios by means of steel drive belts working around expandable pullers. The theory of the CVT is that the driver depresses the accelerator according to whether he wants maximum or mild acceleration, or a high or low cruising speed. The engine spins up to the required number of revolutions needed to meet these needs with maximum efficiency - and the transmission accelerates the car in the most efficient way to 'catch up' with the accelerator setting, and subsequently cruises the vehicle at the most economical engine speed. The proclaimed advantage of the CVT is that it allows the engine to operate in its most efficient revolution band. The driver has to do no more than engage forward or reverse; the energy-sapping losses caused by the hydraulic torque converter of a conventional automatic transmission - which typically produced fuel consumption 15 per cent worse than a manual as well as weakening performance - are largely absent. Lapworth acknowledges that the CVT is a desirable transmission. However, it costs more than a conventional automatic transmission - and still has more inherent energy losses than a manual transmission. 'It will become a better proposition if and when a car maker produces both a CVT and an engine which are specifically designed to work together,' says Lapworth. 'But if you had to rate them in cold energy efficiency terms, on a scale of one to 10, the manual would be at 10, fully developed CVT engine/transmission at nine and the existing conventional automatic at six or seven. 'And if you accept that you don't need synchromesh in our type of transmission, you could pack in six or seven gear ratios in the same space, so that for most drivers you would have something very close to a CVT anyway.' Although the autoshift is currently Prodrive's only serious road car project, Lapworth says there is much potential for applying motor sport-based technology on a wider front - 'cars are full of things hydraulic and mechanical which could be better controlled', he says.</p>

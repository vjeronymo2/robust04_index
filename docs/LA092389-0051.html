			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUTTERING PROJECT  </P> <P> Jeff Kaye's Sept. 14 article, "Networks to Simulcast Animated Anti-Drug Show,"  showed insensitivity to stutterers. Kaye characterized the theme of the show as  "J-J-J-Just Say No, Folks," even though no reference to Porky Pig was made at  the press conference that announced the special. Is this an example of accurate  reporting?  </P> <P> Stutterers don't deserve to be made fun of by movies or television -- or the  Los Angeles Times.  </P> <P> IRA ZIMMERMAN  </P> <P> National Stuttering Project  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

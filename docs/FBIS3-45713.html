			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Munich, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Top Chinese  legislator Qiao Shi said here today that he has full confidence  in China's reform.    Qiao, chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC)  Standing Committee, made the statement in talks with Wilhelm  Vorndran, president of Bavaria state's parliament.    Qiao noted that 1994 is an important year for China's  deepening reform, during which many important measures will be  taken.    Qiao stressed, "The aim of our reform is to accelerate the  building of the country's market economic system and quicken the  pace for economic construction."    "We also need to strengthen cooperation with the  international community, and in adopting measures for the reform  we are seeking conformity with the international community," he  added.    He said that tariffs readjustment will help restore China's  status as a signatory party to the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (GATT).    Qiao told Vorndran, "We are still facing an arduous task of  drawing up laws and we will initially set up a frame structure  for the legal system to meet the requirements of the market  economy within the five-year term of the Eighth National  People's Congress."    In this regard, China should draw on the experiences of  foreign countries, he added.    Qiao said he is very pleased to see the sound growth of  bilateral ties, including the relationship between China and the  state of Bavaria.    He expressed the hope that such relationship will not only  involve economic cooperation, but also cooperation in culture,  education, science and technology.    Prior to the talks, Vorndran hosted a welcoming ceremony for  Qiao and his party.    Bavaria state and China have enjoyed very good ties,  Vorndran  said, adding that Qiao's visit will give a new impetus to such  ties.    He said he is glad that China will set up a  consulate-general  in Munich which, he said, is an indication of the developing  relations between Bavaria state and China.    Qiao noted that as early as the 1980s, Bavaria state  established a partnership with Shandong Province in east China,  and its cooperation with other parts of China has also been  fruitful.    "It is certain that my visit to Bavaria will produce  abundant  results," he added.    Earlier today, Qiao and his party visited BMW Limited  Company, the 11th largest industrial enterprise in Germany.</p>

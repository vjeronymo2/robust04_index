			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Just five months ago, an 800-pound pig named Grunt was in a ton of trouble  because his owners had moved away from Rolling Hills Estates and left him  behind.  </P> <P> County officials feared he might have to be put to death because it seemed  unlikely that anyone would be willing to adopt a hunk of pork that size. But  once his plight became known, the county received more than 400 offers in less  than a week.  </P> <P> The homeless swine not only found a new life on a Santa Paula ranch in Ventura  County, but a female recently moved in with him.  </P> <P> "Her name's Pugsy," said Rhonda Osborn, whose husband Ozzie adopted Grunt. "She  doesn't have a nose hardly. She's really cute, and even lazier than he is. She  kept going up to Grunt's pen and hanging out. So we finally put her in there."  </P> <P> No doubt Grunt admired her slim figure. Pugsy weighs just 300 pounds.  </P> <P> However, their relationship is a bit more complicated than the surface serenity  on the 193-acre ranch would suggest. (Isn't that always the case?)  </P> <P> Pugsy is pregnant -- but not by Grunt.  </P> <P> She was in a family way when she found Grunt. He doesn't seem to mind.  </P> <P> "They have a great time," said Osborn. "They just sleep all day."  </P> <P> Apparently, many DeLorean drivers fear that there's only so much life in their  8-year-old jalopy, and give it even less exercise than Grunt gets.  </P> <P> DeLorean World Magazine, published in Sun Valley, recently reminded owners  that, in order to avoid fuel system problems, they should remember to run the  engine for at least 10 minutes "each month."  </P> <P> It was a proud weekend for Allan Abbott and Alec Brooks of Pasadena.  </P> <P> The craft that they built set a world speed record on water in Adrian, Mich.  </P> <P> In fact, it went almost 19 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Not exactly approaching the speed of sound, true, but then their Flying Fish  hydrofoil was human-powered.  </P> <P> Pedaling like a bicyclist, pilot Bobby Livingston of Atlanta zoomed across the  100-meter course on Lake Adrian at an average speed of 18.76 m.p.h., or 16.23  knots, to win the 15th annual International Human Powered Speed Championship.  </P> <P> Alas, he didn't quite pedal fast enough to win the $25,000 prize offered by  DuPont Co. for the first single-rider water craft to top an average speed of 23  m.p.h.  </P> <P> But he did move faster than the average rush-hour commuter on the Pasadena  Freeway.  </P> <P> Corralling canine entertainment stars for a fund-raising benefit for less  fortunate four-legged critters isn't so easy.  </P> <P> Or so publicist Howard Bragman discovered when he tried to line up some celeb  pooches for an Amanda Foundation fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion Oct. 14.  The foundation rescues stray dogs and cats from city shelters and places them  in homes.  </P> <P> Bragman heard a lot of Hollywood-type excuses from such can't-shows as Lassie  ("they said she was off on a promotional tour for the new television series"),  Rin Tin Tin ("in Canada on a publicity tour") and Spuds McKenzie ("his PR man  explained he's had too much exposure in L.A. lately").  </P> <P> However, Bragman was able to land Beasley, who gave the sensitive portrayal of  the slobbering Hooch in "Turner and Hooch," Mike (from "Down and Out in Beverly  Hills") and Dreyfuss (from television's "Empty Nest").  </P> <P> Dreyfuss the dog, incidentally, is not to be confused with Richard Dreyfuss the  human who co-starred with Mike the dog in "Down and Out in Beverly Hills."  </P> <P> A bit more than 103 years ago, The Times published 70 answers to questions  about Los Angeles "oftenest put by prospective comers."  </P> <P> Here's answer No. 40:  </P> <P> "The inhabitants do not wear arsenals, nor shoot at the drop of a handkerchief.  The Apaches are 800 miles away. . . . "  </P></p>

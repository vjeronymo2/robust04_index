			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Swiss reject tighter code on animal protection SWISS voters yesterday rejected a proposal that would have tightened further already stiff regulations on animal experiments, Reuter reports from Zurich. Officials in Berne said a majority of Switzerland's cantons (regions) had voted against the proposal, which had sparked one of the country's most emotive referendum campaigns. To succeed, the proposal needed the backing of at least half of Switzerland's 26 cantons, regardless of the popular vote. The drugs industry and government had said the proposal would cut life-saving research and jobs. Interpharma, an organisation representing Switzerland's world-leading pharmaceutical and chemical industry, said the result was a 'clear indication of the commitment of the Swiss people to continue as a leading country in medical and biomedical research'. A spokesman for the Swiss Animal Protection League, which launched the referendum, expressed disappointment over the result but said the League would go on looking for ways to improve animal protection.</p>

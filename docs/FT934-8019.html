			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Thai oil and gas group well ahead PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP), the Thai oil and gas company partially privatised this year, announced sharply higher consolidated net profits for the third quarter of 1993 to Bt142.6m (Dollars 5.6m), compared with Bt10.3m in the same period last year, writes Victor Mallet. For nine months to end-September, group net profits rose to Bt259.4m from Bt82.3m. The company says profits are expected to continue rising as production increases from the Bongkot offshore gas field, which opened in July. PTTEP is Thailand's only listed exploration and production company and is still 85 per cent owned by the Petroleum Authority of Thailand.</p>

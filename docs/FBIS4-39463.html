			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Bulantsev] </F>   [Text] New Delhi June 7 TASS -- "Our delegation's visit to  India was successful. In the course of our negotiations with  the Indian leaders we were able to work out a mechanism for  achieving mutual understanding between our young Russia and the  renovated India, and for achieving mutually acceptable  decisions," Vice- Chairman of the Russian Government Yuriy Yarov  told a press conference here today. He is currently visiting  the Indian capital at the head of a high-ranking Russian  delegation.    "As a result of the scrupulous work done by the two sides,"  Yarov said, "we were able to draw up a package of documents that  are expected to be concluded at the end of Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao's official visit to Russia at the end of June and  the beginning of July. The agreements are practically ready to  be signed and they cover many areas of cooperation, including  the protection of investments, development of tourism, business  partnership in science and technology, implementation of joint  ecological projects and measures to protect the environment, etc.    Yarov did not dodge some sharp questions put to him by  journalists about the Russo-Indian relations. He stated, for  instance, that the results of bilateral contacts over the past  two years were unsatisfactory. "At the present time, the trade  turnover between our two countries amounts to 25 billion rupees  (about 782 million U.S. dollars), which is absolutely  insufficient. This sum has to be at least doubled by the end of  the year," Yarov stated.    Asked about the irregularity of Russian deliveries of spare  parts to the Indian armed forces, the head of the Russian  delegation said that this was a "feeble link" in Russo-Indian  cooperation.    However, on the whole, Yarov sounded quite optimistic. Asked  by ITAR-TASS to sum up the results of the Russian delegation's  work in India, he said: "We were able to do a lot during this  brief period, but there is still much work ahead. On the whole,  we are satisfied with our results. Our relations with India  were made more dynamic. We want to be friends with India and we  shall do our best to promote this friendship."    Yarov said that agreement was reached on Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin's visit to India, which will take place in the near  future.    Yarov will be received by Indian Prime Minister Narasimha  Rao  today, after which the Russian delegation will leave for home.</p>

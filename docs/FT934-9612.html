			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Names warned of higher losses MORE THAN a thousand Names whose assets support syndicates managed by Sturge Holdings, one of the largest Lloyd's agencies, have been told by members' agents that their losses for 1990 and 1991 could be worse than feared. Names on syndicate 428, a small marine syndicate that specialised in reinsurance business, face losses of between Pounds 29.4m and Pounds 45.6m - between 100 per cent and 155 per cent of the syndicate's capacity (the amount of premiums it can accept) for the 1990 year. Losses were estimated at Pounds 27.1m (92 per cent of capacity) in June when managers published their 1990 result. Syndicate accounts were left open because of continuing uncertainty over claims. Mr Johnston Brown, group secretary at Sturge Holdings, said the Sturge managing agency had not altered its own estimates of losses for syndicate 428 given to Names in June. He said members' agents were taking a more 'pessimistic' view. Syndicate 428 had been affected by large numbers of smaller 'attritional' claims, many of which had not emerged until late last year. The syndicate's performance could be the subject of a 'loss review' by Lloyd's, Mr Brown said. Lloyd's examines the circumstances surrounding syndicate losses when these exceed 100 per cent of capacity. So far several loss reviews have been conducted. A total of 1,358 Names on syndicate 428 face a further loss of between Pounds 23.98m and Pounds 31.98m (75 per cent to 100 per cent of capacity) for 1991. Names on the larger marine syndicate 209 also face 1991 losses, estimated at Pounds 49.58m to Pounds 52.88m (75 per cent to 80 per cent of capacity). Trust plan scrapped, Page 23</p>

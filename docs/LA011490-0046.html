			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUMP CLEANUP TO TAKE YEARS BUT IT'S ALREADY A SUCCESS  </P> <P> In the annals of toxic waste, a barren 40 stories of trash in southeast  Monterey Park ranks as something of a success story.  </P> <P> The defunct Operating Industries Inc. dump, once considered one of the worst  toxic hazards in the state and nation, cleaned up its act enough to win  favorable comment in a 1988 federal study. These days, some people, with a  straight face, even mention the possibility of someday growing plants on the  site, sandwiched between Monterey Park and Montebello.  </P> <P> However, the dump's toxic legacy runs deep. And its recovery is many decades  away.  </P> <P> Officials of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency now are presenting their  latest solution: Top the 190-acre site with an elaborate plastic cover that  could cost $61 million to $116 million.  </P> <P> Combined with an extensive system to extract and treat potentially harmful  gases generated by the landfill, the cover would be designed to minimize  malodorous emissions from the 30 million cubic yards of trash.  </P> <P> The idea is part of a proposal that could cost as much as $300 million and  could go on for the next 45 to 60 years, officials said. The EPA's master  formula for treating the dump will not even be complete until 1993, said  Shelley Sussman, a federal environmental engineer.  </P> <P> "This site won't look . . . pristine," Brian Ullensvang, Sussman's engineer  colleague, told an audience of three dozen residents at Schurr High School in  Montebello recently.  </P> <P> He turned to face a mural that covered the school cafeteria wall, with a  colorful panoply of birds of paradise, jonquils, gladiolus in the foreground  and verdant mountains behind. "It won't look like this."  </P> <P> Later Sussman added: "Realistically, it will not be a golf course and it will  not be a park. But that does not imply it is not safe to be in the  neighborhood."  </P> <P> Today, six years after closure of the controversial landfill and four years  after the site's inclusion on the federal Superfund list, even those who were  the most vocal opponents of the dump say the situation has improved and the  acrid odors are not as strong.  </P> <P> "Many people are disappointed with the speed of the cleanup. We all would like  it to be done yesterday," said Hank Yoshitake, the long-time leader of a  Montebello homeowners group as he walked in his driveway a block from the site.  "But you walk around here now and you don't smell anything very often."  </P> <P> The dump's toxicity dates from the 1950s, when there was less fear of liquid  wastes -- and fewer regulations on dumping them. Oil companies, food companies,  aerospace industries and waste haulers disposed of a vast range of toxic  liquids, including such potentially cancer-causing substances as vinyl  chloride, trichloroethylene, benzene and toluene.  </P> <P> At least 200 million gallons of hazardous waste were dumped by as many as 4,000  companies, federal officials say.  </P> <P> Significant progress has been made on the most obvious problems. And now, when  concerned citizens assemble to hear the latest federal briefing, as they did 10  days ago in Montebello, they tend to look back almost nostalgically.  </P> <P> During a break in the meeting at the school, Leland T. Saito recalled that as a  boy 25 years ago, he and his buddies would go down into the bottom of the dump,  then little more than a deep garbage pit near their homes, and shoot birds with  slingshots.  </P> <P> Today, he pointed out, the dump is a substantial hillock, rising 150 to 250  feet above the landscape and appearing as a natural land formation to  passers-by on the Pomona Freeway. It is so large now, residents say, that  television reception has been fouled because the dump's height blocks signals  to the area behind it.  </P> <P> Montebello Councilman William Molinari walked up and told the story of a man  who lit his fireplace in the early 1980s. The entire hearth, he said, became  ringed with a Bunsen burner-like flame because methane gas had apparently  filtered underground from the dump and seeped into his house.  </P> <P> Samuel Kiang joined the two men, and described house hunting in Montebello  around the same time. He said the stench assaulted his nose when he rolled down  his car window. He decided to settle a good distance away in Monterey Park.  </P> <P> The men recalled a series of Monterey Park and Montebello City Council meetings  that were marked by one angry debate after another during the 1970s and early  1980s.  </P> <P> Despite possible $1,000-a-day fines and heavy criticism from state health and  air quality officials, dump operators in 1981 defied orders to temporarily shut  down.  </P> <P> EPA Regional Administrator Daniel McGovern has called it "one of the most  complex and contaminated sites in the nation." The site is one of four in Los  Angeles County and among 91 in the state on the federal government's list of  more than 1,200 Superfund locations. Last year, in a federal court agreement,  more than 110 companies agreed to pay $65 million for the dump's cleanup. The  companies included some of the nation's biggest: Chevron, Atlantic Richfield,  Exxon USA, McDonnell Douglas, Union Oil, Occidental Petroleum and Times Mirror  Co., parent firm of the Los Angeles Times.  </P> <P> Since the agreement, cleanup efforts have intensified and about 60 of the firms  formed a company called CURE, Coalition Undertaking Remedial Efforts, to  oversee their end of the bargain. As many as 75 people work at the landfill  daily. Another 15 to 20 off-site employees, including federal environmental  officials in San Francisco, work full time on the cleanup effort.  </P> <P> In an unusual attempt to find other companies that contributed to the  contamination, the EPA last year ran newspaper ads headlined "Ever Worked  Here?" Listing 51 companies, the ad solicited information from workers and  former workers of firms that might have dumped hazardous wastes at the  landfill.  </P> <P> Under federal law, companies that dump hazardous waste, even if they did so  legally, still bear responsibility for helping to remedy problems related to  the wastes.  </P> <P> The landfill has even played a role in elections. Gov. George Deukmejian, under  attack for generous political contributions from landfill companies,  acknowledged in 1986 that the dump's owners, Mike Harabedian, Jack Arakelian  and Tim Agajanian had been "friends of mine for a long, long time." But, the  governor said, he had never discussed landfill operations with them.  </P> <P> Today, trailers at the dump are the headquarters of cleanup crews composed of  consultants, contractors and federal officials. In September, the EPA set up  sampling stations at the dump and at locations in the surrounding neighborhood,  where air is regularly tested for contaminants. Significant results will not be  available until next year  </P> <P> Also in September, workers began to dig 25 wells around the dump's perimeter  and in selected sites in the surrounding neighborhood to test for possible  ground water contamination.  </P> <P> All the activity does little to reassure Monterey Park resident Phyllis Rabins,  however. "I'm frustrated still. Some nights I still wake up, coughing at 2, 3,  4 o'clock in the morning. The methane gas is so strong I have a hard time  breathing. My quarrel has always been that they are not moving fast enough."  </P> <P> But Hank Yoshitake said the neighborhoods surrounding the dump are beginning to  turn around.  </P> <P> "People are fixing up their homes now. Houses are selling for $300,000,  $350,000. Kids are playing outdoors again. There are areas where it's still  going to smell, particularly when they drill to do tests. But if you're sick  and the doctor has to give you a shot, it's going to hurt," he said.  </P> <P> "From the day the dump closed in 1984, we knew it would get better. For a long  time this dump had been giving us headaches, figuratively and literally. But  that's all over with now, thank God."  </P> <P> </P> <P> HISTORY OF THE OII DUMP  </P> <P> Pre-1948: Sand and gravel mined from site.  </P> <P> 1948: Landfill opened by city of Monterey Park and private firm for garbage  disposal.  </P> <P> 1952: Taken over by Operating Industries Inc.  </P> <P> 1954: Regional water board allows dumping of hazardous liquid wastes.  </P> <P> 1974: Pomona Freeway splits 190-acre landfill.  </P> <P> 1975: Montebello subdivision tract built next to dump.  </P> <P> 1978: Enforcement agencies note intense odor problems.  </P> <P> 1979: Getty Synthetic Fuels begins extracting gas and selling it to Southern  California Gas Co.  </P> <P> 1981: County health officials cite dump for lacking plan to control potentially  hazardous gases.  </P> <P> 1982: Liquids leak into Montebello neighborhood.  </P> <P> 1983: Heavy rains bring mudslides; state health officials begin study of nearby  residents; air quality officials record high levels of vinyl chloride in  Montebello; more liquids found leaking into Montebello.  </P> <P> 1984: Underground fire; dump closes after state announces OII is the 16th  worst-hazardous site among 97 in state.  </P> <P> 1986: Getty ceases gas processing; OII selected as federal Superfund site.  </P> <P> 1989: More than 110 companies agree to pay $65 million in cleanup costs.  </P></p>

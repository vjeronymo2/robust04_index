			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Rail unions to vote on Thursday Tube strike LEADERS of rail unions are to decide today whether to hold a 24-hour strike on London Underground on Thursday after considering a six-point proposal by managers to end the dispute over 1,005 job cuts. The one-day strike might go ahead even if leaders of the RMT and TSSA rail unions agree a settlement and decide not to continue with a series of one-day strikes they called after balloting on London Underground's cuts. The RMT, which represents 12,000 of the workers balloted on action, said the Thursday strike could be called off today if a settlement was agreed. The executives of the two unions would have to decide whether to do so. London Underground said it had made a six-point proposal in talks at the Acas conciliation service on Friday. It said it believed the proposal addressed many of the concerns of the unions and hoped that a settlement could be reached. The corporation has warned staff that if they take part in industrial action, they face being suspended and may be dismissed. It wants to prevent a prolonged campaign of industrial disruption this summer. The job cuts, including the loss of about 300 posts in ticket offices, were planned by London Underground after it sustained an unexpected Pounds 92m loss. It says that automation of ticket sales has made the cuts possible. The unions have argued that they might endanger passengers as well as cutting earnings in the long term. Among the cuts would be 30 jobs involving the daily cleaning of dust trays under escalators on the network. The rail unions are also in the middle of a dispute with British Rail over the annual pay round. The RMT has decided to hold a ballot on industrial action among 60,000 members in British Rail after rejecting a 7 per cent pay offer.</p>

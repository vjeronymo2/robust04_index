			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Furthermore, as in Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review; Rice From Thailand (56 FR 68, January 2, 1991) (Final), we determine that the second criterion of 771B, limited value added, is also satisfied in this review. Respondent would have us consider the difference between paddy rice and milled rice in terms of price as the focus in determining value added. The statute, however, requires us to consider the processing operation in determining value added for the purposes of 771B. Notably, the bulk of value added in terms of price reflects supply and demand conditions in the world market for rice and includes selling costs and profits in addition to the cost of milling or processing operations. In this case, the processing operations consist primarily of parboiling the paddy rice, removing the rice hulls, and removing the bran layer. The resulting processed agricultural product, milled rice, while not identical to the raw agricultural product, paddy rice, is essentially unchanged in composition. As a result, the Department determines that the processing operation itself adds only limited value to the raw commodity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, we determine that subsidies found to be provided to paddy rice shall be deemed to be provided with respect to the manufacture, production, or exportation of milled rice in accordance with section 771B of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 7:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent claims that in order to receive interest-free loans under the MOI's loan program, millers are required by the Government to buy paddy from farmers at prices approximately ten percent above prevailing market prices. Therefore, respondent argues that the gross benefit from the loans should be reduced by ten percent, as authorized under section 771(6) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purpose of determining the net subsidy, section 771(6) of the Act allows the administering authority to subtract from the gross subsidy the amount of ``(A) any application fee, deposit, or similar payment paid in order to qualify for, or to receive, the benefit of the subsidy, (B) any loss in the value of the subsidy resulting from the deferred receipt, if the deferral is mandated by Government order, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of merchandise to the United States specifically intended to offset the subsidy received.'' Our practice is to interpret this section of the Act very narrowly, and we determine that the requirement to buy paddy at prices above prevailing market prices is not an offset provided for under section 771(6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

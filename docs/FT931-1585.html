			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Threat grows to school testing A SECOND union representing headteachers has warned the government that boycotts by teachers could stop the compulsory testing of 14-year-olds in England and Wales this summer. The Secondary Heads Association, regarded by ministers as one of the most responsible of the teaching unions, is advising members not to do anything that could undermine action by the two largest unions. The NASUWT, the second-largest teachers' union, has launched a boycott of all testing and assessment connected with the national curriculum. The largest teaching union, the NUT, will ballot its members in May over a boycott of the English test for 14-year-olds. The association's warning comes just a week after the other union representing heads, the National Association of Head Teachers, said heads would find it impossible to continue with the tests if boycotts took place. It said that there was limited scope to compel heads who cancelled the tests to stage them. An emergency conference of Secondary Heads Association branch conveners yesterday heard the anger of heads and deputies over the tests planned for this summer, especially those in English and technology. The conveners deplored the lack of pilot trials for the new tests and the administrative muddles over the syllabuses for them.</p>

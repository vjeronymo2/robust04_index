			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, June 29 (XINHUA) -- A trade union  leader said here today that the workers' congress system should  be adhered to, even as the state-owned enterprises are shifting  their operational mechanisms in line with international  practices.    Yang Xingfu, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of  Trade Unions (ACFTU), said that workers and staff members, as  "masters of the state and state-owned enterprises", are in  charge of state property, and shoulder the responsibility of  preserving its value.    Yang was speaking at a national conference on trade unions  held in this capital of north China's Hebei Province.    "Unlike workers in Western countries," he said, "Chinese  workers can participate in the democratic management of  state-owned enterprises through the workers' congress system  with Chinese characteristics."    Yang said that workers' congresses have been set up in  nearly  all the state-owned enterprises, and the system is upheld in  China's Constitution, the Enterprise Law, the Trade Union Law  and the Corporate Law.    Yang claimed that the economic efficiency of state  enterprises can be raised through workers' democratic  involvement.    Of millions of proposals from the workers' congresses across  the country every year, more than half concern production and  business operations, according to the vice-chairman.    However, he lamented, "in some areas, the democratic  involvement mechanism has not been beefed up in line with the  autonomy rights gained by enterprises."    And the incidents of workers' rights being infringed upon by  collectively owned enterprises are increasing, he noted.    He urged all parties to explore new ways to strengthen the  role of the workers' congresses in the transitional period.    He stressed that state-owned enterprises, state-funded  corporations and limited-liability companies funded by the state  should improve their workers' congresses in accordance with the  new Corporation Law and the Enterprise Law.    The rights of the congresses should include participation in  the policy-making process concerning the development, production  and operation of the enterprises. The congresses should have  the right to examine salaries and bonuses, check safety measures  and working conditions, and supervise the business operations of  top executives.    Corporations should have workers' representatives on their  boards of directors and boards of supervisors, Yang said.    Workers should account for one third of the members of the  boards of directors and one third to half of the members of the  boards of supervisors, he said.    Yang said foreign-funded enterprises should also make it a  rule to let workers take part in their management, by  establishing trade unions or labor-management committees.</p>

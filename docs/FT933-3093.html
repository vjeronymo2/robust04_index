			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries sharply lower as report prompts jitters US TREASURY bonds fell sharply yesterday as news of a greater-than-expected rise in consumer prices, coupled with a modest increase in retail sales, undermined the market's confidence. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 1 3/8 at 103 27/32 , yielding 5.970 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was  5/32 lower at 99 15/16 , to yield 3.891 per cent. The expectation of low inflation which has fuelled the bond market's recent rally was rattled by both of the day's main economic reports. The August consumer price index, which showed retail prices rising by 0.3 per cent last month, compared unfavourably with analysts' forecasts of a 0.1 per cent increase. The larger-than-expected figure was especially disappointing after a 0.6 per cent decline in August producer prices. Concern over inflation was reinforced by 0.2 per cent growth in August retail sales, which suggested that economic conditions were more robust than analysts had thought. Retail sales had been expected to show a slight decline. However, the figure's value as an indicator of economic growth - and stronger inflationary pressure - was undercut by an upward revision of the estimated increase in July retail sales, to 0.3 per cent. Although this suggested that the pace of consumption was actually moderating, it had little impact on the negative sentiment dominating the market. CANADIAN government bonds fell steeply on the back of the downturn for US Treasuries, a weak Canadian dollar and political jitters ahead of the October 25 federal elections. Prices were under further pressure as traders prepared for today's auction of some CDollars 1.8bn of 7 1/2 per cent 10-year bonds. GERMAN government bonds outperformed most of their European counterparts, although they erased most of their early gains to end little changed. The December bund futures contract ended at 98.41, up 0.02 point from Monday. Bunds are expected to continue range-trading until the release of August M3 money supply numbers, expected early next week. Most analysts are calling for an annualised M3 rate of around 8 per cent, up from 7.4 per cent in July due to heavy currency intervention in August. However, a higher number is widely discounted and unlikely to cause a strong market reaction, traders say. UK GILTS dropped in sympathy with US Treasuries, the five-year paper falling about  1/2 point and long-dated bonds down nearly a point. But dealers reported little cash market activity, with many investors sidelined before today's inflation data. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, expects the underlying inflation rate to have risen 0.2 per cent on the month and 2.9 per cent on the year. A number at or above 3 per cent could disappoint the market, he said. Also subduing sentiment is the Bank of England's imminent auction announcement, expected Friday. Most traders expect the government to start issuing bonds due 2004, which will become a 10-year benchmark next year. FRENCH government bonds ended some  1/8 point lower. Many traders are looking to Thursday's Bank of France repo allocation for a possible cut in the 6.75 per cent repo rate. They are also waiting for Friday's second-quarter gross domestic product data. Until then, prices are expected to stay locked in a narrow trading range. JAPANESE bonds eased in Tokyo but recouped some of their losses in London trading, where the December JGB future rose 0.12 point to 111.12. Fears that the long-awaited cut in the 2 1/2 per cent official discount rate has been delayed caused short-term rates to rise. The three-month certificate of deposit rate rose to 2.67 per cent from 2.60 per cent on Monday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Issa Kostoyev, chairman of the Federation </F> Council Committee for Constitutional Legislation and  Judicial-Legal Questions, by Yuriy Zvyagin, Yevgeniy Skukin;  date, place not given: "The Innocent Could Suffer"]    [Text] Issa Kostoyev, chairman of the Federation Council  Committee for Constitutional Legislation and Judicial-Legal  Questions, comments on the Russian Federation president's Edict  "On Urgent Measures To Protect the Population Against  Gangsterism and Other Manifestations of Organized Crime." He  has devoted 28 years to investigative work as an ordinary  investigator, criminal prosecutor, investigator for especially  important cases, deputy chief of an investigation unit, and then  chief of the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office  department for the investigation of crimes against the person.  He has the solving of many of the most dangerous crimes to his  credit, including, incidentally, the Chikatilo [serial killer]  case.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Issa Magometovich, a heated debate has  broken out over the president's edict. What do you make of this  document?    [Kostoyev] If we are talking about the tasks the president  has set the law-enforcement organs, they are the same as those  stated in the five similar edicts of recent years. A long, long  time ago someone should have said: Bring the culprits to book.  Why have you boys not been implementing these edicts?    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What have been the specific  consequences of the failure to implement the previous edicts?    [Kostoyev] Well, for example, MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] staff are now working for private firms, banks, and  commercial offices. And their new bosses are completely  satisfied with them. They do not take just anyone but will  hire, in particular, anyone who has had to fight organized crime  during his service and anyone who has lawful credentials and the  right to carry a gun. In the morning this man turns up at his  own section: He says that he is going to meet one of his agents,  but he actually goes to a private office. Incidentally, a  militiaman must always be on call, even in his spare time.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Be that as it may, the draft Federation  Council decree prepared by your committee instructs the general  prosecutor to ensure rigorous observance of citizens' rights and  freedoms and to establish strict monitoring of the conduct of  investigations. Do you therefore see a possibility of using the  edict within the framework of existing legislation?    [Kostoyev] Under one article of the Constitution the  president's edicts must be implemented on the territory of the  entire Russian state, under another an edict must conform with  the constitution and federal laws. All we can do as jurists is  try to put up a barrier against anything that contradicts the  law, so that innocent people do not suffer. Edict No. 1226  contradicts the constitution, the Code of Criminal Procedure,  the Law on Enterprises and Entrepreneurial Activity, the Law on  Banks and Banking Activity, and the Law on Operational  Investigation Activity. I think that, like the previous edicts,  it will not be fully implemented and will not have the desired  results.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] How does this edict relate to the  federal program to intensify the fight against crime for the  years 1994-1995?    [Kostoyev] Very strangely. The 24 May edict instructs the  Russian Federation Justice Ministry, jointly with other  interested federal executive branch bodies, to prepare within  two months proposals on, I stress, making appropriate amendments  to Russian Federation legislative acts, making provision for  giving the militia the right to search buildings and premises of  enterprises of all forms of ownership, etc. But what has  emerged is a direct-action edict based on such wishes instead of  legislative acts.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Nonetheless, what is needed to stop  crime?    [Kostoyev] The aforementioned federal program was  recommended by deputies, invited specialists, and  representatives of ministries and departments at the April  parliamentary hearings on this subject. It was decided to give  priority consideration to laws aimed at protecting the  constitutional rights of citizens, witnesses, and people  administering justice -- in short, aimed at taking appropriate  counteraction against organized crime. I think that precise  compliance with the federal program and the quickest possible  adoption of laws, many of which have passed their first or  second reading, are what will put up a real barrier to crime.</p>

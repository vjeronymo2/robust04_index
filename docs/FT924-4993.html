			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Christmas Food and Drink: Rich, comforting winter fare - Cookery GOOSENECK pudding is, I believe, a recipe worth waiting for. Which is just as well, since I mentioned in September that I planned to make one with the neck of my Michelmas goose, and some of you have been waiting patiently to hear how it is done. Gooseneck pudding is not, as one reader hypothesised, a goose giblet variation on steak and kidney pudding - although that idea might be worth trying. It is a pudding as in black or white pudding or boudin: in other words, a sausage, the neck skin of the bird being used as a casing. In First Catch Your Peacock, Bobby Freeman refers to Welsh cooks making gooseneck puddings filled with goose blood, oatmeal and onions. These were boiled, sliced when cold, and fried in bacon fat. In Goosefat and Garlic, Jeanne Strang describes the far richer confections of south-western France where goosenecks may be stuffed with foie gras, truffles, wild mushrooms, wine-soaked currants and pistachios, and cooked in a deep pot of simmering goose fat. I was thinking along more English lines - a stuffing meatier than the first sort but more modest than the second. And I planned to 'roste hym and serve hym forth,' much as English court cooks did in the 15th century. For pudding purposes, the neck of a goose is best chopped off as close as possible to the body and close to the beak, as this gives maximum length of skin. A busy butcher is apt to cut the neck only as far as it has been plucked. But if you buy a long-legged bird - ie, one with its head and feet on - you can pluck the full length of the neck and head (white ruffs of feathers usually are left on purely for aesthetic reasons) and cut it accordingly. Even if the neck skin is long the pudding, when parcelled up with stuffing, is unglamorous. Mine, admittedly on the short side, looked more like haggis than the stylish Cumberland coil I had expected. Clearly, a swan-neck pudding would make a more elegant dish - and I dare say it did in royal circles once upon a time. But taste is the main thing, and I suspect that the rich savour of the skin and the liver of a goose is hard to beat. Start skinning gooseneck at the wide (body) end. Ease the skin away gently from the flesh of the neck and then roll it back on itself, turning it inside out as you do so - like peeling off a glove. This is much easier done than said. Quite a lot of fat may cling to the skin at the wide end. Scrape and shave it away carefully with a knife. Remove the two tubes that run the full length of the neck: an elastic, hollow, worm-like windpipe and a whopping gullet (I realise now how easy force-feeding must be when fattening geese for foie gras). Wash them under a cold running tap, using a bottle brush or teapot spout cleaner to 'chimney sweep' them if you want to add them to the stock pot. Use strong eyebrow tweezers or small pliers to pull out any quill stubble that might remain in the neck skin. Sprinkle the skin inside and out with coarse salt and set it aside while preparing the filling. For my first gooseneck pudding, I used some of the meat picked from the gooseneck itself (only scraps that were pulled away easily - enough remained on the bone to produce a small quantity of light stock); the heart and gizzard of the bird; two or three rashers of green, streaky bacon; and some very lean belly of pork, well seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and thyme plus a tablespoon of brandy for good measure. As many people may prefer to save most of the giblets to make gravy to serve with roast goose, my second attempt at gooseneck pudding used only the liver, pork meats and seasonings. Not quite such a rich and unusual mixture, but very good indeed nonetheless. Either way, you need a total of 1 lb of meats (prepared weight) for the stuffing. Chop the goose liver into little nuggets by hand. Mince or process the rest to chop them more finely. Wipe moisture and salt from the goose skin and, while it is inside out, sew it up along the wide end. Turn it right side out so the stitches are hidden neatly inside. Spoon in as much of the stuffing as the skin will hold comfortably (but do not pack it too tightly: the pudding will swell a little in cooking) and sew up the second end. Leftover stuffing, if any, can be packed into an earthenware dish, covered with foil and baked like a pate. If time is short or you have no neck skin, the entire mixture could be cooked en terrine, of course, but that strikes me as missing the point. The little ritual of preparing the pudding, albeit time-consuming, is half the fun and the distinctive rich character of the pudding depends on cooking it in its goose skin casing. Rest the pudding in the fridge overnight to allow flavours to blend and infuse. (You could probably freeze it, but I have not tried this). To cook, check that the skin is perfectly dry. Rub it with a modicum of salt and lay the pudding on a rack in a roasting tin. Roast for 50-60 minutes at 350-375'F/180'-190'C (gas mark 4-5), turning the pudding once or twice so that the skin becomes crisp and well coloured all over. If serving it hot, let the cooked pudding stand for around five minutes before slicing. Carving is a joy - this is the stage when the cook's labours are rewarded. The slices fall firm and neat from the knife. Suddenly, the pudding looks professional and the contrasting textures enticing: a crisp ring of skin encircling the solid, meaty centre studded with nuggets of liver and fat. Best of all is the eating. Gooseneck pudding makes an excellent first course, and a very pretty one if slices of the cold meat are laid on individual plates garnished with a few frizzy endive or chicory leaves. I served mine with pickled prunes and toasted ciabatta. Gooseneck pudding is even more delicious served hot. We tucked into it greedily, served on a bed of potato puree, sauced with juices from the roasting tin and accompanied by slices of lightly fried Cox's apple, mounds of toastily fried bread crumbs seasoned with salt and crushed fennel seeds, and clumps of peppery watercress. This is rich and comforting food, and it would be more substantial still if the potato were replaced by a puree of lentils, marrowfat peas or butter beans. That is how I imagine it might be served to stoke one up for the rigours of tramping out to midnight mass on a freezing Christmas eve. The only improvement I can think of is to heed the words of Patience Gray in Honey From a Weed: 'The best prelude to goose is oysters.' Half a dozen apiece should do nicely.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Ministers may hasten end of gas monopoly GOVERNMENT consultations on the gas market end this week amid expectations that ministers will move faster to end the British Gas monopoly on domestic supplies than the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has recommended. There is, however, considerably less pressure for the government to accept the commission's recommendation that the company be broken up. The Department of Trade and Industry is likely to rule on the commission's report later this year, although a delay is possible because of the political sensitivities of a decision and the illness during the summer of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Ministers are determined that any adverse consequences of their decisions, particularly on prices, do not coincide with the next general election due by April 1997. The report recommended a timetable for ending the dominance of British Gas, starting with divestment by the company by March 1997 of its supply arm and abolition of its monopoly in the domestic market by 2002. However, the DTI has always placed greater priority on introducing more competition than breaking British Gas up. Ofgas, the industry regulator, which once championed splitting up the company, also believes that competition is more important. The problem for the government with adopting the commission's approach is that it may lead to price rises around the time of the next election. The commission said the cost of a break-up, put by British Gas at Pounds 870m over 10 years, should be met by consumers. Introducing more competition, however, opens up the possibility of price cuts to offset the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. Independent gas companies said last week that bills would fall by 8 per cent as a result of ending British Gas's monopoly. However, British Gas said many of its customers would face higher prices. The government may therefore be tempted to put off full liberalisation until the election. One possibility is that ministers will opt for 1998, when households will also for the first time be able to choose from which company to buy their electricity supplies.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Greta Steyn] </F>   [Text] Cape Town -- Government was already in a debt trap  in terms of the strict definition of the concept, Reserve Bank  Deputy Governor Jaap Meijer said yesterday.    He told Parliament's joint committee on finance SA [South  Africa] could still find a way out of the trap. "It does not  matter that much that we have hit our head against the wall of  the bunker, as it is still easy to get out. There are ways out  of the bunker."    Meijer and Bank Governor Chris Stals appeared before the  committee to explain the Bank's monetary policy stance. They  fielded questions on the Bank's conservative position on the  deficit, IMF conditionality and the reasons behind SA's large  capital outflows.    Stals signalled that a reduction in interest rates was not  on  the card in the short term, as SA's balance of payments was  still too fragile. Capital outflows, low savings and high  fiscal deficits had recently placed upward pressure on interest  rates, he said.    He expressed concern over the "very high" level of the  deficit, saying it would start crowding out the private sector  when the economic upswing gained momentum. This was in response  to a question from ANC MP Max Sisulu, who questioned the  "magical" 6 percent of GDP level for the deficit.    Stals was encouraged by the reduction in the deficit from  6.9  percent of GDP to 6.6 percent, but repeatedly warned that a  borrowing requirement of 6 percent would become progressively  difficult to finance once the private sector's demand for credit  picked up.    SA was borrowing to pay interest rather than to invest.  Government's interest bill was already 5.5 percent of GDP. But  sluggish economic conditions had added to government's  difficulties by putting a lid on revenue growth -- a situation  that would change.    On interest rates, he hoped there would be capital inflows  in  the second half, so that it would "not be necessary to raise  Bank rate". If SA experienced a capital inflow over the next six  months, it could lead to a "slight decline" in interest rates.    Stals also disclosed the extent to which SA's foreign  exchange reserves were threatened in the run-up to the election  and said the situation remained worrisome.    The Bank had arranged R11bn [rand] in shortterm foreign  credit lines, of which R8.5bn had been used in the first week  of May. SA's reserves were battered right up to the  inauguration of President Nelson Mandela.    However, there had been a subsequent improvement which had  enabled the Bank to cut its foreign exchange "overdrafts" to  about R6.5bn. He hoped the borrowings could be reduced to zero  by year-end.    Commenting on the financial rand, he said deposits of about  R4bn in the money market would have to be run down before the  Bank could consider recommending the scrapping of the dual  currency system. Other prerequisites were a narrowing in the  discount between the finrand and the commercial rand to 10  percent from the present level of about 23 percent, and a  substantial increase in the country's reserves.    The finrand deposits had already fallen, from about R8bn 18  months ago, and the discount had narrowed. He put the finrand  pool -- non-resident investment mainly in SA gilts and equities  -- at about $15bn.</p>

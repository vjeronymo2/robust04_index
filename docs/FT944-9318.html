			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Arts: Simple ideas come off best on the Fringe - Theatre If you want to see a really sparkling first play, pick Nick Gross's Peaches at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs. This has authenticity written all over it, yet the touch remains light throughout. The background is the numerical explosion of Britain's student population. Here are semi-educated young people at university, at first just messing about, drinking and dancing, then ultimately looking for jobs and a place in the real world. The university is Leeds, suitably far north, but still only a few hours drive from the seemingly magnetic pull of London. Driving plays a large part in the piece. The scenes where students drive and talk in cars up and down the M1 are beautifully done - almost to the point where you think that Peaches might have been made for television. Yet this is the trick: the play is so well written and so well done that it works on stage. In a succession of short scenes Grosso uses surtitles to indicate the location and the characters. Far from being trendy, the men are frankly reactionary. 'Peaches' is the word for women which, as one of the men says, is what the male students think about all the time, even if they occasionally talk about something else. They regret that so many of the women have turned gay, vegetarian or vegan. One of the women may even have found a job on Channel 4. Grosso writes without bias or preaching. He simply shows the students as they are. Some education has clearly rubbed off on them, though they try to conceal it. For instance: 'Do you know Raymond Chandler?' 'You mean the one who played for Fulham?' Or 'what's that book about the future - 1973? They had to change the title.' The men live in the past. There are also social nuances even among students trying to be egalitarian. Watch the embarrassment when Frank (Ben Chaplin) goes off to a girl friend's country house and finds he doesn't like the country. The play has a pedigree. It comes from the Studio of the Royal National Theatre, where they do intensive rehearsing and experimenting. The work pays off. Not a line nor a movement in this piece is lost. Under James Macdonald's direction and David Roger's design, there is marvellous attention detail. Note the cows outside the country house and, better still, the pigeons outside the window of a London flat. Yet it cannot be quite true that the National Theatre can make a good production out of almost anything. The writing has to be there in the first place. The only trouble with Peaches, which perhaps owes something to the influence of television, is that it lasts for only 75 minutes. Beware of plays that try to be too clever. One good idea is usually enough. At the Gate Theatre Maria Irene Fornes has an excellent idea at the start of The Danube: it could be sustained throughout, but distractions get in the way. The piece plays around with foreign language teaching. It is Budapest 1938. On the board is Unit One: Basic sentences. A visiting American talks to some locals in that slow stilted style that goes with learning a new language. 'Are you a Hungarian?' 'No, I am an American.' The conversation moves on: 'What do you eat for breakfast, as a rule?' There are some promising developments. A Hungarian father (Simeon Andrews) muses that some say that German is the language of the future, but that others say that it is English. The father has a marked preference for German cigarettes. Since this is close to the eve of the second world war, all that is appropriately ominous. Then The Danube shoots off all over the place. As a programme note puts it: the play 'soon departs from chronologically (sic) realism'. The notes also refer to nuclear fall-out from north eastern Kazakstan, pollution in Budapest and the London suburb of Putney, as well as the alleged misdeeds of the mining company, RTZ. Certainly the characters begin to suffer from respiratory and other diseases, yet nothing is very clear. Meanwhile, the play continues in its language lesson format, eventually reaching Unit 14. This is a useful dramatic venture in itself. It shows how the language of the text books is not always so different from the language people speak if they lack individual self-expression. It could be further explored. Ms Fornes throws away the chance by trying to do too much. One other slight cavil. Short plays seem to be catching. The Danube lasts only 80 minutes. There is, however, one joy. Hannah Miles makes her first professional appearance as the Hungarian daughter. Previously she had played Hedda Gabler at the Guildhall school. She has great poise, and is clearly an actress to be watched. Direction is by Nancy Meckler for the Shared Experience Theatre. At the Cockpit, John Constable's Tulip Futures suffers even more than The Danube from seeking to be too clever. It may sound a good idea to write a play about the financial market in Dutch tulips in the 17th century measured against the market for art: it is a piece about relative values. Yet good ideas are not always inherently dramatic: it helps to have characters, feeling and wit. Still, the piece is redeemed by a splendid last five minutes when the characters in the original portraits speak from their now elevated position in the National Gallery. Abigail Morris directs and there is a remarkably ambitious set, perhaps too big for this theatre, designed by Tom Piper.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Leading Article: From Yukon to Yucatan PRESIDENT GEORGE Bush gave vent to some uncharacteristically ringing phrases when he announced yesterday the completion of 14 months of negotiations for a North American Free Trade Agreement. It was, he said, 'a good day for America, a good day for North America'. It was also, he might have added, not a bad day for his own re-election campaign. At next week's Republican party convention in Houston, he will be able to boast an achievement in two areas - foreign and economic policy - where he has lately been found wanting. And for the rest of the campaign, while the US debate on whether to ratify the accord gets underway, he has a trade policy stick with which he hopes to beat his Democratic opponents. But was yesterday really a good day for the three signatory states - the US, Canada and Mexico - and, more particularly, for those other countries and companies that invest in and export to them? The answer in both cases can only be a qualified yes. The agreement will undoubtedly achieve some important political and economic aims: it should stimulate trade between the parties, help Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari lock in his liberal economic reforms, and assist his country on the road to prosperity - all objectives understandably close to Washington's heart. In time, if other Latin American countries are allowed to join, the accord could help to spread market-oriented policies throughout the American hemisphere. Restrictive rules Yet in some areas, it is questionable to what extent the agreement encourages free, as opposed to managed, trade. Highly restrictive rules of origin on car parts and textiles could tie the hands of foreign investors in Mexico and place other exporters at a significant disadvantage. Its protectionist arrangements for agriculture extend the iniquitous US sugar regime and may worsen the position of impoverished Caribbean sugar exporters. Within the free trade area, it sets high environmental standards that may erode some aspects of Mexico's comparative advantage. These concerns are not large enough to render the overall agreement objectionable - at least, not as it stands. Indeed, the proposed Nafta probably sets up fewer impediments to external investment and trade than have been imposed by the European Community. Congressional pressure What is worrying is that the accord unveiled yesterday may not stand - that Congressional Democrats will overturn the 'fast-track' authority that was granted to the Bush administration for approval (or rejection) of the package as a whole, and then seek to inject more protectionist regulations on the environment and on the labour market. That is certainly what Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, threatened to do last month. If he finds himself being forced to accede to Congressional pressure to subvert Nafta's liberal intentions, President Bush would be well-advised to call the whole exercise off. That would be a pity. A genuine free trade agreement would bring great benefit both to North America and the rest of the world - provided, that is, it does not come to be seen as an alternative, rather than a complement, to multilateral free trade. While the deal may not be inherently incompatible either with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or with the sagging Uruguay round, there is a danger that it will become a political substitute for the latter - and thus postpone further the chances of completing it. A Uruguay round agreement is still the most important trade prize which President Bush could offer his electorate. For the US, trade with other regions of the world is still more important than trade within North America. Little more than a quarter of US exports go to Mexico and Canada - a proportion that is likely to change only slowly once the agreement comes into force in 1994. This means that the US still has a real incentive to complete a multilateral accord bringing services and farm trade under the Gatt - more, perhaps, than the EC, whose member states do 74 per cent of their trade with one another. Will the US and Europe respond, or will they find themselves seduced by the siren voices of inward-looking, managed trade?</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Burkhard Bondel under the rubric "Machine </F> Building and New Materials. Special. High-Tech": "Machines of  the Future. Closer Man-Machine Contact. German Manufacturers for  Years Developed Machines As Their Customers Stood By Watching.  Now for the First Time the Units Are Operator-Friendly and No  Longer Shut Out the Know-How of Skilled Operators"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] On the broader front research  institutes and companies have set about long overdue radical  changes:     -  Intuitive input and programming by means of  graphic symbols, voice and gestures. Aspect GmbH in Norderstedt  has developed voice recognition for a limited number of machine  commands. Siemens researchers recently introduced an image  processing system in which a hand gesture is sufficient to  control the machine interfaced to the system.    -  Process control  and monitoring. From now on operators will be able to be  informed directly on the machine's screen about every situation,  invoke auxiliary functions and intervene in the  computer-controlled process. Grundig Gildemeister Automation  GmbH in Hannover has integrated into the control system the  operator's manual, that up to now has been on paper, so that the  operator can consult it at the scene of the action.    -  Planning.  Via internetworking with production planning, the machine  operator already in the near future will be able to decide  totally on his own when and in which order he wants to make  individual parts.     Not that the industry's mighty have  accelerated the progress of the change, but former outsiders  like Oberhachinger Autocon GmbH, R&amp;D Steurung und  Datentechnik  [Control and Data Systems Technology] GmbH in  Mochengladbach, R. &amp; S. Keller GmbH in Wuppertal, Augustin  &amp;  Partner GmbH in Neubrandenburg, and IG Metall [Industrial Trade  Union of Metal Workers].    It starts with seemingly trivial changes that reactivate the  operator's senses: For instance, in R. &amp; S. Keller's control  system the screen and operator's panel are to be moved so that  the operator always has the monitor and machining process  simultaneously in his field of view. Or that the operator, in  spite of complete enclosing, can listen into the machines in  order to monitor acoustically the machining process. Sensors and  headphones suited for this purpose have been developed at the  Kassel cluster college's Institute for Ergonomics.    Then the operator's closer contact with the machine brings  about, with revolutionary simple programming and control  systems, a decisive jump in productivity--for instance, via  Keller's GKE/CAM or Autocon's Autowop M, that the operator can  operate in the shop, as well as control systems that enable  intervention in automatic operations.    Up to now programs for machines have had to be written with  cryptic- appearing commands like G0, L100 or M30. Because each  control system producer has its own dialect, the mastery of a  single type of control system really represents a truly  Herculean task. "It is almost impossible for a single operator  to be able to operate several machines at the same time,"  complains Herbert Schulz, head of the Institute for  Manufacturing Technology and Machine Tools at Darmstadt  Technical College. The consequence: Programs are being created  in production planning and not by the operator in the shop. "New  factory models with team work and fractal structures are  accordingly from the outset doomed to failure," Werner Bauer,  manager of the European Federation of Fractal Enterprises GmbH  in Nuremburg, says knowingly.    However, Keller and Autocon make do without a program code  line: For instance, if the operator wants to turn a taper by  means of GKE/CAM, he chooses the proper graphic symbol from a  menu and enters the coordinates and machine data. Before the  machine sets to work, the operator can view the part in three  dimensions on the screen and run through a simulation of the  machining process. Outstanding point: So-called postprocessors  knit together from these entries conventional programs for over  30 different types of control systems, and these programs can  then be run online or from diskette. Keller, thinking ahead, is  adding one other thing to its new CNCplus control system that is  now coming on the market. Not just that programming on the  machine is a cinch here, similar to GKE/CAM software. CNCplus  weds the computer control system to two handwheels that are  normally used to control conventional machines and are not  present on any current CNC machine. A lathe or milling machine  so equipped can now for the first time in the world be run  manually, semiautomatically and fully automatically. Other  manufacturers are slowly following suit: Grundig Gildmeister  Automation has now introduced a control system that upgrades  conventional machines to semiautomatic CNC machines.    The integration, now beginning, of complex computer  technology and manual operation is urgently necessary. In German  companies CNC machines live in the shadows with a meager  15-percent share of the machine inventory. This is the  operators' revenge: "Because one could hardly operate CNC  machines, operators stuck with conventional machines," Autocon  head Hannes W. Politsch says knowingly. This, says the former  vice president of Deckel, "is a considerable productivity  disadvantage for the base of Germany vis-a-vis Japan and the  U.S."    User-friendly machines will gain in importance even more in  the future. Further improved performance is to be expected in  every type of machine, with high-speed machining, greater  precision and the use of new materials. On paper anyway. Autocon  head Politsch says, urging haste, "If a revolution does not  occur now at the man-machine interface, the advantages will be  theoretical."</p>

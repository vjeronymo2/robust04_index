			<p>BFN     [Text] In connection with the issue of DPRK's (North  Korea) suspected development of nuclear weapons, the chances are  improving for the ROK and the DPRK to hold talks. For example,  there have been new moves for holding a South-North summit. In  this connection, the government has indicated that it "welcomes"  as stated by Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa such developments.  Considering that future developments are still unpredictable,  however, the government plans to keep a wary eye on new  developments, such as how North Korea may respond to the  International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) call for inspections  of its nuclear facilities. At the same time, the government  plans to maintain closer ties with the United States and the ROK.    The ROK and the DPRK have reached an agreement on holding a  South-North summit, with ROK President Kim Yong-sam accepting  DPRK President Kim Il-song's call for holding a summit meeting.  Regarding this summit, a senior official at the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs [MOFA] said: "That is excellent. Originally,  President Kim Yong-sam had called for such a summit ever since  his inauguration, but it never came about because North Korea  kept insisting on holding talks with the United States only."  This is how MOFA views the situation. Regarding the flexible  stance the DPRK is now showing, MOFA has analyzed that with  former U.S. President Jimmy Carter acting practically as a  special envoy in a series of high-level talks with President Kim  Il-song, "North Korea's dignity has been preserved," (according  to a government source).    The government believes that should a South-North summit  meeting be held, the ROK Government is expected to press North  Korea to live up to the joint declaration on the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, which came into effect  in February 1992 when the two countries were pursuing a policy  of mutual harmony. Talks are also expected to be held regarding  wiping out mutual distrust.    In some quarters of the Japanese Government, however, there  are deep-rooted feelings of distrust toward North Korea since  the latter has been noted to shift between hardline and flexible  stances in the past. Therefore, some government officials are  not necessarily optimistic about future developments. Rather,  they plan to remain calm and keep a wary eye on how the  situation may develop.    The government places particular emphasis on the outcome of  working-level meetings to be held as early as 20 June for  working out details in preparation for the third round of the  U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. This is because the government  expects that aside from negotiations conducted by Carter at the  private level, there will be a considerable exchange of opinions  on such issues as nuclear inspections at the government level.    Moreover, the government is concerned about views that the  United States may decide not to pursue questioning North Korea  on its suspected nuclear developments in the past. A top  government official has said: "The U.S. Government has explained  to us that it does not intend to drop past issues at all."  Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada has said: "Past  issues cannot be dropped." The government thus plans to confirm  U.S. intentions during talks with the U.S. Government.</p>

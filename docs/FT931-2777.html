			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: BAe chief urges aerospace strategy A STRONG plea for a 'national strategy' for the aerospace industry was made yesterday by Mr Dick Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace. He told the Commons trade and industry committee that aerospace was one of the few activities in which Britain was genuinely still a world leader. But it was clear that France, and more recently Germany, had developed strategic plans for their aerospace sectors. 'Unless we address the issue of investment in a much more specific way we are in danger of losing the ground, or part of the ground, that we are currently occupying,' he said. He welcomed what he called a 'gratifying' improvement in the level of dialogue between the industry and government. But Mr Evans said the industry was relying on the Department of Trade and Industry to take the lead in setting out a strategy. With other companies, BAe is awaiting a response from ministers to proposals for a national strategic technology acquisition plan, drawn up by a mixed working group of civil servants and industry representatives. Proposals include measures to fund work on different areas of aircraft technology, including helicopters, and related activities such as air traffic management. Last year's US-European agreement limiting direct support for development of new civil aircraft had halved the amount of launch aid that could be given. Mr Evans described the accord as 'an extremely good agreement for the Americans and an extremely poor agreement for the Europeans.' Mr Mike Turner, BAe's regional aircraft chief, said the company would look to the government to help with investment on the next regional jet and turboprop aircraft projects.</p>

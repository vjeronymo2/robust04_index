For this purpose, under the private security or payment test (including under &sect;1.141&hyph;7), the issuer may use the yield on the refunded issue to present value payments and security from arrangements that were not entered into in contemplation of the refunding issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Qualified bonds <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Generally, whether bonds issued as part of a refunding issue are qualified bonds (other than bonds issued under sections 144(a) or 1394) is determined exclusively on the basis of the use of the proceeds of the refunding issue, determined in the same manner as under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In addition, section 147(d) is applied as of the issue date of the prior issue. A refunding issue meets the requirements of section 147(b) if the refunded issue met these requirements and the weighted average maturity of the refunding bonds is not greater than the remaining weighted average maturity of the refunded bonds.

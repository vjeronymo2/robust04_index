			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Articles by Juan Carlos Rivera and Alberto Salazar] </F>   [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] In recent months, as a result  of our country's sanatorium policy, consideration has been given  to reincorporating AIDS patients into society. This raises the  possibility of outpatient treatment with ongoing medical  checkups and monitoring of the virus and illustrates our respect  for patients as individuals and the protection of their human  rights. Reincorporation, which will be only for those who have  accepted their condition as HIV-positive, are sufficiently  mature and psychologically well balanced, and display  responsible social and sexual conduct, will not mean the  disappearance of the sanatoriums. The move is part of Cuba's  advancing and consistent program for battling AIDS. [passage  omitted]  <H5>  Box, p 8] </H5>   The AIDS sanatorium in Pinar del Rio has 44 patients,  although there were 96 HIV-positives in the provinces in October  1993. The rest are in Los Cocos in Havana. There have been 20  deaths since the disease emerged. The sanatorium has 48  employees. Its director, Dr. Angel Fulladosa, says that surveys  in college preparatory schools in the province reveal that  youngsters know quite a bit about AIDS. Most, however, answer  yes to this question: "And if you feel like it, do you have  sexual relations even if you know that you are HIV-positive?"  [passage omitted]    Moreover, drugstores are no longer carrying condoms, and  youngsters are not in the habit of using them anyway. The high  risk groups in the province are girls 14 to 18 and boys 16 to  20. There are other risk groups as well, though. There is  systematic monitoring in the province, and 700,000 tests have  been done since studies began in 1986. This enables us to say  that there must not be more than a few undetected cases in the  province.    The young people here can receive visits from their  relatives  or go home for several days, and this helps their morale  greatly. Some sanatoriums have also started gradually releasing  patients back into their neighborhoods. They have good relations  here with the locals, and friendships are developing. All of  this is helping to make the youngsters less aggressive. Proper,  humanitarian treatment improves social relations, Fulladosa  says, as we tour the sanatorium's new facilities under  construction: soon to be completed bungalows among the trees  with a maximum capacity of 150.    While many governments and health-care systems around the  world seem powerless or at least bewildered by the geometric  spread of AIDS, Cuba still has an extremely low rate of HIV  infection, under 0.01. The containment of the epidemic on our  island is often attributed, especially overseas, to the  sanatorium policy implemented by local medical authorities. As a  result, many will be surprised to hear that Cuba now proposes to  provide outpatient treatment to every HIV-positive person who  wants to and can receive it.    This decision does not, however, imply that the country is  even partially giving up on an institution that has proven its  effectiveness in containing the disease. BOHEMIA asked Dr.  Reinaldo Gil Suarez, who runs the National Program Against AIDS,  and Dr. Mariluz Rodriguez Alvarez, the director of the National  Health Education Center, to comment on this subject.    "The National Program Against AIDS is 10 years old now,"  explains Gil Suarez. "The first measures were taken in 1983.  They consisted of a system of surveillance against opportunistic  diseases and a ban on imports of blood products from countries  in which AIDS was present. This averted major problems for us.  Because we ourselves produced these drugs, with the necessary  rigor and care, the number of people who got infected this way  can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and concurrently the  nation developed its own technology for manufacturing these  items.    "In late 1985 and early 1986 we looked into the possibility  of doing testing with diagnostic kits in spite of their high  price on the market. We also decided to fight AIDS as just  another sexually transmitted disease, by identifying risk  groups, undertaking major prevention and education efforts among  the population, and preventing infection through the perinatal  route.    "Another element in the strategy was the establishment of  sanatoriums for those who tested HIV-positive. HIV-positives  were thus surrounded by various kinds of specialists to prevent  fatal complications, and the chances of the virus spreading  among the healthy population were considerably lessened.    "As you can see, the system of sanatoriums is one of the  pillars of our success in battling AIDS, but it is not the only  one."    At this point in the conversation Dr. Rodriguez Alvarez  remarked that outpatient treatment is not altogether new,  inasmuch as several HIV-positive persons have been receiving it  for five years, either full-time or taking periodic leaves in  the company of medical personnel or a relative who makes sure  that their behavior on the street is above reproach.    "Outpatient treatment," the director of the National Health  Education Center adds, "represents a higher stage in the  development of the program and should in no way be related to  the financial limitations facing the country. We have been and  will be unstinting with resources in battling the disease, and  the proof of this is that those who avail themselves of this  arrangement will continue to receive medication absolutely free  of charge and a special diet that meets all protein and calorie  requirements.    "Now then," Dr. Suarez Gil says, retaking the floor, "not  all  sanatorium patients will automatically be reincorporated into  society. Each sanatorium has commissions that decide which  patients are responsible enough about their own health and that  of the community. There is enough background information for a  correct decision in each case, because we are familiar with the  earlier lives of these persons, their work and social history,  their ethical values, the families they came from, and,  something very important, their behavior inside the sanatorium,  how they are reconciling themselves to the disease, etc.    "In addition to the principle of selectivity, there is also  the principle of choice. No patient will be forced to accept  outpatient treatment even if the medical commission decides that  he can. Only those who deserve and want it can receive it. We  even anticipate offering them the chance to keep on living in  the sanatorium and to study or work on the outside.    "They are also guaranteed ongoing specialized medical care,  whether at the sanatorium, through family physicians (who have  been appropriately trained in this connection), in provincial  hospitals, or at the Pedro Kouri Institute of Tropical  Medicine," Gil Suarez notes.    "As we see things," Dr. Rodriguez Alvarez remarks,  "reincorporating HIV-positive people into their families and  into society at large will reinforce the prevention and  education work that we physicians are doing in various ways. The  message will be most effective among young people, who represent  the highest risk group, because it will be conveyed by people  their own age who dress the same, have the same general tastes,  the same psychology, and ways of looking at the world...."    "The patients are displaying an admirable willingness to  cooperate in this connection. The sanatoriums have done a lot of  work with them, and we should underscore their involvement in a  prevention system that they themselves have inspired and built  in the centers in which they are patients. AIDS patients and  HIV-positives are represented on the AIDS national technical  commission, and one of them, a physician, is even the head of  the prevention section.    "I should point out that outpatient care is not granted for  a  specific period of time. The behavior of the people who can and  choose to avail themselves of this treatment will be  systematically monitored, and if they are unruly or violate,  even in a minor way, the principles on which it rests, they are  brought back into the sanatorium permanently."  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5> <H5>  Statistics on AIDS in Cuba (as of 16 December 1993) </H5>    -  Total tests conducted: 15,097,284    -  HIV-positives detected:  987 (702 males and 285 females)    -  Estimate of undetected carriers:  between 150 and 200    -  Two-hundred and thirty of the HIV carriers  have fallen ill, and 147 of them have died.    -  Sexual transmission  is most common, accounting for 98 percent of the cases.    -  The  average period for developing the disease, in other words, for  an individual to move from asymptomatic to symptomatic, is 11  years.    -  There are sanatoriums in all provinces except Las Tunas  and the Isle of Youth.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 30 (CNA) -- Jordan recently asked the  Republic of China [ROC] to cut Jordan's foreign debt based on  the spirit of the "Paris Club," of which the ROC is not a member.    Jordan asked Taipei to cut some U.S.$1 million from its debt  after Taipei agreed to cancel 75 percent of Nicaragua's  U.S.$22.84 million in loans with the island.    According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials, Jordan  is  not likely to be given the same treatment as Nicaragua. They  said that Jordan's lack of diplomatic ties with Taiwan was the  main reason which would prevent the foreign debt reduction.    Jordan received several loans from the ROC in the 1970s, but  has been unable to repay the debt as planned because of  financial difficulties.    News that Taipei agreed to cancel 75 percent of the debt  owned it by Nicaragua during ROC President Li Teng-hui's visit  to the Central American country early this month fueled a spate  of inquiries from several debtor countries for similar  treatment, the officials said.    About 30 countries owe money to the ROC.    The "Paris Club" or G10, was established in 1962 by then 10  international monetary fund member countries. It aims to unify  loan terms and accords for international debtor nations. Club  members reduce the foreign debts for nations which are plagued  with anemic foreign exchange reserves but have started economic  reforms that would secure future loan payments.</p>

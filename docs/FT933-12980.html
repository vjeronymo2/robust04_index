			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Investors shrug off Maastricht vote and gilt auction THE UK government bond market took the details of the forthcoming gilts auction and nervousness over tomorrow's Maastricht vote in its stride. Short-dated maturities held steady with the declining hopes of a further cut in base rates countered by the impact of a firm pound. Middle-dated maturities shrugged off the impending supply pressure from next week's auction. The Bank of England said it would auction Pounds 3.25bn of 7 per cent stock dated November 2001. The stock will be payable in three instalments and be free of tax to overseas residents. The new issue was trading between 18.08 and 18.10 on a when-issued basis yesterday. The size of the auction came as no surprise, but the market had predicted a maturity of 2000. There was some additional encouragement in a fall in M4, the broad measure of money. The figure came in at minus 0.2 per cent on the month against expectations of a rise of 0.5 per cent. The fall was, in fact, a reflection of high government borrowing, which has been draining cash from bank accounts. At the ultra-long end, the continuing belief in enduring low inflation saw the 8 3/4 per cent stock dated 2017 rise  7/32 to 108 17/32 with investors seizing on any weakness to buy in. SWIRLING speculation on money supply figures and views on today's interest rate signals sent German government debt prices lower yesterday. German bund futures for September traded on Liffe fell 0.16 to 96.08. Initially, a rumour swept through the market that the German M3 money supply figure, which is expected today, would come in at 7.2 per cent, far higher than the target range of 6.5 per cent. If that were the case, the inflationary pressures would push back hopes for a rate cut. The market also focused on a long interview with Mr Lothar Muller, a Bundesbank council member, who poured cold water on ideas of future rate cuts. Mr Muller has already spoken out against the practice of relaxing monetary policy without evidence of easing in the recession. Finally, the two-day reverse repo carried out on Monday at 7.15 per cent was seen as setting a floor for short-term rates. Dealers said, although the Bundesbank could have carried out the same operation with T-Bills, that would have signalled a lower floor of 7 per cent. Economists expect a tight repo of around 7.18 per cent today. This will drain money from the system following the recent intervention to support the heavy selling of D-Marks for French francs. ITALIAN government bonds were hit by a weak lira and a row brewing between the central bank and the government. The currency is suffering because of the government's desire to cut interest rates further. Mr Carlo Ciampi's government is at odds with the central bank, which says it should not. Further interest rate cuts will help the short end of the yield curve. However, political uncertainty is never encouraging for the long end, and the 10-year futures contract for September traded on Liffe slipped 0.21 to 104.44. US TREASURY prices slipped as the market digested comments by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and players started to hedge against an expected Dollars 3bn paper issue by the Tennessee Valley Authority. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/32 lower at 107 7/16 , yielding 6.550 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  5/32 , to yield 4.056 per cent. In testimony before Congress, Mr Greenspan said this year's inflation news was disappointing and added that further progress on inflation would not be easy. 'Inflation expectations, at least by some measures, appear to have tilted upward this year, possibly contributing to price pressures,' he said. His comments triggered fears that the Fed might tighten short-term rates to muffle inflation, which hurt shorter-dated maturities. There was little reaction to the unchanged June housing starts numbers. May housing starts were revised to show a rise of 4 per cent. The Federal Reserve intervened in the open market to arrange Dollars 2.5bn of customer repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 3 1/16 per cent. Fed funds ended the day at 3 per cent.</p>

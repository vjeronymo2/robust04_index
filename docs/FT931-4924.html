			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Arts: Macbeth - Theatre Dr Johnson disliked Macbeth because of the line 'Nor heav'n peep through the blanket of the dark, to cry, Hold, Hold]' Who, thought Johnson, could hear of peeping through a blanket? Now videos, lasers and scarifying electric soundtrack challenge the settled gravity of Macbeth in a bold, fresh, wayward production at the Leicester Haymarket. Julia Bardsley's heavily-cut text reduces Shakespeare's shortest play to a shade over two hours: out go the Porter, the evocations of Dunsinane and the lyrical lines on sleep; in come lasers, microphones and stroboscopic light. The nine actors rove around three sunken water tanks, two dozen chairs and a rail of coats. Bardsley's newness of insight certainly reshapes the play. The initial encounter between Macbeth and Duncan is played twice: first as 'There's no art to find the mind's construction in the body', and then as the usual 'face', a joke about body language in the video age. Soliloquies are shouted into microphones, muttered through cigarettes, or shared between characters. These cuts and alterations stress the action, a play-size model of Macbeth's 'If 'twere done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly.' Of course, Shakespeare often needs alteration. The scenes in England - largely cut here - do little more than give the actor playing Macbeth an act's rest. But this production distorts both the play and the mind's own workout in the theatre. Scourging Macbeth of its lyricism turns the action into physical event rather than verbal interplay. The witches' warnings to Macbeth are drowned in a welter of electric distortion, so first-time playgoers would have no idea what was happening. These prophecies must be clear so Macbeth's fear becomes understandable in the final scene. Other directorial waywardness includes having Lady Macbeth sleepwalk along a long line of pillows, like someone trudging through a snowdrift, rubbing her hands with cold; and having all the characters prowl over the set, colonising the stage space but dissipating the focused energies of the verse. Christopher Toulmin's lighting is the technical hero. The deep black stage is scoured by floodlights, rotating, searching out the shadows among heaps of ladder-back chairs: red light for murders, blue for night. Purple and green lasers represent the witches, who speak in three voices through one actor with a video camera. The anti-climactic chaos of the final scene finds Macbeth surrounded by chairs, raincoats and spotlights. The moral issues are dismissed as Macbeth's identity is excised. It was the radical Dr Johnson who thought the action of Macbeth too forthright to admit of individual characters. Leicester until March 20; 0533 539797</p>

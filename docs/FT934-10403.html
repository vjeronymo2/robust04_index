			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: BP Yesterday's figures from BP saw the prospect of a rights issue finally disappear below the horizon. The company's disposal programme is ahead of schedule and debt is now down to Dollars 13.1bn. Even more encouragingly, the company saw a net cash inflow before counting disposals for the first time since 1991. Much of the benefit of retrenchment also seems to be sticking to the company, at least for now. Cash inflow from operations in the first nine months was Pounds 3.4bn against Pounds 3.5bn for the whole of 1992. Next year, net cash will flow regularly from operations. That will show that the company is back on to a sustainable path, and bring closer the time for a debate on the dividend. An increase will be an important psychological signal to the market, yet it makes little sense to drain substantial cash from the company when it can usefully be spent on longer term development. Balancing the needs of the business and shareholders will be a ticklish decision for the board next spring. Given the progress made on sorting out problems, and the way in which BP has set its face against further equity funding, the company is entitled to retain much of the fruit of its labour.</p>

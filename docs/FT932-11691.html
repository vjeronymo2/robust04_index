			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar buoyed by T-Bill cut THE DOLLAR was trapped in a tight range against the D-Mark yesterday, buoyed by another indication that the Bundesbank is cutting rates but depressed by more poor news on the US economy, writes James Blitz. The dollar rose by around a pfennig in the European afternoon, peaking at DM1.5905, after the Bundesbank cut its 3-day Treasury Bill rate by 50 basis points to 7 per cent. Changes in the Treasury bill rate, which the Bundesbank uses to mop up excess money market liquidity, tend to be a lagging indicator of its monetary policy. However, yesterday's cut brought the T-Bill rate some 50 basis points below the discount rate floor of 7.50 per cent, raising speculation that the general structure of German rates could soon be lowered again. Miss Alison Cottrell, an economist at Midland Global Markets, pointed out that this was the first time the rate had ever been below the discount rate which sets the floor for all money market rates. 'Why should the Bundesbank take the T-Bills to a meaninglesly low rate unless they intend to give the message that it won't be meaningless for long ?' she asked. However, the dollar failed to make any further ground in an afternoon which saw more indications that the US economy is growing only slowly. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London, said yesterday's figure for personal consumption, showing a decline of 0.2 per cent in March against expectations of a 0.1 per cent drop, was a particularly worrying sign for the US economy. In his view, the first quarter GDP figure, which earlier this week showed annualised growth of 1.8 per cent, will be revised down on May 29. This week's figure for M2 money supply, showing a net drop of Dollars 9.4bn, also underlines that bullish US growth forecasts may need to be revised. The dollar closed in London yesterday at DM1.5880, up from a previous DM1.5815. The US currency checked its decline against the yen in Friday's Tokyo trading, following the conclusion of the G7 finance ministers meeting in Washington. The dollar had weakened to around Y111.25 in Tokyo as dealers took the view that there was no commitment in the G7 communique to halt the yen's recent rise. The dollar closed at Y111.2 in London. Sterling closed  3/4 of a pfennig up on the day against the D-Mark, at DM2.4925, following the change in German rates. However, with no important UK indicators due next week, the currency is unlilkely to break through the DM2.50 level in the next few days.</p>

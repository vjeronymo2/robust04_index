			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Allen hit by construction decline as profits fall PRE-TAX profits at Allen were halved from Pounds 3.21m to Pounds 1.51m in the year to March 28 as the construction industry continued to decline, undermined by high interest rates in the first half and 'political and economic uncertainty' in the second. Turnover fell to Pounds 52.2m, against Pounds 58.9m. While announcing the results, Mr Donald Greenhalgh, chairman and managing director of the group, which has interests in housebuilding, contracting, hire services and property development and investment, inveighed against pay rises for directors even when their companies have fallen into losses, long service contracts and share options. This time, Allen's six board directors shared Pounds 417,000 for basic salaries, benefits in kind, and pension contributions, against Pounds 456,000 previously. Some Pounds 440,000 is expected for this year. Further, main board directors received no performance-related bonuses (last time Pounds 135,000 was paid), though Mr Greenhalgh said directors and staff of particular companies were rewarded for meeting pre-set targets. Margins in the housebuilding and hire services sides were hit as operating profits declined 27 per cent to Pounds 1.47m and 45 per cent to Pounds 410,000 respectively. Their turnovers were more or less static at Pounds 15.9m and Pounds 7.8m respectively. Completed houses rose by 9 to 280. Mr Ken Fox, deputy managing director, said that Allen had now left the speculative development market, but that property investment was 'a steady earner'. Divisional profits tumbled to Pounds 42,000 (Pounds 150,000) on turnover of Pounds 437,000 (Pounds 1.6m). Contracting made Pounds 780,000 (Pounds 1.5m) on turnover down at Pounds 26.8m (Pounds 32.9m). After a one-off 25.9 per cent tax charge, earnings per share only declined to 5.05p (9.69p), allowing the maintained total dividend of 5p to be covered. The final is a proposed 3.35p.</p>

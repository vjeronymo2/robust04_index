Although most turned-wood vessels  are made with at least a suggestion of a bowl shape, some look like graceful  filigree while others are braided, stretched, furrowed, fluted, looped or even  tied.  </P> <P> Attorney Edward Jacobson's extraordinary collection of these turned-wood bowls  was the subject of awed reviews during its recent three-year  Smithsonian-sponsored international tour; Jacobson recently donated all the  pieces to Arizona State University at Tempe's Fine Arts Museum. Now, in  "Contemporary Masters, Current Work by Artists of the Jacobson Collection,"  more than 60 new works by 18 of the artists represented in Jacobson's group are  on display at del Mano Gallery &amp; Studio (through Oct. 27). Prices range  from about $500 to more than $10,000.  </P> <P>  del Mano Gallery &amp; Studio, 11981 San Vicente Blvd., Brentwood; (213)  476-8508.  </P> <P> no credit JUDITH SIMS  </P></p>

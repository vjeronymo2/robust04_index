			<p>BFN     [Text] Journalist Alberto Giraldo Lopez spoke with an EL  TIEMPO reporter by telephone to give an account of the  controversial conversation he had with members of the Cali  cartel.    He said it seemed "unfair to Samper, a president who won the  elections honestly, to find himself involved in such a mess."  He emphasized that "the transcript you published does not  include the part where I said that neither of the two campaigns  received money."    Giraldo explained that he had spoken to the Rodriguez  Orejuela brothers and asked them to contribute to the campaigns.  "They gave me discretionary powers," he said, adding that he  had met with Santiago Medina, treasurer of the Samper campaign,  through Eduardo Mestre. "Eduardo had no connection to the  campaign, but he is an important member of the Liberal Party,"  he said.    Giraldo added: "Two days later I spoke with Medina, and he  declined the offer, saying that the campaign was being conducted  very honestly and that there was an overseer and an ethical  prosecutor. Unfortunately, no definite decision was reached."    Giraldo said he also had breakfast with Hernan Beltz,  financial director for Pastrana's campaign, and made him the  same offer. Like Medina, Beltz consulted with the party's board  of directors, and their answer was negative. Giraldo added that  he "later spoke with Alvaro Pava, who told me he would discuss  the offer with Andres. Pava later gave me a negative answer;  both sides said no."    Giraldo Lopez said he suspects the recording was made by the  CIA or DEA, adding that he cannot understand why it was given to  Pastrana in Cali by unidentified individuals instead of to the  authorities.    Giraldo declared "his civil death. I committed civil  suicide. However, it is unfair that, due to a mistake by a man  like myself and because of an improper action by foreign  governments, they should attack Colombia's democracy and taint  the credentials of a man like Samper, who won the elections  honestly."    Alberto Giraldo Lopez sent the following message to EL  TIEMPO  director Hernando Santos:    With a great display of publicity, television and radio  newscasts and the press transcribed excerpts of a telephone  conversation I held with Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela.    People who know me know that for many years I have been a  friend of the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, who also count among  their friends many honest people with whom they discuss various  issues including politics, which, to a certain extent, affects  them. During the conversation in question, we discussed  politics, and the simple truth is the following:    I told Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela that I could  talk with the candidates' treasurers to see if it would be  possible for them to make campaign contributions in an  uncompromising manner.    In Dr. Ernesto Samper Pizano's camp I spoke with Dr.  Santiago  Medina, who refused to consider my proposal, because the  candidate himself had said that it was essential to keep  contributions honest and ordered strict internal supervision.    In Dr. Andres Pastrana Arango's camp I spoke on two  occasions  with Dr. Hernan Beltz Peralta, his campaign manager, and Dr.  Alvaro Pava Camelo, director of the Sunday elections [Domingo  Electoral]. Both of them refused the contribution with arguments  similar to those set forth by Dr. Samper's camp. Both camps  deemed the contributions unacceptable, and my efforts proved  useless.    I called the same number to inform the Rodriguez brothers of  this. They said they would respect the campaign treasurers'  position, although they were not requesting any services in  return. I responded that at any rate the parties had declined  the offer in a very courteous manner. Strangely enough, this  part of the dialogue was withheld; only the part that could harm  Colombian democracy was published.</p>

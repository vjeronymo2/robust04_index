			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Favourable tax regime Sir, Your article, 'Boost for Dublin's tax haven' (December 8), reporting the decision of the European Commission to extend the marketing deadline for Dublin's International Financial Services Centre, refers to the centre as a 'tax haven'. Such pejorative language is totally inappropriate. The rate of corporation tax on the profits of companies in the International Financial Services Centre is 10 per cent exactly, the same rate applicable to the profits of manufacturing companies in Ireland. Some 220,000 people are employed in manufacturing industry in Ireland, of whom some 90,000 are employees of foreign-owned industrial enterprises. These companies are attracted by a favourable corporation tax regime and the European Union's youngest and best educated workforce. The same features attract companies to the centre. Your correspondent should be aware that the European Commission is not in the business of approving tax havens and that its decision vindicates how the centre has evolved over the past seven years. Torlach Denihan, director, Financial Services Industry Association, 84-86 Lower Baggot Street, Dublin 2, Ireland</p>

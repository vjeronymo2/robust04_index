			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 15 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The  resignation of the government might lead to a slowing down of  the economic reforming pace. This was said over the national  television by the chairman of the National Development  Department under the Prime Minister C. Ulaan. He goes on to say  that the political hunger strike is quite an ordinary event in a  democratic society. But the demands referring to resignation of  the government at the present time when the country is entering  the decisive year of economic reforms and the government is  doing its best in order to implement the programme of action for  1994 approved by the parliament is fraught with adverse  aftermaths.    Especially at the given moment when there is becoming  transparent a tendency toward a stabilizing of macroeconomic  showings, it is ackowledged by the international financial and  economic establishments the government's fulfilling of its  obligations undertaken, are being developed the joint programmes  in the fuel and power industry and for developing the  infrastructure. The transition process in Mongolia is being  considered as an example of reforming a society.    In today's conditions a forming of a new government and  adopting of its new programme would turn out to be a useless  waste of time. The political unstableness might cause to a loss  of confidence in our country on the part of the world community.</p>

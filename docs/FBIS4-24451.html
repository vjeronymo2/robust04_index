			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ivan Tong] </F>   [Text] Escalating grievances relating to the Shanghai and  Shenzhen stock exchanges and a top-level power struggle forced  chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC),  Liu Hongru, to hand in his resignation, Beijing sources say.  Although his imminent departure has yet to be announced,  securities experts in China and overseas have already begun to  wonder whether his resignation will mean any policy changes on  mainland enterprises' domestic and overseas listings.    "The general feeling in China's securities industry is that  (Mr) Liu should take the blame for the B-share doldrums in the  two mainland stock markets, which has lasted for more than a  year," one source said. "He has been criticised by the mainland  exchange officials as having been paying too much attention to  the A-share market and has neglected the (development of the)  B-share market. Such a situation was crucial in his downfall,"  the source added.    A securities watchdog spokeswoman in Beijing refused to  comment on the strong rumours of Mr Liu's resignation. When  questioned, she said: "I don't know...this is not a question  that we would be in a position to answer".    Mr Liu seemed to favour overseas listings in the form of H-  shares, preferring this form of raising capital to cultivating a  solid infrastructure for B-share markets. The 64-year-old,  Soviet-educated economic technocrat is a former deputy governor  of the People's Bank of China and vice-minister of the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economy.    He is regarded as China's best-known banker overseas. He was  appointed the central bank's vice-governor in 1982 and has  represented China at meetings of the International Monetary  Fund. Mr Liu was appointed to the hot seat when the national  securities watchdog was set up in 1992. His appointment at that  time was read as a compromise of interests between the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economy and the central bank.    The development of the securities industry in China has long  been a power game between the two entities. Before the  setting-up of the national-securities watchdog, stock market  development was nominally under the Stock Exchange Executive  Council (SEEC) but in practice was under the supervision of  central bank. The bank played both a policy-making and an  executive role through the financial divisions of its local  branches in Shanghai and Shenzhen.    When the CSRC was formed, the State Commission for  Restructuring the Economy appeared to have in turn gained an  upper hand. But struggles went on behind the scene. "(The)  CSRC is a coveted body in China. It represents influence and  money," one local analyst said.    It is said Mr Liu will be succeeded by the 54-year-old Hong  Hu, who is presently the vice-minister of the State Commission  for Restructuring the Economy. His formal appointment will  underline the diminishing role of the central bank in the  securities industry. Swiss Bank Corporation associate director  Lawrence Ang noted that the development of the mainland  securities industry had reached a critical point, and it made Mr  Liu's departure more unusual. "His apparent preference for  H-share listings overseas, American listings in particular, plus  the recently announced measure of doubling the number of B  shares by the end of the year have been extremely  controversial," Mr Ang said.</p>

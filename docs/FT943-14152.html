			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Derivatives markets moved ahead strongly in heavy trading towards the close of official business yesterday, writes Terry Byland. Dealers said that the impetus had come from sudden demand for German bond futures, but this quickly produced demand for UK bond and equity futures. At the official close of trading, the FT-SE September future contract stood at 3,070, a premium of 23 points to the cash market, with fair value now at around 5 points. Later trading saw a further gain. The demand from continental European buyers was sparked off by the favourable response to the latest retail sales figures from the US, and from the gains in US Federal bonds which followed the announcement. In traded options, there was increased activity in the FT-SE contract on the impending expiry of the July option series volume jumped to 17,265 from just over 12,000 in the previous session and the Euro FT-SE option recorded 5,033 deals. The sector as a whole traded 51,056 contracts against 31,343 on Wednesday. Among the individual stocks, Hanson topped the actives list with 8,372 contracts. Food stocks, alerted by Tesco's bid for Wm Low, attracted attention, Tesco trading 3,167 contracts, Argyll 3,260 and Storehouse 1,509. Sainsbury, regarded as a potential rival bidder for Wm Low, traded 1,028.</p>

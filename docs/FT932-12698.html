			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Guinness silent on Red Stripe stake speculation GUINNESS, the brewing and spirits group, is, according to industry sources, negotiating to buy a majority stake in Desnoes &amp; Geddes, the Jamaican brewer of Red Stripe lager. Guinness declined to confirm the talks yesterday. 'We never comment on speculation concerning possible acquisitions,' the company said. However, Guinness has had a long and close relationship with the Jamaican company which for many years has brewed its stout under licence. Jamaican consumption has doubled over the last two years to make the country one of the top 12 markets for Guinness worldwide. Acquisition of a majority stake in the company, in which Heineken has a 14 per cent holding, would further the UK group's strategy of expanding its international brewing operations by taking control of brewers with substantial local market shares. Guinness, which first began exporting to the West Indies 176 years ago, already holds minority stakes in several of the 12 brewers which now produce its stout under licence in other Caribbean countries. Desnoes &amp; Geddes, which also produces a range of soft drinks, introduced its Red Stripe lager into the UK in the late 1970s. Brewed under licence by Charles Wells, the independent Bedford-based brewer, and marketed and distributed by HP Bulmer, it is now the number three packaged lager in the UK - behind Stella Artois and Beck's - with estimated annual sales of 100,000 barrels. Charles Wells also exports the lager to several continental European markets, including Spain and Italy.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MY BEAT : COLOR HIS SUPER BOWL EMPTY, HIS FACE BLUSH-RED  </P> <P> The vacant parking place should have tipped me off.  </P> <P> After all, I'd always heard there were was no such thing in San Francisco. But  my flight had been delayed and I was late for my assignment, so I gratefully  pulled into the spot in my rental car.  </P> <P> It was seven years ago this week, and I was in the Bay City to write a colorful  piece on the wacky inhabitants of a typical sports bar glorying in the 49ers'  first Super Bowl. Then, as this Sunday, Cincinnati was the opponent.  </P> <P> Knowing nothing of the city, I had phoned the San Francisco Examiner beforehand  and the sports department had cheerfully recommended the name of a "great  joint."  </P> <P> Despite the available parking, I walked in expecting to see Super Bowl banners  and noise-makers, giant television screens and wall-to-wall enthusiasts  uttering quotable things and performing crazy stunts.  </P> <P> Instead, as I stumbled into the darkened interior, I was able to make out the  shapes of six motionless, somewhat disheveled figures huddled over the bar,  including one man who was crying as the National Anthem played on an aged  television set. His friend assured the bartender, "Oh, don't mind him. He cried  all the way through the Jerry Lewis telethon."  </P> <P> I was taken aback but, with my uncanny affinity for getting people to open up,  I decided to get a quote out of the bartender. "So . . . the Super Bowl," I  said.  </P> <P> He glared at me and my blue sports coat. "You want a drink?" he asked.  </P> <P> I ordered a beer. He brought me a can, sans glass.  </P> <P> The game began and I waited, hoping that for some unaccountable reason a horde  of Super Bowl enthusiasts would suddenly storm through the door. Instead,  another of my seatmates fell asleep.  </P> <P> I was 35 years old, a veteran of 14 years in the business and I'd been  hoodwinked by a rival newspaper, tricked into watching the Super Bowl at a Skid  Row bar. That no one would care if I also began weeping was of small  consolation.  </P> <P> I was unwittingly continuing a mostly vanished tradition dating back to the  days when every big city was inhabited by several newspapers, which put out new  editions every few hours and employed reporters under orders to use any trick  to one-up a competitor.  </P> <P> I'd heard of some of the ploys myself.  </P> <P> There was the young newsman on the old Los Angeles Herald in the 1930s who had  arranged with a supposed friend at the rival Express to see the Express' paper  as it came off the press. The Herald man planned to phone the headlines back to  his boss. Only an Express photographer suddenly appeared. A photo of the Herald  reporter ran on the front page of the Express the next day alongside the  headline: "How the Herald Gets Its News."  </P> <P> There was the Examiner reporter in the 1950s who outraced The Times'  representative to a farmhouse -- and the only telephone for miles -- with a  story on a widely publicized murder case. The Examiner man called in his piece,  then paid $50 to the owner of the farmhouse for the privilege of ripping the  phone out of the wall. Stepping outside, where The Times man was politely  waiting, the Examiner man smiled and said, "Here's the phone," and handed it  over.  </P> <P> And in the 1960s, there was the reporter on a small daily who made a habit of  perusing the unoccupied desks of his rivals in a downtown bureau, occasionally  copying down stories they had written -- until the day he stole one about a new  meat plant in his hometown. Unknown to him, his colleagues had concocted the  story and christened the fictitious plant, as well as the plant's officials,  with names that translated as "horse" in various foreign languages.  </P> <P> Now, I could add myself to the list -- the Skid Row humor man, victimized by my  own lazy research.  </P> <P> I wasn't sure The Times' sports editor had an appreciation of such journalistic  traditions. So, at the end of the first quarter, I bid adieu to the bartender  (who didn't look up). For the next hour, I slogged through innumerable  construction and cable car zones before spotting a lively fern bar with a Super  Bowl sign in front.  </P> <P> This time, of course, there was no vacant parking place in sight.  </P> <P> My eventual article, such as it was, gave the appearance that the enthusiasts  in the bar had been strangely tight-mouthed until the second half, when they  suddenly burst forth with boisterous comments.  </P> <P> And, now, San Francisco and Cincinnati have a Super Bowl rematch Sunday.  </P> <P> Obviously the possessor of a good memory, the sports editor is giving me the  day off.  </P> <P> Still, I know that when the National Anthem starts, I'll feel a slight chill.  </P></p>

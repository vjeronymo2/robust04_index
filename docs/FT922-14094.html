			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Churchill still digging for victory 'Hello, I'm Winston Churchill' - is in danger of losing his seat. The grandson of Britain's wartime leader was still confident and wowing the respectful middle-aged in Sale shopping centre, Manchester, on Monday afternoon. But his relative lack of success among the young, some of whom responded with a pointed reversal of the Churchillian sign of victory, may indicate a wider malaise. After 22 years, the Churchill grip on the Davyhulme constituency in Greater Manchester should be firm. Three weeks ago it looked as if it would be weakened, but not broken. Mr Churchill still says he detects no sign of the surge required to overturn his 8,199 majority. This week, though, Mr Barry Brotherton for Labour and Dr Jackie Pearcey for the Liberal Democrats have begun to sound as if they believe Mr Churchill could be toppled. The evidence is far from overwhelming. None of the parties will have carried out anything like a complete canvass by polling day. Because Davyhulme has not been considered marginal, the organisations of the three parties are less impressive than in other more tightly contested seats. Mr Brotherton, a quietly-spoken engineer who has had to come to terms with pinstripe suits and buttonholes sprouting flowers, argues that if Labour is building on the last local council elections, a swing of much less than 8 per cent will give him the seat. Dr Pearcey, a nuclear physicist trying to build on a 23 per cent share of the vote, talked three weeks ago of pushing Labour into third place. Ambition has bloomed and she now sees the possibility of relegating Mr Churchill to last place. What seems to be happening is no more than a reflection of the past three weeks elsewhere in the north-west. Mr Churchill's hard core of support will not be eroded. The name and the Tory tradition in an area scarcely noted for radicalism are bound to keep him closely in contention. Yet the Conservative vote is being nibbled away at the edges by abstentions, a few direct transfers to Labour, and by rather more who say they will vote Liberal Democrat. How far and how fast the process is moving are questions that have added much needed spice to the final days of a rather dour campaign. All the candidates accept that a significant, perhaps substantial, number of voters will not make up their mind until the last minute. Long-serving party workers say they cannot recall an election more difficult to predict or one where it has been as tough to assess what tactical-voting trends might emerge. And that, of course, will be the let-out for everyone who gets the result wrong.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MARILYN MONROE LETTER NETS $7,150  </P> <P> A handwritten letter by Marilyn Monroe was sold for $7,150, setting a record  for an auction price for a letter by a movie star, according to a specialist in  autograph auctions.  </P> <P> The auction Thursday night broke the old record of $6,600 paid in September,  1987, for a handwritten letter by actress Greta Garbo, said Herman Darvick, who  stages autograph auctions six times a year.  </P> <P> The record does not include one movie actor -- the one who became President. A  handwritten letter by Ronald Reagan praising Frank Sinatra once sold for  $12,500, but his White House connection made a large difference, Darvick said.  </P> <P> The Monroe letter, in an envelope postmarked Jan. 17, 1945, is actually signed  Norma Jeane, Monroe's given name. She was 18 when she wrote it.  </P></p>

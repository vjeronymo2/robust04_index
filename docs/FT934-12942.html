			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Property: Better - but not good - Cadogan's Place WAS THE bad weather in September too much for the property market? Or were sober assessments of family finances for the coming year to blame, especially as nobody knows what nasty medicines the chancellor will administer in November? Whatever the reason, business was less than agents had expected. Such words as 'flat' and 'patchy' - even 'stagnant' - could be heard. Buyers remain willing to wait or withdraw unless house and price match perfectly. And while the Corporate Estate Agents property index reported September sales 7.5 per cent up on August, they were below the February-July monthly totals. One property that is likely to sell quickly, however, is Erwarton Hall, on the Shotley peninsula in Suffolk. New on the market, it is a brick, grade II-listed Elizabethan house with plenty of bedrooms plus a great hall with minstrels' gallery, heated indoor swimming pool, jacuzzi and sauna. Its glory is a 1549 gatehouse, looking like an upturned multi-legged table in brick, directing visitors to the front door. Strutt &amp; Parker (0473-214841) is seeking offers over Pounds 450,000. Why so little? As a repossessed property, it is empty, which does not help selling. Also, there are farm buildings against one of the boundaries, it is far down the peninsula, and the view across the river Stour includes Harwich docks. But it looks good value, especially with its gatehouse. ***** IN CAMBRIDGE, St John's College has created the city's first true crescent (rather than a sweeping road). The Crescent, designed by John Blair of local architect Saunders Boston, and built with care by Amey, is aligned on the axis of Churchill College across the road, enhancing both buildings. It has 16 town houses and five detached houses behind. At the side is housing that college staff, graduate students and visiting fellows can afford in a city where demand far exceeds supply and prices and rents are high as a result. Town house prices start at Pounds 69,950 and the detached houses at Pounds 187,500. The agents are Carter Jonas (0223-68 771) and Redmayne Arnold &amp; Harris (0223-323 130). ***** IN OXFORD, New College is selling 16 lordships of the manor in places where it no longer owns property. A minimum price of Pounds 5,000 allows the buyer to be styled lord of the manor of, say, Newton Longville (or elsewhere) and pass that on to an heir - but brings little else. Buyers pay a 10 per cent premium, or 2.5 per cent if they are former New College men and women. Inquiries to Cluttons (071-408-1010). ***** IF YOU hanker after water views, but do not want to move to distant parts, try Bishops Bowl Lakes. They lie in an old limestone quarry at Bishop's Itchington, Warwickshire (between Banbury and Warwick), where two fossilised plesiosaurs and an ichthyosaur were found in 1928. The lakes are for sale from John D. Wood (0865-311522), which is seeking offers well in excess of Pounds 1m. When I visited them on a cold and frosty morning, steam was rising from the water between the layered limestone cliffs as it began to warm in the morning sun. Duck and a snipe were in the reeds. Yet, this romantic wilderness is only 30 miles from Birmingham and Leicester and a mere 17 from Coventry. The lakes have planning permission for a private house, club houses and fishing lodges, and could easily be a leisure centre for the Midlands since they are only three miles from junction 12 on the M40. At present, there is fishing, and water sports in the summer. If I had the money, I should forget the leisure centre and build a large, low house for watching the birds and enjoying Warwickshire at its wildest. ***** WHO BUYS a tax haven in the Channel Islands, where you can be free of UK income tax? Answer: very rich people who might have to pay the tax. Last year, Monaco-based reclusive twin brothers David and Frederick Barclay - placed 62nd in Business Age's most recent list of Britain's wealthiest people - bought The European newspaper from the ruins of the Maxwell empire. Now, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has sold them Brecqhou, a small island off Sark in the Channel Islands. WHO The asking price was Pounds 3.5m. David Barclay also gets a seat on Sark's governing body, the Chief Pleas.</p>

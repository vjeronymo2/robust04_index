			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MOTLEY CRUE PULLS PLUG ON ICE  </P> <P> The heavy metal band Motley Crue stormed off the stage for 20 minutes after  lead singer Vince Neil got hit in the face with a cup of ice.  </P> <P> Neil was treated for superficial injuries after Wednesday's concert at the  Rushmore Plaza Civic Center, said Louis Heidelmeier, a spokesman for Elektra  Records.  </P> <P> Neil dodged plastic squeeze bottles, undergarments and other items thrown on  stage throughout the opening numbers. He rebuked the crowd and said the band  would leave if the trashing continued. When the cup of ice hit him during the  next song, he unplugged his guitar and the band left the stage.  </P> <P> After a hiatus, Motley Crue returned and finished the concert, Heidelmeier  said.  </P> <P> Police said about 70 people were arrested for underage consumption of alcohol.  </P> <P> The heavy metal band -- once known for its heavy drug and alcohol use -- is  touring the U.S. promoting their "Dr. Feelgood" album, the first since the  group declared its sobriety.  </P></p>

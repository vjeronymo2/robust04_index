			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- A meeting took place  here today to mark the 21st anniversary of the publication of  "Let Us Prevent a National Partition and Reunify the Country", a  work of the great leader President Kim Il-song.    The meeting was attended by Pak Song-chol, member of the  Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party  of Korea [WPK] and vice-president, Yang Hyong-sop, alternate  member of the Political Bureau of the C.C. [Central Committee],  WPK and chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, and working  people in the city.    On June 23, 1973, immediately after the South Korean rulers  published a "special statement" announcing the creation of "two  Koreas" as their "policy", President Kim Il-song put forth the  five-point policy of national reunification as a revolutionary  measure decisively to smash the permanent nation-splitting moves  of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges and open an epochal  phase of national reunification.    The great leader President Kim Il-song has said:    "Our proposal is to remove military confrontation and ease  tension between the North and the South, bring about  multilateral collaboration and interchange between the two  parts, convene the great national congress composed of  representatives of people of all levels and political parties  and social organizations in the North and South, institute the  North-South confederation under the single name of the  Confederal Republic of Koryo and enter the UN under that name.  When this proposal for the country's reunification is put into  effect, there will be a great improvement in accomplishing the  historic cause of peaceful national reunification on the  principle of the North-South joint statement, as commonly  desired by our people and the world's people."    In his report at the meeting Paek Nam-chun, director of the  Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of  the Fatherland, said the five-point policy of national  reunification laid down by the great leader was a patriotic  reunification formula most correctly reflecting the unanimous  aspirations and will of all the fellow countrymen who desired a  peaceful reunification of the country and opposed a permanent  division of the nation, and an immortal militant banner which  set forth a broad vista and way of national reunification and  roused vigorously the entire people to the struggle to realize  it.    "It is entirely because of the `two Koreas' policy of the  United States and the successive South Korean authorities that  the five-point policy of national reunification has not been  implemented, though it evoked welcome and full support of the  entire Korean people and the world's peaceloving people for its  fair and reasonable nature," he said.    The reporter pointed out that in recent years the United  States and its followers have been increasing the tensions on  the Korean peninsula and creating graver obstacles in the way of  Korea's reunification by inventing the "nuclear issue" of the  DPRK.    Recalling that the DPRK Government took a decisive measure  of  declaring its immediate withdrawal from the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] in face of unjustifiable moves of the IAEA  Secretariat, he said this is a legitimate self-defence measure  and "an expression of our people's firm stand and will not to  bow to any pressure."    It is not allowable to live in uneasiness, exposed to the  danger of an unpredictable nuclear war on top of the tragedy of  national division, the reporter said, and continued:    The United States must no longer seek "sanctions" against  the  DPRK but come out to the DPRK-U.S. talks with a sincere  attitude and stand for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue  of the Korean peninsula, in compliance with the aspiration of  the time and the demand of the Korean and U.S. peoples.    We believe that the visit to Pyongyang by a former U.S.  President a few days ago will produce an affirmative result.    The Japanese reactionaries must renounce the hostile policy  toward the DPRK they have pursued, motivated by a foolish  intention to realise their old dream of "the greater east Asia  coprosperity sphere."    They must ponder over the consequences to be entailed by  their moves against the DPRK and the General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), honestly apologize for  all the crimes committed so far and punish the criminals.    "Sanctions" against the North are immediately sanctions  against the South and a declaration of war to the 70 million  Koreans.    The South Korean authorities must renounce the policy of  dependence on outside forces, take the stand of national  independence, give up the policy of confrontation between the  fellow countrymen and seek national concord and unity.    It is our consistent position to meet with anyone who truly  wants the independent and peaceful reunification of the country  from the stand of great national unity and national independence  and jointly seek the way of the peace and peaceful reunification  of the country.    The premier of the DPRK Administration Council, thinking it  lucky that the South Korean side expressed its readiness to hold  top-level talks with the North, sent a message today upon  authorization to the South Korean "prime minister," expressing  welcome and agreement to the South side's proposal for holding a  preliminary contact for the North-South top-level talks.    I express support to it in the name of the participants in  this meeting, considering that it reflects the consistent  position and policy of our side to remove confrontation between  North and South and open a new phase for national reunification  independently and peacefully through top-level talks.    Paek Nam-chun called on all the Koreans at home and abroad  to  brilliantly adorn 1995 as the proud year of national  reunification, the significant year marking the 50th anniversary  of national liberation and the historical year that our nation  set as the first year of reunification, under the banner of the  10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation.</p>

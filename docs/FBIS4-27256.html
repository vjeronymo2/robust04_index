			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Antonio Sampaio] </F>   [Excerpt] The Manila conference on human rights in East  Timor will really go ahead. A court in the Philippines banned  the conference, but we have been informed that the organizers  will disregard the decision.    The conference will start on Monday [30 May] with an address  by Konis Santana, the East Timorese resistance leader. Our  correspondent in Australia, Antonio Sampaio, managed to obtain  an exclusive copy of the video that also contains pictures of  resistance members:    [Sampaio] [Video shows armed members of the resistance in  camouflage uniform, in the bush. Video shows the men in  formation, sitting on the ground and performing tasks] These are  the latest pictures to arrive from the mountains in East Timor,  filmed at the end of April and given to us exclusively. They  are destined for Manila, where at the end of weeks of Indonesian  controversy and diplomatic blackmail, the first conference in  the Asia-Pacific region on human rights in East Timor is about  to start.    The highlight of the conference will be the opening speech  by  Konis Santana, the leader of the East Timorese resistance. In  this speech, Konis addresses heavy criticism at Jakarta and at  the cooperation that governments in the region are maintaining  with the Indonesian regime:    [Begin Santana recording] [video shows Santana speaking,  standing at a table with a gun next to him, and resistance flag  draped behind him] Many around the world thought it impossible  for a defenseless people to defeat such a great Asian power as  Indonesia and assumed the East Timorese issue to be over. [end  recording]    [Sampaio] [Video shows armed resistance men in formation]  The  resistance leader also appeals for further joint efforts in  favor of East Timor and makes wide reference to the peace plan  proposed by Jose Ramos Horta [resistance spokesman abroad]:    [Begin Santana recording] The East Timorese people are thus  sufficiently ready to ensure civilized, orderly, and responsible  behavior, within the context of the geo-political region. The  East Timorese people recognize the interests of the region and  Indonesia itself and will know how to respect those interests.  The people of East Timor, aware of their position in the  region, will fight actively to become a member of the  Asia-Pacific region. Most of all, East Timor manifests its wish  to put itself forward to become a member state of ASEAN, for  only then will it be able to contribute to stability and peace  in the region.

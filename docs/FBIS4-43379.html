			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Winfried Muenster: "Voters Prefer Characters </F> Like Waigel"]    [Text] In the spring, Bavaria's governing Christian Social  Union [CSU] was at times worried that it would not get 5 percent  of all votes cast in Germany and would have to leave the  European Parliament in Strasbourg. During the election  campaign, however, the prospects improved. Opinion polls showed  that voters considered the CSU "competent" on European policy,  and they honored this by giving the party almost 7 percent.  Edmund Stoiber's criticism about "Brussels," about the flood of  directives and expenditures, about the danger that, through the  Community, France's bureaucratic centralism and interventionism  would be spread throughout Europe, has apparently impressed  people.    Thus Stoiber would have won the elections -- if Chancellor  Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union [CDU] had not been even  more successful. Those who do not like the Community as it has  developed in the past 30 years should not vote for the CDU in  European elections, because this Community undisputedly is the  product of the Christian democrats of the six founding  countries; France, Italy, Benelux, and the Federal Republic.  Logically, they hardly ever criticize Brussels. However, the  Bavarian sister party is led by someone who has not entertained  the public or the electorate with loud criticism, but has  frequently adopted a certain tone in Brussels itself -- Theo  Waigel. That is why he should be declared the winner of the  European elections, even though there is no scientific basis to  say so. No one will doubt that he is a convinced European.  Nonetheless, in the Council of Ministers, he kicks against the  pricks -- or, rather, against the zeitgeist -- time and again,  and frankly tells his counterparts what Germany would consider  good European economics policy -- self-imposed moderation  instead of hunting for responsibilities, austerity instead of  distributing subsidies in a self-important way, primacy of price  and monetary stability instead of inflationary employment  policy. In Brussels, by the EU, most ministers mean something  else. However, that does not worry Waigel, and now it looks as  if the elections had shifted the club of 12 in his direction.    For this direction, the term "subsidiarity" was introduced.  In the new European Parliament, a clear superiority of  Christian democrats and conservatives over social democrats and  socialists has developed. The latter are working for a  centralist and interventionist Community, because they intend to  give employees in the EU equal, and the highest possible, social  security, irrespective of the country where they work. For  social democrats, this forms part of the solidarity in the  Community and it forms part of the single market, which in  theory is supposed to give employees mobility between Scotland  and Sicily. The Christian democrats are equally dedicated to  this goal. The conservatives, who have now risen to become the  third force, tend toward a basically different policy --  competition between the systems. Brussels does not impose the  system, but cultivates competition and makes sure the rules are  respected. Solidarity and help for the weaker members have a  place here. However, they are not the Community's most  important task.    Following European elections, the economic policy helm in  Brussels will not be turned abruptly, but will at best be  slightly changed. According to economic expert Horst Siebert,  the Community will only stay together if it learns to see itself  as a competitive society.</p>

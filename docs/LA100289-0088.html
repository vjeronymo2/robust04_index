			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET INTO THE ACT;  </P> <P> SUPPORT SERVICES FOR SCREENWRITERS RANGE FROM RESEARCHERS AND TYPISTS TO  PSYCHOTHERAPISTS.  </P> <P> Sitting in a tattered cardboard box on the floor, it looked much like any other  screenplay. But something about one called "Beverly Hills Cop" caught the eye  of Gabriele Zinke.  </P> <P> "I remember looking at the title and thinking that was pretty funny," said  Zinke, who co-owns the Writer's Computer Store, a Los Angeles company  specializing in computer hardware and software for screenwriters.  </P> <P> "Beverly Hills Cop" was composed on a computer -- and with software --  purchased at the Writer's Computer Store. "This might sound silly," said Zinke,  "but any time something successful is written on one of our computers, I feel  like I'm a small part of it."  </P> <P> These days, it seems that everyone wants to play their part in the movie  business. And a growing number of Los Angeles area companies are finding ways  to make some profits servicing screenwriters.  </P> <P> Just a decade ago, about all the assistance that screenwriters had to choose  from were secretaries to type finished scripts and photocopy stores to make  extra sets of the screenplays. But today, screenwriters -- and wanna-be  screenwriters -- seem to have an endless selection of services.  </P> <P> For the novice, there are numerous courses on how to write screenplays. And for  the seasoned screenwriter, many companies such as Zinke's sell thousands of  dollars in computer hardware and software specifically designed for script  writing. There are also so-called script doctors who, for a price, will tell  you if your screenplay is any good. And there are researchers who will help  busy screenwriters find out any facts -- historical or otherwise -- that they  might need to know for their scripts. There are even some psychotherapists who  say they can help screenwriters overcome one of the most common problems of all  -- writer's block.  </P> <P> "It's more than a cottage industry -- it's enormous," said George Kirgo,  president of the West Coast division of the Writer's Guild of America. "Some  screenwriters will swear by the courses, the computer stores and the  what-have-you's," said Kirgo, whose West Coast guild has 7,500 members, "but  there are plenty of fly-by-nights, like in every other business."  </P> <P> What has caused this sudden growth? "There's been an absolute explosion because  of all the money involved in screen writing," said Syd Field, author of two  books on screen writing technique and one of the most highly regarded names in  the profession of screen writing instruction.  </P> <P> Experts estimate that while top scripts sold for $60,000 just a few years ago,  they can now fetch upward of $600,000. "The joke is that if you're in the film  business, your pool man, barber and taxi driver will all have a script to show  you," said Kirgo. "It's become the glamour industry of Los Angeles and New  York."  </P> <P> Some say that all a screenwriter needs to write a successful screenplay is a  very good idea, a piece of paper and a pen. But the way Field figures it, that  may be the exception. Even a novice can quickly spend a total of about $1,000  to attend some basic screen writing classes, have a completed script typed by a  professional and have a dozen copies made for distribution.  </P> <P> "Everyone wants to be in film," said Field, whose company, Screenwriters Inc.,  will also critique screenplays for $295. "We have a generation of young people  who have grown up watching TV and going to the movies. So their tendency isn't  to write books, but to write for TV and films."  </P> <P> Certainly, this is the tendency of Dan Petrie Jr., who not only wrote "Beverly  Hills Cop" but also "The Big Easy," and co-wrote the screenplays "Turner &amp;  Hooch" and "Shoot to Kill." And while Petrie figures that he has spent up to  $10,000 for computer hardware and software, he doesn't think that most  screenwriters need to go overboard on equipment and courses.  </P> <P> "I'd say, you can probably spend less and get more," Petrie said. "If I was  going to spend $1,000 for a screen writing class, I'd like to know that the guy  teaching it is Neil Simon."  </P> <P> Jeff Gordon isn't Neil Simon. But the 27-year-old graduate of USC Film School  recently started a company called Writer's Boot Camp that offers 10-session  courses for $900. "The price reflects the quality of the course," said Gordon,  who insists that writers who complete the course will have extensively  developed their plot lines and their main characters. At the other end of the  price spectrum are screen writing courses -- which include nine class sessions  for $185 -- offered through UCLA Extension.  </P> <P> Once screen writing hopefuls have learned the technique -- and come up with a  plot -- the next decision is whether to type the screenplay on a typewriter or  a computer. And no matter what decision that screenwriters make, plenty of  companies stand to profit from them.  </P> <P> One Santa Monica company, for example, can take a script that's been typed on  paper, run it through a special machine that scans the words and records the  script on a computer disk. "It's kind of like reverse printing," said Jay  Brown, operations director at On Word Inc.  </P> <P> On Word charges about $85 to place a typed script on computer disk. More than a  year ago, the screenplay to the film "Batman" was brought into the company. "It  went through here before anyone even knew about it," said Brown. "I remember  thinking it was pretty weird that there was a Batman movie without Robin in  it."  </P> <P> Then, there are specialists who simply type screenplays into the proper format.  Costs vary from $100 to $350.  </P> <P> They say there's no telling where the screenplays will come from.  </P> <P> Barbara's Place, one of the better-known Los Angeles-area screenplay typing  specialists, recently received a script from the North Pole. "I thought it was  a joke until the check cleared" said Susan Johannesson, owner of the company.  Barbara's Place typed one of the final versions of the film "Out of Africa"  several years ago. "Anyone can type up their own scripts," said Johannesson,  "but when we do it, the screenplay looks professional."  </P> <P> At the same time, there are companies that will do research of any kind for  screenwriters -- for a price. The Silver Lake company, Legworks, charges about  $40 an hour to help screenwriters get the facts straight.  </P> <P> Most of the work that the research company does is confidential, but the  requests can vary wildly. For one writer, the company looked into the cost of  leasing office space in the Empire State Building in 1933. But for a story that  another writer was working on about teen-age runaways, the company's co-founder  Sandy Ferguson recently hung around a Los Angeles bus depot to observe runaways  firsthand. "I learned real fast how to pick out a runaway," she said.  </P> <P> But few Hollywood studios will pick up the tab for researchers. "It's  considered a luxury item," said Ferguson. "Most screenwriters are forced to pay  researchers out of their own pockets."  </P> <P> Maybe it sounds a bit too Hollywood. But there is even a woman who says she  specializes in helping screenwriters overcome writer's block. This is what  happens to some screenwriters when they get stuck in ruts and are unable to  make progress in writing their scripts.  </P> <P> The woman is Rachel Ballon, a screenwriter and licensed psychotherapist who  also teaches screenwriters how to deal with rejection. Ballon has sold several  TV scripts and one movie script. Her Brentwood company, Rachel Ballon &amp;  Co., offers individual or group classes -- from $35 to $95 per hour -- about  "how to survive" in the entertainment industry, said Ballon.  </P> <P> "You put two years of your life into writing a screenplay and it can be  rejected in two minutes," said Ballon. "Writers have to be taught how to go out  and survive."  </P> <P> Many screenwriters count too heavily on their scripts to sell, she said. "There  are people who put their lives at stake on a single script," she said. "I tell  them that won't work. They also have to love the process of writing."  </P> <P> And some have rather unexpected problems. "I've talked with people who haven't  even written a word yet," said Ballon, "and they're already worrying about  foreign distribution rights."  </P></p>

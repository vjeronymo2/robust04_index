			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POPS WAVES THE FLAG IN SEASONAL WAY;  </P> <P> PATRIOTISM: MARCHES, ODES, SWEET ADELINES AND A EUPHONIUM SOLO CONTRIBUTE TO  THE SPIRIT OF THE FOURTH THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> Sousa marches and patriotic medleys are as requisite to a Fourth of July pops  program as potato salad and cold fried chicken are to the traditional holiday  picnic.  </P> <P> Wednesday night at Hospitality Point, guest conductor Carl Hermanns and the San  Diego Symphony pops orchestra did not flout tradition: The unmistakable martial  cadences of Sousa surrounded a parade of flag-waving odes, ably assisted by the  120 massed voices of San Diego's Sweet Adelines vocal ensemble.  </P> <P> For those ears too jaded to respond to Sousa's "El Capitan" and "Washington  Post" marches or to the time-worn Peter J. Wilhousky arrangement of the "Battle  Hymn of the Republic," Hermanns programmed Aaron Copland's "Lincoln Portrait"  and Herbert L. Clarke's "Bride of the Waves," transcribed for euphonium.  </P> <P> In his usual chatty way, Hermanns described the euphonium as a kind of "baby  tuba."  </P> <P> Although the "Lincoln Portrait" is not exactly obscure, it is no pops staple.  </P> <P> From the subdued opening to its brassy finale, Hermanns pressed the piece  forward with a steady hand, and the players responded with their cleanest  playing of the evening.  </P> <P> Wednesday's narrator for the 3,167 concert-goers was City Councilman Bruce  Henderson, who earnestly intoned the bold, awkwardly chiseled words of Abraham  Lincoln expounding the need for national resolve to eradicate the evils of  slavery.  </P> <P> This aptly nationalistic program runs through Saturday, and, each evening, a  different local politician assumes the narrator's role.  </P> <P> Heather Buchman, the orchestra's principal trombone, performed the euphonium  solo in "Bride of the Waves," a novel idea that no doubt looked better on paper  than it sounded in concert.  </P> <P> Although Buchman coaxed a sweet, mellow sound from the valved instrument that  gently gurgles in the tenor range, she could not make it spring through the  agile figuration of the piece, which was of course intended for the cornet,  Clarke's own instrument.  </P> <P> Coupled with the conductor's difficulty in keeping soloist and orchestra  together through the quick transitions of this variation cycle, the quaint  period piece fizzled like a damp firecracker.  </P> <P> Director Kim Hulbert's energetic Sweet Adelines sounded best in their  unaccompanied songs, especially a snappy arrangement of Cy Coleman and Michael  Stewart's upbeat "Come Follow the Band."  </P> <P> Although the well-disciplined chorus projected the characteristic sonority of  women's barbershop harmony -- an intensely bright and shallow sound -- this  writer agrees with the wag who labeled it "cruel and not sufficiently unusual  punishment."  </P></p>

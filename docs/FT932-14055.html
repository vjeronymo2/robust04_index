			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / US housing starts fell by 4.6% last month SEVERE winter storms on the east coast contributed to a 4.6 per cent fall in US housing starts in March, the commerce department said yesterday. The decline followed a small increase in February and an even sharper drop in January. Starts are now running at their lowest level since last July and 14 per cent below the level registered in March last year. The figures, however, were distorted by bad weather: starts fell 26.8 per cent in the northeast, the region most affected by storms, by 13.9 per cent in the Midwest and by 5 per cent in the south. Starts rose 17.9 per cent in the west. Even allowing for bad weather, analysts are puzzled by the weakness of starts, given that fixed-rate mortgage rates have fallen to about 7.5 per cent, the lowest level in two decades. Most are predicting a strong recovery in housing in the spring and summer. The disappointing figures for starts are the latest in a series of economic reports - including a sharp drop in retail sales last month and flat industrial production - that appear to indicate a recent slowing of the pace of economic recovery.</p>

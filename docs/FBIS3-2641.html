			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 9 (XINHUA) -- The 50th session of the  U.N. Commission on Human Rights adopted here today a Chinese  motion that no decision will be taken on the draft resolution  entitled "The Situation of Human Rights in China."    Similar draft resolutions presented by some Western  countries  at the previous three U.N. human rights sessions were rejected.    At today's session, the motion put forward by Jin Yongjian,  head of the Chinese delegation received 20 votes for, 16 against  and 17 abstentions.    Jin pointed out that those who don't prejudice against China  can see how it currently enjoys political and social stability,  sustained and rapid economic development while its democracy and  legal system continues to be perfected.    The living standard of Chinese people has gone up  significantly and they are enjoying wider human rights and more  fundamental freedom than in any of its previous periods of  history, Jin said.    Jin said that the aim of those countries who had colluded to  draft the resolutions was only to exert political pressure on  China and to obstruct China's economic development, thus forcing  Chinese people to change the path of development which they have  chosen according to their own national conditions.    "China is willing to cooperate internationally in the field  of human rights, in accordance with the purposes and principles  of the U.N. Charter and on the basis of mutual respect and  equality," Jin added.    "However, China is firmly opposed to any attempt by any  country or blocks of countries to vilify it in the name of  protecting human rights," he said.    Before the vote, deputies from many developing countries  such  as Cuba, Mauritius, Syria, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and  Iran, expressed their support for the Chinese delegation's  motion.    They pointed out that the international community should be  aware of the great progress that China has made in nearly every  aspect. The Chinese Government has accepted the challenge of  efficiently managing such a big country, which has a quarter of  the world's population and has ensured that the living standard  of Chinese people has gone up consistently.    China's contributions to the world should be highly praised  and encouraged, they said.    They also pointed out that some Western countries are used  to  imposing their own views on others, and their draft resolution  about China has been put together with clear political  intentions.</p>

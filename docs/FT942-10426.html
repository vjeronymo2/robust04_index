			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Zil says it's back in business Zil, Russia's ailing truck manufacturer, said yesterday it had reopened after a 10-day stoppage and much political furore over its troubles. Executives at Zil, a Moscow-based enterprise with an old-style management and 85,000 employees, said they proposed to reverse the company's fortunes by focusing on recovering money from its debtors in the former Soviet Union, and expanding its range of vehicles. They also said Zil would take long-overdue steps to trim its work force. Rather than begin painful restructuring and lower their prices to attract customers, many enterprises, including Zil, have so far successfully put pressure on the government to give them soft loans by threatening to close down. As part of the lobbying process, various ministries have issued dire warnings of imminent closures and mass lay-offs, even if it is exactly such results that the government has sought to achieve. One illustration of continuing extravagance at Zil is provided by the fact that it still runs one of the best hospitals in Moscow. A recent patient was Mr Anders Aslund, a Swedish adviser to Russian radical ministers who were forced out of office last winter. Mr Aslund had long advocated bankruptcy proceedings for poorly-performing companies such as Zil. Zil had earlier insisted that it needed cheap credits to reopen but these were not mentioned by its executives yesterday. However, Professor Yevgeny Yasin, the newly-named economic adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, told the Financial Times that Zil had managed to secure financial support from the Moscow mayor's office. Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor, is fundamentally opposed to the radical restructuring and privatisation policies pursued by the government. It was not clear yesterday how the Moscow city authorities, who frequently complain that the city is bankrupt, had managed to find money for Zil, but the mayor was clearly unhappy at the prospect of the closure of such a large industrial enterprise on his doorstep. Prof Yasin stressed that the Russian government could not have afforded to help Zil out. Zil was an exceptional beneficiary because the Russian government, unlike the Moscow authorities, could not afford such help for other troubled flagships of the former Soviet industrial machine. He also distanced himself from comments by a less senior presidential aide, Mr Alexander Livshits, who last week called for new financial injections into ailing enterprises to 'compensate' for the government's tight money policy and to prevent mass unemployment.</p>

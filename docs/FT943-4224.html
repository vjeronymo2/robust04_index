			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Macy merger deal approved by US court A US bankruptcy court yesterday approved the merger agreement signed last month by Federated Department Stores and RH Macy, two of the biggest retailers in the US, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dollars 1.4bn deal to bring Macy's out of bankruptcy, however, still has some hurdles to overcome. Later this month, a bankruptcy court will rule on the joint reorganisation plan submitted to the court by Federated and Macy's last week. If that plan is approved, the merger is likely to go ahead, creating a company with revenues of more than Dollars 13bn.</p>

The disputes between the two country must be settled  properly  through consultation on an equal footing in the spirit of mutual  respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences,  the Chinese premier stressed, adding that the problems can only  be complicated by exerting pressures unilaterally.    The Chinese premier made the statements during his meeting  with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his  party here this afternoon.    Premier Li Peng said that China attaches importance to the  current visit by Christopher, hoping that candid talks might  help enhance mutual understanding.    Recalling Christopher's China visit a decade ago, Premier Li  Peng said that great changes have taken place in China as well  as in the world, but the changing international situation has  not in any way change the importance of the Sino-U.S. relations.    On the contrary, he said, the changing international  situation has called for the enhancement of Sino-U.S. relations.    China has always approached the Sino-U.S. relations from the  global perspective and from the fundamental interests of the two  peoples, Premier Li Peng told U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher.    He said that the Chinese Government attaches importance to  the Sino-U.S. relations and has made tremendous efforts toward  improving and developing such relations, adding that in my  government work report to the National People's Congress session  two days ago, he reiterated again this stand of the Chinese  Government.    Premier Li Peng reviewed the bilateral trade, which has in  recent years, grown rapidly, with the trade volume topping 27.65  billion U.S. dollars, increasing 10 times over that of 1979.    He said that China's economy is developing in a sustained,  fast and steady manner and the market has kept expanding. Its  import is expected to reach 1,000 billion U.S. dollars in the  next seven years.    At present, transportation, telecommunications and energy  industries, for which U.S. is a strong power, constitute the  priority sectors of China's development, the Chinese premier  said. If the Sino-U.S. relations go well, with the man-made  obstacles removed, it would mean a historic opportunity for U.S.  economic circles.    On human rights issue, Li said that China and the U.S. have  different concepts regarding human rights.    China is a developing country, Li said. The population of  the developing world makes up four-fifths of the world's total.    It is not fair to impose the human rights concepts of a  developed country on a developing country, Li stressed.    China will never accept the human rights concepts of the  United States, the premier asserted.    For a developing country, human rights are, first of all,  the  rights to survival and development. A person must first survive  before talking about rights, Li said.    The disputes between China and the United States concerning  human rights can be discussed on the basis of equality so as to  enhance mutual understanding, the Chinese premier said, but  there should be no putting-on of pressure.    Li Peng said that it is a mutually beneficial arrangement  for  the two countries to maintain normal trade relations.    "To speak frankly, if China's most favored nation status is  cancelled, the losses incurred to the United States would be no  smaller than those to China," said the Chinese premier.    China mainly relies on its internal market and has a strong  capability of self-reliance, he added.    "What the U.S. would lose is a vast market," Li said. "We  hope the U.S. side would handle this issue properly."    Christopher expressed agreement with Li's remarks in his  government work report about the importance of Sino-U.S.  relations.    He said that President Clinton regards the U.S. relations  with China as conforming to the national interests of the United  States.    He told the Chinese premier that the U.S. can cooperate with  China on a wide ranging issues, both global and regional, both  bilateral and multilateral, and both in the areas of peace and  security.    The United States and China are both permanent members of  the  UN Security Council and the U.S. side is willing to improve its  relations with China, he said.    Christopher also briefed Li on U.S. views on human rights  and  MFN.    Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and  Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei were present at the meeting.    Present on the U.S. side were Ambassador Stapleton Roy,  Undersecretary of State for International Security Affairs Lynn  Davis and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 9 ITAR-TASS -- "Russia needs Civic  Accord. Political confrontation has been exhausting.  Constructive cooperation for the sake of Russian revival is the  best way out. None but we will settle our problems. We should  be wise enough to accept and understand each other," says a  statement of the Russian president's public chamber circulated  here today.    "Acknowledging our responsibility for the future of our  motherland and considering its interests to be superior to  class, corporative, party and group interests, we,  representatives of political, trade union, women's, veterans',  youth and other public organizations, who have diverse political  outlook and social interests, voice our support to the  initiatives of citizens, public associations, political parties,  the Russian president and the State Duma on the achievement of  Civic Accord in Russia," says the document.    Members of the public chamber called for the maximum broad  use of conciliatory mechanisms in solution of political, social  and economic issues. They offered the working group for  preparation of the draft agreement on Civic Accord in Russia to  take into account proposals voiced during the draft discussion  at the public chamber.</p>

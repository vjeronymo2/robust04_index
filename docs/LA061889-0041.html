			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE MASSACRE  </P> <P> I just returned from a two-month stay in the Soviet Union. The Soviet  television coverage of events in China was very thorough.  </P> <P> A Soviet acquaintance told me that the reason for this coverage was to show the  people in the Soviet Union what would happen to them if they started a serious  rebellion.  </P> <P> The commentary accompanying this coverage was chilling. I am glad to be back  home.  </P> <P> ADRIANNE PERRAULT  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

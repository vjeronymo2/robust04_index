			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 17 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Frantz Robert  Monde, recently elected Chamber of Deputies president, backed  today the initiative of deposed President Aristide to form "a  government of concord" and proposed summoning a national  conference in Haiti.    "The meeting organized by President Aristide is a positive  step in the search for a solution to the crisis but should be  followed up with a national conference to take place in the  country," explained Monde, a well-known neo-Duvalarist  legislator.    In December President Aristide rejected a national  conference  in Haiti, citing inadequate security for participants. This was  one of the most conflictive topics between Aristide and his  prime minister, Robert Malval.    The Haitian conference held this weekend in Miami, Florida,  to search for ways out of the political crisis in Haiti,  concluded Sunday night with a call by deposed President  Jean-Bertrand Artistide for the unity of the Haitian people.    The proposal by the Chamber of Deputies leader received the  support of former Haitian President General Prosper Avril, who  broke his long silence to ask that a national conference be held.    Avril, who had refused to summon elections during his term,  was forced to leave power in 1989 due to U.S. pressures.    One of the recommendations of the Miami meeting that  concluded last night is that the president should organize a  national conference once he returns to the country.    Meanwhile, oil sent by the international community to Haiti  last week has not yet began to be distributed. The oil is  intended to allow humanitarian organizations to distribute  medical attention to the most vulnerable citizens in the crisis.    Political observers in Haiti believe this situation is due  to  pressures exerted by the military and opposition sectors so that  the international community will lift the oil embargo.    According to sources close to the military, the  international  community and the U.S. Embassy in particular are seeking an  agreement with the military that could include the concession of  part of the cargo.    The State Department and the United Nations have supplied  different figures on the oil carried by the tanker. The State  Department mentions 400,000 gallons of oil, while a UN spokesman  has announced that the cargo amounts to 300,000 gallons.  "Indeed, 400,000 gallons of oil had been requested, but after  evaporation, less the oil burned during the voyage and during  operation in port, the remaining oil could well be only 300,000  gallons," explained Erick Falt.    Some observers believe that the 100,000 gallons that  "evaporated" have been given to Police chief Michel Francois, to  ensure his "cooperation" in the distribution of fuel to  humanitarian organizations.</p>

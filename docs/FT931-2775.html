			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Summer start pledged for business advice shop THE FIRST of the govern-ment's new one-stop business advice centres will open in the summer, with a fresh round of bids for contracts to run them to be invited this autumn, MPs were told yesterday. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, made the announcement as he praised Tuesday's Budget for being full of 'very considerable' good news for business. He clashed with Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, over the leaked DTI report showing a depressing outlook for British manufacturing. Calling for publication of the document Mr Cook said it represented 'an appalling verdict' on 14 years of Conservative government. Mr Heseltine retorted that the report revealed the 'devastating inheritance' the Tories had taken on in 1979 'when this country's economy was perceived as the sick man of Europe'. The confidential report concludes that UK industry is beset by weak management and products and under-investment in new technology. In the first round of applications to run 15 pilot one-stop outlets which the government hopes will start the process of revolutionising support for British companies, the Department of Trade and Industry received 57 bids. The 'shops', which will eventually number 200, will bring together the business services of chambers of commerce, local authorities, local enterprise agencies and the DTI.</p>

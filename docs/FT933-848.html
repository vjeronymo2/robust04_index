			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Way ahead for the ERM SERIOUS DEBATE on European Community economic policy has at last begun. Such a debate may not lead to a sound conclusion. But it is an excellent start. Of nothing is this more true than monetary arrangements. When the ERM was partially dismembered a year ago, the official reaction of the EC was that the system was fine. The problem, it was argued, lay with inept management, exacerbated by the unfortunate consequences of German unification. That position looks far less credible today. Some, it is true, believe that the ERM was mugged by Anglo-Saxon speculators. But that view cannot be defended. As Sir Leon Brittan argued last Friday, 'the difficulties experienced all the way from black Wednesday in September 1992 to the August decision to widen ERM bands, arose from the incompatibility of free capital movements, fixed exchange rates and independent monetary policies.' Where Sir Leon goes wrong is in his subsequent statement that 'if we had followed the system as it was originally envisaged and allowed parities to change . . . we would have avoided our present difficulties.' As the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, argued last Wednesday, 'prompt parity adjustment is not at all easy to achieve in practice . . . Prompt adjustment is anyway something of a contradiction, when the reasonably stout defence of existing parities is seen as an intrinsic part of the ERM's function as an external discipline.' Survive attack More fundamentally, knowledge that exchange rates can be changed undermines the credibility they need to survive attack. As the governor remarked, the remedy of more timely adjustment could merely 'come to mean more frequent exchange rate crises', as investors seek to jump the gun. There are four intellectually defensible possibilities: for some member states to jump to economic and monetary union; to move to a pure float; to return to narrow bands, while constraining currency speculation; or to manage the new wide-band ERM. The first of these is intellectually defensible, not for all 12 member states, but for a narrower core, which could include Germany, the Benelux countries and France. Denmark could join if it wanted to. Austria and Switzerland could join if they were within the EC. The second option, though still less popular, is also defensible. In practice, however, neither alternative is politically conceivable at present. The third possibility always has supporters. When speculators show that a government has no policy clothes, the first reaction is to try to put them in irons. The president of the European Commission, Mr Jacques Delors, has already suggested capital controls, be it a ring fence around the EC or special deposits on borrowing for currency speculation. Argue forcefully Both Sir Leon and the governor argue forcefully against such ideas. The danger is that such interventions would, if effective, undermine the single market that currency stability is intended to defend. In addition, should it be made easier for governments to persist with misaligned exchange rates or inappropriate monetary policies? When what is impossible is eliminated what is left, however improbable, must be chosen. By luck or by inspiration, the EC has fallen upon a perfectly sensible exchange rate system. As the governor notes, rules for a sensible domestic policy are given by the Maastricht Treaty's convergence requirements. As Sir Leon notes, the preconditions for a co-operative monetary policy are also given by the treaty. What the EC should do is agree on a sensible monetary policy for each of its members, defined against the goal of non-inflationary growth. Countries should be encouraged to exploit the current margin of manoeuvre, provided their actions can be justified against the agreed criteria. The old ERM was merely a means towards a sensible, co-operative monetary policy. What is needed now is to build a new co-operative policy, one which recognises that EC member states sometimes have divergent requirements, even though they share common monetary objectives. The new ERM provides the basis. The EC should build upon what it offers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michel Moutot] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 18 (AFP) -- Three hundred UN French  troops deployed among nine observations posts astride the  frontlines on the hills overlooking Sarajevo could end up as  sitting ducks if NATO starts bombing Serb positions.    The UN soldiers were deployed in their new observation posts  following a ceasefire agreement signed by the Bosnian Serbs and  Moslems, but the Serbs have since warned that they would  retaliate against the UN soldiers if attacked by North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation planes in the wake of its ultimatum that  heavy weapons be withdrawn by Sunday night from around the  besieged Bosnian capital.    "The day when someone, from whatever camp, decides to kill  Blue Helmets, he will probably be able to do so easily,"  according to a senior UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officer who  wished to remain anonymous.    "But this will be an act of war against the United Nations.  He (the assailant) must know he will be taking big risks. A  small (UN) group represents nothing by itself, but the balance  of forces has recently changed in Bosnia. The air force is now  here," he said.    Any guns that opened up on UN emplacements would have very  little time before being spotted, attacked and destroyed,  according to experts here.    "We have issued instructions in case a withdrawal is needed.  But it is certain this would be delicate," another UNPROFOR  officer said.    "We know that all our withdrawal routes can easily be cut.  In case of air strikes, I think our men will remain in place.  They are getting ready to protect themselves as best possible.  There's no question of withdrawing them a few hours ahead (of  an air strike), we would have to react after the event. In any  case, we aren't kept informed of everything in the offing," he  said.    In the snow and the cold which has dropped to minus 18  degrees Celsius (zero degrees Fahrenheit), French UNPROFOR  soldiers are camping out among the trenches and minefields of  the warring parties, knowing both sides hold them in their  gunsights.    "It is certain that one doesn't take such action without  risk," according to Lieutenant Colonel Richard Pernod.    "But in case of trouble, they (the soldiers) have their  armoured vehicles to protect them and allow them to move out.  And of course, we have planned the means to get them out if  their positions become untenable," he added.    In one such observation post, at Dobrinja, 16 French  soldiers  have been deployed for the past eight days, exactly between the  frontlines.    They have removed the mines from a few square meters (yards)  of territory, between two rows of blackened buildings where  Bosnian Serbs hold the left side of the street and Bosnian  Moslem the right side.    Armed shadows sometimes briefly appear behind blown-out  windows, while all entrances are mined. The two UN armoured  vehicles and two small tents appear lost in the midst of the  ruins.    In another observation post, at Vidikovac up on a hill, 17  soldiers are surrounded on three sides by Serb bunkers.    "We are going to build a shelter with bags of earth, beams  and wooden planks we have brought with us," said Lieutenant  Jean-Marie Pichouron.    But the frozen earth, under 50 centimeters (19 inches) of  snow, does not lend itself easily to such work.    "The Serbs are very welcoming. They have invited us to  dinner," one soldier said.    "They must say to themselves that while we are there, the  planes will certainly not fire on them," he added.</p>

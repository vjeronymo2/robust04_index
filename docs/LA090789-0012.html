			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESPITE CARE OFFERS PARENTS A BURDEN-FREE OASIS OF TIME  </P> <P> Think finding a good baby-sitter can be tough? Consider the dilemma of the  parent of a child suffering from Down's syndrome, autism or cerebral palsy.  </P> <P> But Joseph M. Palazzola, a customer service representative in the men's  sportswear industry, will take the job. So will teacher Patricia Morgan and  Postal Service letter carrier Marva Golden. They'll even come recommended, and  under the guidelines of the state Department of Developmental Services, it  won't cost the parent a penny.  </P> <P> Palazzola, Morgan and Golden are three of about 200 full- and part-time  state-funded "respite care workers" in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and  Antelope valleys. Depending on the seriousness of the disability, respite care  services can be authorized to provide from 12 to 36 hours of care per month,  regardless of the family's ability to pay.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Tremendous Help'  </P> <P> "I could not do without it," said Jean Ginsberg of Arleta, who is allowed 36  hours of respite care per month for her two retarded daughters, Rachel, 18, and  Dorothy, 17. "It's a tremendous help, allowing me to have a little time to  myself. It's also good for them to be with somebody else. They look forward to  it," she said.  </P> <P> "It's a birth-to-death child-care service if the child is eligible," explained  Ann Baerwald, director of client services at the North Los Angeles Regional  Center in Sepulveda. The program also serves children who fall into other  high-risk categories, including drug babies and premature infants.  </P> <P> Palazzola, 42, a former Vietnam medic, prefers to think of himself as a big  brother rather than a caretaker. "There's a lot of pleasure in it," Palazzola  said of working with children and young adults, most on a long-term basis.  "Seeing a person start a project they haven't done in the past, whether it's  ordering food for themselves, making change correctly or watching them learn  how to transfer from one bus to the next and get home again gives you a great  feeling."  </P> <P> He thinks many of his charges don't get out enough, either because both parents  work or the disabled child may be part of a larger family. "I'll put them in  the car and we'll take off, maybe go to the park, the beach, take a long walk  or just sit and talk sports. I try for a one-on-one relationship."  </P> <P> Morgan's full-time job as a teacher of developmentally disabled students in the  Los Angeles Unified School District suits her for respite care work. Averaging  15 hours a week at night and on weekends, the 40-year-old said she does it  because "I enjoy working with handicapped children; it's an excellent learning  experience."  </P> <P> Marva Golden, 39, walks a neighborhood in Northridge all day delivering the  mail. At night and on weekends, the certified nurse's aide works about 12 hours  a week with small children suffering from Down's syndrome or cerebral palsy.  "They're special kids," she said, "and they make me really appreciate coming  home to my healthy 15-year-old son."  </P> <P> The state provides assistance through a network of 21 not-for-profit  corporations established in 1966. The local regional center is one such  corporation which, in turn, contracts with various other companies and  corporations to provide suitable workers.  </P> <P> The regional center gets the majority of its workers through the Job Shop in  Reseda, a company specializing in in-home care; the Jay Nolan Center, a  not-for-profit corporation in Canyon Country specializing in dealing with the  developmentally handicapped, and Accredited Nursing Services in Encino, which  provides full- and part-time workers who are qualified as nurse's aides. All  three draw on a large pool of people with a variety of backgrounds but with the  common interest of helping developmentally disabled children.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1964 Study  </P> <P> Respite home child care, said the regional center's Baerwald, is the direct  result of a 1964 study commissioned by the state that recommended helping  families by setting up home care services at fixed locations. The regional  center concept was born two years later.  </P> <P> "The whole idea is to give the parents some respite," said Ellyn Hayes of the  Jay Nolan Center, who stresses the importance of keeping disabled children at  home rather than institutionalizing them.  </P> <P> The Jay Nolan Center, which provides about 10,000 in-home care hours a month,  also has a private sitter program for families who prefer someone they know to  take care of the disabled child. "It can be a relative as long as it is not  someone who lives in the same home, or a neighbor, a friend or anyone that the  family trusts with their child. After filling out the required paper work, they  are paid through us," Hayes said. (The center, which opened 10 years ago, was  named after the autistic son of late actor Lloyd Nolan.)  </P> <P> Accredited Nursing Services splits its business between dealing with the  geriatric population and providing respite care for regional center clients,  said President Barry Berger. The Job Shop does a variety of temporary and  permanent placement services in addition to working with various regional  centers, including elderly care and visitation monitoring in court cases.  </P> <P> "We watch the handicapped, the retarded, the epileptic, the autistic, the  quadriplegic, the paraplegic, combinations of two and three of these, so the  parent can get away for a few hours a week and take care of their other  siblings," explained The Job Shop owner, Newton Fletcher. "There is no  difference in taking care of a mentally handicapped child. If it's a  14-year-old with the capacity of a 3-year-old, you take care of a 3-year-old."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Care for Anyone  </P> <P> Fletcher, who also has a regular baby-sitting service, said his motto is,  "We'll take care of anybody from birth to death so long as it's legal, ethical  and moral."  </P> <P> All three firms receive a pre-negotiated fee from the regional center, ranging  from $7.46 to $8.38 for each hour of respite care work. In turn, the sitter  receives from $4.50 to $5.50 depending on the firm; the rest goes toward  operating expenses.  </P> <P> Hayes warns that some sitters burn out when they realize it can be emotionally  taxing. "Many people believe it's an easy way to make a little extra money,"  she said. "They soon learn otherwise."  </P> <P> Denise Peters, a Los Angeles City Unified School District teacher who works  part time for Accredited Nursing, agrees, but adds, "The greatest joy is the  pure, unadulterated love these kids give. The kids make it the best job in the  world."  </P> <P> For more information on Respite Child Care, contact the North Los Angeles  Regional Center, 8353 Sepulveda Blvd., Sepulveda, 91343-6512, (818) 891-0920.  </P></p>

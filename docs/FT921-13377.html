			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Master fixer: Egon Klepsch, the European Parliament's newly elected president The European Parliament today is far in distance, time and nature from Chicago of the 1960s. But it has just gained in Mr Egon Klepsch, an avuncular German Christian Democrat, a president whose skill in political fixing rivals that of the late Richard Daley, legendary boss of the mid-west city. A Daleyesque talent for exercising power may be just what the European Community's chaotic transnational parliament now needs. This nomadic circus of a legislature - rotating between Strasbourg (plenary sessions), Brussels (committee meetings) and Luxembourg (staff base) - has barely organised itself properly to use the powers awarded to it by the 1986 Single European Act, let alone what it will get once the Maastricht agreement is ratified and implemented. The keynote of Mr Klepsch's inaugural appeal to fellow MEPs last week was, therefore, no surprise. 'Let us do our utmost, acting resolutely, responsibly and effectively and in a way which is comprehensible to the people of Europe, to make use of the powers which the Parliament has just acquired (at Maastricht),' he said. These powers, bestowed from above rather than earned from below, now give the Parliament a chance to disprove the quip so often made of it - that powerlessness corrupts, and absolute powerlessness corrupts absolutely. Once the Parliament gets its act together, 'then we will be able to address directly to the citizens of Europe, who will no longer accuse us of gobbledygook,' says Mr Klepsch. For all their whispering in the Strasbourg corridors about underhand methods and tainted tactics used by Mr Klepsch in his climb to the top, most MEPs heartily welcome his interest in internal reform. It is better, the majority say, to have a parliamentary professional, warts and all, at the rostrum than an inefficient amateur like his Spanish socialist predecessor, Mr Enrique Baron. It is also appropriate that the Parliament's new president should have a direct line to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who strove mightily last year to get his fellow EC leaders to accept more powers for the Strasbourg assembly. Mr Klepsch and Mr Kohl go back to the mid-1950s when they both cut their political teeth in the Rhineland-Palatinate. It will certainly do the Parliament no harm for it to be led into budgetary or legislative battle with the other EC institutions by a close ally of Europe's most powerful leader. Mr Klepsch has won himself brownie points in Bonn by taking the lead in proposing 18 extra MEPs for the newly enlarged Germany. The Maastricht summit only agreed to study extra representation for Germany, because France bridled at the notion of losing its treasured political parity with Germany. 'But I am sure we will get the extra MEPs,' he says. Winning extra seats for Germany is a natural goal for Mr Klepsch, who escaped from East Germany as a 20-year-old in 1950. He came up the hard way, supporting himself through the university of Marburg as a part-time packer of washing machines and carpenter. And he has been nailing deals together ever since, first in the Bundestag and since 1973 in the European Parliament. Amid MEPs' mutterings about sharp practice, only one firm charge has ever been made, and admitted. This was when in 1981 he was spotted pushing the voting button of a fellow Christian Democrat as well as his own. Mr Klepsch says he was only doing what was common at the time, and that he has never done it since. When he was asked at his first presidential press conference about the 1981 incident, he told reporters: 'This exercises you more than I intend to be exercised by it.' Mr Klepsch has that fortunate combination for a politician - a thick skin and sensitive political antennae, tuned to the first hint of revolt or discontent. There has always been some of that. It is an open secret that he does not get on well with Mr Leo Tindemans, the former Belgian prime minister, who last week succeeded Mr Klepsch as leader of the 128-strong Christian Democrat group in Strasbourg. His unrivalled knowledge of what transpires within the Parliament is due in part to the fact that he knows everyone - even the doormen - and in part to the fact that even his spare time is spent playing skat, a popular German card game, with fellow Christian Democrat deputies, and discussing politics. Consensus politics is far from being a dirty word for Mr Klepsch. 'We are in fact condemned to practising consensus politics,' he says. This is because of the requirement that the Parliament muster 260 votes, or an absolute majority of its 518 members, to exercise any of the important law-amending or treaty-approving powers that it got under the Single European Act or will get under the Maastricht treaty. No EC country imposes such a voting threshold on its legislature (except in revising constitutions). But EC governments have imposed it on Strasbourg to test the seriousness of a Parliament that none of them totally trust. Mr Klepsch does not quarrel with this. Indeed he says it is essential 'because we are legislating for 12 different countries' with very different political strands in them. We need to find solutions to fit the bill for the whole Community,' he says. What Strasbourg-style consensus means in practice is constant deal-making between the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, the largest group with 180 MEPs. This worked smoothly through much of the 1980s when there was another German, Mr Rudi Arndt, in charge of the Socialists. It is less smooth-running now, with the more acerbic Mr Jean-Pierre Cot leading a Socialist group that now contains as its largest national contingent 45 UK Labour MEPs, for whom there is something unholy about cosying up to a Christian Democrat group that is considering taking in the British Tories. But as their price for backing - or at least not opposing - Mr Klepsch for the presidency, the Socialists last week secured most of the key committee chairmanships. This includes a new foreign affairs committee to be presided over, rather aptly, by Mr Baron, who was criticised widely during his presidential term for spending too much time posturing on the international stage. Another fruit of this Christian Democrat-Socialist compact was last week's rule changes. These were essentially aimed at preventing plenary sessions being cluttered up with endless amendments. Up to now, during the weekly plenary session each month MEPs have spent some seven to eight hours merely voting on - not even debating - about 1,000 amendments. The main change makes it harder for an amendment, lost in committee, to be re-presented in the plenary. 'We must deal with technicalities in committee, and keep the plenaries for debating the big issues that people care about,' Mr Klepsch says. Once Maastricht comes into effect, the Parliament will have a real say on almost all of the big issues confronting the EC. Mr Klepsch particularly prizes the expanded treaty-vetting power of the Parliament, which goes beyond the rights of most national EC legislatures and matches that of the US Senate. Will that make the European Parliament the difficult international partner that the US Senate has often been? (MEPs, for instance, last week voted down aid packages for Morocco and Syria, on human rights grounds.) No, says Mr Klepsch. 'If the Council and Commission take us seriously and provide full information, we will behave seriously.'</p>

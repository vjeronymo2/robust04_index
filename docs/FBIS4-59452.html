			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary from the "Issues and Events" </F> program]    [Excerpt] The firing of missiles by the gang of secession  and apostasy on the capital, Sanaa, and on Ta'izz has no  worthwhile result but to claim the lives of innocent people and  terrorize defenseless citizens. Those who are perpetrating this  criminal act know long-range missile attacks will never affect  the current military situation or the outcome of the military  operations raging only a few kilometers from Aden, where the  gang of secession and apostasy is standing in trenches. The  only option for this gang is to surrender, leave the homeland  and enjoy the public funds it has looted, or commit suicide.    Despite the fact that the missiles have harmed a number of  citizens, martyring some of them in the capital, Sanaa, and in  the city of Ta'izz, they have not adversely affected the psyche  of the forces struggling to protect unity and defend  constitutional legitimacy. This is because the forces of unity  have a human and geographic depth, thus making them more  steadfast and stronger. Moreover, all members of these forces  enjoy resolve and unwavering faith in victory.    We say without exaggeration that the cowardly missile  attacks  on the capital, Sanaa, and on Ta'izz will only increase the  determination of the sons of our proud Armed Forces to move  forward until they arrest the rebellious gang of apostasy and  secession. These forces are struggling for unity and for  defending Constitutional legitimacy. The people's sons are  waiting to hold this gang to account for what it deserves for  the crimes it has committed against the people and their  resources.    The missile attacks on the capital, Sanaa, and on Ta'izz  have  revealed both the impotence and the grudge of the gang of  apostasy and secession. This gang knows well that these  missiles cannot affect the course and results of the military  operations whose theaters have approached the outskirts of Aden.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Water price deals proposed FOUR more water companies have proposed deals with Ofwat, the water regulator, that would reduce the scope for varying annual price rises. Ofwat, which sets the increases, has sometimes requested companies to restrain increases, while companies have sometimes negotiated extra rises to cover unexpected costs. Under the proposed deals between Ofwat and Southern Water, North East Water, Essex Water and Suffolk Water price rises will be more predictable. Similar deals have been made with five other companies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Leszek Miller, labor and social policy </F> minister, by unidentified reporters in Warsaw on the "Hundred  Questions To..." program--live]    [Excerpts] [Reporter] Mr. Minister, you mentioned money.  How much money do you specifically need, and how would you spend  it?    [Miller] You know, of course I need more of it than I have  right now, but I am happy that, at least when it comes to some  items, I have more money than I used to. For instance, when it  comes to active forms of combating unemployment, my ministry has  almost 6 trillions zlotys [Z] at its disposal right now, whereas  we used to have just Z3.5 trillion. That is an increase of over  60 percent. So there are reasons for me to be happy with that.  But, when it comes to social assistance, the situation is not  as good there. The Z16 trillion that constitute the amount at  the disposal of local governors will meet this year's needs at  approximately the same level as last year. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] There is ever more talk of unfulfilled election  promises that were made by the now governing coalition, even  though only six months have gone by. When asked whether he will  sign the budget, President Walesa said that, if he does decide  to sign it, it will be with the reservation that society was  treated with disregard once again, in the sense that something  was promised to society, and it is being given something  completely different right now. Are you to blame for that?    [Miller] Because you want to talk about election promises,  let me remind you that there were all kinds of promises made  then. For instance, our opponents from the election campaign  used to say that, if the left wing wins, political isolation of  Poland will follow. That did not happen. They also said there  would be economic isolation, as well, that the West would turn  its back on us. That did not happen, either. These opponents  also said it is time to start buying vinegar in grocery  stores--and, as far as I can recall, Mr. Borusewicz said he has  already done that--because there will be nothing left in the  stores. They also said one would have to introduce  food-rationing coupons and so forth. So let us also confront  these promises that were made back then. Of course, I am happy  that these particular promises have nothing to do with the  current reality. But what I would have to do is ask you  [addressing the reporter] which specific promise you mean. If,  for instance, you mean that we said that the level of the lowest  retirement pensions and other kinds of pensions must be raised,  the fact is that we did even more than what we promised because  we said we would implement a 3-percentage-point raise effective  1 January, but, when it comes to retirement pensions, the actual  raise is 4 percent. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, I am not sure why, but there have  been no questions so far on the strike situation. Do you plan  on using force in the event of a general strike or if  electricity is cut off from the building of the Council of  Ministers' Office [URM]? There are such doubts in trade union  circles.    [Miller] I cannot assume that a situation could take place  where the URM building should be deprived of electricity because  there are other ways of supplying it there.    [Reporter] But when it comes to a general strike?    [Miller] Of course, a general strike is a big danger, and,  because you mentioned it, the current conflict with Solidarity  is taking place kind of on two levels: The first level is about  real social problems. After all, no sane person could say that  there are no families for whom life is extremely difficult; in  fact, the situation of many Polish families is indeed tragic.  But the other level of the dispute is about an argument  concerning the ways and methods of solving the conflicts. We  cannot treat Solidarity any differently from all of the other  trade unions. The previous government treated Solidarity in a  privileged way, and then it was brought down by that very  Solidarity. We cannot make the same mistake. We will be trying  to establish such areas of negotiation that are based on equal  treatment of all trade union centers. So, if Solidarity wants  to force the government to treat it differently, the government  will be in a very difficult position. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Are you not afraid of other kinds of dangers?  After all, we had a debate on the budget in the Sejm, but the  president does not have to sign the budget, anyway. It may turn  out that a completely new situation will emerge. What will the  coalition and you do then?    [Miller] Of course, Mr. President does not have to sign the  budget, but the budget will be in force anyway because I am  convinced that the Sejm would reject a presidential veto. That  is because even those Sejm deputies who voted against the budget  when it was being voted would vote against the president right  now. Simply put, the Sejm will be aware of what it would mean.  A nonrejection of a presidential veto would mean the Sejm's  dissolution. I think that, if the president were to make such a  move, the intention would be to have the Sejm dissolved. Well,  the fact is that the Sejm will successfully defend itself  against that. So I would simply urge Mr. President to just sign  the budget. [passage omitted]</p>

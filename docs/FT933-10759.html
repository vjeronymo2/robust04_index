			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Australian Government Bonds: Focus on calm away from ERM storm FAR away from the trials and tribulations of Europe's exchange rate mechanism, the Australian government bond market has been rallying, helped by expectations of monetary easing and a new-found status as a safe haven from Europe's currency storms. However, with the half-point cut in Australian interest rates on Friday, many investors may wonder whether there is further to go in the bond market rally, or whether it is best to take profits and switch their money elsewhere. Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said Friday's reduction in overnight interest rates from 5.25 per cent to 4.75 per cent was 'in response to evidence of continuing slow growth and low inflation'. The interest rate cut marks the 15th time the Reserve Bank of Australia has eased rates since they peaked at 18 per cent in January 1990, and is the second reduction since the prime minister Mr Paul Keating won the March general election. The lower cash rate should be passed on by financial institutions to borrowers in the corporate and household sector. The government bond market, which had been expecting an easing in interest rates for some time, rallied on last Friday's news, although profit-taking held the day's gains in check and the market closed a little higher on the day. The yield on the 10-year benchmark government bond reached 6.9 per cent, a 20-year low. The yield on 10-year bonds has fallen during 1993, from a January 6 high of 9.12 per cent. The currency held up well, with the Australian dollar firming to a high of USDollars 0.6845 before moving back to USDollars 0.6835. That the interest rate cut was widely expected was due mainly to the economic data released last week. The consumer price index rose 0.4 per cent in the June quarter, giving an annual rate of 1.9 per cent. Economists say that, given the weak state of the economy, there is little risk of a surge in inflationary pressures in the next year. Mr Fraser said inflation remained under control, with the underlying rate at between 2 per cent and 3 per cent. However, with economic recovery apparently proceeding at a modest pace, he warned that 'faster growth of private-sector activity was necessary to generate more jobs and reduce unemployment', currently more than 10 per cent. 'In the board's judgment, the combination of a sluggish rate of recovery, relatively high real interest rates, and low inflation warrant a further modest fall in cash rates,' Mr Fraser said. However, some economists are recommending that investors take profits at the long end of the market now, pointing out that last week's interest rate cut could be the last for some time. 'I don't see a unilateral fall in rates at these levels - long yields should now consolidate at around 6.75 per cent -7.25 per cent, and if we see US rates trending up, that would probably influence Australian rates,' warned one analyst.</p>

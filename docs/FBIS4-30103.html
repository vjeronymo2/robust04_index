In a by-lined article titled "Clairvoyance in Building  Socialism With Bright Future" the paper says the history of the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership is shining as  glorious annals of an outstanding leader who has guided the  cause of socialism along the most correct way with clairvoyance  to successfully build socialism.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said:    "Since Comrade Kim Chong-il began his leadership, fresh  changes have taken place not only in the party work but also in  different domains of politics, economy and culture and great  innovations and upsurge have been effected in all sectors of  socialist construction."    The clairvoyance of Comrade Kim Chong-il in triumphantly  leading the cause of socialism has been demonstrated in  constantly developing in depth socialism on a new ideological  and theoretical basis with deep insight into the demand of the  time.    He comprehensively systematized the fundamental principle  and  contents of the chuche idea with energetic thinking and pursuit.  He proved in a scientific way that only the chuche idea, the  revolutionary idea centred on the popular masses which gives the  man-centred outlook on the world, is the guiding idea which  makes it possible to solve most correctly all the problems  arising in the accomplishment of the socialist cause. Then, he  proclaimed the chuche idea as the guiding idea and theory of our  age by formulating the revolutionary idea of the respected  leader Comrade Kim Il-song as the system of the idea, theory and  method of chuche.    His clairvoyance has been displayed also in that he has  wisely guided the efforts to strengthen the party and enhance  its leadership function and role, in compliance with the  prospective demand of socialist and communist construction,  grasping this as the main point, and has always kept to our way,  the way of chuche in socialist construction.    He gave a comprehensive exposition of original policies  envisaging that the party's leadership must be continued in the  communist society. And he has strengthened and developed our  party to be a tested guide of the cause of socialism and  communism and constantly enhanced its role with energetic  guidance.    He set forth the revolutionary slogan "Let us live our own  way!" With the chuche-based will and faith that the Korean  revolutionaries must build socialism and communism on the land  of Korea and build an ideal society of the people with our own  efforts in conformity with our people's aspiration and will.  And he has wisely led the revolution and construction so that  they could be carried on in the Korean way, the way of chuche.    It is a splendid fruition of the wise guidance of the dear  leader with clairvoyance that an invincible socialism is  confidently advancing along its own way without the slightest  vacillation under any circumstances has been built in our  country, stresses the article.</p>

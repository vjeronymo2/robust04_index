			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said he was  especially satisfied with the outcome of his official talks with  U.S. President Bill Clinton. Athens News Agency reported today  from Washington that after meeting U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes  and U.S. Presidential Adviser George Stephanopoulos, the prime  minister said he is optimistic about the issue of Skopje [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Papandreou  stressed that many opposing forces operate in politics and no  one can predict developments with certainty.    Papandreou added that in the United States he found a very  warm welcome and support for Greece and noted that for the first  time it was recognized that Greece has rights that are being  violated. Discussing Greek-Turkish relations, the prime minister  said that Washington is under the impression that the  possibilities for positive Greek-Turkish relations are greater  than we think.    In light of Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias' meeting with  international mediator Cyrus Vance in New York, U.S.  Presidential envoy to Skopje Matthew Nimetz met Foreign Ministry  Secretary General Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis at the Greek  Embassy.    The official part of Papandreou's visit to Washington  concluded last night with a reception hosted by the Greek  ambassador at the Embassy. The prime minister and his  delegation will leave for New York today.</p>

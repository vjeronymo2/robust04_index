			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Improvement of DPRK-U.S. Relations" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- If the United States  choose to improve its relations with the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea from a sincere stand, not setting unreasonable  preconditions, we will make energetic efforts for the  improvement of the relations between the two countries, not  looking back on the past but looking forward to the future,  declares NODONG SINMUN in an editorial today.    Noting that 44 years have passed since the United States and  the South Korean rulers started a war of aggression against the  DPRK on June 25, 1950, the editorial says:    The victory of the Korean people in the fatherland  liberation  war furnished ample proof that no threat and strong arm of the  imperialists could subdue a people who rose up to defend the  sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation under  the wise leadership of the party and the leader.    The editorial headlined "Let Us End Confrontation and  Division and Advance Toward Peace and Reunification" further  says:    The Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK Government have in  the past period put forward most reasonable and realistic  proposals and programs for the improvement of the  confrontational DPRK-U.S. and North-South relations and for a  durable peace in the country and its peaceful reunification and  made every possible effort for their implementation. But they  have not borne fruits owing to the U.S. hostile policy toward  the DPRK and the anti-peace, anti- reunification splittist  manoeuvres of the South Korean rulers.    If the United States really do not want to see the  repetition  of the June 25 disasters on the Korean peninsula, it must  rectify its outdated Korean policy of blindly antagonizing the  DPRK and approaching the Korean issue from the stand of strength  and move ahead toward the termination of the hostile relations  between the two countries.    The military armistice system in Korea has been paralysed  today by a unilateral act of the United States. The United  States is talking much about the end of the Cold War and the  advent of peace. Should it truly want a durable peace on the  Korean peninsula, there would be no ground for it to refuse to  accept the peace proposal of the DPRK to replace the Korean  armistice agreement with a peace agreement and establish a new  peace arrangement and there would be no problem unsolvable in  its relations with the DPRK.    If the South Korean authorities want to take the road for  the  nation in the changed realities today, they should join in the  nationwide cause of achieving peace of the country and its  peaceful reunification, promoting the great unity of the nation  from the stand of national independence.    MINJU CHOSON in its editorial today says.    If the United States do not want the repetition of the  disasters of war on the Korean peninsula, it must bend efforts  for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue and a  substantial improvement of its overall relations with the DPRK  and respond at an early date to our proposal for the  establishment of a new peace arrangement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Taipei, June 4 (CNA) -- Chao Jen-ho,  secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said  at a press conference Saturday [4 June] that he hopes Mainland  China will send influential figures to Taiwan to learn what  Taiwan people are thinking.    Chao said both sides of the Taiwan Strait should step up  communications, and that if mainland representatives visited  here, they would realize the fact that Taiwan is a political  entity.    SEF is a semi-official organization set up to deal with  civilian exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.    Chao [words indistinct] he has invited Deng Pufang, son of  Mainland China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, to visit Taiwan  [words indistinct] any message through Deng Pufang to his  father. But he said he would not be opposed to inviting Deng  here, saying his visit would help cross-strait relations.    On his proposed meeting with Tang Shubei, standing vice  chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Strait (ARATS), Chao said that he hopes Tang can come to  Taiwan in July or August.    The previous Chao-Tang meeting, held early this year  produced  no concrete results on the issues of the repatriation of illegal  mainland immigrants and hijackers, and fishery disputes.  Meanwhile, on Saturday, SEF again sent a message to ARATS  concerning the Qiandao Lake incident in March, in which 24  Taiwan tourists were murdered. It was the ninth time he has  asked ARATS for help in resolving the incident. In this case,  SEF asked ARATS which insurance companies and travel agents will  be involved in compensating families of the Taiwan victims.    Relatives of the Taiwan victims Friday protested to the  Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), criticizing the government's  efforts to resolve the affair as weak. They faulted MAC and SEF  for their incompetence in negotiating a conclusion to the  incident.</p>

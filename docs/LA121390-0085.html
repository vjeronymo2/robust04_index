I want to see vocational education and  other items that are interesting to everybody so they won't drop out, because  the three Rs aren't doing it for them. That is my first priority," Sandoval  said. "We have laid the groundwork, now we need to refine and find the bugs  until we have what we really want." AMELIA CHAFFEE  </P></p>

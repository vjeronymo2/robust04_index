			<p>Summary:      The Japanese press reports that the National Space  Development Agency of Japan [NASDA] will keep its 1 February launch  date for the H-II rocket despite difficulties experienced during a  23 December fueling rehearsal.  The launch will be a major event  attracting nearly 1,000 government and company representatives, and  members of the press.      NASDA announced on 18 January that it will launch the H-II rocket  on 1 February, according to the 19 January MINAMI NIHON SHIMBUN.  NASDA held an unscheduled fueling rehearsal on 14 January after  problems were discovered during the scheduled rehearsal on 23  December.  During the December rehearsal problems arose in eight  places, including a leak in the helium pressure valves on the LE-7  main engine which resulted in insufficient pressure, according to  the 18 January MINAMI NIHON SHIMBUN.  During the 14 January  rehearsal the moveable nozzles on the the solid rocket boosters  developed problems, but NASDA "determined that they were not major"  and decided to keep the 1 February launch date.      NASDA may feel under pressure to proceed with the launch of the  H-II, which cost 2.7 trillion yen ($2.45 billion) to develop.  The  H-II launch has already been rescheduled twice, delaying the launch  about two years because of problems in developing the LE-7 main  engine.  In 1991 the LE-7 engine exploded during a pressure test and  killed a technician.  In 1992 another LE-7 caught on fire during a  combustion test, according to the 25 January NIKKEI SANGYO.  Furthermore, the launch of "Japan's first indigenously developed  large rocket" is being touted as "placing Japan on par with the  United States and Europe in space technology," and, according to the  23 January YOMIURI SHIMBUN, will attract "nearly 1,000 members of  the press, and NASDA and company representatives to Tanegashima."  The H-II rocket will be launched from the Yoshinobu launch pad at  the Tanegashima Space Center at 7 am on 1 February, according to the  19 January MINAMI NIHON SHIMBUN.  It will carry a 3.27-metric ton  payload consisting of the 865 kg OREX vehicle, and the 2.4-ton VEP.  The 24 January NIKKEI BUSINESS reports the objectives for the launch  are to 1) launch the rocket, 2) place the VEP in a transfer orbit,  and 3) have the OREX reenter. NASDA reportedly will consider the  launch a success if objectives one and two are accomplished.      The VEP, which is a dummy of experimental technology satellite 6  (ETS-6), is scheduled to separate 28 minutes after launch and enter  an elliptical stationary transfer orbit with an apogee of 36,200  kilometers and a perigee of about 450 kilometers.  Because its  apogee-motor fuel tanks will be loaded with water rather than fuel  it will remain in this transfer orbit.  The VEP's batteries will  give it a life of 100 hours and it will transmit H-II vibration and  orbit-positioning accuracy data to the ground during that time,  according to the 5 January SANKEI SHIMBUN.      The OREX will separate 14 minutes after launch and orbit the  earth once at 450 kilometers, according to the SANKEI SHIMBUN.  About 1 hour and 40 minutes after launch the OREX will fire its  retro rockets and reenter the atmosphere, according to the 27  October 93 NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN.  Two hours after launch OREX will  splash down in the Pacific near Christmas Island, according to the 5  January SANKEI SHIMBUN.  The 5 November MINAMI NIHON SHIMBUN reports  the OREX will not be recovered after splashdown because of the costs  that would be involved.      (AUTHOR:COOK.

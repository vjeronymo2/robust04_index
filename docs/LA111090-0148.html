			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINGER-POINTING OVER THE S.F. FESTIVAL THAT FAILED;  </P> <P> ARTS: ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE OPERATION OF FESTIVAL 2000 HAS BECOME A MAJOR  ISSUE FOR MANY ARTISTS AND ARTS ADMINISTRATORS.  </P> <P> As in a classic "Who-done-it?" mystery, members of the arts community here are  pointing fingers over who's responsible for the Festival 2000 debacle, the  failed $2.3-million multicultural arts program that finished $500,000 in debt.  </P> <P> People want to know if the October festival was overly ambitious in scope and  whether the city of San Francisco should have kept tighter reins on executive  director Lenwood Sloan and his 20-member staff.  </P> <P> Sloan, who recently left town to take a new job with the National Endowment for  the Arts in Washington, acknowledged making mistakes. But he said in an  interview here that those calling for financial "autopsy reports" are  overlooking the festival's artistic achievements. "The festival cannot be  measured from Oct. 6 to 23," he said, referring to the official run dates.  </P> <P> But he admitted blunders were made. "My mistake, in so far as managing goes,  was being blinded by my vision, being focused on the future dividends and not  hiring a P.T. Barnum, whose focus would be on getting bodies to the events."  </P> <P> Accountability for Festival 2000's operation and budget -- $1.8 million raised  from the city, the Rockefeller Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts,  box office receipts and other sources -- has become an overriding issue for  many artists and arts administrators.  </P> <P> "Nobody added up the numbers and said, 'You can't do this,"' said Bruce W.  Davis, vice president of the San Francisco Arts Democratic Club who has  produced many city festivals, including the annual San Francisco Ethnic Dance  Festival. "No matter how noble your artistic vision is, or righteous the cause  is, wishful thinking won't change the numbers. It looks like nobody asked the  question. It almost had the feeling of 'Our Gang' -- 'Let's do a show! Darla,  you do the costumes; Spanky, you set up the lights. "'  </P> <P> Plenty of questions are being asked now, especially after Wednesday's decision  by the festival's board of directors to declare bankruptcy. Letters to  creditors were sent out Thursday and attorney Suzanne Smith filed for Chapter 7  bankruptcy on behalf of the nonprofit organization Friday morning. A trustee  will liquidate the festival's assets, estimated to be worth about $75,000,  before doling out what little funds there are to creditors, according to Smith.  </P> <P> "We are literally out of business," said board member Al Wilson.  </P> <P> Two city agencies -- the San Francisco Arts Commission and Grants for the Arts  Program -- have agreed to a $100,000 bail-out of two dozen individuals and arts  groups that didn't receive their full payments for festival participation. But  others, including some national arts groups, remain thousands of dollars in the  hole.  </P> <P> San Francisco Supervisor Terence Hallinan has called for a Dec. 13 hearing to  review how the festival spent the city's $500,000 seed money. "I'm just after  what happened," he said. "You'd have to say that Mr. Sloan is where the ball  stops, or starts. He devoted his energies to the artistic part of it, and no  one was around to pick up the other end of it. Somebody should have been  checking up on things."  </P> <P> The supervisor plans to question the role of Kary Schulman, whose agency Grants  for the Arts provided Sloan with half-a-million dollars from the city's hotel  occupancy tax fund, seemingly with few strings attached.  </P> <P> Schulman says it is not under her purview to keep tabs on nonprofit groups.  "We're a small office, and we give funding to the arts," she said. "Had anyone  wanted to call us, we would have given advice. But this is not a technical  assistance office."  </P> <P> Sloan said even though the festival lost money, there will be artistic  "dividends" from the festival. There has been increased national interest in  some of the festival's artists and performers, such as a visual arts exhibit  that will tour the country.  </P> <P> "It was a relay race, and the last runner stumbled," he said. "The question is,  was the race worth it? The focus has been on the money and not on the work. The  whole thing has been taken out of context."  </P> <P> As for his resignation, Sloan said he left San Francisco for the NEA job --  which he assumed two weeks earlier than announced -- for a simple reason. "I  have to pay the rent." He said he had not been paid by the festival since Oct.  1.  </P> <P> Sloan acknowledged he erred by "not measuring the recessionary climate" and  "overreacting to the festival's initial response from individuals and  corporations." But he also said his work was plagued by politics.  </P> <P> "San Francisco is a political place; no one there operates outside of the  politics. I operated by referendum. When the visual artists wanted to be  represented, they were and the budget grew by $400,000. The same with a schools  component. They were added and the budget grew by $150,000. Right down to the  last day, we were hearing, 'Our community was never asked to participate in the  dialogue,' and 'We're being left out."'  </P> <P> "Everyone wanted to be front stage in this festival," festival organizer Davis  observed. "I guess he loved to say, 'Yes.' No is a hard word."  </P> <P> Schulman said the festival may have grown too big, too fast.  </P> <P> Davis said competing interests, and the battle to stay under budget, comes with  the turf.  </P> <P> "The festival was rooted in politics; it started on a political premise, that  multicultural arts aren't getting their just share of the pie. It was almost a  mission impossible to keep politics out of it.  </P> <P> "They failed miserably, and at a great cost and grief to people," he said.  "People are angry. San Francisco is proud of the fact that it has one of the  strongest professional arts communities in the country. Here was a moment of  glory that got covered with mud. We need to figure out what went wrong."  </P></p>

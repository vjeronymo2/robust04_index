			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi </F> Shams-al-Din, chairman of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council in  Lebanon, by Kamal Tarabayh on 2 April; place not given--recorded]    [Text] [Tarabayh] Your Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi  Shams-al-Din: During the Friday sermon you delivered yesterday,  you made clear your support for the measures the government has  taken, particularly with regard to the media issue. You said:  Freedom should not give rise to chaos. At the same time, it  should not result in repression or exclusion. My question is  the following: More than 10 days have passed since private radio  and television stations were banned from airing political news.  Since then, a cabinet session was held. However, a new media  bill has not been endorsed, as was previously announced. Your  Eminence, why do you think that this situation is not tantamount  to repression and exclusion, a development that shows a  violation of the law?    [Shams-al-Din] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. As you have said, I addressed this issue in my  Friday sermon yesterday. My support for the decisions made by  the Council of Ministers last week was couched in general terms.  I did not specifically address the decision made regarding the  media. Last week, we supported the government's decisions. We  said that we could understand the decision that was made with  regard to private media, and that we would wait until the  following week to see what the government would do with regard  to the media bill. The deadline announced for examining the  media bill has elapsed without any discussion of this bill.  That is why I raised the issue yesterday. I said I saw the  delay as an unfavorable development. I added that efforts to  endorse the bill must be expedited so that the current  suspension of the private media may be remedied. It is also  necessary to correct the previous status of the private media,  namely, their illegal operation. Also, outside the context of  this sermon, I have informed officials that they must expedite  efforts to endorse the media bill so that the suspension does  not become permanent and effectively turn into a law. We do not  want the suspension to be prolonged. Last week, we said frankly  that we do not at all agree to a monopoly of media activities by  the official media, underscoring the fact that citizens have the  right to listen to various viewpoints with regard to what is  taking place. Hence, I do not agree with the view that the  current situation is one of repression. Nonetheless, I do not  at all advise that the current status be prolonged. We are  closely following the situation to expedite the referral of the  media bill to the Chamber of Deputies. We are also urging the  Chamber of Deputies to quickly endorse this bill, God willing.    [Tarabayh] Your Eminence the Shaykh, have you received any  assurances from officials regarding a desire to speed up the  promulgation of a media law?    [Shams-al-Din] I have had no direct assurances. However, I  know that the government wants to get it over with.    [Tarabayh] Your Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din,  I want to shift to another topic. In his Easter address, His  Beatitude Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Sfayr said the state has  not treated all people equally, nor has it made the Christians  feel that it is embracing them like other citizens. Do you  subscribe to the idea that there is some defect in the way the  state has been treating a part of the sons of the homeland?    [Shams-al-Din] I deeply regret, an I am saddened by, what  has happened. I do not agree with the ideas presented by His  Beatitude Patriarch Sfayr in his sermon yesterday. I do not  approve of the content. We spoke last week with his beatitude  about the form as well. First of all, to say that the state  does not embrace Christians is not justified, as far as I am  concerned. As for the justifications advanced by his beatitude  the patriarch, he knows more about these. We will get in touch  with him to discuss this view the way it was presented in  yesterday's sermon. We think that the state looks after  citizens equally. If some individuals or groups do not feel  they are being looked after properly, maybe they themselves are  responsible for this and not the state. I am not implying that  the state is infallible and cannot make mistakes. Doubtless,  there are mistakes committed by the state as a whole or by its  institutions. However, these mistakes do not reach the degree  espoused by his beatitude the patriarch. Therefore, I hope --  and I have repeatedly said this publicly and secretly -- that  disputable issues will be presented in a way that contributes to  unifying positions and helping the state assume its  responsibilities and avoid making mistakes.    [Shams-al-Din] We respect his beatitude the patriarch. His  voice is one of the pure and sincere voices. However, only God  is infallible. We wanted to hear from him what I appealed for  him to give -- a speech of hope and confidence. As everybody  knows, I am personally concerned about the Christian citizens,  who are also my fellow men. We have a responsibility toward all  citizens. I am not responsible for the Muslim citizens more  than the Christian citizens. I am responsible for the Muslim  citizens in terms of religion more than the Christians. On the  political level and in terms of citizens' rights, I reiterate  that I am also responsible for the Christians. I hope that all  Lebanese in high positions feel the same. His beatitude the  patriarch should also be responsible for the Muslim citizens as  he is responsible for the Christian citizens.    [Tarabayh] Your eminence, my last question is the following:  Is it possible to see your voices -- as leaders of the spiritual  communities in Lebanon -- united and unifying the ranks through  a religious summit, for example?    [Shams-al-Din] This is my objective. I believe that the  existing situation requires the convening of such a spiritual  summit. This issue has been my main concern for the past two  days. I will make some moves in this direction in this week,  because the present situation requires such a meeting even  though relations with the other brothers are continuous. We  always exchange opinions and we are in continuous contact. I  spoke with the patriarch two days ago. I am thinking seriously  about convening a spiritual summit.    [Tarabayh] Your Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din,  thank you.    [Shams-al-Din] May God preserve you all.</p>

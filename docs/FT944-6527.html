			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: JLI shows 31% growth to Pounds 1.73m Despite the continuing 'difficult trading environment', JLI Group, the food processing and snacks company, reported pre-tax profits up by 31 per cent from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds 1.73m for the six months to end-September. The advance was achieved on turnover of Pounds 54.3m (Pounds 52.5m), including Pounds 1.6m from acquisitions, with each of the three divisions making a 'solid contribution', according to Mr Yoav Gottesman, chairman. Within food services, which achieved operating profits of Pounds 931,000 (Pounds 877,000) on turnover of Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 19.8m), Jack L Israel had further strengthened its position as a supplier to the catering industry, the chairman said. The reorganisation in the snacks division had also been successful, he said, with operating profits up from Pounds 310,000 to Pounds 784,000 on turnover down from Pounds 15m to Pounds 13.9m. Kernels Snack Products, the nut processing business acquired in April, had met expectations and was now fully integrated. The food ingredients side, helped by contributions from Turban and Frozen Herbs, turned in Pounds 887,000 (Pounds 660,000) on turnover up Pounds 2m to Pounds 19.8m. Earnings emerged at 2.8p (2.1p) and the interim dividend is 1.65p (1.6p). The shares closed down 1p at 92p. Mr Gottesman said the impact of the three cash acquisitions made in the past 12 months, coupled with the seasonally high stock and debtor levels, had increased gearing in the short term. Analysts are forecasting profits in the region of Pounds 5m for the year.</p>

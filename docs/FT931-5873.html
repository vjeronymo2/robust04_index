			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / World Trade News: White House to back US chip makers THE Clinton administration is ready to take a tough stand on the long-running semiconductor trade dispute with Japan, Mr Ronald Brown, commerce secretary, told US semiconductor industry executives visiting Washington this week for their annual caucus. 'When every market in the world, outside Japan, prefers your products, I have to conclude that we are facing unfair trading barriers. We expect Japan to live up to its agreements,' Mr Brown told members of the Semiconductor Industry Association, who gave him a standing ovation. Under a 1991 trade agreement between the US and Japan, the Japanese government recognised US 'expectations' that the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market should rise to at least 20 per cent by the end of 1992. The pact was an extension of a similar 1985 agreement. Since 1991, the foreign chip maker's market share in Japan has crept upward, reaching almost 16 per cent in the third quarter of 1992. Data for the fourth and final quarter of the period covered by the agreement is expected in about two weeks. However, the industry expects the market share figure, upon which Japan's compliance with the market opening agreement is measured, to rise. Strong sales of US-made microprocessors in the growing Japanese personal computer market may boost the fourth quarter figure by more than 1 per cent. Disputes over how market share should be measured, including whether the internal transfer 'sales' of IBM and other US computer companies to their Japanese subsidiaries should be counted in the trade data, might bring the disputed market share figure within range of its target. This has created a dilemma for the US chip makers, who for the first time in their decade-long trade battle find that they have friends in the White House. In the past, the SIA has seldom hesitated to raise the spectre of trade sanctions against Japan. Now, however, the industry seems hesitant to push the Clinton administration into applying sanctions that would inevitably be seen as the beginning of a 'trade war' with Japan. There is no question, however, that the industry will demand sanctions if the market share figure falls short of expectations. The industry group already has a list of proposed Japanese import targets. The group was encouraged by Mr Brown's remarks. 'A few years back, unfair trading practices in the Far East almost destroyed the American semiconductor industry. It took harsh action to end Japanese dumping. We must be prepared to act again - in Japan or any other market,' Mr Brown said in reference to trade sanctions imposed by President Reagan against Japan in 1986 when Japan was deemed to have failed to live up to the original US-Japan semiconductor deal. 'We expect Japan to live up to its agreements. I will work closely with you to evaluate their performance against the objectives of our agreements. We want to ensure that the Japanese market is open so that we can achieve a market share commensurate with our worldwide competitive position.' Mr Brown also assured the semiconductor industry group that the Clinton administration will continue to fund Sematech, the semiconductor industry consortium that for the past five years has received half its annual budget from the Pentagon's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, over the occasional objections of Bush administration officials, and the remaining half from industry members. Sematech is a model for the Clinton administration's technology policy, Mr Brown said.</p>

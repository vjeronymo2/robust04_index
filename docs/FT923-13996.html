			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / M-way funds decision MR JOHN MacGREGOR, transport secretary, said yesterday there would be no government funding for the east coast motorway proposed by a consortium of public and private sector interests in east and north-east England. Mr MacGregor said it was not worth spending Pounds 950m on a motorway from London to Humberside and Cleveland because the the government was already upgrading the nearby A1 to motorway standard at a cost of Pounds 1.5bn.</p>

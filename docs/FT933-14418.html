			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Comalco lifts smelter stake by 20% COMALCO, the Australian aluminium producer, is to buy a further 20 per cent stake in the Boyne Island smelter in Queensland for about ADollars 200m (USDollars 136m) from Metall Aktiengesellschaft, the Austrian metals group. The purchase would lift Comalco's interest in the smelter to 50 per cent and comes as the company is close to a decision on adding a new potline which would lift annual aluminium capacity by about 85 per cent. Construction of the new potline, being considered despite the glut in world aluminium supplies, would add about 200,000 tonnes to the smelter's annual capacity of 230,000 tonnes of primary metal. Mr Nick Stump, Comalco chief executive, said the proportion of ownership in the new potline was still under discussion with remaining shareholders - a consortium of five Japanese companies. Deliberations also included arrangements for electric power for the smelter from the Gladstone power station, controlled by the Queensland government, and a decision was expected by the end of 1993. One option being considered by the company is outright purchase of the Gladstone power station. Comalco is also involved in talks on power supplies to the two other smelters it controls, at Bell Bay in Tasmania and at Tiwai Point in New Zealand. 'This (purchase) decision is consistent with Comalco's previously announced strategy to concentrate its future investment in the upstream (bauxite to metal) sector of the aluminium industry,' Mr Stump said. 'The additional supply will allow Comalco to service its increasing customer base in export markets.' Mr Stump said AMAG, which is controlled by the Austrian government, had expressed a wish to end its interest in the smelter early this year as part of a plan to focus more closely on the company's European fabricating operations. The smelter, which began production in 1982, operates under a consortium tolling arrangement with participants taking metal in line with their equity shares. AMAG has been a partner since 1989. The acquisition includes AMAG's shares in the smelter, working capital and other funding obligations attached to the interest. The purchase price is subject to minor adjustments and to approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board.</p>

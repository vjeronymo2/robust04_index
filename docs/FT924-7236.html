			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: ACIL to make fresh offer to repurchase receipts AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Investments (ACIL), the Australian investment company which owns the former Bell Resources, is making a second offer to repurchase the receipts of convertible bondholders with whom they are involved in a legal dispute. The first offer closed last month with a level of 40 per cent acceptances. The original dispute arose when bondholders tried to exercise a put option providing for early repayment of principal at 117.7 per cent of par value on November 13, 1991. Instead, bonds were redeemed at 103 per cent of their par value, when the company exercised its call option, and gave receipts to bondholders. Earlier this year, the UK Court of Appeal decided in favour of the investors, however ACIL has pursued the matter and is currently waiting for the House of Lords to decide whether to allow an appeal. The latest offer to buy back receipts is on the same terms as the first offer, at a price of 10 cents on the dollar, compared with 14.7 cents a dollar, if the Court of Appeal's decision is upheld. However, a House of Lords appeal may take some considerable time. Mr Colin Henson, executive director of ACIL, said yesterday that the appeal will go ahead even if the company succeeds in buying back the majority of receipts.</p>

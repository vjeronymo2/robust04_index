			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Minister offers BR talks on pensions THE GOVERNMENT is offering to negotiate with British Rail's board of directors over the future of BR's Pounds 8.5bn pension scheme after privatisation. However, it has not backed down from its initial proposals that would allow it to take a portion of the scheme's assets in exchange for a promise to increase pensions in line with inflation - the BR scheme's current policy. Last week BR's directors privately told the government that proposals for the pension schemes after privatisation were inadequate and needed improvement. Specifically, the directors are seeking the right of BR employees who transfer involuntarily to the private sector to remain members of a joint industry scheme as long as they do not leave railway employment. Yesterday Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, said: 'The government does not rule out the possibility that the existing British Rail scheme could remain open in the short term and the pensioners remain in it with existing British Rail staff.' The government contemplates that scheme members could then have five years' grace until privatisation is completed. 'I do not at present see a need for individuals to have a right to remain in the joint industry scheme. But we will discuss this idea further with the trustees and others,' Mr Freeman said. The government had proposed that all current employees whose division is privatised would be required to leave the BR scheme and join their new employer's scheme. BR directors told the government it could not support plans to review the annual contribution to the pension scheme made under the Transport Act 1980. The BR board also rejected two government options to provide benefits for current and deferred pensioners - those who have left BR employment but have not yet reached retirement age. One proposal involved running the pension scheme as a closed fund with current assets. In the other the government would take a portion of the pension scheme's assets for itself, guarantee annual increases in line with inflation but would rule out any improvements in benefits.</p>

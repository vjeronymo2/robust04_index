			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Goodyear spells out five-year strategy Goodyear chairman Mr Stanley Gault has spelt out a new five-year plan for the US tyre company, including a dividend policy allowing a payout of between one-fifth and one-quarter of the previous year's earnings. Mr Gault, who recently agreed to stay with the company until the end of 1995 rather than retire at the end of this year, has overseen a strong recovery since joining Goodyear three years ago. Goodyear has lifted its dividend from 5 cents a quarter in 1991 to 15 cents now, after a share split last year. At the current level, it will pay out Dollars 120m in dividends this year - close to a third of last year's net income of Dollars 388m, and ahead of the new dividend rate. With the US automotive industry performing strongly, Goodyear's after-tax earnings are widely expected to rise to between Dollars 560m and Dollars 570m this year. Targets set this week include a reduction in the company's gearing from 40 per cent to between 25 and 30 per cent by the end of 1998. Goodyear's debt has already come down to Dollars 1.4bn, from Dollars 3.7bn in 1991. Sales are expected to grow at between 4.5 and 5 per cent a year until the end of 1998, twice the projected rate of growth in the tyre industry as a whole, Mr Gault said.</p>

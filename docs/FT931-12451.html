			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Profits warning from Remy as sales slide REMY-COINTREAU, one of France's leading drinks groups, yesterday issued a profits warning for 1992 because of the sluggish economic environment and the impact of high French interest rates. Remy, which has extensive interests in champagne as well as its signature Remy-Martin and Cointreau spirits brands, suffered a 7.5 per cent fall in turnover to FFr4.39bn (Dollars 823m) in the nine months to December 31. The company said that it had experienced a recovery in demand during the third quarter, but this had failed to compensate for the reduction in sales during the first half. It did not disclose details of its profit performance in the first nine months, nor of its probable performance for the full year to March 31. However, the company confirmed that it anticipated a reduction on its FFr271m net profits recorded in the previous year. Remy has been hit by a decline in demand across its international markets. Sales of cognac fell from FFr1.97bn to FFr1.84bn in the first three quarters, while sales of liqueurs and spirits dipped from FFr1.33bn to FFr1.24bn. Champagne was the only sector to report an increase in sales, with turnover rising from FFr481m to FFr510m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Suhayr 'Ubaydat] </F>   [Text] Amman--The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)  Sunday [27 February] renewed a call on the mainstream Fatah  faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) to  renounce the Middle East peace process and join hands to  liberate Palestine through armed struggle.    "We call upon our brothers in Fatah to join hands and  escalate the intifada and holy war against the enemy," said an  open letter signed by Hamas.    In a separate statement, the group, which is dominant in the  occupied Gaza Strip, warned Palestinian negotiators to quit the  peace talks or face unspecified consquences.    Hamas is the largest religious-oriented group in the  occupied  territories challenging the domination of the PLO and Fatah,  which is led by Yasir 'Arafat, who is also chairman of the PLO.    Hamas and Fatah, at two ends of political ideology, have  been  locked in a power struggle in elections to various Palestinian  organisations and student unions in the occupied territries.    "The (massacre in Hebron) in which hundreds of our people  died confirms the righteousness of the resistance and armed  struggle... and exposes the Zionists' claims that they wish to  live with our people in peace," said the statement.    In its open letter, a copy of which was made available to  the  Jordan Times, Hamas urged "our brothers in Fatah ... to respond  to this brotherhly and national call ... to abort the  surrendering scheme led by the Oslo men."    Hamas, while vowing to wreck the autonomy accord through  escalated attacks against Israeli targets, appeared to drop its  earlier stand that it would not take up arms against fellow  Palestinians.    In its message addressed to the Palestinians in the occupied  territories, Hamas threatened Palestinian negotiators with  attacks if they do not withdraw from negotiations with Israel.    "We demand that the Oslo team announce their immediate  withdrawal from the negotiations with Israel ... we will not  allow a handful of us (Palestinians) to continue negotiationbs  with those murderers at the expense of the Palestinian people,"  said the letter.    The letter also called on the Palestinians in the occupied  territories to observe a three-day general strike, escalate the  intifada and carry out revenege attacks against Israeli soldiers  and settlers and engage in fights with them.    "We call on our people to avenge the killing of our martyrs  and consider the occupation troops and settlers as permanent  targets wherever they may be," read the letter.    The letter also called for demonstrations and marches  throughout the occupied territories.    It also called on the people of Hebron to protect the  Ibrahimi mosque and continue praying in it.    Salih Ra'fat, of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine (DFLP) Sunday urged the PLO to freeze its negotiations  with Israel. He also called on Mr. 'Arafat not to respond to  U.S. President Bill Clinton's call for a summit with Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Washington.    Reports of such an invitation by Mr. Clinton were Saturday  denied by a spokesman for Mr. Rabin, who said that the only  invitation out of Washington was to lower-level peace  negotiators to resume the talks. But other sources confirmed  the invitation.    Mr. Ra'fat also called for the protection of the  Palestinians  in the occupied territories, the dismantling of settlements and  the disarming of Jewish settlers.    Sulayman al-Najjab, member of the PLO Executive Committee,  called for the suspension of the peace negotiations with Israel  for the time being until they are preceded with conditions that  are in line with international legitimacy.</p>

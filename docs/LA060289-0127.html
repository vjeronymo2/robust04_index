			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUPLE ARRESTED IN BEATING DEATH OF WOMAN'S CHILD, 2  </P> <P> A Boyle Heights woman and her live-in boyfriend were in police custody  Thursday, held on suspicion of beating the woman's 2-year-old child to death  and then burying her body on a remote hillside.  </P> <P> Maria Gutierrez and Manuel Bonilla, both 22, were booked for investigation of  murder and held without bail after police discovered Johanna Gutierrez's body  covered with sand in Azusa Canyon early Thursday morning.  </P> <P> The couple had gone to Hollenbeck police station Wednesday afternoon to report  that the child was missing from their home in the 600 block of North Fickett  Street since about 5 p.m. the previous day, said Hollenbeck Capt. Art Lopez.  </P> <P> Gutierrez first told police she believed that the child was kidnaped after she  had left the child alone in the house and went off to buy medicine. Gutierrez  had told police that Johanna was often sick.  </P> <P> But Lopez said police grew suspicious because the couple waited almost 24 hours  to report the alleged abduction. "That gives you a clue something was not  right," Lopez said.  </P> <P> Police detectives questioned the pair several times Wednesday and interviewed  their friends and neighbors in an attempt to find the child.  </P> <P> Lopez said that Bonilla, a security guard, eventually changed his story,  telling investigators that he and Gutierrez beat the child to death because she  urinated and cried excessively. Bonilla then volunteered to lead police to the  child.  </P> <P> "It was an unusual situation," Lopez said. "(Detectives) interviewed the  suspect and he just decided to change his mind."  </P> <P> The child's mother also admitted she participated in the beating that occurred  sometime Tuesday, Lopez said.  </P> <P> Four children -- a 2-week-old infant and three others of 1, 3, and 4 years --  were taken from the house and placed in the custody of the Los Angeles County  Department of Children's Services, a Police Department spokesman said.  </P> <P> Neighbors said the couple, who had been living in the tiny one-bedroom  apartment for more than a year, had argued constantly. Some said they heard  slapping noises and cries from the apartment.  </P> <P> Adela Oliveras, who lives in a building behind the family, described Johanna as  a timid child. But she was often left alone and her diaper was often soiled,  Oliveras said.  </P> <P> Johnny Andrade, whose wife was the previous tenant in the apartment, was  visibly shaken by Johanna's death. He said that he had asked Gutierrez and  Bonilla if he could adopt the child, but that the pair refused.  </P> <P> "She was something special, she would trust anybody," Andrade said. "But she  didn't want anybody to touch her."  </P> <P> The couple will be arraigned today in Los Angeles Superior Court.  </P></p>

In a Tokyo speech, Mieno said that  the long recession after the collapse of the late 1980s  speculative bubble highlights the dangers of the financial  industry concentrating its lending in one area, such as real  estate.    Mieno said private risk-management ability has weakened,  citing a financial sector tendency "to use industry averages as  a benchmark and stay in the pack," unaware that "ill-managed  behavior in one corner can spread risk through the sector."    Noting competition-forced innovations in domestic industries  such as autos and electronics, the central bank chief said most  financial sector improvements have been copied from abroad, and  asked "why is it that innovation is hard to come by for Japanese  financial institutions?"    Reforms needed to strengthen the financial sector center on  letting the market more effectively drive financial institutions  to seek profits while shareholders and other market players  discipline "excessive behavior," Mieno said.    He praised December's Hiraiwa Commission report calling for  deregulation, called on institutions to improve their risk  management procedures and urged beefing up of such financial  "infrastructure" as accounting and disclosure systems.    Regulation and surpervision remain essential to "embed moral  standards in financial institutions," but regulations focus  heavily on risks while the market constantly balances risks with  rewards, Mieno said.    The concentration on real estate-related lending in the  bubble era has left financial institutions saddled with huge  nonperforming assets, which they must write off to allow full  recovery, Mieno said. He repeated that adjustments need not be  complete for recovery to begin but said they will continue to  retard a return to full-throttle growth.    Bright spots continue to emerge, but more time is needed for  stock and balance sheet adjustments and responses to increasing  international competition, he said.    Mieno noted that some areas of consumption and industrial  production are brightening but said capital spending and labor  conditions continue to worsen. He cautioned that such recent  signs as higher output from mines and factories somewhat reflect  a typical surge toward the end of the fiscal year in March.    "Conditions are falling in place for a better-balanced  growth," but some excess capacity run up in the bubble days may  never be fully used, he said.</p>

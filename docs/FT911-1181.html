			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Auditors forced to resign over TGI row TGI, the audio and electronic products group, has appointed KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock as auditors following the resignation last month of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. The dispute which led to the resignation centres on profit figures reported by Tannoy Audix, a company bought by TGI on earnout terms in February 1989. Reported 1990 pre-tax profits for Audix were Pounds 1.1m but TGI said in a statement yesterday said that the board was now of the opinion that Audix did not make a profit at all in 1990, following an investigation into the company by Peat Marwick. TGI said it stood to suffer a potential loss because these accounts, audited by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, formed the basis of payments due to the vendors of Audix under the earnout agreement. TGI issued loan notes to the vendors amounting to Pounds 1m before it investigated the Audix accounts, but it has yet to pay any cash to vendors. Mr Norman Crocker, TGI chairman, said yesterday that a precise quantification of the potential loss would become clear as the 1991 audit got under way. In the meantime, he said the company had taken the following action: sought, and obtained the resignation of Coopers as auditors, following legal advice to the TGI board to the effect that Coopers are likely to have been in breach of contract and/or to have been negligent. Coopers denied these allegations; dismissed Mr John Billett, one of the vendors, as executive chairman of Audix. 'The board considers that (Mr Billett) may bear some responsibility as to certain matters at Audix', yesterday's statement said. Mr Crocker refused to elaborate on this; TGI proposes to resist making any payment of the contingent consideration under the loan notes. Coopers has written a letter denying the allegation of negligence which is to be circulated to TGI shareholders.</p>

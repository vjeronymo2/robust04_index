			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> FOR LUCKY CAPOTE, A $50,000 GAMBLE PAID OFF;  </P> <P> ENTREPRENEURSHIP: THE FOUNDER OF THE SUCCESSFUL NATIONAL MICROCOMP COMPUTER  SERVICES FIRM IS NAMED A SMALL-BUSINESS PERSON OF THE YEAR.  </P> <P> The year was 1984, and Luciano (Lucky) Capote had recently retired, with some  reluctance, from his job as regional manager of Texas Instruments' computer  services division in Orange County.  </P> <P> At 58, the Cuban-born businessman felt that he was too young to spend the rest  of his life just watching the waves break near his oceanfront home in San  Clemente, so he decided to gamble.  </P> <P> He withdrew $50,000 from his family's savings and founded National Microcomp  Inc. in a Mission Viejo garage to pursue the business he knew best -- fixing  computers.  </P> <P> The business, he says, has brought him more financial rewards than he had ever  dreamed of. And now it has brought him something more.  </P> <P> Last week, the U.S. Commerce Department named Capote the small-business person  of the year for Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.  </P> <P> "I have this silly notion that I can do whatever I want to do so long as the  opportunities are there for my taking. It's all up to me," said Capote. The  nickname Lucky, he added, originated years ago when friends at Texas A&amp;M  University "couldn't pronounce my name right."  </P> <P> Last year, National Microcomp, now based in Tustin, rang up sales of $1.1  million servicing the computers of aerospace and distribution companies,  hospitals and banks and distribution companies in California, Hawaii and  Arizona. His company, which now has 17 employees, recently added a division  that sells computer hardware. Its customers include aerospace heavyweights such  as Ford Aerospace, Hughes Aircraft and General Dynamics.  </P> <P> But Capote credits his 25-year career with Texas Instruments, the Dallas-based  computer and defense firm, with laying the foundation for his current success.  </P> <P> "When I created the service division at Texas Instruments, it was like creating  a new business," he said. "I learned how to make the business grow and how to  keep it profitable yet lean and efficient enough to be responsible to the  customers."  </P> <P> He also learned not to put all of his eggs in one basket. Capote's business is  equally divided among aerospace firms, private companies and government  customers, the U.S. Navy and Air Force among them.  </P> <P> Capote, like the owners of many other growing small businesses, would like to  expand his company into other areas. He would like, for example, to get into  reselling computers made by various manufacturers, he said. But he does not  have the money or the staff to do that just now.  </P> <P> Capote also says he has learned some hard lessons along the way. He conceded  that when he started his company six years ago, his biggest problem was  attitude. Used to arranging million-dollar deals during his days with Texas  Instruments, he figured that it would be no time at all before he was making  megabuck deals, despite having "only a little garage to show as my office."  </P> <P> It took what Capote describes as relentless prodding to persuade Wells Fargo  Bank to give him his first big order: a service contract for 900 computer  terminals in the bank's California branches.  </P> <P> Steve Wadell, district director of the Small Business Administration regional  office that oversees Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties, said Capote  stands out because of his dedication to provide good-quality services at  affordable rates. "Lucky has been successful in great part because of his  excellent marketing skills and close attention to the needs of his customers,"  Wadell said.  </P> <P> Jim Rick, who was Capote's boss at Texas Instruments in Houston, said: "I've  known Lucky for about 30 years, and he has always been hard-working and a  people-oriented person. He understood what customers expected of him, and he  delivered it."  </P> <P> Capote, however, says that starting a business was easy compared to the  situation he faced when he stepped off a dusty Greyhound bus at College  Station, Tex., at age 26. It was 1954, and he had come to the United States for  the first time to study electrical engineering at Texas A&amp;M.  </P> <P> He was the son of a poor grocery bookkeeper and a seamstress, and he knew no  English. Still, he was determined to break the chain of poverty his family had  known in Havana and to get the college degree that would help him do that.  </P> <P> Capote never got his college degree, but he did earn the financial security he  had hoped for.  </P> <P> "When I was at Texas Instruments," he said, "I dreamed of bringing my family  out of Cuba one day -- and I did."  </P></p>

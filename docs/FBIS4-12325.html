			<p>BFN     [Text] The death toll in the suicide operation that was  carried out by 19-year-old Palestinian Ra'id Zakarinah in 'Afula  yesterday has risen to nine. Fifty-two others were injured in  the attack. The Palestinian youth was martyred in the operation,  which marked the passing of 40 days since the Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre. The youth who carried out the operation had been  detained in occupation jails last year and had been tortured by  the secret security organs for 75 days.    In a statement to London radio, Israeli Government Spokesman  (Uri Drumi) urged the PLO to condemn the car bomb operation in  'Afula.    The United States also asked PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to  condemn the car-bombing in 'Afula, northern occupied Palestine.  U.S. State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry said: We certainly  hope that 'Arafat would condemn this act of violence. The  language would be of his choosing. McCurry described the  operation as extremely serious. In a press release issued by  the U.S. State Department on the operation last night, McCurry  said that the United States condemns this act in the strongest  terms. He stressed that the United States is committed to the  security of Israel and to supporting it in its fight against  so-called terrorism. At the same time, he stressed that the  United States will continue efforts to advance the Middle East  peace process. [In its review of the Syrian press headlines at  0445 GMT on 7 April, Damascus Radio carries the following  headline without further elaboration: "The papers highlight the  martyrdom operation that was carried out by a Palestinian youth  against an Israeli bus, killing nine settlers and wounding 52  others"]</p>

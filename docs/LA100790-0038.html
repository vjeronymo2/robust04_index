			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH HOLY DAYS 'SCHLEP' RAISES OBJECTIONS  </P> <P> I strongly object to the article "A Fun 'Schlep' for a Higher Holy Service"  (Sept. 28) appearing on the eve of the holiest day in the Jewish faith, Yom  Kippur. In case the readers missed the impact on the first page, they were  reminded of the subject by the headline on the continuation page: "Jewish:  Having Fun 'Schlepping' in Temples."  </P> <P> In these days of increased racial and religious distrust of each other, The  Times has demeaned this momentous holiday by celebrating the cuteness of one  writer's so-called quest.  </P> <P> Yom Kippur is a day in which we evaluate our past year's deeds and thoughts,  ask for forgiveness, and then plan to create a better life for ourselves, our  family and the greater community.  </P> <P> I believe it would benefit us all -- Jew, Christian, Moslem -- to spend at  least one day a year away from the pressures of everyday life, contemplate what  we have wrought, and seek solutions to the problems that plague our world.  </P> <P> ALICE BECKERMAN ZYETZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

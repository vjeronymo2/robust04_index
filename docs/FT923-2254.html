			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Mexican bonds hope to break new ground in US THE FIRST Mexican bond issue in the US for a decade - and the first by any sub-investment grade foreign borrower - was launched yesterday. The Dollars 250m issue, led by Goldman Sachs, marks an attempt to develop a new US investor base for Mexico, which carries a split rating of BBplus from Standard &amp; Poor's and Ba2 from Moody's. A roadshow has been mounted in eight US cities recently to take the issue to insurance companies and pension funds which until now have not bought Latin American debt. The 10-year bonds are expected to be priced before the end of this week at a yield over Treasuries of less than 2 1/4 per cent. Meanwhile, Argentina still plans to return to the Eurobond market later this month with a Dollars 200m-Dollars 300m issue, despite the failure of the issue to emerge so far. Central bank officials say they are negotiating details of the issue - the country's third this year - with the manager, Credit Suisse-First Boston. However, they expect to place the bonds at a maximum of five years, with a spread of less than 3 per cent over the benchmark five-year US Treasury bonds. The Argentinian government's new foray into the bond market follows its successful sale last year of Dollars 500m-worth of Eurobonds in two placements handled by J P Morgan. Officials are encouraged that Argentina's cost of borrowing is falling, reflecting the decline of inflation to below 20 per cent a year and a forecasted 8-10 per cent growth in 1992. Proceeds from the new bond sales will be used to partially roll over maturing bond debt. Officials deny that Argentina is increasing its Eurobond borrowings too fast. They argue the new placement is small in comparison with the estimated Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6bn in bonds that Argentina has outstanding on the local and international markets. Furthermore, Argentina is actually reducing its bond debt, by redeeming Dollars 1.5bn-worth of bonds this year.</p>

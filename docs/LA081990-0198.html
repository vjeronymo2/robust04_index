			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACK SCARS, WHITE FEARS;  </P> <P> SCENES FROM THE EVERYDAY REVOLUTION IN SOUTTH AFRICA  </P> <P> The road to Avalon, on the edge of sprawling Soweto, ends at a haunting field,  an incongruous and lonely break from the surrounding slum. At dusk, the vast  expanse appears to be a no-man's land of wild waist-high grass and weeds. While  the rest of the black township outside Johannesburg bustles noisily with  numbers it can no longer contain, the only sound across the unkempt Avalon  field is the echo of dogs barking in the distance. It is an anonymous monument  to recent South African history.  </P> <P> I had come to Avalon to look for Hector Peterson, the black youth who  symbolized the turbulent years I had spent in South Africa as a journalist  covering the first nationwide black uprising in the 1970s. Dubbed the  "children's crusade," the violence had lasted 16 months, ending only after at  least 570 had died, 3,900 had been injured and 5,900 had been detained.  Returning to South Africa this year, exactly a decade after I'd left, I made a  pilgrimage to find Peterson, just as I had done on every anniversary of the  uprising while I lived there.  </P> <P> Avalon is a blacks-only cemetery. And Hector Peterson's grave is its most noted  site.  </P> <P> Peterson died on June 16, 1976. Like thousands of other students, he had left  class to join a peaceful march against the imposition of Afrikaans, the  language of early Dutch settlers, on black schools. The protest quickly turned  into a confrontation with South African police as students hurled rocks and  police responded with rifles. Peterson, age 13, was the first to die. He was  shot in the back. At the time, his death captivated the world. A photograph of  his limp, bloody body being carried away by another young black, Peterson's  screaming sister Antoinette running alongside, made the front pages of papers  around the world -- and eventually the walls of the United Nations. A single  picture symbolized the frustration and rage spawned by repression -- and the  price children had to pay to stand up against apartheid.  </P> <P> I hadn't seen Hector Peterson die, but I had been in Soweto that day and  throughout the uprising. What none of us knew back then was that his death  would mark a cataclysmic turning point for the last bastion of white minority  rule in Africa. A new generation of young blacks assumed the mantle of  leadership and escalated opposition from pockets of sporadic resistance to a  mass movement constantly challenging, and eroding, white rule. The uprising  would eventually lead, on an uneven course, to the sweeping changes pledged by  the government this year.  </P> <P> Tracing the three people in that picture became the first leg of a personal  journey into the past I had witnessed. I needed to understand what had happened  in the volatile interim in order to understand what lies ahead. Armed with an  anxious curiosity and a passion for a bountifully lush country, I wasn't sure  what to expect. After living and working there for five years, I had left South  Africa angry, not only at the inequality among races, but also at the  indignities one set of men could heap on another simply because of the color of  their skin. Ten years later, I didn't think I could stand to be disappointed  again.  </P> <P> In some ways, it was a joyous trip. Some things had changed more than I had  anticipated they would in my lifetime. A minority of blacks and whites have  begun to cross the long bridge that has separated them from the moment of birth  in segregated clinics to burial in segregated cemeteries. In other ways it was  gut-wrenching. Dismantling apartheid, I discovered, is going to be a  tumultuous, painful exercise in healing the scars and fears of the past. The  majority of whites, who have paid psychologically for their financial and  political dominance, live in a state of anxious aprehension about the price  they may have to pay for four decades of apartheid. And the majority of blacks,  including another generation of children, have suffered in squalor -- walking  miles daily to get water from public taps, waiting for places in overcrowded  schools and even turning to crime to ease their poverty -- as the nation groped  slowly for a formula to share power. Despite the crumbling of legal barriers,  most blacks and whites are still a color apart.  </P> <P> The entrance to Avalon today looks almost respectable. The rough old track has  been widened and paved. Beyond a new brick archway, the road is lined with  yellow daisies stretching high toward the blazing South African sun. But  inside, little has changed, except the size. Once the equivalent of a couple of  football fields, the massive blocks of untended plots had grown so big that I  had to ask a black gravedigger to locate Peterson.  </P> <P> "No, you'd never find it now," he said dourly. He got into my car and we drove  over the weather-gutted lanes of red clay, then walked through the underbrush  to the 1976 sector. Then he stopped. "There," he pointed to the ground.  </P> <P> Since I had left, the small cross that marked Peterson's grave had been  replaced by a proper headstone. But late last year, the large slab of marble  had been smashed. No one was sure who had vandalized the site. But local  consensus blamed a group of whites spotted near the sector that day; not many  whites visit Avalon. The pieces, at least, were still in order, and I could see  the inscription chiseled into the black marble. "Time is on the side of the  oppressed," it read. "Truth is on the side of the oppressed."  </P> <P> Peterson's epitaph was an angrier version of another warning issued 30 years  earlier. On February 3, 1960, British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan had stood  before the South African Parliament in Cape Town to herald "the wind of change  blowing through the continent" -- and to give notice that Britain could no  longer support white domination. It was a watershed speech that signaled the  impending end of Africa's colonial era. Since then, 40 African nations have  gained independence from colonial masters, foreign mandates and other forms of  white minority rule. South Africa, however, chose to ignore the message.  </P> <P> The delay has been costly. Vast numbers of a generation -- the most politicized  in the nation's history -- have been lost, dispersed or silenced.  </P> <P> Mbuyisa Makhubu, the 18-year-old in denim overalls who scooped up Peterson, the  young stranger crumpled at his feet, was among the dispersed. Eyewitnesses said  that Makhubu had been visiting friends when he heard the initial outburst and  went to see what was happening. Although he didn't know Peterson, Makhubu raced  the boy to a clinic where he was pronounced dead. Police searched for Makhubu  after the world-famous photograph was published; they told his family that he  had posed for the picture. From then on, Makhubu moved constantly for almost  three months until he fled, first to Botswana and then Nigeria. Exile was  preferable to detention. Makhubu's family has not heard of him for more than a  decade. An international organization tried for two years to track him down,  but failed. Several accounts suggest that he has died.  </P> <P> Since 1976, at least 10,000 South Africans have also slipped into exile. Many  trained as guerrillas. Others studied. Some just drifted. Another 58,000 of all  races have been silenced in open-ended detention, according to the Human Rights  Commission. Most have been black.  </P> <P> And even detention could be dangerous: 52 blacks died in police custody. One  detainee died after allegedly slipping on a bar of soap, another after  allegedly falling off an upper-level floor ledge, though it was later noted  that the floor had no ledge, and a third after supposedly hitting his head  repeatedly against the wall.  </P> <P> South African security forces had managed to quell the initial uprising through  intimidation and force. But by the mid-1980s, the country was again ready to  explode. When the government introduced a new tri-cameral parliament in 1984  that brought in Indians and Coloreds but excluded blacks, it did. Black rent  increases and protests over inferior black education further fueled the second  round of nationwide riots and strikes. By 1985, unrest was so widespread that  the government even banned outdoor funerals of "people who died of unnatural  causes" -- a euphemism for victims of the violence. Mourning the dead, the last  remaining public forum for dissent, became illegal.  </P> <P> Over the years, black bitterness has welled up and hardened.  </P> <P> The only member of the trio left in South Africa is Hector Peterson's sister  Antoinette, known as Toto to her friends. She was a cherubic and chubby 16 when  her brother died. Now 30, she is a matronly plump mother of two boys. With the  help of a black journalist, I found her living in relative obscurity in Soweto.  Since the uprising and the photograph and the two weeks of police  interrogations that followed, she has stayed away from politics. But she hasn't  forgotten. Her elder son, now 8, is named Hector.  </P> <P> Toto represents the future -- and the pivotal question facing South African  blacks: Can hope and change overcome the scars?  </P> <P> "I relive a bit of that day every day," Toto told me in a whisper-soft voice.  Without prompting, she went on: "We were at different schools, so it was God's  miracle that we met on the street. I had him by the hand and we were hiding.  The police had released dogs and they were beating students with batons.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Stay with me, it looks dangerous.' But he saw the students marching  and wanted to go with them. A few minutes later I saw a group of boys crowding  around something and Hector's shoe was on the ground." Then she paused. "I  thought he was still beside me.  </P> <P> "He was my only brother, and I miss him."  </P> <P> She later reflected, "Can I forgive? I don't know. I can't say yes because when  I think back, all the hatred also comes back. But I may be less bitter about my  brother's death now because of the changes here."  </P> <P> "Modified concentration camps" was the way a visiting U.S. assistant secretary  for Housing and Urban Development described Soweto and other black townships  before the 1976 riots. The 26 suburbs of the South West Townships -- a name  shortened into Soweto -- were then an eyesore of gloomy brick matchbox homes,  each few blocks identical, lined up on treeless roads or dirt paths. Blacks had  no choice about where they lived; the government assigned rental homes in  designated townships.  </P> <P> On weekends, I used to photograph life in Soweto. The images are still stark in  my mind: women "shopping" at scraggly traffic islands, where used clothing was  laid out on sheets on the ground. Men nearby sitting on cans to have their hair  cut by outdoor barbers. Little girls doing wash in large tin tubs in back yards  or near communal water outlets. A gaggle of boys pushing toy cars, ingeniously  fashioned from coat-hanger wire, in mock derbies down worn roads. A man  wrestling to hold on to two live chickens he bought from a street vendor.  </P> <P> Soweto then had only one phone for every 27,000 and a single hospital for a  million-plus inhabitants. About one-third of its homes had electricity, and  even fewer had indoor plumbing. The township had only two banks, two movie  houses -- limited to showing movies cleared by censors -- and no supermarket.  Most people spent evenings by candlelight or oil lamps; the coal stoves they  used for heat and cooking left the rippling hills covered with an odorous smog.  </P> <P> Yet Soweto, back then, was considered South Africa's "showcase" black township.  The government even offered tours to show how well blacks lived. Most other  areas were far worse. The uprising, however, produced unprecedented new  pressure -- and gradual changes.  </P> <P> Today, Toto lives with her second husband, Meshack Sithole, in the Dobsonville  "extension," one of the new subdivisions added to Soweto since the uprising.  Miles of pastel bungalows with sweet little gardens now surround old  Dobsonville and the ugly core of Soweto. It's as if a little bit of heaven has  been built on the outskirts of hell.  </P> <P> Toto's home is pale-pink stucco with a rose-tiled roof. She has a telephone,  electricity, running water -- "cold and hot," she likes to point out -- and  toilets. She doesn't have a washing machine, but she does have a bathtub to  clean the family's clothes indoors. The Sitholes took out a mortgage on the  house on Ramatlotlo Road for $13,200 in 1987; they also have a 99-year  leasehold on the land, a change introduced in 1983. A series of government  moves between 1986 and 1988 now allows blacks to buy land outright, although  few can afford the high prices.  </P> <P> Both Toto and Meshack hold jobs that, in 1976, were restricted to whites under  various "job reservation" acts, laws that were repealed in phases between 1979  and 1987. Toto is now a clerk for an encyclopedia publisher. Meshack is a  warehouse manager for an automotive parts company; he is the first black to  hold the position.  </P> <P> The new opportunities for blacks were created by a confluence of factors: Black  boycotts and sporadic violence that occasionally spilled over into white areas  forced both local and foreign corporations to recognize that they could not  survive if black living and working conditions did not improve. Local and  international political pressure, along with the high black birth rate that  made whites an even smaller minority, forced the government to accept gradual  change for a population it could no longer control -- even with brute force.  And black consciousness blossomed.  </P> <P> As a result, some aspects of Soweto life have improved. Blacks no longer have  to buy live chickens from street vendors. Big Daddy's Famous Speedchicken  rivals a chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets. And shopping is no longer  limited to traffic circles or small shops. Maponya's giant Discount Store has  made its owner a millionaire and breeder of racehorses. Barbers still have  open-air stands, but hair salons also now coif the hair of men and women.  Little boys still play with their wire cars, but Sowetans prefer to boast of  the two real Rolls-Royces owned by blacks in the wealthier township  subdivisions, such as the one called Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Toto credits the movement symbolized by her brother's death for the changes in  her life and others'. "His death helped make life better for me," she said,  nodding. "Whites, at least some whites, began to notice our situation. And the  government began doing things, some small things, about the way we lived."  </P> <P> But, like Avalon, only parts of Soweto have a respectable veneer.  </P> <P> When the government restricted the press from Soweto in 1976, I used to do  on-camera commentaries in front of the township's one quasi-luxury: an  overgrown three-hole golf course on the border. Today, the golf course is home  to 50,000 people, one of five Soweto squatter camps of shanties fashioned from  old cardboard, corrugated tin and weathered plastics. The shacks are crammed  together so tightly it's hard to tell where one ends and the next begins.  Nationwide, 2.5 million are squatters or homeless.  </P> <P> Soweto, with a population that has at least doubled and perhaps quadrupled  since 1976, is bursting at the seams, often forcing several generations to live  together. In Soweto's Jabulani district, the Dhlamini family has 32 children  living in one of the old four-room matchbox houses. Ranging in age from 8  months to 18 years, they sleep on the floor, in the kitchen, on any scrap of  furniture, all woven together like worms. The standard of misery for countless  blacks is even worse than when I was last in South Africa.  </P> <P> The government had tried to control the numbers in the "townships" -- the name  whites give all-black suburbs -- with "influx control" restrictions stipulating  that only blacks with jobs in white cities or farms could live outside the 10  tribal homelands. When the laws were repealed in 1986, tens of thousands  flocked to townships like Soweto in search of better-paying jobs -- or, in  fact, any job. Black unemployment has become chronic, up to an estimated 60% in  the worst areas. And even for those with jobs the black per-capita income has  been more than halved, from $1,460 in 1976 to only $548. The plummeting value  of the Rand, the South African currency, and the black-population surge mean  that dwindling wealth has to be divided among even more people.  </P> <P> Education, the issue that ignited the uprising, is also straining under the  migration and population pressures. In 1976, Soweto had 42 high schools; today  it has 67, but 150,000 children are still without schools, according to black  principals.  </P> <P> Yet Soweto remains the "showcase" township.  </P> <P> Perhaps more critical to the future than the political and economic disparities  is the deep cleavage between the races. It extends well beyond the first  generation that went to prison for championing black rights and the second  generation that fought street battles to achieve them.  </P> <P> As I got up to leave Toto's house I stuck out my arm to shake hands with her  sons. Hector, a slim, long-legged child who favors Mickey Mouse T-shirts, shyly  gave me his hand. But his 2-year-old brother Sylvester pulled away and started  to squeal. Toto smiled. "It's nothing personal," she said. "It's just that the  only whites he has ever seen are doctors, and he associates them with pain.'  </P> <P> The child's response was eerily familiar.  </P> <P> In the late 1970s, I had visited a black school in Mamelodi, a Pretoria  township, with Jacquie Myburgh, an angel-faced Afrikaner child with a long  brown braid, and her mother. As we pulled up to the school's front door, the  students, who had watched us approach from the window, stampeded outside. We  instinctively rolled up the windows and locked the doors. For several minutes,  dozens of children, age 7 to 12, pressed their faces and fingers hard against  the windows, trapping us in the car.  </P> <P> Finally, a black teacher waded through the crowd and tapped on the window. "Not  to worry," she said with a knowing smile. "They don't want to hurt you. It's  just that they've never seen a white child before." The desperate fascination  of those children had remained locked in my memory because it so succinctly  defined the absurdity and perversity of apartheid.  </P> <P> It was, of course, only one of dozens of examples. When I lived in South  Africa, local newspaper accounts often bordered on the bizarre: There were  regular reports of twins classified as different races and forced to live apart  because of varying skin hues. One of the craziest stories involved a skull that  had washed up on the southern shore. When forensic tests couldn't determine its  race, a local magistrate rented a refrigerator to store it; the government  didn't want it buried in the wrong racial cemetery. One of the most sensational  scandals involved a white dominie, pastor of the Afrikaners' Dutch Reformed  Church, who fathered a Colored child by a black mistress he couldn't legally  marry. The scandal, in the eyes of his strict Calvinist faith, was  miscegenation; the real tragedy was that, by law, all three had to live in  separate areas.  </P> <P> I had to track down Jacquie Myburgh and her family to find out more about what  had happened to racial interaction.  </P> <P> Like Toto, Jacquie had grown up with the crisis dating back to the uprising.  And, as a descendant of the first white settlers, she represents the pivotal  question for South African whites: Can hope and change overcome the fears?  </P> <P> Jacquie has grown into a stunning 22-year-old with big brown eyes. While her  mother remembered the incident in Mamelodi, Jacquie didn't. Her only memory was  of making thick peanut-butter sandwiches to take to black children in the  townships. But the fact that she couldn't remember may reflect the difference  between generations and the context of their lives. Jacquie now coexists with  blacks.  </P> <P> Today she is an environmental reporter for the Johannesburg Star. She sits next  to a black reporter. One of her editors is black. She was recently approached  by a famed local black saxophone player, who asked her to translate his  autobiography into Afrikaans -- the language that sparked the uprising -- so it  would be available to whites. She has also begun socializing with a multiracial  group of young professionals.  </P> <P> "I don't think of a person's color anymore," she said with just a trace of the  accent that distinguishes Afrikaners from English-speaking whites. "The whole  idea is ridiculous when you think about it.  </P> <P> "I'm really quite excited about bringing up children here. I'm not scared of  the future at all. I think it's going to be marvelous."  </P> <P> Traditionally, Afrikaners have been more conservative than English-speaking  whites. They tended to hold the lower-class and rural jobs; they had also  settled in South Africa two centuries before most English arrived and fought  blacks to gain control of the land. Their fears were evident when the  Afrikaner-dominated National Party won power in 1948 and later introduced the  concept of apartheid. In the past, most scenarios of the country's future  portrayed Afrikaners as the last hold-outs, rebuilding the lagers, the circling  of the wagons of early settlers, to prevent sharing power with blacks.  </P> <P> "I don't think that's true anymore," Jacquie said with a chuckle. "I think we  will adapt better. We have a longer attachment to this country. Our past is  here and so is our future."  </P> <P> In some ways, the framework for the future is already here. Jacquie works on  Sauer Street in downtown Johannesburg, just around the corner from my old  office and only three miles from where I used to live. In 1975, I had an  apartment in Hillbrow, Johannesburg's equivalent of Greenwich Village, a place  that buzzed with eclectic shops and cafes. It was legally -- and distinctly --  white. Most blacks who worked downtown were cleaners, gofers or laborers who  took trains back to Soweto at night.  </P> <P> But, now, most of the tenants in my old block are black. So are the majority of  shoppers and the sales personnel in the stores. In the decade since I left,  downtown Johannesburg has effectively changed color, opening up to all races  because there was, simply, no alternative. By the mid-1980s, the growth of the  black population -- conservatively estimated at about 3%, almost twice the  white birth rate -- created an unprecedented housing shortage. And the  expanding black middle class began to have the means to pay more. The lifting  in 1986 of the "pass" laws, which had required blacks to have special papers to  get out of the townships, allowed freer movement. And the repeal of  restrictions on whites-only parks, restaurants, cinemas and other public  facilities changed the climate.  </P> <P> Like many aspects of life in South Africa on the eve of transition, the line  between legalities and realities is still sometimes fuzzy. Blacks who have  moved into Hillbrow high-rises are breaking the law. But apartheid is now too  costly to enforce, so the government has chosen to ignore hundreds of  complaints.  </P> <P> The metamorphosis was vividly evident when I went to check out the Diplomat  Hotel on Plein Street. In the 1970s, the Diplomat had a legendary bar, a  males-only hangout frequented by white mercenaries and assorted cohorts in  between jobs. During the wars in Angola, Rhodesia and Zaire's Shaba, I often  tried to get in to find out about the mercenaries' misadventures and future  plans. But I always ended up having to summon the bartender outside to have him  relay messages or to convince one of the men to come out and talk.  </P> <P> Today, the Diplomat's sidewalk billboard boasts: "Exotic Dancers -- Best Girls  in Town." The bar throbs in the afternoons with disco or rock as strobe lights  flash against the dark walls and showgirls fulfill their billing. At tables  around the dance floor, female "escorts," mostly black, are snuggled  elbow-to-elbow with "clients," usually white. This time, someone shouted for me  to come on in.  </P> <P> Interracial socializing, relationships and even prostitution are now tolerated,  albeit reluctantly, by the government. And the law proscribing mixed marriages  was repealed in 1985. But, again, there is a fuzziness that shows how very far  South Africa still has to go. Among the once-dizzying set of laws still on the  books and erratically enforced is the Group Areas Act, which segregates the  races into their own living areas. So blacks and whites and Coloreds and Asians  can now have intercourse and intermarry, but they still can't legally live  together.  </P> <P> Jacquie Myburgh's optimism that the fuzziness will all eventually be sorted out  is not universally shared. The white flight, which began after the 1976  uprising, is once again a subject of intense speculation.  </P> <P> "From the readers' letters we get, you can see that 90% (of whites) are nervous  about change," commented Tertius Myburgh, Jacquie's father and the editor of  The Sunday Times, one of the largest English-language weeklies. "A great  majority of the South African population is walking around in bewilderment."  </P> <P> The black move into the city was in part triggered by the exodus of thousands  of whites to starched-white enclaves in northern Johannesburg. Although many  still work downtown, they don't want to live there -- because of the black  encroachment, the feared loss of real estate values or the growing crime. "I  have a contest with my driver on the way home every night to see who spots the  first white," Myburgh joked. "It's usually in Bramfontein," the dividing line  between downtown and the white suburbs.  </P> <P> More telling, perhaps, is that more than 165,000 whites have left the country  since the uprising. The trend first became noticeable in 1977, when white  emigrants outnumbered immigrants for the first time in almost two decades. A  poll of white students that year revealed that 65% planned to leave. Talk at  cocktail parties reflected the tension. I heard endless conversations among  women about what kinds of jewelry and antiques would beat restrictions on cash  taken out of the country; among men, it was new or antique cars. Discussions  often ended with ratings of kennels, and which was the best for pets to be left  behind.  </P> <P> Party talk hasn't changed much.  </P> <P> "One of the most common questions at parties these days is 'Where are your  children?' " Tertius Myburgh lamented. "One of the great tragedies is that so  many of the next generation of whites are in California or Toronto.  </P> <P> "People are often surprised when we tell them that all three of our kids are  here, that all three are aggressive about staying."  </P> <P> In Pretoria, the British Embassy is reportedly now issuing 2,000 passports each  month for South Africans of English heritage. The British Foreign Office has  disclosed that as many as a million whites qualify for citizenship. The U.S.,  Australian, Canadian and other embassies have been flooded with queries about  immigration.  </P> <P> But many Afrikaners fearful of the future are either ineligible for citizenship  elsewhere or can't afford to leave. Some have chosen to join the growing  hard-line opposition, ranging from the Conservative Party to assorted neo-Nazi  groups, to resist change. Others are just drifting. For both groups, the sense  of betrayal -- that a fellow Afrikaner, President F. W. de Klerk, is giving  away what generations fought to establish -- is deep.  </P> <P> In Pretoria, I ran into one of the disillusioned. As I searched for a parking  slot, I saw a bearded, unkempt white man motioning madly. He was standing in  front of an open space. Like two blacks also working the same block, he sought  tips for pointing out space in metered zones. When I left South Africa, no race  was allowed to work the streets, and white panhandling was unheard of --  especially in the ultraconservative capital.  </P> <P> As I got out, he offered to wash my spanking-clean rental car. Kirk, a  39-year-old Afrikaner, turned out to be a former railway shunter laid off last  year. He had to give up his apartment and move in with a friend.  </P> <P> "The way things are going, there aren't many jobs for me anymore," he  complained. "Whites no longer have guarantees, and it's cheaper to hire blacks.  Everyone wants to hire blacks now."  </P> <P> When I asked what he thought of the promised reforms, he looked at me as if I  were crazy.  </P> <P> "What future do I have now?" he said with an angry scowl. "Whites are finished  here. And what country is going to let me in? My family has been here for 300  years." His despondency about the future was as intense as Jacquie Myburgh's  confidence.  </P> <P> In the decade since I'd left, whites had also been thoroughly politicized and  their lives radically changed. There were, as I discovered, no exceptions.  </P> <P> During my last four years in South Africa, Roland Hunter, his parents and his  three little sisters were my neighbors in Forest Town, a sleepy Johannesburg  suburb of white-washed homes and cottages. The Hunters were the ordinary, nice  family next door. Roland's father, Peter, who finished his doctorate in  education at UCLA, was a respected university administrator. Lucienne, his  mother, had an uproarious giggle that broke the tension of any crisis. The  girls were sweet and spirited.  </P> <P> The last time I saw Roland, he was a 22-year-old economics student, a  wholesomely good-looking kid just growing out of lanky adolescence. It was  March, 1980, and I had gone next door to ask if I could use the Hunters' tennis  court. "Sure," Roland had smiled. He didn't make much use of the tennis court  back then.  </P> <P> I had no intention of including the Hunters in this story, but I couldn't leave  South Africa without checking on them. I knew the odds that they would still be  there were small, but, when I dropped by unannounced, I saw Lucienne through  the window.  </P> <P> After a big bear hug, she wanted to hear about my wanderings and my writing. I  then asked about news of the family, suspecting that their quiet lives would be  the one constant in the overwhelming change around me.  </P> <P> "Well, we have a bit of news, too," she said in what turned out to be the  understatement of my missing decade.  </P> <P> Late last year, Roland had finished a five-year sentence at Pretoria Central  Prison. "Technically," Lucienne explained. "He should have gotten 25 years to  life. That's the mandatory term for high treason."  </P> <P> In one of the most damaging espionage cases in the country's history, Hunter  had stolen what the press later called a "trunk load" of South African military  secrets. The documents revealed the country's deepest covert operation: plans  to destabilize or help overthrow the governments in four neighboring black  states.  </P> <P> Hunter had never before been politically active, and the most telling aspect of  his saga of intrigue and espionage was that it was not premeditated. "It was an  amateur operation really," Roland said with a chuckle when I caught up with him  later. "I didn't really know what I was doing. I wanted to be a lecturer, not a  spy."  </P> <P> The turning point was in 1982, when he was drafted. Assigned to the Directorate  of Special Tasks, he quickly learned he was in the midst of the army's "dirty  tricks" unit, which ran operations against Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe and  Lesotho. His job included handling all the paper work for Operation Mila, a  campaign to overthrow the Mozambique government. Hunter was only supposed to  file the secret folders. Instead, he copied the documents.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a moral decision or dilemma. There was no anguish," he said. Once he  read the documents, "what I had to do suddenly became clear, clear, clear." The  operation finally gave Hunter a reason to use the tennis court, where, after  carefully wrapping the papers in double plastic bags to avoid water damage, he  buried them. Every month for almost a year, he handed over a new set of files  to a white couple who provided a link to the African National Congress.  </P> <P> Despite several close calls, Hunter almost got away with it. Then, eight days  before he finished his army stint, he was arrested for treason and held  incommunicado for several months. The government was eventually forced to  reduce the charges against him to avoid a public trial and exposure of other  secret documents whose numbers Hunter had memorized. At an in-camera trial,  which even his family couldn't attend, he was sentenced to five years. In 1984,  Roland Hunter went to prison.  </P> <P> What had happened to the Hunters, a normal middle-class family, in the  intervening decade to change them so dramatically?  </P> <P> "Actually, it didn't begin with Roland. Catherine was the first one to be  detained," Lucienne replied. In 1983, Catherine, an authoritative, gentle young  woman, was picked up under provisions of South Africa's Internal Security Act  -- which meant no lawyer, no family visits and indefinite detention without  being charged. Her offense turned out to be having the wrong friends. Then a  23-year-old education student, she was seen by security police walking with a  white student who was about to go on trial for being an ANC supporter. Unless  she testified against him in court, she was told, she would go to jail for five  to six years. She held out for nine weeks, then the student confessed. Her  testimony no longer needed, she was released.  </P> <P> Five weeks later, Roland was arrested. With the family preoccupied with  Catherine, he had not bothered to mention that he was spying for the ANC.  </P> <P> The odds of having two of four children detained seemed a bit unusual.  </P> <P> "Three, actually," Lucienne chuckled.  </P> <P> Rosemary, the Hunter's third child, was detained in 1988 under South Africa's  emergency regulations, imposed on the uprising's 10th anniversary. Rosemary was  then student council president at the University of Witwatersrand, and had ties  with active black student unions. She was never interrogated, and, after a  week, she was released -- still uncertain why she was detained.  </P> <P> "Yes, one way or another, it's been an interesting 10 years," Lucienne said. On  a single night in 1984, Roland's car was vandalized, seven bricks were thrown  into Rosemary's apartment, and the neighbor's murdered cat, still warm, left on  her doorstep. The phone rang with a death threat. Another time, Catherine's  apartment was the target of three petrol bombs thrown through the windows.  </P> <P> In 1988, the family car was doused with gasoline and then set on fire. Lucienne  ran out with a fire extinguisher -- which she didn't know how to operate.  "There it was burning, looking like brandy over a Christmas pudding, and I  couldn't do anything about it." By the light of the fire, she read the  directions.  </P> <P> When I kept pressing the Hunters about what had motivated such defiance, the  implicit answer was one word: apartheid. Like the black children who took to  the streets in 1976, it was simply a matter of anger and conscience coming  together with experience at the right moment to express it.  </P> <P> The Hunters have no bitterness, nor do they think of themselves as particularly  noble or special. "So many have suffered so much more and so much longer than I  have," Roland said. "I am white, and that counted even in prison." Although he  had spied for the ANC, Hunter was confined to a whites-only jail.  </P> <P> "If we had it to live over, we wouldn't change any of it," added Lucienne. "We  have all grown enormously. Maybe we played a small part in what's happened.  And, of course, we intend to see it through."  </P> <P> Despite the de facto changes over the past decade and the dramatic pledges this  year of reform to end the apartheid era, "seeing it through" is not going to be  easy. Changing laws is only one step; integration and equality for the nation's  four races in day-to-day life are the bigger tests for coexistence.  </P> <P> Some South Africans, such as Roland Hunter, are trying to lay the groundwork.  Although he finished a graduate economics degree by correspondence while in  prison, Roland decided not to be a lecturer after all. After his release, he  plunged into a program called the "One City Campaign" designed to eventually  bring black townships and white cities, like Soweto and Johannesburg, together.  But it is a process that, by almost everyone's admission, will take years, even  decades to complete. Black scars and white fears are deep and lingering, and  somehow, if it is to build a lasting nonracial society, South Africa must find  a way to heal both.  </P></p>

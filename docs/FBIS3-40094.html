			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhao Haikuan (6392 3189 1401) edited by Gao Lu </F> (7559 6424): "Monetary Policy Is a Key Means of Macroeconomic  Regulation and Control"]    [Text] Our establishment of a socialist market economy will  further invigorate microeconomic operations, with market  variations becoming the key regulator of enterprise production  and business activities. Yet, while market activities can  forcefully propel enterprises to improve their operation and  management and raise their product quality and economic  efficiency, they are quite unchecked. So, to bring the driving  force of markets into full play, while ensuring the steady,  rapid, and sound growth of our national economy, tighter  macroeconomic regulation and control brook no delay.    China's macroeconomic regulation and control is exercised by  the State Council through sectors such as planning, finance, and  banking. The central bank is the department that enforces  monetary policy under State Council leadership by regulating the  money supply. The "CPC Central Committee Resolution on Certain  Issues Involved in Establishing a Socialist Market Economy"  (abbreviated hereafter as the "Resolution") points out that the  Central Government must "use monetary and fiscal policy for  regulation to achieve a basic overall balance between supply and  demand, as well as coordinating them with industrial policy to  promote the balanced development of our national economy and  society."  <H3>  Monetary Policy Is Most Crucial Means of Exercising  Macroeconomic Regulation and Control </H3>   While planning, fiscal policy, and monetary policy all are  China's means of macroeconomic regulation and control, monetary  policy stands in a particularly crucial position. This is  because the most essential substance of macroeconomic regulation  and control is the maintenance of basic overall economic  balance, or the preservation of a basic overall balance between  supply and demand. Overall supply is all of the commodities  capable of being provided to markets, while overall demand means  effective demand, or purchasing power expressed in the money  supply and its turnover frequency. The key function of  macroeconomic regulation and control, in addition to actively  supporting the development of industrial and agricultural  production and tertiary industries, by doing all possible to  increase commodity supplies, is to regulate the whole society's  money supply (as the currency turnover rate does not vary much  under normal conditions, it can be regarded as a constant), so  that it reflects the scale on which overall demand is suited to  overall supply.    The so-called money supply is the cash and account-transfer  currency in the market. It is formed by banks through fund  applications. As about 95 percent of bank fund applications are  loans, it can be said that the money supply is formed through  bank lending. Enterprises generally borrow from banks to pay for  stock purchases, and the loans granted by banks for enterprise  stock purchases very quickly turn into sales units' product-sale  funds. The product-sale funds acquired by sales units are then  used to pay employee wages, all sorts of expenses, profits and  taxes to state revenue, and for stock purchases with, except for  some that form potential currency, the rest being converted  through transactions into cash and account transfer currency. So  as long as the state emphasizes the key link of banks,  controlling overall lending and the money supply, it can achieve  its macroeconomic regulation and control ends.    The fund activities of other sectors of the national economy  can affect only the distribution and turnover rate of social  currency, by either shifting it from one sector to another or  accelerating or slowing the currency turnover rate, but cannot  directly increase or reduce the money supply. This is also the  case with fiscal revenue and expenditure. When revenue and  expenditure is balanced (including balance achieved through the  sale of bonds), fiscal revenue and expenditure comes from and is  used for the society, affecting only the social currency  turnover frequency, as well as redistributing the social money  supply. However, when fiscal revenue and expenditure produces  surpluses or deficits that increase or decrease the social money  supply, that is achieved either through increasing or decreasing  fiscal deposits in banks or through borrowing and overdrawing  from banks. In the final analysis, the impact of fiscal revenue  and expenditure on the money supply is still realized through  bank credit fund variation.    Of course, this refers only to the overall source of the  social money supply, certainly not to say that the impact of the  economic activities of the non-banking sector (mostly the fiscal  sector) on the money supply, and thus on overall social demand,  is insignificant. On the contrary, sectors, such as state  revenue, in addition to being able to affect the currency  turnover rate, can also use methods, such as spending beyond  income, creating deficits, and arranging more basic construction  projects, to force banks to make additional loans, increasing  the money supply and expanding overall social demand. So the  impact on overall demand of activities by sectors, such as state  revenue, must absolutely not be overlooked. While emphasizing  the use of monetary policy to exercise macroeconomic regulation  and control, the state must also establish coordination and  restraint mechanisms among planning, banking, and finance, to  enhance its comprehensive coordination of economic operations.  <H3>  Achieving Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Through  Mostly Monetary Policy Means Will Require Certain Terms To Be Met </H3>   Setting up a macroeconomic regulation and control system in  which planning, finance, and banking are coordinated and  monetary policy by banks is the major means, or shifting  regulation and control from mostly administrative to mostly  economic means, will require that the following terms be met:    1. We need to set up a modern enterprise system, to enable  state enterprises to become corporate entities that have  operating autonomy, are responsible for their own profits and  losses, and organize their production or operation according to  market needs. This will allow both enterprise leaders and  employees to pay particular attention to their operating results  so that they can respond sensitively to economic macroeconomic  regulation and control measures by conscientiously organizing  and adjusting their production and operation according to state  macroeconomic policy.    2. We need to pave the way for the central bank to exercise  an independent monetary policy. China's money market is a  centralized one, in which the yuan can circulate freely and  without obstacle throughout the country, and in which a larger  monetary investment by any region can affect the national  money-flow status quo. Thus, to prevent unchecked starting of  projects by localities, which would force the central bank to  provide more money, sharpening inflation, our macroeconomic  regulation and control authority, including monetary policy  control authority, must be concentrated in the center.    Some hold that we ought to devolve some macroeconomic  regulation and control authority to local governments, setting a  clear division of labor between the center and localities, and  practicing two-level macroeconomic regulation and control. This  merits discussion. Those who hold this view probably understand  macroeconomic regulation and control as controlling the major  matter of economic construction, believing that it should be not  overcentralized, but rather appropriately decentralized to  stimulate the initiative of all areas. In fact, macroeconomic  regulation and control is an economic concept with a specific  meaning, being an overall regulation and control. Its regulation  and control target is overall social supply and demand, with its  regulation and control aim being an attempt to achieve an  overall balance of demand with supply. So macroeconomic  regulation and control policies and measures can only be  formulated, organized, and enforced directly by the central  government. If we allowed all places and sectors to become their  own units for exercising regulation and control, making their  own money supply decisions, it would be impossible to balance  our whole society's overall supply and demand, and difficult to  prevent inflation.    Might the uniform exercise of macroeconomic regulation and  control concentrated in the center affect local economic  development? This would be absolutely impossible, and we must  not confuse macroeconomic regulation and control with the former  planned management. We must not worry that the mere mention of  tighter macroeconomic regulation and control concentrated in the  center might mean restricted microeconomic activity. In fact,  macroeconomic regulation and control differs sharply from the  past planned management, which directly restrained microeconomic  activity, with the more planning, the more restraint on and the  harder to stimulate the economy. On the other hand,  macroeconomic regulation and control mainly regulates and  controls overall social supply and demand, completely  deregulating the economic activities of individual enterprises  to market regulation. Tighter macroeconomic regulation and  control ensures currency stability to give enterprises full play  to grow faster, by clearing the way and setting the stage. One  of the reasons that the "Resolution" provides for macroeconomic  regulation and control authority to be concentrated in the  center is to promote microeconomic activity. If we allowed all  regions and sectors to share in macroeconomic regulation and  control authority, to practice two- or multi-level regulation  and control that would micromanage macroeconomic regulation and  control, certain defects of our past planned management might  reappear in such micromanaged macroeconomic regulation and  control.    3. We need to establish an appropriate banking system. While  banks shoulder the key macroeconomic regulation and control  responsibility, our banking system still contains certain  problems that keep it from adapting to needs. 1. Our central  bank is liable for too many specific matters, making it hard for  it to focus more efforts on controlling monetary policy. 2. All  specialized banks handle both ordinary banking business and  policy-related matters, making it impossible for them to be  genuine enterprises. This keeps the banking industry from  further invigoration, while making it impossible for the central  bank to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control through  economic means. Economic means of regulation and control is  using a method that can influence the economic interests of all  financial institutions and enterprises, to guide financial  institutions and thus enterprises to operate their business  activities according to state macroeconomic policy demands. As  all large banks have not yet become genuine enterprises, not  emphasizing evaluation of profits, it would be bound to be  impossible for the central bank to achieve the desired results  from exercising macroeconomic regulation and control through  economic means. 3. As economic leverage, such as interest and  exchange rates, is still not invigorated, bringing the impact of  monetary policy into full play to tighten macroeconomic  regulation and control will necessitate intensified reform of  our banking system:    --We need to set up a policy bank as quickly as possible to  specially handle the ordinary banking business handled by the  central bank and the policy-related matters handled by  specialized banks that require direct government regulation and  control. Once specialized banks separate out policy-related  matters; they will gradually convert to commercial banks. In  addition, we could also reestablish in an organized way a few  national or regional commercial banks, including  shareholding-system banks. But all commercial banks must  practice assets, liability, and ratio management and risk  control.    --We need to better develop our money markets. We need not  only to increase our securities trade turnover, but also to  commercialize the credit funds of commercial banks and other  financial institutions. All monetary funds, except for policy  bank loans, must be turned into commodities to operate according  to the fund for commodity exchange principle.    --We need to deregulate banking interest rates in a  controlled way. Based on the spirit of the decision by the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the central  bank in the future will set only benchmark interest rates based  on fund supply and demand, while commercial bank interest rates  can float freely within a range around the benchmark rates.  Within these limits, commercial banks and other financial  institutions will have the authority to freely decide their own  deposit and loan interest rates. We also need to reform our  foreign exchange control system by establishing a market-based  and controlled floating exchange rate system and a foreign  exchange market with uniform standards, in order to gradually  turn the yuan into a convertible currency.    Once these terms are met, the central bank will be able to  basically use economic means to effect monetary policy, the  state will be able to establish macroeconomic regulation and  control forces that control effectively while contributing to  microeconomic invigoration, and our socialist market economy  will be able to grow steadily, quickly, and soundly.</p>

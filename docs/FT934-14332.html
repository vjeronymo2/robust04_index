			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / UK warns US over unitary taxation THE UK has warned the US that it is not satisfied with the changes California has made to its system of unitary taxation. In a formal approach last week to the US State Department on behalf of the EC and eight other countries Sir Robin Renwick, the British ambassador to Washington, said new Californian legislation which in effect allows foreign companies to opt out of the unitary system did not resolve the unitary tax problem. The EC countries, together with Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, said they would not be satisfied unless the normal arm's length system of taxation was established 'as the only legitimate basis of taxing foreign companies in any state'. The UK has asked the US Supreme Court to take up the issue, filing a brief in support of a case brought by Barclays Bank of the UK against a tax assessment made by California under the unitary system. Barclays is appealing against a ruling by the California state supreme court in favour of the state tax authorities, in a test case for suits by other foreign-owned companies which could cost California Dollars 900m (Pounds 596m). Foreign, and especially British, companies have long objected to California's system of unitary taxation, which taxes a company on a percentage of its worldwide income, rather than only on income earned in the state. The Clinton administration last week urged the Supreme Court to ignore Barclays appeal, on the grounds that the new California legislation resolved the issue. But the UK's lawyers argue that the Supreme Court needs to resolve the constitutional issues raised by unitary taxation, since 'foreign policy issues are so directly implicated and lower state courts appear totally confused by this Court's prior pronouncements'.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEAF BLOWERS  </P> <P> I object to the blowers gardeners use to rid lawns and sidewalks of leaves.  This act is an insult to the senses; it uses fossil fuel instead of elbow  grease, it creates a loud, incessant noise, and it spews dust particles all  over the neighborhood. Where do they think the debris is going? Even the trade  of gardening has become a victim of technology.  </P> <P> As a first step toward discouraging the use of these blowers, I suggest that  each homeowner (the consumer) request that his or her gardener not use them.  </P> <P> JUDY CARR  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / By coal barge through Europe's heart: Nicholas Woodsworth took a slow boat up the Rhine and watched the castles, vineyards and great industries roll past WHEN Jan Veldman, somewhere on the Rhine River between Dusseldorf and Cologne, told me he was hauling 1.5m kilos of coal, I began to realise I was slightly out of my league. We were talking big boat here. I could not actually see his barge, the Vecht; I was sitting in Bonn, watching fat drops of rain hit car rooftops outside and chatting to Jan over a scratchy radio-telephone link. Nor, in my mind's eye, could I visualise that much coal. But the figure helped to put things in perspective. I have a 17-metre narrowboat on London's Regent's canal and, as English canal boats go, consider it large. I find, though, that just a couple of bags of heating coal, 25 kilos or so, cut down considerably on my living space in winter - I have to pile it under my galley table. But where on any canal boat, for heaven's sake, can you pile 60,000 times that amount, 1.5m kilos of the stuff, without it getting seriously underfoot? I was interested to see what kind of craft the Vecht might be. I did not hold my breath. The Vecht may be capacious, but no one has yet built a coal barge for speed. The trip from Dusseldorf to Bonn by car takes just one hour. Pushing a heavy cargo upstream at a stately rate of 9kph - a brisk walking pace - the Vecht took 12 times as long. Slow boats would have been in China sooner. But Jan Veldman is nothing if not punctual. A few minutes before noon the next day I was standing under quayside cranes at Grau Rheindorf, Bonn's river port, where we had agreed on a mid-day rendezvous. The cranes dripped, the sky drizzled. There was not a great deal to see. Some 300m across the river I could make out the trees and flat green fields of the far bank. Gurgling and sighing as it surged past the quay, the Rhine emerged upstream from a dull grey mist, only to disappear back into it further down. At precisely noon the square bows of a hull loomed into view and moved slowly up-river alongside the quay. The bow of the boat passed me, a Montega estate wagon parked on its foredeck. The low, narrow length of the barge came on, and on - and kept on coming, a seemingly endless succession of small hills of piled coal sliding by me. I tumbled aboard, the Vecht swung back into the oncoming current, and we were away. It seemed a long stroll to the raised wheelhouse and living quarters on the stern of the barge. I now understood why Jan did not have to clutter up his galley the way I did mine. The Vecht is just a shade under the length of a full-size soccer pitch. You can put a lot of coal into a floating steel bin 4m deep, 10m wide and 109m long. I had expected the Vecht to be a battered old vessel covered in grime and black dust. Jan Veldman would be cheery enough, I thought, a ham-fisted, hard-living bargee, a rough-polished truck driver of the waterways. Neither assumption was anywhere near the truth. With the general proportions of a pencil, the Vecht could not be called graceful. But she was as well-kept and efficiently run as a Cunard liner. She was almost as clean as a Cunard liner. My shoes came off at the door to the wheelhouse. Like everyone on board I used a pair of rubber clogs outdoors and exchanged them for bedroom slippers in the spotless interior. On modest river trips of my own through the English countryside I find that even the simplest operation requires many hands to cope with bow lines, stern lines, lock gates, boat hooks and tiller. How many crew were needed for this leviathan, I wondered. Eight? Ten? But no, here on the world's busiest inland waterway, everything from 200m locks to blind navigation in thick fog was handled by just three people. The difference is that I am a clumsy amateur and these were life-long professionals. None of them, however, remotely resembled my vision of the picaresque bargee. Sender Bosch, the Vecht's deckhand, looked like a 17-year-old student, which is what he is - anytime he is not hosing down decks, sandpapering or painting, he is studying for the series of tough exams that will eventually allow him to become a Rhine barge captain. His skipper, Jan Veldman, was indeed cheerful, but entirely failed in the tough-guy category. Behind gold-rimmed glasses his face was mobile and expressive. His hands were well-manicured, his trousers neatly pressed. He looked like an academic on holiday. The third member of the crew looked even less swash-buckling. Wearing a dark skirt and flowered blouse, her bespectacled eyes focused on her sewing, Mrs Veldman cut a comfortingly maternal figure. She should: she is the mother of six children. Like most barges on the Rhine, where 16-hour days discourage overtime wages and the growth of company fleets, the Vecht is a mom-and-pop family operation. Seen from mid-stream of the Rhine, Germany is a much prettier country than from the autobahn or the railway. As we slowly beat our way upriver past Bad Godesburg and Koningswinter, Remagen and Linz, there were all the signs of a traditional rural past - fields and cows, stretches of forest, old towns with half-timbered buildings and tall church spires. But there was no getting away from the fact that we were in the heart of the European powerhouse, a highly industrialised country in the middle of a crowded continent. If the slumbering castles and vineyards of the Rhine strike a note of Gothic romantic tradition, the storage tanks and cooling towers, industrial parks, container terminals, electricity pylons and atomic energy plants that lie along the Rhine's banks indicate a more vibrant, contemporary industrial tradition. I did not have to look as far as the shore to see that the Rhine is a highly developed axis. The river itself throbs with the sound of waterborne goods on the move. Over the next two days there was rarely a moment when the Vecht was alone on the river. There were times when I could sweep its surface with binoculars and see some of the river's more leisurely activities - a week-ending sailboat, for example, a cabin cruiser, a kayak, or one of the brightly-painted tour-boats of the Koln-Dusseldorfer line. More usually, the narrow lanes between the river's bobbing red and green channel markers were packed with the work-horses of the river getting on with their daily business. There are more than 5,000 vessels registered for use on the Rhine. Over a rainy grey afternoon I watched the progress of scores of vessels - boats like the Korsika, a German barge carrying a load of scrap metal; the Barco, from Zwijndrecht in the Netherlands, with three decks jammed with Ford and Nissan cars; the Furka, a container-carrier from Basel, in Switzerland; the Zenn, a fuel tanker from Wurzburg so heavily laden that water was lapping her gunnels. And, like the Vecht herself, heading south from the Victoria Augusta mine of the Ruhr valley to the power-generating plant of the vast BASF chemical works near Mannheim, there were innumerable coal barges. For Jan Veldman, this is the only life he knows or cares for. He comes from a line of Dutch bargemen who have worked the rivers and canals of the Netherlands and Germany uninterruptedly for 400 years. In the 17th century his ancestors were transporting peat by horse-drawn barge from the lowlands of the eastern Netherlands to heat homes in Leyden, Amsterdam and Rotterdam. By the 19th century they had changed to steam and moved on to the Rhine, carrying coal and iron ore, bricks and raw materials for the supply of the Ruhr's industrial revolution. Jan was born on his father's barge, began riverwork as a deckhand at 14, married a barge-skipper's daughter and took over his father's boat at 23. Since 1962 he has made 30 to 40 long-haul trips on the Rhine every year. He can identify hundreds of river boats by sight and knows the Rhine with his eyes closed. Now 45, he hopes that his own son, Johannes, will take over when he retires. Jan is not a carefree river gipsy, but a man of strong Calvinist principle who believes in family, hard work and individual initiative. What is it, I asked as we sat in a wheelhouse full of complex engine, steering, communication and radar equipment, that keeps him incessantly moving up and down the Rhine? Like most men whose survival depends solely on their own efforts, it is the life of independence that he values. 'I am the director of a company', he told me. 'It is only a little company, this boat, but I am its director. I make my own choices and work in my own way. I like the variety of my job. I would no more want to sit behind a ship's wheel all day than I would want to sit behind an office desk all day. I am a mechanic, a navigator, a maintenance man, a businessman.' He looked out at the passing scene and smiled. 'My life and my job are one thing, but never the same. This is a kind of freedom. From one minute to the next, life on the river is constant change.' And so it is. By late evening, the radar screen glowing green in the darkness of the Vecht's wheelhouse, we had passed the lights of the town of Boppard and moored out of the main shipping channel for the night. Under the aft-deck the Veldmans retired to a sitting room full of books and music and plants in quarters as comfortable as those of any suburban flat. With the Veldman children far away in boarding schools in the Netherlands, I settled down for the night in a snug bedroom wall-papered in clouds of pink and white. Surrounded by puppets and wide-eyed dolls and the sound of the current ceaselessly swirling around the stern, I drifted through a night of restless dreams. IT DID not last long. By 5am the floor beneath my bunk shuddered, the engine below roared into life and we were moving between the high hills of the Rhine gorge. This is the narrowest part of the river on its 1,000km length between Lake Constance and Rotterdam on the North Sea, and also the fastest. Up on deck, passing St Goar with the great defensive walls and turrets of Rheinfels castle above us, I saw that the river's width had shrunk from its customary 100m to something less than 50m. The surface of the water was covered with rags of drifting mist, but they were not thick enough to hide signs of a current now surging downstream at more than 10kph. That may not sound fast. But in a narrow channel where 100m boats are negotiating winding bends, where eddys, whirlpools and broken white water cover submerged rocks and sandbanks, it is very fast indeed. It is fast enough that the Lorelei, the high slate cliff that plunges into the Rhine in the mid-section of the gorge, has become celebrated in Germanic myth and song as a destroyer of ships and men. Certainly, watching Jan Veldman concentrating at the helm of the Vecht as she churned upstream through white water, it was fast enough for me to realise that the Rhine, no matter how domesticated and business-like it has become, remains an exciting river, one of the great waterways of the world. That afternoon, some 180km from my starting point at Bonn and two hours past the confluence of the Rhine and the Main, I bade my farewells and jumped ship. It was time to head back down the river and home. In Rudesheim - a renowned producer of Rhine wine and one of the kitschiest tourist traps in Germany - I boarded the MV Koblenz. As if on cue the clouds cleared, the sun appeared and the river turned from leaden grey to sparkling blue. From the crowded glassed-in dining room of the tour-boat, the Rhine had become another river. The work-a-day world of the river disappeared and was replaced by the Rhine of dramatic sightseeing and syrupy gemutlichkeit. On steep crags and hills above the vineyards, famous castles and fortresses slid by - Ehrenfels, Rheinstein, Marksburg, Reichenstein, Sooneck, Burg Maus. On the ship's Tannoy there was a commentary in three languages. At the tables there were sausages and schnitzel galore. Steins of beer were emptied almost as quickly as they could be filled. At the Lorelei we all joined in singing Heinrich Heine's stirring ode to the river. There were tears in people's eyes, sentimental pride in their faces. They were romantic, jolly, and emotional in a way only Teutons can be. I was emotional, too. I was thinking of Jan Veldman sitting quietly with the rain beating on the wheelhouse of the Vecht, and missing it.</p>

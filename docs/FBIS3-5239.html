Yun Se-tal over the recent scandal surrounding  the misappropriation of public donations to charity by officials  at some countries under his control.    Yi Kyong-ho, assistant minister of home affairs, will be  named new Kyonggi governor, a government spokesman said.    The government also sacked O Song-su, Songnam City mayor who  is being dismissed for his "problematic" wealth accumulation,  and Kim Hak-kyu, Hwasong County chief, with regard to the  charity scandal, the official said.    Ha Yong-su, director-general of transportation and tourism  affairs at Kyonggi provincial government, will receive  disciplinary measures, according to the spokesman.    The dismissals came after the Home Affairs Ministry  completed  Thursday its 10-day inspection of affiliated organizations  including Kyonggi provincial government over the  misappropriation of charity funds.    The ministry's inspection was undertaken after the Board of  Audit and Inspection announced last week that some government  agencies had misappropriated charity funds donated by the public  for other purposes.    The dismissed governor had used donations for the poor for  personal expenses and O was found to have forcibly collected 3.9  billion won from construction firms as charity funds, the  spokesman said.</p>

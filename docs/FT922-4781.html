			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally after surprise Fed coupon purchase US TREASURY prices staged a remarkable turnround yesterday after the Federal Reserve surprisingly announced an outright purchase of coupons. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  9/32 at 101 9/16 , yielding 7.857 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/8 at 99 27/32 , yielding 5.192 per cent. Prices opened markedly weaker across the board and remained at low levels throughout the morning after the likelihood of another interest rate cut had dwindled in the wake of Monday's unexpectedly strong May purchasing managers' report. In the afternoon, however, prices rallied sharply after the Fed's announcement. Few had expected a coupon pass from the Fed, so inventories were low. Subsequently, the rush of buying by dealers who needed securities to sell to the Fed pushed prices higher. Earlier in the day there had been little reaction to the news of a surprisingly small 1.3 per cent rise in April new single-family home sales, but the buying lacked conviction and soon petered out. UK government bond prices slipped back in dull trading with dealers suggesting that the Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty exerted a restraining influence on the market yesterday. Short-dated gilts ended the day little changed, while longer-dated issues edged lower. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 slipped from its opening level of 117 31/32 to trade at 117 7/8 by late afternoon. The Bank of England issued a Pounds 100m tranche of the existing 6 3/4 per cent gilt due 1995/98, which will be available for sale from today at a price of 93 1/16 . Dealers pointed out that the existing stock had recently been trading 'rather expensively' in the market and welcomed the Bank's decision to issue a new tranche for market management purposes. In addition, a Pounds 500m tranche of 3 per cent Treasury stock due 1992 matures next week, so investors who prefer to hold low-coupon stocks may be keen to place the proceeds from the maturing stock in another low-coupon issue such as the 6 3/4 per cent 1995/98 gilt. THE European government bond markets fell back yesterday as rumours circulated that Denmark would vote against the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty on economic and monetary union in yesterday's referendum. Despite a clutch of recent opinion polls showing a swing in favour of ratification, traders said speculation had circulated in the bond markets and sent prices lower in Germany, France and the Ecu bond market. The fall in the US Treasury bond market also helped ond prices. Traders noted some switching out of Germany into the Scandinavian markets ahead of the referendum result. The Danish government bond market ended the day higher, with the 9 per cent bond due 2000 moving from its opening level of 101.70 to close at 101.95. JAPANESE government bond prices ended at the day's lows as the yen failed to strengthen against the US dollar. The market opened on a weak note yesterday, following the fall in US Treasury bond prices overnight and the halt in the yen's strengthening against the US currency. The Bank of Japan intervened in the foreign exchange markets, selling dollars for the fifth consecutive trading day, and the yen traded at 127.50 to the dollar in London, compared with 127.15 the previous day. The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 5.535 per cent and moved in a range of 5.5 to 5.535 per cent before closing in Tokyo at 5.53 per cent. China plans to put Y21bn of state treasury bonds on the market on July 1 as part of efforts to tap growing personal savings, AP-DJ reports from Beijing. The Ministry of Finance said the bonds would mature on July 1 1995. Annual interest on the tax-exempt bonds will be 9.5 per cent. It did not give details of how money raised would be spent.</p>

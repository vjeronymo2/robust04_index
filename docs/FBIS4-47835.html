			<p>BFN     [Text] The Goldstone Commission has released its report on  the preliminary inquiry into the attempted purchase of firearms  by the KwaZulu Government from Eskom [Electricity Supply  Commission]. The commission said it was disturbing that the  commissioner of police had issued an export permit for the  weapons without realizing the sensitivity of the matter. The  commission found that the sale of 1,000 semi-automatic rifles to  the KwaZulu Police had not been authorized by the management of  Eskom, but that the sale had been arranged without authority by  an employee of the company. The commission said it was  satisfied that the National Intelligence Service had had nothing  to do with the transaction.</p>

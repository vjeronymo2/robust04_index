			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Lima Radio Programas del Peru Network in  Spanish at 1400 GMT on 15 January broadcasts live its 60-minute  "Saturday Focus" program hosted by Dennis Vargas Marin. Vargas  begins by discussing the government's decision to change the  municipal tax system. This is a controversial decision, he  says, and mayors have reacted strongly against cuts in its  revenues. Vargas adds that Finance Minister Jorge Camet has  supported the decision of President Fujimori, who said that he  will prove that municipalities will indeed receive more funds.    His guests include Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont; Enrique  Espinosa, Metropolitan Institute of Planning president; Enrique  Labarte, municipal economic adviser and assemblyman; and Arturo  Castillo, Chiclayo mayor and Association of Peruvian  Municipalities president.    Belmont says this hasty decision does not surprise him. A  similar situation, he adds, happened when Democratic Constituent  Congress President Jaime Yoshiyama urged Peruvians to vote for  the new Constitution in the referendum regardless of whether  they had read it.    Vargas asks Belmont what he did when he learned that  President Fujimori was about to make this decision. Belmont  says that he protested sternly. He details the works his  administration has accomplished so far. Labarte quotes a  congressman who said that municipalities will get more funds,  except Lima, whose revenues will be redistributed.    LA REPUBLICA reporter Ismael Leon asks Belmont what he  thinks  about certain mayors' decision to support the redistribution of  funds from rich municipalities, such as Lima, to poorer  municipalities. Belmont says that he has been unable to meet  with President Fujimori to discuss this issue and that it is a  shame that the president refuses to let anyone do anything good.  Belmont lists the major achievements of his administration.    Vargas asks how this decision will affect Lima in 1994.  Belmont says that many projects will not be built, that many  jobs will disappear, and that prices will go up. He compares  this situation to being in a boxing ring with tied hands.    Vargas asks if other mayors agree with Belmont's viewpoints.  Mayor Castillo says he does, and Chiclayo will also be affected  by cuts in municipal revenues, he says.    Belmont says "Peru is suffering from divisions." He adds  that  congressmen should visit Chiclayo, Puno, and other poor  municipalities to learn firsthand of their realities. Vargas  agrees with him. Belmont adds that he has visited Huaycan, a  poor neighborhood. He says he has performed many works, but the  media have not been invited to the openings or covered such  events. Belmont says Peru is a whole nation, but "Lima is not  responsible for the lack of development elsewhere in the country  and for governmental mistakes." Lima has many problems too, he  adds.    Reporter Leon wonders whether municipal governments are more  important than regional governments. Castillo says he believes  that the two governments are necessary to decentralize the  administration.    Vargas cites Economy Minister Camet, who has said provincial  governments have kept all the funds instead of distributing them  among municipalities. Castillo replies that this is a big lie.  Vargas also wonders if this issue is being politicized, and  Belmont insists it is. He adds that President Fujimori is  polarizing Peruvians, saying, he is "playing political games."    Belmont concludes that the new Constitution will let  Fujimori  stay in power for many years, because he will seek reelection,  but Castillo says he harbors doubts about this possibility.</p>

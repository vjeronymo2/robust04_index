			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> OLYMPIAN FINDS SELF IN VICTORY  </P> <P> Former Olympic champion Billy Mills, a native of the Pine Ridge Indian  Reservation, says he felt rejected by the white world until he won the  10,000-meter race in the 1964 Games in Tokyo.  </P> <P> "The Japanese judge kept asking me, 'You are? You are?' For the first time in  my life I could look at someone in the eyes and tell them who I really was,"  Mills said at an Indian education workshop.  </P> <P> South Dakota is making progress in improving relations between Indians and  whites, said Mills, who now lives in California. But Mills, 52, said Indians  still have difficulty getting the respect and representation they deserve.  </P> <P> "I live for the day when there is a constitutional amendment to elect two  at-large senators to represent all Indian tribes," he said. "Then and only then  will I have representation."  </P></p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Somalia fighting claims two lives as troops battle gunmen AT LEAST two Somalis were killed and 14 injured when US Marines and French foreign legionnaire paratroopers exchanged fire with freelance gunmen and bandits last night in the Somali capital, Mogadishu. The clash, the most serious since foreign troops took the capital on Wednesday, came as Mr Herman Cohen, US assistant secretary of state for African affairs, told a Nairobi news conference that some of the US-led force could stay in Somalia for up to a year. 'US military involvement will be limited,' said Mr Cohen, 'but troops will liaise with the UN with a view to establishing some form of governmental authority.' It would take 'between six and 12 months'. The US force in Mogadishu said it had arranged talks between the two most important rival warlords whose power struggle has reduced the city to rubble. Gen Mohamed Farar Aideed and Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed agreed to meet for the first time in 13 months today at the gutted US embassy compound. But Mr Robert Oakley, the US special envoy now in Somalia, was adamant that the US would not be involved 'in drawing the possible political architecture for the future of Somalia'. In a television interview from Mogadishu, he said today's meeting was not 'political' and was mostly designed to discuss immediate security-related issues. Somalia's future, he added, was 'a UN mission' in which the US would offer what help it could but not, he implied, take the lead. One purpose of the meeting, he said, was to look into how best to get Somalis to turn in their weapons. He did not rule out house-to-house searches by the coalition forces, but hoped some less intrusive approach might work. Payment of bounties to those surrendering guns has also not been ruled out in Washington. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, said in New York that he was inviting Gen Aideed and Mr Mahdi to a further meeting, in Addis Ababa next month, in a new attempt at national reconciliation. Representatives of the clans and international aid officials would also be asked to attend. The moves have brought Somalia closer to the status of a UN trusteeship. This reflects the hardening belief that a political initiative must run in parallel with the relief exercise. The alternative, say African and other diplomats, is that Somalia would revert to violence as soon as the international force withdrew. As UN forces imposed some order in Mogadishu, a US expeditionary force checked out the airstrip at the former Somali air force base of Baidogley, 110 miles away. Aid agencies called on US forces to deploy rapidly into the towns of Kismayo and Baidoa which have been engulfed in looting and warfare, leaving at least 60 dead in the past four days.

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Superquarry caught in centre of debate: James Buxton examines the fierce row over the proposed destruction of a Hebridean hillside The eastern side of the island of Harris in the Outer Hebrides is a broken landscape of low rocky hills, tiny lochs and jagged indentations from the sea. Few people live here, because apart from a little fishing and sheep farming there is almost nothing for them to do. One of the hills, near Lingerabay, consists of a rock called anorthosite, in strong demand for use as aggregate in construction and road building. Tomorrow a public inquiry starts into a controversial plan by Redland Aggregates, part of the Redland construction group, to establish a quarry at Lingerabay and extract 600m tonnes of anorthosite in the next 60 to 100 years. The scale of the project justifies the term superquarry. The eastern side of a hill named Roineabhal will gradually be scooped out and shipped away. Eventually the hillside will give way to a man-made sea loch. The quarry will cover an area of more than 1 sq m. The superquarry has the support of Western Isles council which is 'minded' to give planning consent to Redland. But Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, has ordered a public inquiry because of the environmental and economic issues that the project raises. The hearing is set to go on into next year. Redland says Lingerabay is the best of more than 40 sites in Scotland for mining a badly needed commodity when there is a shortage of feasible quarrying sites in England and Wales. It says the quarry, which will initially employ 25 people, rising to between 50 and 100 at full production, will give 'confidence and hope to a visibly declining society in south Harris'. The issue of the superquarry, over which the 5,000 people of Harris are divided evenly, boils down to whether mineral extraction is the kind of activity which will arrest the decline in the population, or whether its environmental effects will cause further damage to a fragile economy. The most authoritative objector is Scottish Natural Heritage, the government's conservation agency, whose opposition made the public inquiry inevitable. It says the quarry, in an officially designated national scenic area, would have an unacceptable impact on its 'scenic qualities and character'. It would create a scar on the landscape visible from Skye, 20 miles away - though it would be shielded from the rest of Harris - and would inflict noise, dust, vibration from blasting, traffic and waste disposal, so damaging the interests of those dependent on Harris's reputation as 'a pristine tourist destination'. Aggregate could be better obtained from other sites in Scotland, or from superquarries in Norway. This attitude infuriates some residents, who point to the decline in the population and the desperate shortage of economic activity in Harris. At a recent public debate Mr Kenneth Mattheson, a crofter, complained that the agency was giving wildlife and plants priority over people. A local doctor said that last year in the northern part of the island only eight babies were born but 50 people died. The population, he said, was set to halve in the next 25 years. But Mr Ian Callaghan, a merchant banker who moved to Harris nearly five years ago to run a small hotel, believes the scale of the project is too big for the island to absorb. 'The things we have here - like community values, lack of crime, peace and quiet - are beyond price,' he said. Redland last week agreed to pay Pounds 15,000 a year or 1p per tonne of rock removed, whichever was the greater, into a community trust fund for local people once production started, probably at the turn of the century. At the 5m tonnes a year which Redland hopes to achieve by 2005, that would amount to Pounds 50,000 a year. The company is anxious to convince islanders that it will suppress dust emission from the site by spraying water and will ensure that ballast water pumped out of bulk carriers before they load from the quarry does not damage the rich prawn grounds off south-east Harris. Yet some people doubt whether the quarry, if it goes ahead, would directly benefit the indigenous population. The numbers it would employ would not be high, and in spite of Redland's commitment to hiring the majority of its workforce from the locals, it could be in for a disappointment. One Harris man who has employed people on the island for 18 years said: 'You can't rely on the Harris crofters as a workforce. They sign on for a job but then take a week off to dip their sheep or dig peat. They don't want jobs, they've got their sheep and their dole and their whisky. There's a few good workers and their employers will want to hang on to them.' Redland, he concluded, would have to bring in its own labour force. That might benefit the island's economy only indirectly.</p>

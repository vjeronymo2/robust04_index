			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUNTING AN ELUSIVE PREY;  </P> <P> COUNTY RESIDENTS COMB PARKS, SEA BLUFFS TO COUNT BUTTERFLIES  </P> <P> Beneath a sweltering sun and the lithe black willow trees, amid the salt  grasses, the pickleweed and the wild grassy growth of orange witch's hair, they  hunted an elusive prey Saturday.  </P> <P> Some 40 county residents, young and old, armed themselves with mesh nets and  water canteens to scour parklands and ocean bluffs from Tustin to Newport Beach  as part of a nationwide, once-a-year butterfly census. They met at 10 a.m. at  UC Irvine's arboretum and at Bowers Museum in Santa Ana before fanning out  across the county for the search.  </P> <P> Organizers said they found fewer butterflies this year, in part because of the  drought that has scorched the Southern California landscape but also because of  the steady decline of the butterfly family resulting from years of development.  The annual count is sponsored by the Xerces Society, a national preservation  group that takes its name from a tiny, now-extinct butterfly that once wandered  the blue skies above San Francisco Bay.  </P> <P> "A lot of environmentalists believe that butterflies are kind of on the front  line of defense," explained Larry Shaw, 34, a biologist who works for the  county.  </P> <P> "If you don't see as many butterflies year after year, you wonder why,"  continued Shaw, who organized the Orange County contingent of the nationwide  search. "They're kind of an indicator species because they're so delicate."  </P> <P> If there were fewer butterflies to count this year, it didn't dampen the  enthusiasm of the eight volunteers who scoured Caspers Regional Park in Irvine.  Fred Soria and his three children, who live in Garden Grove, watched  breathlessly as they waited for just the right moment to swoop a net down on a  blue Pygmy, the tiniest butterfly in the world, who just happens to call  Southern California home.  </P> <P> "Careful, careful. Let him land," Soria told his children. "There he is right  there."  </P> <P> Then came the swoosh, swoosh of 12-year-old Talia Soria's net and the blue  Pygmy was captured, examined, noted on an inventory sheet and freed.  </P> <P> "This is it," Shaw confirmed before freeing the rare butterfly. "This is the  smallest butterfly in the world."  </P> <P> "There's one right here," called out 10-year-old Henry Lim, who chased the  apparently more prolific wandering skipper. "There's another. There's three!"  </P> <P> Saturday's hunt also offered a rudimentary biology class for the novice  butterfly afficionado. The butterfly, Shaw explained, is part of the arthropod  family. Its less attractive relatives include spiders, other insects,  centipedes, crayfish, crabs and lobsters.  </P> <P> There are thousands of varieties of butterflies in the world, 80 to 100 of  which are found in Orange County. Most live only three to four weeks once they  leave their cocoon-like pupae, travel no more than a few hundred yards and mate  only once. One type, the desert swallow, may wait as long as seven years for a  lush, rainy season before shedding its protective shell and emerging as a  butterfly.  </P> <P> "How unfortunate. Such a short life span," mused Kristina Adamek, a Costa Mesa  resident. "I hope they're happy every moment. At least we have some time to  repair."  </P> <P> Saturday's highlight was a glimpse at a morning cloak that had just shed its  pupa that morning. Still in mint condition, with no scratches or bird bites,  the butterfly gently batted its gilded black velvet wings as it rested on a  tree trunk preparing for flight.  </P> <P> "It's just so perfect," Shaw said. "That one has not flown yet. He's just  exercising his muscles."  </P> <P> Despite the find, Saturday's relentless heat proved too much for 6-year-old  Chelsea Soria.  </P></p>

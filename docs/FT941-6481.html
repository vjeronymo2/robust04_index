			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee and cocoa steady - Market Report London Commodity Exchange COCOA and COFFEE futures showed steady gains yesterday after Monday's sharp declines, but traders described trading as 'unenthusiastic'. May delivery cocoa ended Pounds 7 up at 917 a tonne after dipping to Pounds 905 early on. Most traders thought support at Pounds 900 was likely to hold, though some thought a slide to Pounds 870 possible unless fresh outright buying returned. The coffee market enjoyed light support from a further drop in US certified stocks and the May price closed at Dollars 1,223 a tonne, up Dollars 10. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER set a generally lower tone.

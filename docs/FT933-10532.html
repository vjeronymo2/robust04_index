			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The ERM: EC economies, the opportunities and risks - France Prime Minister Edouard Balladur might be loath to admit it, but the demise of his treasured franc fort policy may be exactly what the sluggish economy needs, writes Alice Rawsthorn. For two years the economy has been burdened by high real interest rates depressing consumer spending and industrial investment. Until last autumn companies could count on export growth to compensate for poor domestic demand, but exports have been hit by the franc's strength since last September's currency crisis. France has since slid into recession. Interest rates have fallen since the conservatives took over in March, with the Bank of France's official intervention rate tumbling from 9.1 per cent to 6.75. But these cuts were not enough to improve domestic demand, or to curb unemployment which hit a record 3.18m in June. The decision to widen the ERM bands should enable the government to cut rates more aggressively. The franc's relatively robust performance for the past two days suggests it should be able to avoid a dramatic decline. Broker James Capel expects the official intervention rate to fall to 4 per cent by the year's end. This should help to cut companies' financial costs. Exporters ought to gain ground in relatively strong currency markets such as Germany, the US and UK. But industry has so much surplus capacity that an increase in investment is not expected before next year. Consumer demand could recover sooner, given higher savings ratios, but confidence is unlikely to recover while unemployment rises.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Tokyo hits record high on hopes of rate cut JAPANESE government bonds climbed to new highs as yesterday's tumble in the Tokyo stock market raised hopes of further cut in interest rates. The Nikkei average index dropped another 620.14 points to close at 14,309.41, its lowest close since March 1986. Dealers said the bond market rallied steadily in response to the stock market's free-fall. 'People are pouring money into the (Japanese) government bond market as they expect to see an easing in interest rates,' said one dealer. Short-term interest rates edged lower, with the rate on three-month certificates of deposit slipping from 3.90 per cent to 3.88 per cent yesterday. The price of the December futures contract for 10-year government bonds traded as high as 106.10, the highest level for the since August 1989. The yield on the benchmark No 129 moved from its opening level of 4.80 per cent to 4.71 per cent before closing at 4.725 per cent in Tokyo. The No 129 continued to rally in London trading, taking its cue from the strong opening in the US treasury bond market. Dealers said yesterday's announcement by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, of a package of emergency measures yesterday to restore confidence in the stock market had little impact on the bond market. AN unexpected decline in July housing starts lifted US Treasury prices across the maturity range yesterday, temporarily eclipsing the market's concerns about politically-motivated tax cuts. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/8 at 98, yielding 7.328 per cent. The two-year note was markedly firmer, up 1/8 at 100 7/16 , to yield 3.996 per cent. Prices gained ground after the Commerce department reported that housing starts fell 2.8 per cent last month, and that June's housing starts fell a revised 3.8 per cent (they were originally reported to have declined by 3.2 per cent). Analysts had predicted a modest upturn in housing starts for July, so the figures immediately triggered a spate of buying, especially at the short end of the yield curve. Short-dated securities were also buoyed by speculation about another policy ease. The Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee began its monthly meeting yesterday, and investors were hoping that continued economic weakness would persuade the FOMC to sanction another interest rate cut. AUSTRALIAN government bonds staged a strong rally following the government's annual budget announcement and promises of further cuts in interest rates. The government forecast a budget deficit for the 1992/93 fiscal year of ADollars 13.39bn, towards the low end of expectations. The statement added that 'further reductions in interest rates will be possible if the decline in inflation and expectations of inflation is sustained,' prompting a surge in the bond market, with shorter-dated issues showing the biggest gains. Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, forecast that inflation would average 2 per cent in the year ending June 30 1993, from 1.9 per cent last year. The government expects the economy to grow by 3 per cent this year. The three-year bond futures contract, which had traded at around 93.08 before the announcement, climbed to 93.24. In the cash market, the yield on the 10 per cent bond due October 2002 moved to 8.28 per cent after the budget, from 8.37 per cent before the announcement. GERMAN government bonds ended slightly weaker with the market awaiting today's Bundesbank tender allocation and the release of the July money supply figures. The Liffe bund futures contract traded in a fairly narrow range of 87.64-87.78, ending the day at around 87.68. Dealers warned the market would be watching the Bundesbank's tender allocation for signs of any move in interest rates. STERLING'S weakness in the foreign exchange markets depressed the UK government bond market yesterday with gilts ending the day slightly lower. The Liffe futures contract slipped from 97.20 at the opening to 97.17 while the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 drifted from 115 23/32 to 115 21/32 . The Bank of England announced details of its next auction which met market expectations  - the Bank will auction Pounds 2.5bn of the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 on August 26.</p>

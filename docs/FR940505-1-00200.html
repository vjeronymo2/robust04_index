As for Sacramento and Ventura, the final FIP may be adjusted as appropriate to reflect further analysis by the State and EPA, if that analysis shows that different target levels and control strategies are technically more appropriate to show attainment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. State and local control measures. For all three FIP areas, most existing State and local control measures are included in the emission projections used to compare to the target emission levels. However, since EPA uses the CALI5a motor vehicle emissions model and its own non-road mobile source inventory, the associated emission reductions may not match those assumed by California in its own projected inventories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Attainment demonstrations. Emission reductions projected from proposed FIP measures are discussed in sections 3.C through 3.G of this NPRM. To show attainment, the projected ton/day benefits of the FIP control measures are subtracted from the baseline inventories for the appropriate attainment year in each FIP area. The results are then compared to the attainment target in each area as discussed in section 3.H.3 of this NPRM. This calculation is provided in detail in the technical support document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> I. Transportation Conformity <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act requires transportation plans, transportation programs, and transportation projects which are funded with title 23 U.S.C. or Federal Transit Act funds or approved by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) or Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) to conform with the applicable implementation plan for a nonattainment area. After promulgation, the FIPs will be part of the applicable ozone and CO implementation plans for the Sacramento, Ventura, and South Coast nonattainment areas, and will therefore add certain criteria which must be satisfied before the MPOs for these areas or FHWA/FTA can find that a transportation plan, program, or project conforms. However, these additional criteria are limited, as explained below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed FIP will not alter the Criteria and Procedures for Determining Transportation Conformity which EPA promulgated on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188). The FIP itself will not impose any restriction on the selection and implementation of transportation projects which can be found to conform under the terms of the promulgated transportation conformity criteria and procedures. Furthermore, the FIP does not direct the expenditure of funds designated under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act to any specific projects or type of project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of California is responsible for submitting to EPA a conformity SIP revision by November 24, 1994, as required by 40 CFR 51.396. The conformity SIP revision is a requirement added in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, is not mentioned in any of the settlement agreements, and therefore is not an obligation for EPA under the court orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because it establishes strategies for Sacramento and Ventura to attain by 2005, the FIP will establish motor vehicle emissions budgets for VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for those FIP areas for the year 2005. In addition, the CO attainment demonstration will establish a CO budget for the year 2000 for the South Coast. These budgets play no role for the purposes of conformity until the FIP is promulgated. (This is in contrast to state-submitted budgets, which do play a role upon submission to EPA.) Conformity determinations made after the FIP is promulgated must use the FIP's budgets for the years indicated and any subsequent analysis years, until the SIP process establishes different budgets for subsequent years (e.g., state-submitted plan with budgets is approved). At a minimum, the conformity of the transportation plan must be redetermined using the FIP's budget within 18 months of the FIP's promulgation (see 40 CFR 51.400(b)(3)(iii)). The conformity of transportation improvement programs must be redetermined within six months following the adoption of a transportation plan (see 40 CFR 51.400(c)(3)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is some ambiguity in Clean Air Act section 176(c) and EPA's conformity rule regarding whether the proposed FIP, when final, will create VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  budgets for the South Coast, and if so, for which years. While the FIP analysis contains emissions projections for 2000, 2005, and 2010, EPA believes that its application of Clean Air Act section 182(e)(5) to the FIP means that the South Coast FIP will not specifically allocate 2010 emission reductions between transportation and other sources. Furthermore, there are no specific emission reduction requirements that the FIP must satisfy in 2000 and 2005. Therefore, the South Coast FIP will establish no emissions budget binding on the MPOs or U.S. DOT.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

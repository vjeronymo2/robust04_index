			<p>BFN     [Text] Shortly before leaving for Zurich from Ioannina,  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias expressed reserved optimism  on the outcome of his meeting with his Albanian counterpart,  Alfred Serreqi. He stressed: I am going to this meeting with  open proposals and I hope that Albania will show it willingness  to improve bilateral relations.    The Greek foreign minister said he will raise the issue of  Albania releasing the arrested members of the Greek minority  party Omonoia, who are being detained at Tirana prison.  Papoulias added that the recent incidents in Tirana have cast a  shadow on this meeting in Zurich, and as a gesture of goodwill  the Albanian Government should have already released the  prisoners.    Referring to the recent incident at the Episkopi border  station, Papoulias reiterated that it would not be beneficial  for the Albanian side to insist on its intransigent position.    The ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reported a short time ago that the  meeting between Papoulias and Serreqi began at 1300 today [Greek  time] in Zurich. The bulletin adds that Foreign Ministry  Secretary General Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis and other  officials participated in the meeting, which will deal with the  entire spectrum of Greek-Albanian relations, particularly the  issue of the oppressive measures adopted recently against the  Greek minority.</p>

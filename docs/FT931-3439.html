			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Price rises in pipeline as Rugby edges up to Pounds 57.6m BUILDING MATERIAL price increases are starting to be forced through by producers according to Rugby Group, which supplies cement, joinery, steel and glass to the UK, European and US construction industries. Rugby's share price rose by 6 per cent yesterday, from 222p to 236p, after pre-tax profits edged ahead from Pounds 57.3m to Pounds 57.6m over 1992 despite deep recession in the UK construction industry. Mr Peter Carr, managing director, said that there were clear indications that material producers believed the time was right to try to recover lost margins by pushing up prices. Increases announced at the beginning of this year of up to 13 per cent by British Steel and 8 per cent by Pilkington, the UK glass manufacturer, so far had held firm, he said. 'The closure of large manufacturing capacity means that supply and demand is coming back into line. With the prospect of revival in the housing market there appears to be a concerted attempt among manufacturers to make price rises stick.' Foreign manufacturers suffering from sterling's devaluation were in no position to undercut price moves by British companies. In the case of glass, continental European manufacturers had followed Pilkington's lead and raised their own prices by a similar amount according to Mr Carr. He said that steel, glass, plasterboard, timber and other product price price rises could increase UK building material bills by up to 6 per cent this year. This could be damaging for contractors and sub-contractors which had taken on fixed-price construction contracts at little or no profit margin. Rugby, Britain's third largest cement manufacturer with about 20 per cent of the market, needs to buy steel, glass and timber for its constructional steel, steel reinforcement and joinery businesses. Cement prices, unlike those for other building materials, have seen small rises during recession but have not been increased this year. A 15 per cent fall in UK trading profits to Pounds 29.4m (Pounds 34.8m) was offset by a 41 per cent increase in overseas profits from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 23.4m. International profits were helped by the devaluation of sterling. A 7 per cent increase in Australian dollar profits, for example, became a 20 per cent gain in sterling at year-end exchange rates. UK cement profits fell 12 per cent to Pounds 16.8m following a 5 per fall in volume sales. Rugby said that it expected sales to decline by a similar amount in the current year. Interest received rose from Pounds 4.43m to Pounds 4.82m and helped maintain earnings per share at 13.1p. An unchanged final dividend of 3.6p holds the total for the year at 6.45p. COMMENT Currency translations had a mixed effect on Rugby's results, enhancing the sterling profits of overseas operations but depressing by Pounds 17m the value of cash reserves which during the year fell from Pounds 24m to Pounds 12m. Devaluation will reduce the amount of interest receivable in the current year offsetting further trading improvements in Australia and the US. As a result profits seem likely to show little change. Rugby is a well managed group, with a strong balance sheet and adequate dividend cover, which has shown itself capable of funding necessary capital expenditure out of cashflow. A prospective p/e of 18 on maintained earnings, however, suggests that these virtues have been recognised in the share price.</p>

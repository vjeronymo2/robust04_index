			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR BRADLEY'S PROPOSAL FOR MANDATORY WATER RATIONING  </P> <P> If Mayor Bradley wants to begin water rationing, he ought to begin in his own  back yard. For the last two months, everyday in the late afternoon as I stroll  by City Hall East at Main and 1st streets, the automatic sprinkler system comes  on with one particular sprinkler head missing, hence the water just pours out  from the shrubbery bed onto Main Street with not one city worker in the least  bit attentive to this small hypocrisy.  </P> <P> ANDY AVALOS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

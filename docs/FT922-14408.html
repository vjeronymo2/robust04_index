			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace Although Saudi Arabia has yet formally to place its mooted Tornado order, its decision to allocate more funds to the Al-Yamamah defence deal is undoubtedly good news for British Aerospace. The money will help finance the working capital needed for a range of Al-Yamamah contracts. Saudi Arabia is also signalling a flow of orders large enough to ensure that BAe can at least maintain its dividend over the next couple of years, despite the impact of recession on its motor and property divisions. That justifies yesterday's 5 per cent jump in its share price. A yield of more than 10 per cent even suggests scope for further recovery. But this is limited by the weakness of the regional jet market and the overhang of unsold shares from last year's rights issue, which are likely to start flowing back into the market if the price rises much above 330p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Military Courier" program: Video report by Igor </F> Krondo]    [Text] [Krondo over video of air attack] The experience  of local wars and armed conflicts during the second half of the  20th century, including the wars in Korea and Vietnam, the  Arab-Israeli wars, and operation Desert Storm indicates that the  success of combat operations is determined largely by reliable  air defenses. This accounts for the great attention which has  been paid to the development of modern multiple-target SAM  missile systems. Right now it is possible to claim with  confidence that the Russian military-industrial complex is a  world leader in this sphere.    Take for instance this multichannel SAM missile system, the  S-300 PMO-1, which is in the Russian Army's arsenal. It is  designed to destroy modern combat aircraft and cruise and  ballistic missiles. Essentially, this system ensures 100  percent destruction of aerodynamic targets within a range of 150  km, and of ballistic missiles and their warheads within a range  of 40 km. Minimum target altitude is 10 meters, and maximum  altitude is the service ceiling of modern combat aircraft. What  is more, the speed of the target is of no consequence. It is  possible to hit six targets simultaneously, targeting them with  up to 12 missiles. The S-300 PMO-1 SAM missile system is highly  mobile. Either self-propelled or transported by rail or  military transport aircraft, it can be moved to any region in a  short space of time. And it takes only five minutes to deploy.  Its foreign counterpart is the U.S. Patriot system, which  received wide publicity following operation Desert Storm.</p>

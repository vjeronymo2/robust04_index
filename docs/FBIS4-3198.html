			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 19 (AFP) -- China's best known  dissident Wei Jingsheng has been placed under police  surveillance in a hotel in the Beijing suburbs, his family said  Tuesday. "Police told my father that Wei Jingsheng was in a  medium-class hotel in the suburbs," said Wei Ling, his younger  sister told AFP. But they did not give the name of the hotel,  she added.    A security ministry official contacted by telephone refused  comment.    Wei was detained on April 1 on suspicion of having  "committed  new crimes" but his family has not been told if new charges have  been brought against him. Last week a foreign ministry  spokesman said Wei was a "criminal" and that his case had  nothing to do with human rights.    Wei, 43, was freed on parole last September after serving 14  years in jail for his role as a leader of the Democracy Wall  movement in 1978-79. Since then he has given several interviews  to the foreign press in which he said he planned to continue his  fight for democracy in China.    Wei's secretary Tong Yi, has also been detained by the  authorities, but Wei's family is without news of her.</p>

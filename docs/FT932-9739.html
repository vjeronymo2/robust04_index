			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hong Kong to block 'back-door' exchange listings HONG KONG'S regulatory authorities last night moved to stem the rush of mainland Chinese companies seeking a stock exchange listing by blocking 'back-door listings' on Hong Kong's stock market. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange issued a joint statement warning financial advisers and companies that future deals would be scrutinised closely and stiff penalties applied to those who breached listing and takeover rules. Since October, large mainland Chinese state enterprises have acquired control of eight Hong Kong companies. In two of the cases, arms of the People's Liberation Army have been involved in the transactions. A 'back-door listing' is a convenient way of avoiding the HKSE's requirements for new listings. For mainland companies it is also a way of avoiding Beijing's approval system for foreign listings. Typically, a mainland company acquires a small, third-line, stock in Hong Kong and proceeds to sell it mainland assets financed by placements and rights issues. This practice has raised concerns in Beijing with the China Securities Regulation Commission, China's fledgling corporate watchdog, which has responsibility for the development of securities markets on the mainland China. The SFC said it would take 'the strongest action open to it' under the colony's takeover code if it found that a controlling shareholder selling to another party had received a benefit unavailable to minority shareholders. This action would include forcing the buyer to make available to all shareholders the same level of compensation, and withdrawing the licence of merchant banks and other financial intermediaries who advised on the deal. The stock exchange said asset injections into a newly-acquired company might result in the company being treated as a new applicant for listing, or result in its listing status being reviewed more generally. It also said it might treat transactions between a listed company and former controlling shareholders as connected transactions. In that event a vote of minority shareholders would be required for a transaction to take place. The SFC could limit the number of shares investors can apply for in new issues in a bid to curb massive over-subscriptions, Reuter adds. 'We are studying the situation . . . and that's one possibility,' a spokesman said. The commission's findings could be published next month.</p>

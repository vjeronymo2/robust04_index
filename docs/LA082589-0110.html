			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLORIDA CITRUS GROWERS POISED FOR A COMEBACK  </P> <P> Just a few years ago, when icicles hung from Florida's fruit trees and strange  spots sprouted on their leaves, there were doubts whether the state's citrus  industry would survive the decade.  </P> <P> But despite the losses of millions of trees to wintry weather and disease,  growers now are gearing up for a bumper crop that is expected to herald growth  and prosperity in the 1990s.  </P> <P> Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's largest growers' association, predicts the  state's 1989-90 orange output will exceed the 146.6-million boxes produced in  the previous growing season, which was the best in eight years.  </P></p>

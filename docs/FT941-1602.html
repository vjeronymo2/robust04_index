			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo sells Ninian interests on which company was based Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company, yesterday did the corporate equivalent of selling off the family silver. In a deal which saw the company sell its interests in the Ninian field to Sun Oil and Ranger Oil for Pounds 84m in cash and Sun's 20 per cent interest in the new Birch field, the management released the asset on which the company's fortunes were founded. The Ninian sale also marked the end of the disposal programme which followed its Dollars 1bn acquisition in 1992 of Ultramar, the event which analysts cite as being the start of the company's present troubles. Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, yesterday said he was prepared for a negative reaction from some board members when he brought the sale before them. It was Ninian's discovery in 1974 which transformed a venture capital company, formed in the early 1970s to look for oil at the start of the North Sea's exploration phase, into a fully fledged oil company. It was the cash flow from Ninian which allowed the company to expand, mainly through acquisition. The board, however, thought the sale 'was exactly the right thing to do,' said Mr Darby. 'We got excellent value for a mature, high cost field.' The sale was the latest in a series of asset disposals the company has made recently to bolster a financial position that has been undermined by low oil prices. Late last year it sold a package of assets, including a 5 per cent stake in its main development project, the Liverpool Bay gas field, to PowerGen for Pounds 123m. However it has recently taken the Markham gas field off the market and Mr Darby said yesterday: 'The bulk of the disposal of assets are over. There may be some swaps . . . but I don't see any major asset disposals this year.' Analysts say the sale of Ninian symbolises Lasmo's strategy to shift its production away from high cost reserves. These have led to the company having a cost of sales per barrel of Pounds 8.15, compared with present sterling oil prices of about Pounds 9.30. Chevron, Ninian's operators, say there is scope for steady cost reductions in coming years and additional potential as technology enables companies to extract greater amounts of a reservoir. Lasmo is in a hurry, however, to implement its new low cost strategy, which it says should reduce its operating costs per barrel to Pounds 3.70 this year, compared with Pounds 4.10 last year and Pounds 5 in 1991.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Poll worry hits NZ markets New Zealand's National party should continue to govern even if it loses its parliamentary majority in tomorrow's by-election, Mr Jim Anderton, leader of New Zealand's left-wing Alliance party, said yesterday, Terry Hall reports from Wellington. Mr Anderton has said the opposition parties would simply insist the government acted in a consultative manner. Financial markets have begun to react negatively to opinion polls which suggest the Alliance could win the election. This is being held because of the retirement of former finance minister Ruth Richardson from the former National stronghold in the Selwyn electorate. The prospect of a loss has caused signs of panic within National, with Premier Jim Bolger warning of 'economic chaos' if the Alliance wins. Financial markets reacted to his comments, with the New Zealand dollar falling, interest rates rising and the share market dropping, a Bankers' Trust economist said.</p>

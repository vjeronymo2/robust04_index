Brewer said the Council of Ministers decided to reform Article  2 of the VAT and that merchants must request the necessary  authorization from the Finance Ministry prior to 28 February.  He added that consumers cannot be charged the VAT until  merchants obtain the authorization and duly display it in their  stores and outlets.    [Begin Brewer recording] This means that retail merchants  cannot charge consumers the VAT until they obtain the proper  authorization. Of course, any VAT collected up to this point  must be turned over to the National Treasury. The Tax Office  will fine merchants according to the current tax law if they  violate this law in any way.

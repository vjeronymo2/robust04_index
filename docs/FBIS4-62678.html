			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan 18 May 18 -- Armenian Defence Minister Serzh  Sargsyan has expressed satisfaction with the results of the  meeting of the heads of the military establishments of Russia,  Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh, which ended in Moscow  on Tuesday. Together with other members of the armenian  delegation, he returned to Yerevan late at night on 17 May.    Interviewed by ITAR-TASS at the Yerevan airport, the  minister  stressed that the meeting was on the whole normal. "Our desire  to achieve peace in the region was echoed by the Russian side,  which did everything it could as mediator to settle the Karabakh  conflict," Sargsyan stated. "God knows that the Azeri decision  to sign the offered document or not did not depend on us," he  added.    Touching on the Azeri delegation's stand at the Moscow  meeting, the Armenian defence minister expressed the view that  the Azeri side would not be able to refuse for long to sign the  document and would finally quite soon. "The current refusal is a  temporary obstacle," Sargsyan believes. "The peace-making  process in the region will without doubt continue. There is no  alternative to it," the Armenian defence minister stated.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 08, BNS -- President Guntis Ulmanis  questions the necessity for the April 15 extraordinary session  of the country's parliament which had to decide on the signature  of the Latvian-Russian troop withdrawal agreement.    Ulmanis pledged to make up his mind in few days and inform  the parliament presidium about his decision.    Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs claims that the plenary  session  would be "useless." In his opinion, Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's April 5 decree on the setup of military bases was "a  deliberate action" that excludes the option of immediate  signature of the initialed agreement.    As reported, the extraordinary plenary session was proposed  by Ulmanis and Birkavs.    Ulmanis also told BNS he was not satisfied with the  apologies  by Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh who called the incident  as "a technical mistake."    In Ulmanis' words, rush decisions should be avoided because  the situation in Latvia is highly complicated. "I need at least  24 hours to reason it all," he said.</p>

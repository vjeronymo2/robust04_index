			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Markets: Smoke signals from price war - The Bottom Line THE US cigarette price wars and concern about President Bill Clinton's plans for a 'sin tax' on smoking have put the shares of BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco and financial services group, under a cloud. BAT's shares reached 999p by the beginning of April, after the group had reported a 68 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for 1992 and then intrigued the City by offering an enhanced scrip dividend, partly to help deal with the group's problem of unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax. The share price rise came to a sudden halt on April 2, when the US tobacco group Philip Morris announced that it would slash the price of Marlboro cigarettes to protect its market share from the rise of discount brands. Concern about the impact of this move on the UK group caused an immediate slump in BAT's shares, which are now 14 per cent below their peak. Reporting the group's first-quarter results this week, Sir Patrick Sheehy, BAT's chairman, conceded: 'The price war is clearly set for a period of significant aggravation but it remains to be seen how intensive and how persistent our competitors' activity will be.' But he urged shareholders to keep a sense of perspective, pointing out that the proportion of group trading profits coming from the US domestic tobacco market was falling and was only 20 per cent last year, down from 30 per cent in 1991. BAT's shares shed 24p on Wednesday, even although the group's announced a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the three months to March 31. What concerned the City this week was the news that tobacco profits had already slipped 3 per cent in the first quarter - the period just before Philip Morris slashed prices. The group blamed a number of factors, such as lower volumes at Brown &amp; Williamson, its US cigarette subsidiary, and a sharp downturn in Germany. BAT has now acknowledged that President Clinton's federal tax on tobacco could be as high as Dollars 1 per pack - a huge hike from the present level of 24 cents per pack, especially when one considers BAT's brands currently sell for an average of Dollars 1.50. However, the group points out that the Dollars 1 level might just be an opening bid in the coming tussle with Congress. Clinton's health care proposals might now be delayed until mid-June, which would suggest any new tax could not be imposed before January, 1995 - a year later than first thought. All this concern over tobacco is understandable, but the share price reaction may be overdone. Having suffered huge losses on mortgage indemnity policies though its Eagle Star subsidiary, BAT is now able to rely on the strength of its financial services side to see it through a tricky patch for tobacco. Financial services increased trading profits by 48 per cent in the first quarter. In the general business Farmers, the US insurance subsidiary, continued to progress and the ongoing recovery at Eagle Star contributed to a profit of Pounds 93m (up from Pounds 43m). In the life business, Allied Dunbar, Eagle Star and Farmers all recorded good premium growth. BAT shares are currently on a prospective multiple of 11.6, a 19 per cent discount to the market. NatWest Securities points out that even in the unlikely event of all US domestic tobacco profits being wiped out this year, the group could still increase its dividend by 8 per cent and cover it 1.6 times. A prospective yield of 5.8 per cent puts them on a yield premium of more than 30 per cent. Some investors may consider the time has come to get out of tobacco, given the US uncertainties. However, BAT is expanding strongly overseas and sees huge growth potential in markets such as eastern Europe and Asia. One reason the group pioneered the enhanced scrip dividend was its confidence that it could better invest the cash in tobacco businesses, which enjoy a return on assets of more than 20 per cent. There is certainly a macabre complementarity to selling both cigarettes and insurance policies. For investors who do not find the tobacco trade distasteful, the shares look undervalued on fundamentals.</p>

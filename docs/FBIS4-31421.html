			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, June 8 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Defence  Minister Pavle Bulatovic said there can be no bargaining with no  one, either at home or abroad, over territorial integrity of  Serbia and Montenegro, i.e. the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.    `That country is the result of historical processes and  bloody struggles for freedom against all conquerors and  occupiers in the Balkans and no one has the right to ignore the  blood shed in defence of this area', stressed Bulatovic in an  interview to the weekly VOJSKA appearing on Thursday.    Answering the question in whose hands is the fate of peace  in  the Balkans, Bulatovic stressed that the big powers follow their  own interests and create spheres of influence in the Balkans and  beyond. `It is clear who does not want peace, and the Serbs are  certainly not among them,' neither those (Serbs) from the  war-shattered former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina nor  the ones in Yugoslavia, Bulatovic specified. He said that in  both world wars the aggressors' aim had been to exterminate the  Serbian and Montenegrin peoples, but that they had not been  successful in that, and now they are doing it in a much more  perfidious way `fighting against us by applying low-intensity  strategy', without direct involvement in war.    `This people must resolutely defend their freedom, as they  had managed to do throughout their history. It has no other  choice', said the Yugoslav defence minister.</p>

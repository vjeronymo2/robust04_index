			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 10 Jun (MTI) -- Hungarian President Arpad  Goncz on Friday continued his meetings with the leaders of the  parliamentary parties, and received the chairman of the  Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP), Jozsef Torgyan. At a  press conference following the meeting, Torgyan said he mainly  called the president's attention to the fact that the dominance  of executive power could make parliamentary democracy, which is  based on a system of brakes and counter-weights represented by  the opposition, illusory.    In this context Torgyan said the executive power had waged a  campaign against his party over the last four years, accusing  the FKGP with various charges, freezing its state support, and  making efforts to break it up through smallholders created by  the power. The FKGP chairman also said his family was exposed  to harassment.    Torgyan said he considered it necessary to relate this to  the  president because, in principle, there is a danger that an even  stronger parliamentary dictatorship will come about alongside  the ever more powerful executive power, in the wake of the  election results. The danger of a one-party like system is  further increased by the fact that, according to Torgyan, the  revival of middle-level cadres of the former state party, the  Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, can be experienced  nationwide.    Although the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], which won the  elections, and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which  came in second, are endeavouring to work out a system of  guarantees, Torgyan said neither the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF], nor the Christian Democratic People's party can be a  genuine opposition force under the current circumstances. As  regards the Federation of Young Democrats, Torgyan said the  future will decide whether the party will be a liberal, or a  popular-national force. Thus there is no other prominent  opposition force apart from the Independent Smallholders' Party.    The FKGP chairman also said his party would ensure a greater  role for the president of the Republic, in order to  counter-balance the executive power. For instance, as regards  the media, the FKGP would empower the president with the  appointment right of media leaders that would not require  counter-initialling by the prime minister.    Another element that would, according to the FKGP's intents,  intensify the president's position would be his direct election  by the people. According to the FKGP, it cannot be allowed that  the media be subordinated to the government.</p>

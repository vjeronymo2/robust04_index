			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The prime minister and first vice president,  Honorable John Malecela, continued to hold separate talks in  Arusha town today with the representatives of the Rwanda  Government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] delegations.  The prime minister held talks with the heads of the delegations  separately following the RPF's refusal to recognize the interim  government installed in Rwanda following the death of President  Juvenal Habyarimana on 6 April. [passage omitted]    Hon. Malecela has stressed that peace in Rwanda depended  entirely on both sides solving the ongoing crisis. The  Government of Tanzania is compiling a joint communique on the  talks to be signed separately by the leaders of the Government  of Rwanda and the RPF delegations. The identical documents will  be signed on behalf of the Tanzanian Government by the  representative and coordinator of the talks, Tanzanian Prime  Minister John Malecela, and the United Nations' and OAU  representatives. Reliable sources say that the communique  stresses three important points which Hon. John Malecela  mentioned yesterdayl. These points are an end to the fighting  and killing of innocent citizens, open channels for relief  supplies to reach the citizens of Rwanda, and the Arusha  agreement is to be implemented.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Exco on target with Pounds 28m but third quarter 'subdued' Exco, the moneybroking company that returned to the stock market in July, yesterday announced profits in line with prospectus forecasts, but said that trading in the third quarter of the year had remained 'subdued.' Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose by 31 per cent from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 28m, marginally higher than the Pounds 27.5m forecast. There were substantial increases in the contribution from the three moneybroking businesses of spot foreign exchange, money markets and derivatives, while the fixed income securities broking continued to grow. The company said that 'banks around the world (are) adopting a more cautious approach to trading,' and there had been little sign of recovery from the summer lull. Exco operates a global business, but the bulk of earnings growth came from Europe, where operating profit more than doubled to Pounds 9.59m (Pounds 4.35m), aided by newly-acquired CMS, in Zurich. North America remained the largest contributor, with profits of Pounds 12m, up from Pounds 10.2m. Asia Pacific showed a marginal decline to Pounds 5.32m (Pounds 5.78m), reflecting uncertainty in Japan. Turnover overall rose 22 per cent from Pounds 103m to Pounds 126m, while operating costs rose to Pounds 100m (Pounds 85.2m). Earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 11.9p (9.5p). A delayed interim dividend will be paid in mid-January, representing a part payment of the final dividend.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Degrading Iran's Successful Anti-Drug Campaign"] </F>   [Text] Since 1989 when the Majles (the Islamic Consultative  Assembly) ratified the Antinarcotics Law--according to which  tough punishments including long-term imprisonments and death  penalty for local and international drug-traffickers were  introduced--the quantity of narcotic drugs smuggled into Iran  for either domestic use or transit to Europe, has drastically  decreased.    During the past five years large quantities, including tens  of tons of opium, heroin and morphine, have been seized by the  Iranian National Security Forces from the smugglers, the bulk of  which were en route to the European markets and possibly from  Europe to other regions of the world. In their efforts to  combat the well armed international drug smugglers, a number of  Iranian law enforcement personnel were martyred.    Meanwhile every once in a while, some international human  rights organization or certain foreign countries criticize  Tehran for its anti-drug activities. For instance in October  1993, Amnesty International under the pretext of protecting  "human rights" criticized Iran for its death penalty policy for  traffickers.    The recent statement by the U.S. assistant secretary of  state  for international narcotics strategy, Mr. Robert Gelbard, who  accused Iran of not being successful in its drug campaign is  surely part of a general conspiracy to degrade the Islamic  Republic of Iran's successful efforts in combating drug  trafficking.    Unable to convince the European countries and Japan to join  Washington's economic embargo plans against Tehran, it is not a  big surprise to see a senior U.S. official making such a  baseless statement at a time when Iran is planning to further  enhance its cooperation in combating traffickers both at  regional and global levels, within the framework of the Economic  Cooperation Organization as well as international organizations  such as the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) or  Interpol.    It is crystal clear that drug smuggling is a major  international problem which knows no boundaries and without  regional and international cooperation, combating traffickers  and drug abuse will be a costly measure and a bit difficult for  individual states. Therefore it is no wonder to hear a senior  U.S. official to make such a baseless statement in order to  merely degrade Iran's anti-narcotic strives.    Indeed, it can be assessed that what Mr. Gelbard has said is  part of Washington's general foreign policy strategy to isolate  Iran by using all available means to crate a negative picture of  the Islamic Republic in the minds of the international  community. But, surely the antinarcotic planners of the country  and the brave personnel of the National Security Forces will  foil Washington's propaganda by adopting proper measures.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ['Umar al-Kazimi article: "Two Gardens, Not Two Countries;" </F> article carries the caveat: "This article expresses the opinion  of its writer, not that of the newspaper"]    [Text] In the early eighties, we were a group of young  adolescent men. At that age, every youth usually has his idol.  As party members, our idols were not the typical musicians, pop  singers, or movie stars. There were 10 of us, and we all  thought our first idol was Saddam Husayn from the way he  dressed, spoke, walked, and dealt with people, and even by his  life style. Having agreed on our first idol, we then split into  two groups. The first group of six or seven viewed [late Iraqi  Defense Minister] 'Adnan Khayrallah as its second idol from his  behavior, conduct, and gentle nature. The second group of three  or four viewed comrade Barzan Ibrahim [Saddam Husayn's brother  and Iraqi envoy to UN European headquarters] as its second idol,  because in his youthful years in the eighties Barzan was in  charge of a most sensitive state organ [Iraqi Intelligence  Service] and had a background similar to that of comrade 'Adnan,  although the latter was more experienced since he took part in  the Ramadan Revolution and its ramifications. But comrade  Barzan was also with the comrade leader during the 17-30 July  1968 Revolution. The story goes that comrade Barzan, who  carried a pistol, had tripped a soldier, who held a machinegun,  with his foot to protect his brother the leader, because he  thought the pistol would not serve the purpose. The group that  considered comrade 'Adnan Khayrallah as its second idol was also  charmed by Barzan's unusual character. On the other hand, the  group that considered comrade Barzan as its second idol also  admired comrade 'Adnan Khayrallah's personality. At any rate,  this is not the subject of our story.    When Barzan's first press article appeared, only three of  the  original group of ten remained, the others had pursued their own  courses in life. We thought the article was interesting. Then  came the second, third, and fourth articles. Again, we thought  they were fine and that there was no reason why he should not  express his opinion. But as the articles continued to appear,  we noticed that they contained a set of ideas that were  different from our way of thinking in Iraq. The articles  continued to move away from us and to get closer to the  inclinations of persons who live abroad. When we observed that  these viewpoints began to develop into courses and were followed  by more articles, which deepened these courses and developed  them into a program and a firm line, we thought it would be  proper to reply to them in view of the fact that we are a group  of young men in Iraq who lived the Mother of Battles, fought in  Kuwait and Basra, and experienced all the stages of the blockade.    Our attention was drawn to an article comrade Barzan wrote  about the relationship between Iraq and Iran. He spoke about  this relationship as though nothing had happened between Iraq  and Iran. He spoke about the sons of our people from the Shiites  in Iraq, forgetting that Iraqi Shiites are an Arab faction that  is separated by a river of blood from the Persian faction, which  claims to be Shiite, and that a big difference in concepts and  beliefs exists between the two factions, even though the the  Shu'ubists [Persians] always consider them as one. Moreover,  many of the Iraqis who fought and fell as martyrs in  al-Qadisiyah [Iraq-Iran War] were from our Shiite sons,  especially from the south. This is not a new thing, since it  has been dealt with in several articles. The theme of comrade  Barzan's article revolves around the possibility of coexistence  between Iraq and Iran.    In fact, we cannot coexist with Iran. But we should apply  the Arab proverb that says: "Beware of your friend, but do not  betray him."    But again, this is not the topic of our discussion. The  topic is an article written by Barzan al-Tikriti in  AL-JUMHURIYAH under the headline "A Viewpoint on Yemeni Events."    Let us review some of its paragraphs. The author said: "What  is taking place in Yemen is the outcome of a relationship  between two conflicting regimes that have entered into a unity  that was received with caution and skepticism by everyone  concerned, both the sincere and the not-so-sincere ones." The  author added: "The situation has reached the point of merciless  fighting between brothers in which aircraft and heavy weapons  are being used and battles are taking place as if between two  foreign armies. Airports and power installations are being  destroyed."    Actually, the current events Yemen are related to an  ideological analysis of the phases that preceded and followed  the Mother of Battles. After 2 August [1990] to be precise, the  curtain was pulled and the Arab regimes were exposed. Nobody  believed us when we said that at the time. It is only now that  we are beginning to discover that many Arab regimes, whether in  the Arab Maghreb or the Arab East, have had ties with "Israel"  for decades. This frightful relationship has been under cover  all that time, and it is only now that it is being announced  publicly. Indeed, Arab regimes were exposed after 2 August and  the Arab homeland was split into two ranks; the rank of faith  and the rank of infidelity, to borrow the words of the leader  president. The split was so clear cut that the vote that tipped  the balance in the Arab League meeting on the blockade and the  armed aggression was that of Djibouti.    The Mother of Battles took place and was followed by a new  phase. So what happened? Following the armed aggression and the  period of treachery and treason [reference to the Shiite  rebellion in the south], and due to Iraq's preoccupation with  its domestic situation and the lack of an active Iraqi diplomacy  and of professionals in foreign policy, the supporting Arab  ranks collapsed and the number of supporters decreased.    Let us see what happened. Morocco remained neutral, but also  maintained a clandestine courtship with the other side. Tunisia  maintained a position that was very different from the one it  held before the aggression on Iraq. As for Jordan's stand, it  is clearly known to the Iraqis.    Why do we say there are two conflicting regimes in Yemen? On  the contrary, when Iraq was strong and had an army that extended  from Zakho to al-Faw; and when it enjoyed a well-known political  weight and was not under siege, Yemeni unity was a model that  inspired Arab poets and unionists, and Yemeni relations were at  their peak. But the fact is, Yemen began to be subjected to  Saudi intrigues. In an article published on the front page of  an earlier issue of BABIL, comrade Abu-Sarhan [suspected to be  'Udayy Saddam Husayn] referred to Yemen's courtship with Saudi  Arabia after the armed aggression against Iraq. He said,  verbatim: "If Yemen continues to play with fire the way it is  doing now it will burn its fingers." When Yemen began  compromising its principled stands, it backfired on the Yemeni  body itself. If we look now, we will find that the current  events in Yemen were preceded by one Yemeni side clearly moving  in the direction of the sides that were hostile to Iraq, while  in the past the Yemenis maintained a unified stand.    Thus, Yemeni events are indirectly linked to what took  place in the Mother of Battles and the subsequent developments.  What happened makes us understand the importance of  strengthening the support for Iraq that is now receding.    At any rate, let us continue discussing the subject of  Yemen.  Looking at the Yemeni fighting, which comrade Barzan said is  taking place between two armies and where airports and power  installations are being destroyed, we will observe that it is  similar to the military plan the foreign enemies used against  Iraq, which also targeted power and water installations,  factories, and so forth. Therefore, the plan being carried out  in Yemen today is not just an outcome of the conflict between  Yemenis, but also a plan drawn up and studied abroad in order to  achieve the objective of dividing Yemen. The existence of a  strong Yemen south of Saudi Arabia and a strong Iraq north of it  constitutes a strategic danger to the ruling family in the  Arabian Peninsula. Iraq and Yemen cherish pan-Arab aspirations.  Yemenis have always been known for their Arab nationalist  sentiments and are true Arabs. Proof of this is that Judaism  had existed in Yemen, but it has not had any effect on Arabs  there. When Imam al-Husayn [grandson of Prophet Muhammad and  first Imam of the Shiites who was assassinated in al-Kufah,  Iraq], may peace be upon him, decided to leave for al-Kufah,  'Abdallah Ibn- 'Umar Ibn-al-Khattab, may God rest his soul in  peace, asked him: "Where are you heading, Abu-'Abdallah?" He  replied: "I am heading for al-Kufah." He told him: "Why do you  not go to Yemen, where your father's Shiites [referring to  Yemeni Zaydi sect, an off-shoot of Shiism] live and where you  will have the protection of the mountains." As politicians, we  know that mountainous areas are ideal for rebel armed movements.  When our lord al-Husayn insisted on going to al-Kufah,  'Abdallah Ibn-'Umar told him: "Come, let me bid you farewell."    As we said, what is taking place in Yemen was planned and  studied abroad ever since the declaration of Yemeni unity, and  it was intensified after the Mother of Battles.    Let us continue with comrade Barzan's article. He said:  "What led to the general war was the view held by some people  that say: Either we have full unity, or a general destructive  war will be the only alternative."    It was a full unity. And, a general war is not an  alternative to unity. A general war is a means to destroy unity.    The author also said: "The world was not created in one day  so as to be united in one day. Unity between states takes time."    The creation of the world was a heavenly will. When God  Almighty created the world in seven days, He wanted to teach  patience to mankind. Regarding Arab unity, we have to be clear  on this score. The author, who is posted in the West, will  understand us when we say: One of the great historical unity  experiments was the unification of Germany under Bismarck.  Germany was then unified by force of arms. A second great  experiment was the American federation between the southern and  northern states, which was also achieved by force of arms, and  by a method similar to the one taking place now in Yemen.    Let us consider the Arab reality. What do we see? We see  an egotistical Arab individual who loves shaykhdoms and being a  shaykh. At a time when suzerainties have vanished from the  world, shaykhdoms are still deeply-rooted in the Arab homeland.  No Arab unity has been achieved without the use of armed force.  Armed force has always been the means to Arab unity. As for  the rulers, they have always tried to entrench regionalism. We  thank God that Yemenis understand the meaning of this war. They  rejected mediation, because if they had accepted them Yemen  would have been divided, as is now happening in Yugoslavia. But  the war has now become a war to unify the country by armed  force; in other words, a full liberation war. This situation is  similar to what they wanted to happen in Iraq during the period  of treachery and treason. They wanted to strengthen the  secessionist trend and then declare the division of Iraq into  three states according to the well-known scenario.    Barzan said: "What is happening in Yemen is a repetition of  past Arab unity attempts; the usual relationship which begins  with hugs and kisses and ends up in disputes and war."    Previous attempts at Arab unity have not been a unity of one  Arab people in two countries, but a unity sought for political  purposes and ideological ends. Every Arab ruler sought to take  whatever he could from the other in order to increase his assets  and improve his image before his people. Therefore, there was  no real Arab unity. The real unity is the one known to the  Iraqis and is unity in the real sense of the word.    Barzan continued in his article, saying: "The dream of unity  has developed into fear, terror, and panic. In fact, it has  become a nightmare, and not just in Yemen."    No. Never. All Arab strugglers and all Arabs know full well  that their real dream is the unification of the nation. They  understand that their aspirations will not be achieved, their  identity will not be asserted, and their prestige will not be  maintained except through unity. Therefore, the enemies of the  Arabs represented by Zionism and the Americans always try to  make the Arabs understand that poverty, hunger, injustice,  panic, and fear result from unity. At the same time, and as is  now happening with the Iraqis, these enemies are trying, through  their punishment of Iraq, to create a reaction against unity and  to scare the Arabs away from future unity. But unity is a firm  conviction. A person cannot live with one lung, or live a full  and real life with half a body or a disability. Unity is the  basic aim of all strugglers and honorable men. Despite all the  enmity, we still hear hostile forces represented by the United  States and Britain saying: "The opposition has failed to  establish roots inside Iraq." We thank God that the opponents  of the Iraqi regime are no more than a bunch of agents whose  morality and affiliation to true Arab Iraq are suspect. They  were known to the Iraqi people even before they became known to  the persons who rule Iraq by their history, conduct, and  behavior.    I repeat and say that unity is the resort and hope of the  nation. it is also the paradise and hope of the faithful on  earth. Therefore, we totally disagree with the author of the  article when he said: "There should either be a unity that  respects everyone and guarantees their common rights, or a  return to the separatist states that existed before."    In another part of the article, the author set an example by  saying: "There are 20 other separate Arab states, but they have  managed to coexist with one another without bickering and  fighting." This is what we hope, but how can it be without  fighting?!    The situation reached the point where half of the regimes of  the nation turned their armies against one people [Iraq] of this  nation. They provided them with funds and arms. The present  state of the nation does not augur well. In fact, the nation  has never been in such a miserable state in its entire history.  The Arab rulers have not been so daring as to enlist the help  of the enemy or to deal with Zionism so publicly. We thank God  that it has finally surfaced, because we will see more such  developments, God willing, in 1995 when the situation will  become very clear to everyone.    The author of the article cites another example by saying:  "The other example, although somewhat different, was Syria.  [Former Egyptian President] 'Abd-al-Nasir decided not to  reinforce the Egyptian forces in Syria, especially in Latakia,  in order to strike at the secessionist movement there.  'Abd-al-Nasir believed that saving unity by bloodshed and  opening fire on Syrian secessionists would bar all doors to  rapprochement and unity between the two peoples and countries in  the future."    God bless 'Abd-al-Nasir who was one of the symbols of the  Arab revolutionary movement, but not the first or only symbol of  this movement. He was also not a model for nationalists and  pan-Arabists on the Arab national level.    'Abd-al-Nasir took steps during certain historical phases  that are questionable to this day. One such step was his  approval of the presence of the Egyptian forces alongside the  British forces when 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim demanded the restoration  of Kuwait. The other was his decision to open the Suez Canal to  foreign forces proceeding to Kuwait. These steps continue to be  questioned and queried by all nationalists in Iraq. What  Barzan's article said about Latakia is another point against  'Abd-al-Nasir, because the position taken by 'Abd-al-Nasir then  led to the presence of Hafiz al-Asad today. Hafiz al-Asad is  from the Latakia area. 'Abd-al-Nasir contributed to the  emergence of the al-Nusayriyah Movement in Latakia when he  failed to deal his blow then. This movement developed and  formed the basis for the party's setback in Syria and the  assumption of power by Hafiz al-Asad, who has adopted hostile  trends toward pan- Arabism and Iraq. Syria is known for this up  to this moment.    The brothers in Yemen have done well. There is no  alternative. And, as the poet says: Honor can only be redeemed  by bloodshed.    Therefore, Yemen -- land and people -- will not be redeemed  except by sacrifices.    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.    "There was for Saba, aforetime, a Sign in their homeland --  two gardens to the right and to the left. Eat of the sustenance  provided by your Lord, and be grateful to Him; a territory fair  and happy. And, a Lord oft-forgiving." [Koranic verse]</p>

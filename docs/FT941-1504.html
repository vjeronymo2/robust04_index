			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Cambodian troops find the going tough: Iain Simpson on problems encountered after the fall of the Khmer Rouge main base Cambodian government troops occupying the former Khmer Rouge headquarters at Pailin may have defeated one enemy but they still have to deal with several others. Unseasonal rain is wreaking havoc on a new dirt road built to supply them with food and ammunition, while malaria is affecting both health and morale. After two weeks of heavy fighting, government commanders say they are in control of the former Khmer Rouge base at Pailin, although guerrillas still occupy commanding positions nearby. In the end, the victory at Pailin came rapidly and there is talk in the Cambodian capital that this could mark the end of the Khmer Rouge as a viable force. It is a big political blow to the faction, but the loss of a main base will not stop small units from continuing their campaign of violence in the countryside. The loss of Pailin is also a serious financial blow to the Khmer Rouge. Gem mines and timber in the area are believed to have earned millions of dollars a year. Senior military officers say at least 10,000 government troops supported by heavy artillery and helicopter gunships were involved in the assault on Pailin. Approaching from three directions they squeezed the few remaining defenders towards the border with Thailand. When they finally reached Pailin only 200 guerrillas were waiting for them, but soon afterwards volleys of shells from the nearby hills began landing at the former base. Now the officers say government soldiers are pushing into the hills to clear out remaining Khmer Rouge pockets. Pailin is surrounded by hills and as long as the Khmer Rouge retain positions on the higher ground, the government's hold on the base will not be secure. Already one government helicopter has come under sustained fire from Khmer Rouge positions. The main obstacle now facing the government side is the logistics. 'Their ability to supply and communicate with their troops is being severely stretched,' one diplomat said. Approaching Pailin from the east, troops armed with chainsaws, bulldozers and heavy military trucks literally cut a new road through the jungle. The road twists and turns around trees and thick clumps of bamboo, trapping trucks towing heavy artillery. Heavy rains are turning the road into a quagmire. At least 20km from the base the road is blocked and the rest of the way is only passable to military tanks. On Wednesday one tank carrying soldiers and three freelance photographers to the front hit an anti-tank mine. Two soldiers were killed. The state of the roads strikes terror into the hundreds of soldiers being trucked to Pailin, who know that this is their only escape. Monsoon rains will start in this part of Cambodia in about two months' time, churning up the roads even more, making it almost impossible for trucks to get through to Pailin. If the soldiers cannot be supplied, the base will almost certainly be lost again. Despite their apparent victory, morale is low among government troops. They are short of food and medicine and water supplies are running low. In one unit most soldiers had not been given their official salary of Dollars 20 a month for six months before the attack on Pailin. In February, the government suffered an embarrassing reversal at the northern Khmer Rouge base of Anlog Veng when its troops were driven out less than three weeks after they captured it. Khmer Rouge units attacked behind the government front lines and bombarded government positions, causing heavy casualties. Senior officers at Pailin say they have learned important lessons from the loss of Anlog Veng. They have advanced more slowly and strengthened their flanks to prevent a Khmer Rouge attack in the rear. Already though, Khmer Rouge units are starting to take revenge on villages nearby. Since they lost Pailin, guerrillas have attacked villages in at least five locations in Battambang province. Eight people have been killed and many injured in the attack. In Bavel, which has had a lengthy respite after years of being on the front line, a government ammunition dump was destroyed when a Khmer Rouge rocket scored a direct hit. Further along the road a huge crater marked the spot where a score of anti-tank mines had exploded. At least 5,000 people have fled from villages near Pailin in the past few weeks as government troops advanced. They say officials warned them to leave their homes and now complain that the food aid they were promised has not arrived. Many are former refugees who resettled here after spending up to 15 years in camps in Thailand. They say all they want now is a peaceful life, but at the moment they see little hope of that.</p>

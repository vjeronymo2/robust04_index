			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- A total of 1,361  AIDS-virus carriers have been discovered in 22 Chinese mainland  provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, and 22 of the  country's 40 full-blown AIDS patients have died, an official  from the Ministry of Public Health said here today.    Some 1,106 cases of the total involved mainland residents  and  the other 255 were foreigners and foreign citizens of Chinese  origin, said the official at a seminar here today on China's  AIDS prevention.    Despite the fact that China is one of the regions in the  world with a relatively low rate of AIDS-virus infection, the  Chinese Government has paid close attention to the issue, Chen  Minzhang, minister of public health, told the seminar.    He said that China has intensified its efforts to prevent  and  curb AIDS, citing that in recent years the country has done a  great deal in monitoring, educating on and researching into the  disease.    Meanwhile, the Chinese Government has fruitfully cooperated  in this area with the United Nations Development Program and the  World Health Organization, Chen said.    China will keep to the principle of "prevention first" in  its  endeavors to curb AIDS and will actively advocate coordination  and cooperation among relevant departments, the minister noted.  It will also encourage the participation of the whole nation in  the struggle against AIDS.    He said China will launch a publicity campaign on preventing  and curbing AIDS so as to make people more knowledgeable about  AIDS, which in turn is expected to help them avoid unhealthy  behavior and boost their capacity of self-protection.    Official sources said that China is to draft medium and  long-term plans on the prevention of AIDS as well as to step up  the legislation of necessary laws so as to standardize the work  and ensure the full implementation of measures designed to curb  AIDS.</p>

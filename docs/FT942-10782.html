			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Old ways hamper new prosperity: Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic are being held back by a shortage of capital Mr Jiri Pospisil, a director at the Czech National Bank, seems a hard man to please. He says he is puzzled by industry's 'slow' response to growing domestic demand. Although exports from the Czech Republic rose 23 per cent last year, he is disturbed about a 10 per cent rise in imports. 'Perhaps the bank should talk to the companies to get a clearer picture,' he suggests. He might start with Mr Armando Tatar, feisty founder of a small, two-year-old contact lens maker in Brno, the republic's second city and oldest industrial centre. He competes with 'western quality at Czech prices' against three state-owned operations. 'If I had the money,' he says of his moribund but dominant competitors, 'I would buy them.' But local banks want loan security of between 100 and 200 per cent and even then demand interest of up to 18 per cent, he says. Foreign banks are little use. 'They are only interested in foreign investors, not in us. They always say 'we can't assess the Czech risk'.' Risk is one thing, but as Mr Pospisil acknowledges, the lack of a fully convertible currency - something only the central bank and government can correct - is a big obstacle to the establishment of an efficient primary market and to the flow of foreign funds to finance economic revival. Mr Zdenek Svehla, boss of Prague's Zatka soft drinks company, privatised in mid-1992 with a Kcs55m (Pounds 1.25m at current rates) loan at a relatively generous 14 per cent, agrees that raising capital is the entrepreneur's worst problem. But Czech customers' tendency to ignore invoices is a close second. 'If we could collect 50 per cent of our receivables we would have no worries,' he says. Zatka's only present recourse is to stop deliveries. Prague lawyer Mr Bohuslav Klein says a company seeking redress has to wait five years for a hearing in the overloaded courts. Hence some adopt more unconventional approaches, he says: 'Pay by Tuesday or burn on Wednesday,' for example. While shortages of capital and the inadequacies of the legal system are serious obstacles to development, they are not insuperable. Mr Tatar, for example, was helped by acquaintances in the German optometrics business, who gave him machinery on a pay-when-you-can basis. Mr Lubomir Smejkal, chairman of OMB, a busy textiles plant in Brno, has a more formal agreement with customers in Germany and Austria. Days before his old, state-owned employer closed on December 31 1991, he and his colleagues took with them their know-how, customer address books and the machinery to keep on producing their range of work wear and camping equipment. Production restarted on January 2 1992. Valuing this source of western quality goods at Czech prices, OMB customers funded the purchase of sewing and other machinery on a pay-as-you-go basis. 'At the end of this year it's all ours,' says Mr Smejkal. OMB also has access to foreign bank credits secured against customers' guarantees of payment and, since all output goes to Austria and Germany, there is no trouble with late or non-payment. In an economy where old ways persist - turnover is still equated with production by some - OMB seems a model of capitalist correctness. Mr Smejkal made Kcs1.5m pretax profit on sales of Kcs20m in 1992. Last year, when turnover soared to Kcs46.2m, profits were reduced to Kcs500,000 as earnings were ploughed into new machinery. In the first quarter of the current year OMB made Kcs2.3m pretax profit on sales of Kcs11.5m, and Mr Smejkal is now confident enough to consider braving non-payers in the domestic market: 'We might be ready to try selling here by the end of this year.' But OMB has yet to win complete control over its destiny. Its offices, workshops and stores are in a corner of a giant state-owned weaving mill. Rent is a mere Kcs750,000 a year, but OMB's tenure could be put at risk by the outcome of negotiations for privatisation of the mill. Bayerische Vereinsbank, provider of DM200,000 in credit lines, has promised to help find a way out if OMB must set up in more expensive quarters. When pressed, Mr Smejkal says he may surrender a stake in OMB to 'our German friends' as a last resort. But 'management interference' is unacceptable, he insists. His attitude reflects rising self-confidence among new entrepreneurs, whose private businesses now account for a guesstimated 50 per cent of gross national product. They are driving growth, forecast at a real 3.5 per cent this year after four years of decline. Mr Smejkal's resistance to outside 'interference' reflects resentment against the waves of wheeler-dealers - known locally as 'Johnnie Walkers' - who swept through in the early days of economic reform. Mr Smejkal's rejection of outside management also reflects a feeling that the neighbours' influence is already deemed strong enough. Mr Stephen Bligh, a partner in KPMG's Prague office, says in terms of numbers of investors Germany will 'inevitably' be the biggest foreign business presence in the republic. Apart from heavy-hitters such as Volkswagen, which has a 30 per cent controlling stake (plus further options) in the Skoda car business, hundreds of smaller companies have 'infiltrated' the country. Although real economic growth is expected to start this year, the republic's 'industrial Wirtschaftswunder' has yet to materialise, he says. The second stage of privatisation is due shortly and should be complete in two years, he reckons. Restructuring will last another five. There are signs this phase will be painful. It is a measure of the success of the private sector so far that it has absorbed almost all workers displaced by privatisation. National unemployment is less than 4 per cent and nil in industrial centres. But there is an awareness of a big overhang of hidden unemployment in the utilities, chemicals, agriculture and other state industries which remain to be sold off. Local experts say the best workers and managers from these businesses have already left for new jobs, and there are few opportunities for the unskilled residue. Meanwhile, shortages of skilled labour and management are apparent. The ABB-PBS boiler works in Brno, taken over last year by the Swedish-Swiss group, Asea Brown Boveri, pays wages 10 per cent above local engineering rates to attract talent. Lawyer Mr Klein says Prague-based managers can already earn as much as their German counterparts and a secretary can earn two-thirds more than the national average wage. Although overall labour costs are still low, the new Czech capitalists can see this gives them only a transient competitive edge internationally and none domestically. Increased productivity and quality are now the goal. At ABB-PBS, chief executive Mr Richard Kuba plans in three years to thin the workforce of 4,000 to 3,200 while expanding volume output three-fold and matching the parent's quality standards. At the other end of the scale, the strategy at Mr Tatar's eight-man lens factory bears some hallmarks of that at ABB. High quality means he must pay high prices for imported German raw materials, and high wages for skilled labour, he says. 'If I am to sell at the same prices as the state factories I need much higher productivity.' The quality/price relationship is also crucial to Zatka's approach in the soda pop trade. 'We base our future on the quality of our products,' says Mr Svehla. That depends on fruit concentrates shipped from Israel and Greece. Although he competes against 130 indigenous companies and foreign invaders which together can quench the national thirst twice over, Mr Svehla has few qualms. He can beat the locals on quality, he says. As for newcomers Coke, Pepsi and Schweppes, he accepts 'we will never beat them on image or volume', but Zatka products are 50 per cent cheaper. Without access to the imports which seem so to irritate the central bank, Mr Svehla and Mr Tatar would have been hard-pressed to compete and stay in business. They may tell Mr Pospisil, should he call, that access to imported capital on reasonable terms may also give home-grown entrepreneurs the opportunity to build on their modest beginnings.</p>

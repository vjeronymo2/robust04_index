			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investment Offshore Centres (9): Cyprus woos more Gulf investors MORE than 600 offshore companies and firms have offices in Cyprus, by no means all of them in the financial services sector. Those that arrive there find a banking system modelled on that of the UK and well-experienced in handling trade finance and investment. Exchange controls are light for foreign companies, though Cyprus residents are not allowed to hold foreign currency. Non-residents can hold Cyprus pounds and foreign currency accounts with authorised banks. There are no controls over the transfer of funds to these accounts. Equity capital for foreign investors must come from abroad and the terms of foreign loans have to be approved by the Central Bank. Capital invested and gains from the disposal of shares can be freely remitted abroad. There is no ceiling on profit remittances or minimum period for disposing of investments. Moves to encourage offshore financial investments for the eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf have been under way for some years. To date,15 offshore banking units have been established, entitled to tax, customers' and other benefits. One advantage enjoyed by Cyprus is the time zone with a 'window' which fits neatly between the closing time of financial centres in east Asia and the opening time of those in the western hemisphere.</p>

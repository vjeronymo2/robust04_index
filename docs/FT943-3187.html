			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Coal sale must stress viability Sir, You are right to argue that the taxpayer should receive the highest possible return on the sale of British Coal, but wrong to claim that this is measured solely by the highest bid ('Privatising British Coal', September 12). The highest return to the taxpayer would be for the problems of the long-suffering coal industry to be taken from government's door and never to return. The chance of this happening will be maximised by selecting whichever bid demonstrates the greatest financial and operational viability and a fair price for future cash flows. For example, a very highly geared bid which crashed a few years down the road, perhaps at election time, would have all the bleeding hearts back at the Department of Trade and Industry's and the Treasury's doors. Ministers would be nostalgic for the relative tranquillity of October 1992. For the coal industry to move irreversibly into the private sector, the winning bid must also demonstrate a leadership which has the support of the workforce as well as the marketing and technical skills to maintain sales of a commodity, currently in chronic over-supply, while continuing to produce at an internationally competitive cost. The government should therefore be seeking a proposal which not only proffers a fair price but, even more importantly, has the least chance of returning the industry to its own doorstep. George R J Guise, (prime minister's policy unit, 1986-90), 90 Long Acre, London WC2E 9RA</p>

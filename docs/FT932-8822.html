			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / DTB suspends three traders THE second revelation of trading manipulation on a European futures exchange in less than a month has shaken futures traders and their clients. The Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the German futures and options exchange, announced late on Friday that it had uncovered trading 'irregularities' which could lead to criminal charges. Three weeks ago, BZW Futures, the futures broking arm of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, suspended four of its floor traders pending disciplinary hearings by the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe). The DTB has suspended three traders. It is believed that at least one member firm and one firm outside the exchange are involved in the irregularities. A DTB spokesman declined to reveal the nature of the irregularities, or the contracts involved, saying that he 'wants to keep the black sheep insecure' while the investigation, which began two months ago, is pursued. The DTB went public on the investigation after one of the suspended traders admitted his involvement, according to sources close to the affair. While the alleged rule violations on Liffe involved profits on improper trades of only around Pounds 5,000 and would not form the basis of any criminal charges, the DTB spokesman suggested that the irregularities detected on the DTB could be on a large scale. 'The black sheep have tried to cover the manipulation in a professional way,' he said. He added that, to the exchange's knowledge, there had been no damage to clients. Although dubious practices in the futures markets have become less common, such cases do not help improve the image of the futures business, which is still seeking to recover from a case of illegal trading in the US which culminated in a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1989. Indictments were brought against 48 traders, alleged to have illegally benefited from trades done on their personal accounts. As a result, 46 have been convicted at trial or through plea agreements. DTB rules have legal force and the exchange can pursue the traders involved through the prosecutor's office.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (viii) Particular products and operations. No asbestos cement, mortar, coating, grout, plaster, or similar material containing asbestos, shall be removed from bags, cartons, or other containers in which they are shipped, without being either wetted, or enclosed, or ventilated so as to prevent effectively the release of airborne fibers of.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ix) Compressed air. Compressed air shall not be used to remove asbestos or materials containing asbestos unless the compressed air is used in conjunction with a ventilation system which effectively captures the dust cloud created by the compressed air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (x) Flooring. Sanding of asbestos-containing flooring material is prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Compliance program. (i) Where the TWA and/or excursion limit is exceeded, the employer shall establish and implement a written program to reduce employee exposure to or below the TWA and to or below the excursion limit by means of engineering and work practice controls as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and by the use of respiratory protection where required or permitted under this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Such programs shall be reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect significant changes in the status of the employer's compliance program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Written programs shall be submitted upon request for examination and copying to the Assistant Secretary, the Director, affected employees and designated employee representatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The employer shall not use employee rotation as a means of compliance with the TWA and/or excursion limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Specific compliance methods for brake and clutch repair:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Engineering controls and work practices for brake and clutch repair and service. During automotive brake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair and assembly operations, the employer shall institute engineering controls and work practices to reduce employee exposure to materials containing asbestos using a negative pressure enclosure/HEPA vacuum system method or low pressure/wet cleaning method, which meets the detailed requirements set out in Appendix F to this section. The employer may also comply using an equivalent method which follows written procedures which the employer demonstrates can achieve results equivalent to Method A in Appendix F to this section. For facilities in which no more than 5 pair of brakes or 5 clutches are inspected, disassembled, repaired, or assembled per week, the method set forth in paragraph [D] of Appendix F of this section may be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The employer may also comply by using an equivalent method which follows written procedures, which the employer demonstrates can achieve equivalent exposure reductions as do the two ``preferred methods.'' Such demonstration must include monitoring data conducted under workplace conditions closely resembling the process, type of asbestos containing materials, control method, work practices and environmental conditions which the equivalent method will be used, or objective data, which document that under all reasonably foreseeable conditions of brake and clutch repair applications, the method results in exposures which are equivalent to the methods set out in Appendix F to this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Respiratory protection_(1) General. The employer shall provide respirators, and ensure that they are used, where required by this section. Respirators shall be used in the following circumstances:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) During the interval necessary to install or implement feasible engineering and work practice controls;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) In work operations, such as maintenance and repair activities, or other activities for which engineering and work practice controls are not feasible;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) In work situations where feasible engineering and work practice controls are not yet sufficient to reduce exposure to or below the TWA and/or excursion limit; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) In emergencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Respirator selection. (i) Where respirators are required under this section, the employer shall select and provide, at no cost to the employee, the appropriate respirator as specified in Table 1. The employer shall select respirators from among those jointly approved as being acceptable for protection by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) under the provisions of 30 CFR Part 11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The employer shall provide a powered, air-purifying respirator in lieu of any negative pressure respirator specified in Table 1 whenever:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) An employee chooses to use this type of respirator; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) This respirator will provide adequate protection to the employee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 23 (CTK) -- Premier Vaclav Klaus said  today he expected German representatives to hear the Czech  Government's stand on Sudeten Germans "more clearly and  distinctly" after the autumn parliamentary elections. Speaking  to CTK after his return from an unofficial visit to the USA, he  was reacting to the weekend congress of the Sudeten German  Landsmannschaft.    Klaus said that well-known demands were pronounced at the  congress, which require no "new activities or counter-offensive"  from the Czech Republic. "I believe that after the German  elections there will be scope for us to tell our neighbours some  things more clearly and distinctly. Not (more distinctly) than  we are saying them now, but than they are heard there (in  Germany)," Klaus said.    At the congress in Nuremberg, the Sudeten Germans again  called for the abolition of the decrees issued by Czechoslovak  President Edvard Benes after the war and approved by the Potsdam  conference of the victorious powers. Under the decrees some 2.5  Sudeten Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia and their  property was expropriated.    Klaus said that unlike Daniel Kroupa, deputy chairman of the  coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), he did not think that  it was up to the Czech Government coalition to take "a  coalition" stand.    Kroupa said at the weekend that he was missing a joint  coalition stand on the Sudeten German issue and recalled the  ODA's unsuccessful initiative last year to set up a commission  to clearly state the coalition's stand.    "I don't think that anything of this sort is our task. It is  not at all a coalition question. We have a Foreign Ministry  which is functioning normally and which formulates our stand,"  Klaus said.</p>

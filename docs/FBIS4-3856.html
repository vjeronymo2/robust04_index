			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russia today made  several new concrete proposals on the conflict in Bosnia,  including the strengthening of the UN presence in the region.    The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement proposing  the  stabilization of order in the UN-declared "safe areas" in  Bosnia, the INTERFAX news agency reported.    The statement, issued on the eve of a meeting between  Russian  and U.S. foreign ministers, suggests that Bosnian Serbs and  Muslims sign an agreement on a complete cease-fire and the  ending of hostilities.    A package plan for the political resolution of the Bosnian  crisis should be sought, the Foreign Ministry announced.    While realistically facilitating the peace process, the  international community should lessen its sanctions against  Yugoslavia, the ministry said.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev are due to meet on Tuesday in  Geneva to discuss the Bosnian crisis.</p>

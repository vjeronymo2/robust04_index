			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / UK Company News: Forte to manage Balmoral Hotel Forte is to take over the management of Edinburgh's recently-refurbished Balmoral Hotel from Mr Peter Tyrie's debt-ridden Balmoral International company. Mr Tyrie, who spent Pounds 35m acquiring and refurbishing the hotel, said the Gulf war and the recession had made it impossible for Balmoral to reduce its debts of Pounds 30m. The property, formerly the North British Hotel, has been sold to an unnamed private company, whose owners include some of Balmoral's creditors and one of its shareholders. The company has granted Forte a management contract, with an option to purchase the hotel after five years. Mr Tyrie would not disclose the terms, but said the transaction had wiped out Balmoral's debt. Balmoral International still owns the Old Swan Hotel in Harrogate. Balmoral bought the North British and Old Swan from Queens Moat Houses in 1990. Queens Moat had acquired the properties when it won control of Norfolk Capital, a rival hotel group, two years ago.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Swan Hunter set for subsidy Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, looks set to become eligible for Intervention Funding subsidy, improving its prospects of finding a buyer, Chris Tighe writes. A meeting in Brussels yesterday of European Union heads of cabinet - senior civil servants - agreed to recommend to next Tuesday's meeting of the EU's 17 commissioners that the Tyneside yard should become eligible for the 9 per cent merchant order subsidy, which would be paid by the UK government. It is thought to be unlikely that the commissioners would overturn a recommendation by their senior aides. The news was welcomed by Mr Ed James of receivers Price Waterhouse. 'It's not a guarantee of a buyer but it clearly enhances the prospect for the yard to win new work,' he said.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Zeneca Zeneca is progressing through its first year of independence with remarkably little fuss. Its shares have performed more or less in line with the equity market since demerger from ICI and have modestly outpaced its peers. On the evidence of yesterday's full year figures, Zeneca's handful of newer drugs is growing fast enough to offset the decline in Tenormin, the heart treatment which lost patent protection two years ago. While sales in pharmaceuticals slowed markedly in the second half as US wholesalers held back, volume growth for the full year is solid enough. Still, the 21 per cent increase in trading profit was achieved only with the help of favourable exchange rate movements. Without that the rate of progress looks far more sedate. Since currencies could easily work against Zeneca from here on, the challenge must be to raise margins in agrochemicals and specialty chemicals until the pharmaceuticals research pipeline delivers on its promise. With over Pounds 2bn turnover outside the drugs industry, there is plenty to work on. But while the full benefits of cost-cutting have still to be felt, much turns on the speed of economic recovery in Europe and the US and on how long it will be before reform of the Common Agricultural Policy stops depressing demand for agrochemicals. Since Zeneca has neither the vast cash resources of Glaxo nor the generous dividend cover of Wellcome, it has less scope for keeping shareholders sweet with the payout should earnings disappoint.</p>

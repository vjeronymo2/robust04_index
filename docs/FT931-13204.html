			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / US groups burn their fingers in financial services: Martin Dickson and Nikki Tait analyse a series of disposals stemming from heavy losses A quiet but significant shake-up is taking place in some of the less glamorous reaches of the US financial services industry as some of America's top industrial companies withdraw from the area, often with fingers burnt. The latest example is Xerox, the document processing group, which this week announced plans to shed its remaining insurance and financial services businesses, with a fourth-quarter after-tax charge of Dollars 778m (Pounds 500m) to pay for it. Businesses on the block include Furman Selz, a New York brokerage house, Crum and Forster, a property-casualty operation; and Xerox Life, a life insurance and annuity business. Xerox is not alone. Weyerhaeuser, the forest products group, is selling its wholesale annuity and mutual funds business to GE Capital, the financial services arm of the General Electric group. Kodak has announced plans to sell its equipment leasing business - also to GE Capital - while Westinghouse Electric says it will quit financial services. The biggest sale of all involves Sears Roebuck, the retailer, which is spinning off much of its financial services arm, including a minority stake in Allstate, one of the largest property-casualty operations in the US. Several factors lie behind the disposals. The most dramatic is poor management. Amid the booming financial services markets of the 1980s, numerous industrial companies expanded into the area, often as a by-product of their core business. But some got out of their depth and were ill-prepared for the downturn in the business cycle in the late 1980s. Westinghouse, for example, ended up investing in the most speculative type of cheap hotel property. Such companies are now having to withdraw from financial services to stop the sector casting a permanent pall over the entire group. Others are cutting back. Kodak and Weyerhaeuser are both in the throes of restructurings. Sears has faced shareholder agitation over the poor performance of its merchandise operations. Chrysler, the car group, which sold its consumer finance subsidiary last November, has a very stretched balance sheet. So too does McDonnell Douglas, the aerospace group which has been trimming down its finance operations. But ITT, the conglomerate which this week announced a pre-tax charge of nearly Dollars 1bn to restructure its finance arm, including heavy expected losses in unsecured consumer loans, is in a different position. Since finance and insurance now provide more than 50 per cent of its earnings, it has no plan to withdraw from these areas but instead wants to refocus on more profitable areas of growth. The buyers of the cast-offs are an equally mixed bunch. They include banks, finance houses and leveraged buy-outs involving managements of the businesses concerned. One of the most active is GE Capital. Like many of the operations being sold, it originated as an adjunct to GE's industrial businesses but took off in the 1980s with rapid growth in its own right. Unlike some rivals, its profits growth has remained strong enabling it now to cherry-pick assets from distressed sellers. The US insurance industry also accounts for part of the turnover in financial services operations. Its travails fall into two categories. For life companies, difficulties have arisen principally on the investment side. At end-September, the life industry overall held about 18.4 per cent of assets - some Dollars 300bn - in property or mortgage loans. It needs to bolster reserves against falling property values and/or delinquent loans. By contrast, the property-casualty industry has faced an appalling year for catastrophic events. The New York-based Insurance Services Office, including a probably outdated figure of Dollars 10.7bn for Hurricane Andrew, calculates total catastrophe losses in 1992 reached Dollars 18.2bn. These problems follow some well-publicised insurance company failures - like that of Executive Life in Los Angeles. The bottom line is that many insurance operations are being pressed to strengthen their balance sheets - making them less attractive as peripheral holdings to non-insurance parent companies, and prompting the sale of non-core businesses, often in the financial services sector, by insurers themselves. On the latter score, Travelers, the Hartford-based composite is probably the most striking example. It has sold Dillon Read, its investment banking subsidiary, Keystone, a mutual fund business, and Travelers Mortgage Services, a home loans operation, to raise capital. The situation at Aetna has been broadly similar - with 43 per cent of La Estrella, the Spanish insurer, sold to Banco Hispano Americano for Dollars 100m, and the Dollars 1.21bn sale of its American Reinsurance subsidiary to Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the buy-out specialists, for Dollars 1.4bn. In the other direction, the Hurricane Andrew losses faced by Allstate - more than Dollars 1bn - almost certainly compounded the pressures for capital within Sears, Roebuck. This obliged the company to choose between funding the required overhaul of its retail business and expanding the financial services division. Transamerica, the San Francisco-based financial services group, also cited conflicting demands on capital as the reason behind its decision to dispose of its property-casualty operations. 'We face demands for increased capital to support growth in many of our businesses,' said Mr Frank Herringer, chief executive. In view of this 'we have elected to focus our resources on our life insurance and finance businesses'.</p>

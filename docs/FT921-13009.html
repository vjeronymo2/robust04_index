			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / US pledges extra Dollars 645m to former Soviet states PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday called for a global effort to foster democracy and free markets in the former Soviet Union, and pledged Dollars 645m (Pounds 360m) in fresh US technical and humanitarian aid to the newly independent republics. Mr Bush's announcement came at the opening of an international conference in Washington called by the US in December to co-ordinate aid to the republics. It appeared to be aimed at defusing tensions with European allies which have criticised the US for dragging its feet over Soviet aid. In a further conciliatory gesture, the US agreed to a follow-up aid conference sponsored by the European Community in Lisbon before June. Unlike the Washington meeting, the former Soviet republics will be invited to attend. In his speech, Mr Bush urged foreign ministers and senior officials from 47 countries and five international financial institutions to 'pull together' to meet the historic challenge of winning the post-Cold War peace. He paid tribute to the 'courageous' economic reforms carried out by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, but he acknowledged that the challenge of dismantling communism and centrally planned economies was enormous. Ultimate success or failure rested squarely with the people of Russia, Ukraine, the Caucasus and Central Asia, he said. Mr Bush and Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, who is hosting the conference, praised the European Community, especially Germany, for shouldering much of the burden of providing food, medicine and other humanitarian aid to the former Soviet Union and the republics. However, both of them avoided responding to Russia's request for a Dollars 7bn fund to stabilise the rouble and further money for a 'safety net' against the shock of radical economic reform - both of which are regarded as being vital to the transition to a free market. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said that the main industrialised countries would soon have to confront Russia's request. It was 'not far over the horizon,' he said. The US and Britain want the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to take the lead on macroeconomic reform. Although the IMF and the bank are offering technical advice, direct financial aid will be delayed until Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic states and other reformist republics take up full membership of these institutions - some time before the end of this year. The Washington conference aims to map out 'action plans' on pooling and distributing aid to the republics. Total pledges from the leading industrialised nations and the EC amount to Dollars 20bn, though the latest US pledge is dependent on Congressional approval.

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Leading Article: A mid-Atlantic recovery In the dark days of the 1970s, Britain was said to have the only economy in the developed world that overheated when the chancellor started the ignition. This week a welter of statistics showed that the UK economy is as far removed from that diagnosis as Rover Group is from the days when firebrand conveners could bring it to a halt at the drop of a hub cap. The message in the official data was that most of the surprises are still coming on the side of a better than expected inflation outcome. Yesterday's weak bank lending figures confirmed that consumer demand is nothing like as buoyant as some had assumed. Everything continues to point to a slow and fumbling recovery along the path earlier described by the US. The engine has yet to warm up. In the English-speaking economies and in Japan, this is an economic cycle where financial factors are having a disproportionate influence. A build-up of debt in the personal and corporate sectors, followed by a high incidence of bad debts in the banking system, has dampened demand and reduced the effectiveness of monetary policy. A well-judged response from the US Federal Reserve, which until this month had made the recapitalisation of the banks a specific target of monetary policy, has ensured that the US banking system is now playing its part in a recovery that is robust enough to call for modest pressure on the monetary brake. While Britain went into the downturn at much the same time as the US, membership of the European exchange rate mechanism deferred its recovery. The subsequent devaluation and reduction in short-term interest rates from 15 per cent to 5 1/4 per cent means that the British economic cycle, like the soul of the Tory party, is awkwardly suspended between the US and continental Europe, which is lagging the rest of the developed world. The question is whether the present stance of monetary policy is sufficiently relaxed to ensure that April's fiscal tightening will not bring the economy to a grinding halt. Fiscal squeeze One striking difference between the British experience and that of the US is that American exporters had the benefit of a much more substantial devaluation. Another is that US real interest rates have been close to zero throughout the early stages of the recovery. In contrast, real rates in Britain remain high by comparison, with the underlying inflation at between 2 and 3 per cent. Moreover, the fiscal squeeze now proposed by the government is on a scale that far exceeds the modest tightening under way in the US. And since Britain is a more open economy, it is more beholden to its trading partners in Europe. Their problem has less to do with debt than overvalued exchange rates; and the resulting stagnation has proved a massive stumbling block to the kind of balanced, export-led recovery that Britain ought to have enjoyed against a background of continuing high personal sector borrowing and a return to surplus in the corporate sector. Modest loosening The Bundesbank's decision to signal a modest loosening of monetary policy on Thursday looks overdue. Coming after the earlier quarter-point reduction in British rates, it confirms that the US and Europe are now on divergent monetary paths. Yet despite the fact that British rates are converging with those in continental Europe it remains striking that British gross domestic product since the start of the decade has not only lagged behind the US but behind Germany and France as well. It remains way below trend by any comparative yardstick. That suggests that the authorities are still finding it hard to adjust to the new disinflationary circumstances and that UK rates will have to come down again. And it may be that the markets are finding it equally hard to adjust. The Fed's tightening at the start of the month continues to make both bond and equity markets nervous in Europe. To the extent that interest rate differentials have altered in favour of the US, some repatriation of US capital was always on the cards. Yet disinflationary forces in Europe remain very powerful, which makes the bond market response look slightly perverse. Equities, meantime, are enjoying the benefit of a very American-style mutual fund boom as falling rates make bank deposits less attractive. In Britain the personal sector has ceased to disinvest in equities and has also pushed unit trust sales to record levels. A less remarked phenomenon is the way Italian mutual fund inflows have soared over the past 15 months and French equity investment in SICAVs (unit trusts) has done much the same. If interest rates have further to fall in Britain and the rest of Europe, then instinct suggests that European capital markets should no more be taking their cue from the US than the underlying economies. The change in the direction of US interest rates was bound to impart a profound shock to global capital. But the markets, hitherto effervescent, will prove difficult to read until the dust has properly settled.</p>

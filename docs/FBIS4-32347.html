			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 22/6/1994 -- The vice president  of the State Duma (Parliament) of the Russian Federation,  Valentin Kovalev, told a press conference held at the Romanian  Parliament building that an improvement of the customs  regulations, blended with the growth of investment in  international trade would boost by some 15 per cent the  import-export activities between the countries affiliated to the  Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization.    Besides these steps, the Russian Federation contemplates  other means as well for the economic development in this area,  such as a Black Sea Cooperation Bank, a consolidated  infrastructure for transports, including a circular auto route  around the Black Sea, and a unitary power grid in the entire  zone.</p>

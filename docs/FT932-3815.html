			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Top US aero-engine makers join forces against Rolls-Royce THE TWO leading US aero-engine manufacturers, General Electric and Pratt and Whitney, are joining forces for the first time to challenge Rolls-Royce of the UK in the market for smaller jet engines to power regional and business jets. GE and Pratt and Whitney announced yesterday at the Paris Air Show that they had agreed to work jointly with MTU, the German aero-engine company owned by Deutsche Aerospace, and Snecma, the French state-owned aero-engine group. The four companies will develop a family of engines with a thrust range from 12,000lb to 20,000lb to compete against the joint engine company formed two years ago by Rolls-Royce and BMW, the German car group. The two US companies, which have both restructured in the past 12 months and are the main competitors of Rolls-Royce, have traditionally competed fiercely in the commercial and military engine markets. The move reflects a growing trend towards partnerships in the hard-pressed aerospace industry and follows Boeing's decision to co-operate in joint studies with the partners in the European Airbus consortium on development of a super jumbo aircraft. By teaming with the two European companies, the US manufacturers hope to reduce the lead Rolls-Royce and BMW have taken in the development of smaller jet engines. BMW-Rolls-Royce has already won orders for its new BR700 engine from Gulfstream and the Canadian Bombardier group. The engine is expected to enter service in 1996. GE had been studying the development of a smaller jet engine with Snecma, the CFM88, based on the military engine Snecma has developed for the French Rafale fighter aircraft. GE and Snecma have a long and successful history of co-operation in commercial jet engines. Pratt and Whitney, a subsidiary of United Technologies, already has a wide-ranging alliance with MTU, with which it has been studying joint development of a similar power plant, the RTF180. However, the market lead held by BMW and Rolls-Royce prompted the companies to combine forces. As well as competing to power regional jet and business aircraft, they see sales potential for engines to power a new European military transport. 'There was clearly no room for three competing engine programmes in this market - that's why the four companies decided to team up,' said Mr Georges Sangis, Snecma's head of commercial engine programmes. He said the cost of developing the new engine family would total about Dollars 700m (Pounds 455m). BMW and Rolls-Royce originally sought to attract MTU and Snecma into an all-European engine partnership. BAe's new turbo-prop, Page 3</p>

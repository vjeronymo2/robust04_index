			<p>BFN     [Statement by "responsible source at the Defense Ministry of  the Democratic Republic of Yemen" issued to the ADEN NEWS  AGENCY; place and date not given]       [Excerpt] The ruling military regime in Sanaa has  continued its blatant, adventurist defiance to the will of the  international community, and all Arab and international efforts  aimed at ending the shedding of Yemeni blood and the  comprehensive war launched by the ruling military regime in  Sanaa, over a month and half ago, in a desperate and [words  indistinct] move in our country. Since this morning, the ruling  military regime in Sanaa has continued its aggressive offensive  attempts on all fronts, and in the course of its hostile  operations this evening launched ground-to-ground missiles on  the peaceful, calm city of Aden, intensifying its random  shelling of residential areas. This evening the peaceful  inhabitants of Aden were taken by surprise by three missiles  fired toward the capital. Our air defenses intercepted them and  shot one down, while the other two fell into the sea. One of  the residential areas was hit by shellfire. A number of  long-range artillery rockets did serious damage to the homes of  innocent citizens. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on interest rate hopes THE STRONGER yen and lower short-term interest rates spurred hopes of an imminent easing in monetary policy, and the Nikkei average advanced 2.6 per cent, gaining for the third consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index rose 432.56 to 16,757.63 on active buying by investment trusts, pension funds and dealers. It dipped briefly to the day's low of 16,239.76 in early trading on arbitrage-related selling, but climbed steadily in the afternoon to a high for the day of 16,802.79. Volume expanded to 350m shares from 219m, with dealers active in speculative 'theme' stocks. Domestic institutions, waiting to take profits, placed selling orders at higher levels. Rises overwhelmed falls by 923 to 79, with 78 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks moved ahead 32.71 to 1,291.69, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved 6.01 to 1,026.72. The dollar's fall against the yen, higher bonds and lower short-term interest rates encouraged dealers. Hopes that a US easing would prompt the Bank of Japan to cut the official discount rate added to the enthusiasm. Investors were also comforted by assurances by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, that additional economic measures will be implemented to support the slumping Japanese economy. During his meeting in Washington with Mr George Bush, the US president, Mr Miyazawa suggested that an additional economic support package could be presented this autumn. Some traders, however, said the market's rebound was technical, as investors and dealers moved to square short positions ahead of the Munich summit. 'Real demand' by institutional investors remained absent, they added. High-technology shares with high export ratios rose on the US economic recovery theme. Ricoh, the most active stock, put on Y29 to Y569, while KOA jumped Y58 to Y908. Citizen Watch, a speculative favourite, advanced Y37 to Y896. Taiyo Fishery forged ahead Y80 to Y461 on reports that the company would start breeding blue-fin tuna. Nippon Formula Feed, which has announced similar plans, climbed Y100 to Y772. Aids-related issues were once again firm on short-term buying by dealers. Meiji Milk Products gained Y8 to Y963 and Morinaga Milk Industry Y10 to Y839. In Osaka, the OSE average surged 635.51 to 19,449.25 in volume of 12.7m shares. Roundup DOMESTIC factors influenced trading on the Pacific Rim. Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta were closed for holidays. HONG KONG ended sharply lower after a day of volatile trading marked by rumours of a HKDollars 3bn rights issue by Sun Hung Kai Properties. The Hang Seng index retreated 61.01 to 6,073.74 in turnover of HKDollars 4.51bn, against HKDollars 4.43bn. Sun Hung Kai receded HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 34.50 and other property shares lost ground, Cheung Kong slipping 40 cents to HKDollars 25.80 and Henderson Land also 40 cents to HKDollars 19.40. TAIWAN suffered a steep fall as disappointed investors dumped shares on expectations that the stock transaction tax would not be reduced. The weighted index finished 69.73, or 1.5 per cent, down at 4,454.08 in turnover of TDollars 21.37bn, after TDollars 18.45bn. AUSTRALIA scored its biggest daily rise in seven weeks on hopes of an early interest rate cut. The All Ordinaries index closed 14.0 higher at 1,661.7. News Corp led the way, surging 64 cents to ADollars 21.74 in line with overnight strength in the US market. Banks fared particularly well. NAB appreciated 11 cents to ADollars 7.89 and Commonwealth 9 cents to ADollars 7.29. St George, however, Australia's newest bank, which was listed yesterday, slipped from its ADollars 6.40 listing price to ADollars 6.16, down 22 cents from its last trade on the unlisted market. Queensland Cotton, the day's other new stock, closed 47 cents above its issue price, at ADollars 2.37. NEW ZEALAND finished at its best level for two weeks on optimistic buying ahead of the budget speech, due after the close. The NZSE-40 capital index added 19.35 at 1,541.41 in thin trading. SEOUL dropped to a 53-month low as South Korea's trade shortfall widened to Dollars 310m in June, compared with an Dollars 85m surplus a year earlier. The composite stock index shed 3.70 to 548.28, the lowest level since February 1988. Turnover decreased to Won154.98bn from Wednesday's Won189.59bn. MANILA closed lower for the second day on continued profit-taking. The composite index declined 10.52 to 1,513.57.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: New World up 166% MR CHENG Yu Tung's New World Development has exceeded expectations with a 166 per cent rise in interim net earnings, to HKDollars 939.2m (USDollars 121m) from HKDollars 352.4m, in the six months to December 31. This marks a significant improvement for New World, which earned a net HKDollars 1.16bn in the year to June 20 1991. A dividend of HK 21 cents was declared, up 31 per cent from HK 16 cents last time. Directors said they expected even better results in the second half. They said the outlook was encouraging, given south China's economic development and the determination of Beijing to quicken the pace of economic reform in China. New World is one of Hong Kong's biggest hoteliers and property developers, with interests throughout Asia, and the US. It also has interests in southern Chinese infrastructure developments and transport in Hong Kong. During the half-year, income from property sales rose HKDollars 471.7m to HKDollars 644.9m. Profits from hotels and restaurants rose 35 per cent to HKDollars 283m, while rental income rose 11.4 per cent to HKDollars 525.2m. The company said its hotel occupancy levels had improved during the last half of 1991 and this had continued into this year. In China, where the market has been depressed, higher tourist arrivals were expected to underpin better results. In the first half, Ramada International Hotels and Resorts opened 13 hotels worldwide.</p>

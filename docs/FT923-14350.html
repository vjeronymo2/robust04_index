			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices rally on bargain-hunting THE CLOUDS lifted a little in the UK equity market yesterday when several institutions began cautiously foraging for bargains among the lengthening list of share price casualties. Strategists discounted comments from Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary, that the Bundesbank was expected to cut interest rates 'soon'. The recovery of nearly 25 points on the FT-SE Index yesterday appeared to reflect factors closer to the heart of the London stock market. Buying support was very modest, and the day's Seaq-recorded trading total reached only 381.8m shares, an improvement on Monday's 274.8m but still a poor level by more normal standards. Turnover was boosted by substantial activity in the electricity stocks after the expected pricing review turned out significantly more favourably for the distribution companies than the market had expected. After opening firmly, the Footsie drifted down to the 2,467 area in early trading. Some fund managers, who had taken the view that 2,450 was a buying level, decided not to wait any longer in case they were overtaken by traders seeking to cut bear positions ahead of the end of the trading account on Friday. Share prices steadied and the equity market was then given further encouragement when pressures slackened in the stock index futures sector. Equities turned briskly higher and, helped by a steady opening to the new session in New York, where the Dow Average added 6.76 in London hours, the FT-SE Index closed very nearly at the day's best. At its final calculation, the Footsie was 24.7 up at 2,493.7, raising the hope that the 2,500 mark might be challenged again soon. The market was helped by a good rally in British Aerospace from an initial loss, and by small gains in many of the blue chip issues which have suffered in recent sessions. Improvements in ICI, BP and Shell were of modest proportions indeed, but continued weakness in the US dollar failed to restrain these large overseas-earning shares. However, hopes that the UK stock market might at last be seeking to establish a base level were overshadowed by concern over the outlook for Wall Street. With last week's cut in discount rate by the Federal Reserve apparently finding little response on Wall Street, London still considers US equities overvalued and fears further weakness in New York. Also overhanging the UK market is the increasingly serious problem of low turnover in equities. Retail, or customer, business in equities was worth only Pounds 581.4m on Monday, barely half the level regarded as profitable for the UK securities industry. Stock Exchange statistics show that daily retail volume has remained well short of Pounds 1bn for the past six trading sessions, an unhappy start to the traditionally sluggish summer season. London securities firms have continued to trim back their office and dealing staffs, and confidence was not helped by reports that a UK clearing bank had announced redundancies among its London staff.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An opinion poll conducted for the SABC [South  African Broadcasting Corporation] has found that the majority of  blacks in Natal-KwaZulu want King Goodwill Zwelithini to be the  head of the province. The poll released today found that even  supporters of the king believed he was wrong to be so  politically involved with the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party].    Asked to rate leaders on a scale of 1-10, the king came  first  with an average of 6.64. The second most popular leader is Mr.  Nelson Mandela with 5.8, followed closely by Chief Buthelezi  with 5.37, and State President F.W. de Klerk with 5.04. The  ANC's [African National Congress] candidate for premier in  Natal, Mr. Jacob Zuma, received a negative rating from nearly  half the sample.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DEALERS reported a volatile session in stock index futures, with little in the way of features to help dealing, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 2,500, the September Footsie contract experienced a brief squeeze before it retreated, with dealers expecting a poor performance from Wall Street when it opened. But there was little in the way of dealings in the early part of the session and traders were reported to have been on the offer but seeing few takers. By 10.30am, September had fallen to 2,483. Bargain hunters prevented further falls and boosted trade, and with the feeling that the earlier falls had been overdone, September gently crept forward in the afternoon. The firm opening on Wall Street helped sustain the recovery in the contract and generated reasonable buying interest towards the close. September eventually finished the session at 2,504, down 16 on Tuesday's close, but around 8 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 25. Turnover at around 8,000 contracts was modest. Turnover in the traded options remained dull at 28,316 lots, but an improvement on Tuesday's poor 21,895 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option put in a total of 15,459, with Shell the busiest stock option, trading 1,057 lots.</p>

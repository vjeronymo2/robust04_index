			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rebounds as dollar improves Wall Street US stocks surged yesterday afternoon as the dollar firmed without further intervention by the world's central banks, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 48.56 higher at 3,685.50, rebounding strongly from a 26-point decline at the opening. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 4.51 at 447.31, even though there was an even split between New York SE rises and declines. Volume was a moderate 250m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite lagged behind with a 0.85 decline to 425.45, but the Nasdaq composite enjoyed a handsome gain of 8.89 at 702.68. From the first hour of trade, investors defied expectations of a powerful after-shock on the heels of Friday's 62-point Dow sell-off. At first, the news from the foreign exchange markets was barely supportive, with the US currency slipping below the Y100 mark in overnight trading and flirting with that level throughout the morning. But the relative stability of the dollar, without any further intervention, seemed to be enough to shore up the bond market. Treasuries started out with moderate losses, but staged an impressive rally of their own during the afternoon. The blue chips fared even better, gaining a foothold on positive ground by mid-morning and never turning back. Two stocks, Caterpillar and Walt Disney, led the advance. Shares in the world's biggest maker of earth-moving equipment improved Dollars 4 to Dollars 105 1/8 , even though a strike by 14,000 production workers dragged into its second week. Bargain hunters appeared to be taking advantage of a stock well off its 52-week high of Dollars 121 3/8 . Walt Disney, meanwhile, climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 43. The company's new film, The Lion King, became the third biggest Hollywood release of all time, selling Dollars 41m worth of tickets in its first weekend. The Big Three US car makers were back in favour, with Ford Motor advancing Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 , General Motors up Dollars 2 at Dollars 52 3/8 and Chrysler adding Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 47 3/4 . Banking issues improved, including JP Morgan, Dollars 1 1/2 ahead at Dollars 63 3/8 . Technology stocks were generally higher as well, led by IBM. Big Blue rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 61 5/8 in spite of reports that production delays were forcing Big Blue to scale back the launch of its much-vaunted PowerPC line of personal computers. A rebound by computer-related stocks helped the Nasdaq climb off its weakest close in a year on Friday. Wellfleet jumped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 25 1/2 , Microsoft climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 and Oracle added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 37 3/4 .</p>

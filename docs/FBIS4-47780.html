			<p>BFN     [Text] Maseru May 2 SAPA -- Acting Lesotho Finance Minister  Mpho Malie presented a record budget of R1.59-billion [rand] for  the 1994/95 financial year in the National Assembly in Maseru on  Monday [2 May]. This was a 14 per cent rise on the 1993/94  budget.    Development remained the single largest area of government  spending. The minister announced a 25.3 per cent rise in  budgeted expenditure for devlopement to R520-million.    Mr Malie said the large increase demonstrated government's  commitment to create jobs. Some 35 new projects had been  approved for the current financial year, he said. Education  took the second largest slice of government expenditure  recording an increase of nearly a third to R332-million  (R226-million). Other government department budgets included:  public works, road construction and repairs -- R204-million  (R169-million); health -- R124-million (R118-million);  agriculture -- R103-million (R83.5-million) and defence --  R90.3-million (no previous figure).    Lesotho's share of customs revenue from the Southern African  Customs Union remained the largest source of revenue, budgeted  to total R841-million (R747-million) or 60 per cent of the  1994/95 budget.    The rise was due to the continued importation of goods used  in the construction of the Lesotho Highland Water Project.    However, the minister warned revenue from these imports  would  taper off in the next few years as the main construction work on  the water project was completed.</p>

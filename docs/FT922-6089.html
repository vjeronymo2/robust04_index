			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Major drops visa requirement in gesture to Poles MR John Major announced the abolition of UK visa requirements for Polish tourists yesterday and increased Britain's financial aid to Warsaw. The gesture was designed to underline his commitment to Poland's eventual membership of the European Community. After talks with Polish leaders in Warsaw, Mr Major said he would use Britain's presidency of the EC in the second half of this year to commit the Twelve to allowing Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary to join the Community. He said membership of the EC was not practical in the short term. Poland is locked in twin political and economic crises, heightened last night when President Lech Walesa declared he had 'lost trust in the present government'. All three countries are still making a painful transition to market economies. Mr Major, however, emphasised his determination that the Community should not remain a 'rich man's club', suggesting that the EC should set the turn of the century as a firm target for their inclusion. His announcement, after talks with Mr Walesa and Mr Jan Olszewski, the Polish prime minister, that Britain will abolish visa requirements for Polish visitors to the UK ended a long-running dispute between the two governments. In the past Britain has argued that, because of the large Polish communities in the UK, many visitors have stayed on as illegal workers. Some 200,000 Poles live in the UK. Many have relatives in Poland who want to visit. Complaints have centred on long delays in granting visas, excessive bureaucracy, the number of people rejected and the charge for visas, which at about Pounds 20 can be more than a week's wage in Poland. Last year 47,350 Poles applied for UK visas, and 5 per cent were turned down. The announcement was welcomed by Polish community organisations in the UK. Mr Mieczyslaw Hampel, administrator of the Polish Social and Cultural Association in London, said: 'In general we are very pleased'. Mr Major said the UK would increase financial aid for Poland by Dollars 14m (Pounds 7.7m). The money will finance small business development. Ariane Genillard in Prague writes: Mr Vaclav Havel, the Czechoslovak president, will urge the EC to speed the process of admitting east European countries when he meets Mr Major today. Faster integration with the EC would lessen the risk of violence in the east, he said.</p>

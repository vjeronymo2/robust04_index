			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> REBELS KILL LIBERIA'S DOE, DISPLAY BODY;  </P> <P> 2ND FACTION CALLS FOR PULLOUT OF WEST AFRICAN FORCE  </P> <P> President Samuel Doe was killed by rebels and his bullet-scarred body has been  put on display at their camp outside Monrovia, news and government reports said  today.  </P> <P> Travelers returning to Monrovia told the British Broadcasting Corp. that Doe  died in a rebel camp where he was taken Sunday after he was wounded and  captured by rebel forces in a fierce gun battle in the capital of his war-torn  West African nation.  </P> <P> U.S. State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S.  officials regard the reports as reliable and consider them confirmation of  Doe's death.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Liberia's main rebel fighters demanded today that West African  troops withdraw from Monrovia and said they will keep fighting despite Doe's  death at the hands of Prince Yormie Johnson's rival rebel faction.  </P> <P> Tom Woewiyu, chief spokesman of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front,  dashed hopes for an early end to the tribal conflict in which three warring  parties have killed more than 5,000 civilians.  </P> <P> Doe was interrogated by Prince Johnson over large amounts of money he allegedly  embezzled during his time in power, then killed, the BBC quoted the travelers  as saying. The president's body, badly mutilated, was reportedly on display at  the camp.  </P> <P> State Department spokesman Mark Dillen said the department has reports from  several sources, including representatives of forces led by Prince Johnson,  that Doe "died from the gunshot wounds he suffered in the shoot-out with Prince  Johnson."  </P> <P> Dillen said he had no further information.  </P> <P> Johnson had telephoned the BBC to say he had captured Doe in a battle Sunday as  Liberia's leader of 10 years was trying to flee the country, possibly on a ship  of a West African task force sent to end the 8 1/2-month-old war.  </P> <P> Woewiyu's announcement that Taylor's rebels will keep fighting came in a  telephone interview from Burkina Faso, one of eight West African nations he has  visited in an effort to get the West African force to withdraw from Monrovia.  </P> <P> "Their mission has failed, and a prime example is the capture of Doe by the  Prince Johnson group right in their headquarters," Woewiyu said.  </P> <P> Prince Johnson, whose men felled Doe in a battle at the headquarters of the  West African task force in Monrovia port, declared that he will run Liberia  until elections are held.  </P> <P> Johnson controls Monrovia, but Taylor's 10,000-strong army has overrun much of  the rest of Liberia.  </P> <P> Gambian President Dawda Jawara said today that Doe's ouster may help the peace  process in Liberia. "All the factions that were involved in the fighting,  including other interest groups, were insisting that Doe must go," he said.  </P> <P> He said the West African community will try to consult both rebel leaders about  an interim government. He made no reference to Johnson's having declared  himself president.  </P></p>

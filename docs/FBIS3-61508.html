Kozhabekova, Republican Sanitary Epidemiological Station  and Scientific Research Institute of Epidemiology, Microbiology,  and Infectious Diseases, Alma-Ata; UDC 616.995.132.5.574]    [Text] Abstract. The principal clinical symptoms in  patients and epidemiological characteristics are described in  the article.    The authors of this report observed four patients, three of  whom were identified in Pavlodar and one in Uralsk.    Helminths (Dirofilaria repens) belong to the  genera of Nematodes and Nemathelminthes and have the dimensions  of 100 to 110 x 0.2 mm and, as a rule, parasitize in nodular  intumescence under the skin, subcutaneous fat, and the eye.    The larva migrans cutanea phenomenon, i.e., a  parasite movement over substantial distances under the skin, has  been recorded.    Dirofilarioses are transmissive helminths. Humans are  infected with them in the locations where invaded animals  proliferate (dogs, foxes, wolves, etc.) through mosquito bites.  References: 4.    Key words: Parasitism--A form of cohabitation of two  organisms advantageous for one and harmful for the other  species; filaria--several species of white filamentary  helminths; Dirofilaria--one of the filaria species; larva  migrans cutanea phenomenon--parasite movement over a  considerable distance under the skin; transmissible  diseases--diseases whose etiological agents are transmitted by  vectors.    Several dozen cases of parasitizing of animal filaria in  humans identified as Dirofilaria have been recorded in the  world, including the CIS. Moreover, single, usually sexually  immature female and less frequently, male filaria have been  detected in the organism of most patients. Helminths, as a rule,  parasitize in nodular subcutaneous intumescence, subcutaneous  fat, and the eye.    Filaria have been found in people living in the territories  with subtropical and moderate continental climate. Cases of  Dirofilaria have been described in the maritime kray [3] and  Turkmenia [2]. In Kazakhstan, the first cases of local  Dirofilarioses infestation were described by T.K. Besedina and  N.A. Khokholnikova [1]. Both cases were identified in Alma-Ata  in 1960-1961, and in the author's opinion, the southern  Kazakhstan and Urals oblasts are regarded as likely infestation  areas [4]. The latter two Dirofilarioses cases were recorded in  Kzyl-Orda in 1964 and 1968.    The authors of this report have observed four Dirofilariosis  patients in the last six months. Due to the increased frequency  of the rare helminthism occurrence on the republic territory, it  would be interesting to examine the principal climatic symptoms  on invasion among the patients, especially its epidemiology.    Patient B, born in 1940, is a biology teacher in a Pavlodar  secondary school. She fell acutely ill on 19 Mar 90, felt a  sharp pain and an edema of the left eye. For several days prior  to that, she experienced headaches every evening. On 20 Mar 90,  she sought medical help at a trauma center of the oblast  hospital where a filamentary helminth with a 110 x 0.2 mm size  was removed from under the mucous membrane of the eyeball.    Patient S, born in 1954, is a designer engineer working in  Pavlodar. A hyperemic spot which, with time, transformed into a  1 x 5 mm node, appeared in the left groin area. The larva  migrans phenomenon, i.e., a parasite movement over a  considerable distance under the skin, was detected. The process  was accompanied by pain in the elbow and radiocarpal joints and  an edema of the tongue.    On 25 Sep 90, a 110 x 0.2 mm nematode was pulled from under  the eyeball mucous membrane.    Patient P, a retiree born in 1930, is also a resident of  Pavlodar. She fell ill in late February 1992 when she noted a  hyperemic tumor-like formation on the forehead. She was bothered  by severe headaches. The tumor disappeared several days later.  On 8 March, she had sharp pain in the right eye and developed  photophobia and lacrimation. On 20 March, a 106 x 0.2 mm  nematode was removed from under the eyeball mucous membrane at  the eye department of the oblast hospital.    Patient M from Uralsk is a retiree. In February 1992, she  noted an edema on the front of the right crus and a  zigzag-shaped reddening as well as pain in the area of the knee  joint. Some time later, the reddening moved lower, and a  pea-sized tumor appeared on the rear surface of the right crus.  The movement of the reddening was accompanied by itching. After  self-treatment of the tumor with Vishnevskiy ointment, no  recovery was noted. After she sought medical assistance, the  tumor was operated on, and a white 110-mm-long nematode was  pulled from the purulent wound.    All patients recall numerous mosquito bites during the  summer  and none left Kazakhstan. The helminths extracted from them were  sent to the republican sanitary and epidemiological station for  identification; they are encapsulated preadolescent males  belonging to the Dirofilaria repens species.    Dirofilarioses are transmissible helminthisms. They are  widespread in the world among dogs, but foxes, wolves, coyotes,  tigers, and wild cats may be the final ``host,'' although humans  are only accidental ``hosts.'' Humans are infected in the areas  of habitat of invaded animals through mosquito bites of the  Aedes, Cubex and Anopheles species. The  filaria development phase prior to the invasion stage depends on  the intermediate ``host'' (10-20 days). After entering the  mosquito's stomach together with the blood, the  Drepens microfilaria migrate into the insect body  cavity for 1.5 days. After reaching the invasion stage, the  larva migrate into the head and mouth organs of the mosquitos  and from there--into the human organism through bites.    An increase in the gnat population was noted in Pavlodar and  Uralsk between 1982 and 1991: the mean seasonal indicator rose  by twofold. Such a widespread proliferation of insects in the  aforesaid regions is the factor which determine the unfavorable  situation with the transmissible disease, including  Dirofilariosis.

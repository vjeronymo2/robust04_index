			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Arkadiy Nikiforov report under the "Authority" rubric: </F> "Boris Yeltsin Gives Yuriy Skokov New Carte Blanche. Commodity  Producers Federation Chairman Strengthens His Position at State  Duma"]    [Text] The Russian Federation of Commodity Producers  [RFCP] and the State Duma's second largest faction, the New  Regional Policy, represented by their leaders, Yuriy Skokov and  Vladimir Medvedev respectively, have signed an agreement on a  wide-ranging coordination of their efforts in devising common  approaches to political and economic areas, defining the main  areas of legislative activity, and joint work on resolving  urgent problems at the federal and regional level.    Before the agreement was signed, Skokov and Medvedev had  lengthy meetings and conversations with Boris Yeltsin, who,  according to available reports, approved of this far-reaching  alliance.    It is worth noting that neither the RFCP nor the New  Regional  Policy Faction have signed the Treaty on Social Accord in the  belief that without resolving the most acute economic and social  problems it will end up being yet another declaration of good  intentions.    Yuriy Skokov, who is a serious candidate for top government  posts, is clearly strengthening his position and acquiring new  opportunities to influence the State Duma and the regions. The  formalization of this alliance will be undoubtedly a shot in the  arm for Vladimir Medvedev himself and his faction at the State  Duma, which can now rely on direct support from one of Russia's  most promising and experienced politicians.    In that regard, a question arises as to whether Sergey  Shakhray's removal from the post of minister for nationalities  and regional policy was prompted by the carte blanche Yuriy  Skokov apparently received from the Russian president to pursue  a new political line toward the federation components.    It cannot be ruled out that the RFCP chief's flurry of  activity also stems from the president's harsh criticism of the  government's performance and the signing of a package of edicts  aimed at stabilizing the economy and streamlining  market-oriented reform. In that context, the following question  will be only logical: What will happen after the Chernomyrdin  government is yet again unable to enforce President Yeltsin's  strict instructions and to hold up the avalanche-like production  slump? The situation will apparently require that a new prime  minister be appointed who must have not only the experience of a  large-scale economic manager, but also a serious, thought-out,  and, most important, realistic program of lifting the Russian  economy out of its deepest crisis.</p>

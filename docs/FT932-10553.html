			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Yeltsin continues to purge anti-reformists RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin yesterday promised a purge of officials who opposed his reforms and said he wanted parliamentary elections to be held this year, Reuter reports from Moscow. In a televised address, Mr Yeltsin said the referendum which last month backed his rule was the green light for reforms, which he said were being hindered by the conservative parliament headed by chairman Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov. He said senior officials were also blocking reforms and said he would instruct Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and heads of regional administrations across the country to review the performance of their employees. 'Those who do not share our aims should simply leave so as not to interfere with our work,' he said. 'The heads of government and (local) administrations should carry out a serious reconsideration of their choice of personnel - this is a direct instruction from the president.' He also gave warning of what will be a battle with parliament over his new draft constitution, which would scrap the supreme legislature, the Congress of People's Deputies, and replace it with a two-tier federal parliament. Mr Yeltsin said he would soon put forward a bill proposing parliamentary elections, a move which the existing legislature will undoubtedly dismiss as illegal. 'I do not think it is worth putting off elections to the new parliament beyond the autumn of this year,' he said. But Mr Yeltsin did promise a crackdown on crime, and said the government would fight soaring inflation by clamping down on credit emission. The Russian leader, in what he called 'a difficult and bitter moment', said he had totally lost confidence in his deputy Alexander Rutskoi, now in open opposition. Mr Yeltsin has already stripped the rebellious vice-president of his special responsibilities for agriculture and fighting corruption.</p>

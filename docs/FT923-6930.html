			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Finland proposes budget cut of FM6bn THE Finnish government yesterday proposed swingeing cuts worth nearly FM6bn (Pounds 776m) in next year's budget. This decision follows cuts agreed in June totalling an estimated FM7bn. The cabinet was forced to make further downward revisions in its spending programmes for 1993 because of a soaring budget deficit, fuelled by the cost of growing unemployment, which the government estimates will average 13 per cent in 1993, and provisions by the state of FM20.8bn this year to rescue the ailing banking sector from collapse, The latest cuts will involve a 4 per cent reduction in central and local government administrative costs as well as savings from reduced expenditure on transport, agriculture, housing and provision of child care facilities. The numbers entitled to unemployment benefit will be reduced. In addition the cabinet announced rises in energy taxes to double the yield to FM1bn, further damping depressed domestic demand. The latest bout of cuts was decided by the cabinet which sat late into the night. They underline the continuing fragility of Finland's economy despite an improvement in its export performance, low inflation and signs of a recovery in profitability in both the metal and forestry sectors. Continuing high market interest rates reflect persistent international unease about the economy, although Mr Michel Camdessus, head of the International Monetary Fund, took a positive view of its future on a visit to Finland recently. The markets are looking apprehensively to next month's centralised wage negotiations, where employers are seeking a three-year deal with no pay rises, which the trade unions are unlikely to accept. In October Prime Minister Esko Aho and colleagues in the Centre party-Conservative coalition face a test of their political popularity with local government elections. Observers believe that if these turn out to be disastrous for the ruling parties it could precipitate a political crisis and possible change of government. The current concern is the likely size of the public deficit, expected to rise by FM68bn this year to FM185bn. ETLA, the country's independent economic forecasters, believe public debt will level off by 1996 to around 50 per cent of gross domestic product.</p>

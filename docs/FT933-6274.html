			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Lasmo Despite the rumours surrounding Lasmo in recent weeks, a bid from British Gas looks unlikely. The theory is that since the MMC wants to clip British Gas's wings in the UK, it may spend more on its exploration and production arm. Yet while the company seems keen to expand, the risks and returns look better in its Global Gas business. Management contracts to run gas networks and the construction of power stations in collaboration with others is closer to British Gas's core expertise. Besides, the company's exploration and production interests are primarily in gas: bidding for an oil company like Lasmo would be distinctly out of character. Speculation that Mr John Walmsley might be tempted to join Lasmo after his resignation as finance director of Enterprise Oil looks equally misplaced. The current chief executive, Mr Joe Darby, was only appointed in March. There can hardly be room for Mr Walmsley to become an executive chairman above him. It is even more improbable that Mr Walmsley would be happy to have left Enterprise to become second in command at Lasmo. More persuasive is the idea that US investors, valuing Lasmo on the basis of cash flow, regard the stock as cheap compared to its US counterparts. That ignores the fact that the cash is more than needed to finance the replacement of reserves. Lasmo is unlikely to have any substantial free cash flow until 1996. Since the dividend may yet be cut further, UK fund managers may be content to allow their US competitors to acquire the stock.</p>

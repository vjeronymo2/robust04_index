			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Altruism and fear in the middle ground A MIXTURE OF resignation, fear and altruism was expressed by middle-income professionals yesterday facing the prospect of higher taxes under a Labour government. Mr David Land, an Edinburgh bank official earning between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 40,000 said: 'Labour's tax plans would make me more miserable. Most of my money goes to looking after our family. I would like see John Major returned by a whisker, but also to get constitutional change in Scotland.' He plans to vote Liberal Democrat. Less certain was Mr Keith Green, who is in the same earnings bracket. An account director at a London marketing consultancy, he said that under Labour he would pay more tax without any guarantee of improved public transport or education. 'They seem to be taking money from a small group and giving it to another,' he said. 'I'll vote either Tory or Liberal Democrat.' The resolve to vote Conservative was as strong as ever for Mr Adam Applegarth, 29, assistant general manager at Northern Rock building society in Newcastle upon Tyne. He earns Pounds 45,000 a year. 'I don't believe John Smith can hold the line against their spending ministers,' he said. Mr Roderick Nicol, an Exeter management training consultant on Pounds 50,000, would be hit by Labour's proposals. 'I'm not sure I trust any of the parties to spend money wisely,' he said. He planned to stick with the Conservatives. Reporting by Daniel Green, Chris Tighe, James Buxton and Richard Tomkins.</p>

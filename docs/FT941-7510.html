			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Survey finds optimism among smaller companies Britain's smaller companies are bullish about growth prospects in the short term, in spite of looming tax increases which some have speculated could hinder economic recovery. A survey by brokers SG Warburg showed that 74 per cent of companies expected an improvement in the economy over the next 12 months. This contrasts sharply with recent public opinion polls, which showed that only 13 per cent of respondents expected an improvement. The survey also showed that more companies felt there had been no change in the timeliness of invoice payment, which was widely considered to be poor. About Pounds 50bn is estimated to be outstanding on overdue invoices in the UK. Some 58 per cent of companies questioned favoured the introduction of statutory interest on late payments. About a third opposed legislation. The survey, A View From the Boardroom, was based on the responses of 448 chairmen and chief executives of companies with market values of less than Pounds 300m. It is Warburg's first attempt to track comprehensively the views of senior executives in the smaller companies sector. The survey, conducted in January and February, will be produced on a three or four-monthly basis. Companies were found to be more optimistic than just three months ago, with 46 per cent of those surveyed saying order books were between 1 per cent and 10 per cent ahead in that period. About a third of companies said orders had remained static. Two thirds said they expected sales to increase over the next three months. The economic growth expected by UK companies is unlikely to mean a change in employment levels, however. The consumer goods sector was less optimistic than either the manufacturing or service industries. This contrasts with recent statistics showing a pick up in consumer spending. Some 39 per cent of consumer goods companies reported that import penetration of their UK markets had 'increased a little'. Mr Richard Hickinbotham, head of Warburg's smaller companies research team, said the findings of the survey 'are particularly bullish for small companies' earnings prospects'. However, to justify further outperformance in an already buoyant small company sector, 'we need to see the results of the survey reflected in company statements and ultimately in meaningful earnings advances', Mr Hickinbotham said.</p>

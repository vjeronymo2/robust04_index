			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Japanese politician sentenced A former provincial governor, the only Japanese politician brought to trial in a scandal involving Sagawa Kyubin parcel delivery company, yesterday received a suspended prison sentence. Mr Kiyoshi Kaneko was given a one-year jail term suspended for three years, for taking Y100m (Pounds 632,100) from Sagawa Kyubin in a political funding scandal that helped bring down two governments. Disclosures over Sagawa Kyubin's donations to senior politicians in 1992 and 1993 contributed to the collapse of the Liberal Democratic party government last year.</p>

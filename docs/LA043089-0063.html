			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGES TACKLE INCREASE IN RACISM ON CAMPUSES  </P> <P> In February, amid two weeks of protests against racial incidents at Penn State  University, a young white man grabbed a black student by the arm and punched  her in the eye. "Why don't you protest this," he told her.  </P> <P> During the last two years, 160 U.S. colleges have reported incidents aimed at  black, Latino, Asian and homosexual students and faculty members, said Howard  J. Uhrlich of the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence.  </P> <P> "Between 20% and 25% of all minority students on campus have been victimized at  least once during an academic year," Uhrlich said, citing incidents of verbal  harassment, cross-burnings, hate literature, beatings, brawls, anti-homosexual  graffiti, swastikas and racially motivated slurs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grew Up in Suburbs  </P> <P> "The heart of the problem for many large campuses like ours is that a majority  of our white students grew up in suburban areas or small communities. They have  had no positive experiences with minorities," said Grant Ingle, acting director  of human relations at the University of Massachusetts, where an argument over  the 1986 World Series erupted into a racial brawl.  </P> <P> Pressured by student minority groups, colleges increasingly are naming provosts  for minority affairs, recruiting and retaining more non-white teachers and  creating programs to improve interracial understanding.  </P> <P> * A mini-course, titled "Race and Rutgers," began this semester to review race  relations at the New Jersey university since the 1960s.  </P> <P> * William Chace, president of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., sent  students a letter about racial relations on campus and the film "Mississippi  Burning" about the 1964 murders of civil rights activists.  </P> <P> * Stanford University President Donald Kennedy reported in February on an  incident in which two students were barred from campus housing for two quarters  for drawing caricatures of a black on a Beethoven poster and leaving it near a  black student's door.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ethnic Studies Requirement  </P> <P> * At the University of Wisconsin, 88% of freshmen this fall will have to  fulfill a new ethnic studies credit requirement.  </P> <P> Some minority students, calling attention to the issue with protests and  sit-ins, have labeled these efforts window dressing. They charge that colleges  have not responded quickly enough and have not set stiff enough penalties.  </P> <P> Other critics question the administrators' commitment to diversity.  </P> <P> "Some universities have created a (minority affairs) office or program and say  they solved the problem. I see on many campuses where the minority affairs  officer doesn't have any power," said Reginald Wilson, senior scholar at the  American Council on Education in Washington, D. C.  </P> <P> "Yet when you ask people on campus who is responsible, they point to that  person," Wilson said. "Generally, the colleges that seem to be responding,  unfortunately, are the ones where something has happened."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tougher Conduct Code  </P> <P> Since the October, 1986, World Series brawl at the University of Massachusetts,  the school has instituted a tougher conduct code that more clearly defines what  disciplinary action can be taken. It also has reinstated a freshman orientation  program that encourages racial harmony.  </P> <P> "Our World Series event was the most visible major racial clash on a U.S.  campus. I think we've been forced to do more in response than others," said  James Langley, an associate vice chancellor.  </P> <P> Today's students "did not live through the civil rights movement. Some don't  know the significance of Martin Luther King Jr. Some don't even know who he  was," Langley said. Despite efforts to recruit minorities and to keep the issue  in the forefront, "We have a situation that needs close watching. This campus  is not settled. It's not calm," he said.  </P> <P> "This university has not had any true commitment to diversity," said Traci  Davis, 20, of Springfield, Mass., a member of a minority-rights group on the  Amherst campus. She said the university needs to redouble its efforts.  </P> <P> Penn State a year ago hung at its 22 campuses posters proclaiming that "Racism  Has No Place at Penn State." The posters, which bore telephone numbers for  reporting incidents, were a way for the university to acknowledge that some  people thought racism was a problem on campus, said Patricia Peterson,  assistant vice president for campus life.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Black Women Accosted  </P> <P> Black students, who said five black women were accosted by whites as they  walked downtown near the campus, demonstrated in February. Chanting "Racism no!  Racism must go!" they demanded harsher penalties for racist acts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Surface Changes'  </P> <P> "Right now (administrators) are doing surface changes," said Yvette Dudley,  president of the NAACP chapter at Penn State. "They say they are open to  changes, but we haven't seen any structural changes."  </P> <P> Nearly a year after the Madison Plan, a blueprint for increasing minority  participation, was begun on the University of Wisconsin campus, the  Interfraternity Council expelled a fraternity in November for incidents that  included a slave auction in which pledges in blackface and Afro wigs mimicked  contemporary black entertainers. The action came a week after a university  committee announced it could not punish the fraternity.  </P></p>

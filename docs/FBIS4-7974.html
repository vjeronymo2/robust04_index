			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Piotr Adamowicz and Pawel Reszka: "Solidarity </F> Needs a Success"]    [Text] The Presidium of the National Committee [KK] of  Solidarity ["S"] decided on Wednesday [6 April] in Gdansk that a  meeting with President Lech Walesa should soon be held at the  union's headquarters.    "There is a good prognosis; the president is always willing  to discuss the problems of laborers," was the comment by  Belweder Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski.    "The fact that the president did not sign the new popiwek  [tax on excessive wage increases] law is a step in the right  direction and also a gesture for the union," said "S" Chairman  Marian Krzaklewski. He expects that the president will act  similarly when it comes to the budget law. "Then one will be  able to evaluate the true intentions of the president,"  Krzaklewski believes.    Minister Mieczyslaw Wachowski has recently held several  meetings with a member of the KK Presidium on the organization  of a meeting between the union's leadership and the president.  Opinions within "S" were divided. Some believe that such talks  are necessary because the president may become an ally in the  union-government dispute. Another group of KK Presidium  members, including Kwasniewski, was skeptical. They believe  that Walesa would want to take advantage of the temporary  rapprochement with "S" for his game with the government  coalition.  <H5>  The Unsuccessful Strike </H5>   One of the "S" leaders said during a serious talk that the  present strike situation was caused by the impulsiveness of the  chairman, who, at a 9 February demonstration, delivered an  ultimatum on the "Pact on Enterprise" to the government (Marian  Krzaklewski demanded that the entire packet of the "pact" laws  be passed by 15 March).    "We were not prepared for strikes; however, one must defend  a  young chairman whose nerves turned out to be too weak," our  informer told us.    Now it seems that the union once again wants to save face  after the unsuccessful strike action, which started on 7 March.    One could find several examples of the union's  inconsistency.    On 11 March, trains were supposed to be stopped. However,  the  railroad directors managed to break the strike, and the affair  ended up in mere announcements of a strike. "S" was supposed to  picket the Sejm from 0830 on 17 March and continue the action  until a decision on the popiwek was made. The Sejm deputies put  off the voting until the following day, and the picketing broke  up after a few hours. Permanent statements about staging a  general strike depreciated the most dangerous weapon of the  union.    The "S" leaders are themselves beginning to doubt the sense  of the strike action. Some KK members have started voicing  opinions that the strike should be stopped. The "S" leaders  know very well how difficult it is to stage a protest in a  situation when enterprises are going bankrupt and even the  lowest-paid employees are afraid of losing their jobs (last year  Mazowsze Region chief learned about it himself--the general  strike of the region was, generally speaking, nothing more than  putting up banners at the enterprises). People's opinions about  the protests are also rather unfavorable: A definite majority of  them believe that, in the present situation, strikes will not  yield any results.    "S" managed, however, to collect the strike fund. It is  not known how large the fund is, but it is said to be a  considerable sum. Another problem then appeared: Some want to  use this money at once, while others would rather invest the  money to multiply it.    "Then one could go to a meeting with the prime minister and  show him how large the bank account has become. If the sum is  enormous, it will make an impression on him. One does not have  to stage a strike; the threat would be strong enough. However,  this might be possible in three or four years, if we do not  fritter this money away before that," says one of the younger KK  members.  <H5>  Controlled Talks </H5>   Because it wanted to find a way out of the difficult  situation, "S" decided on talks between the experts of "S" and  those of the government. From the very beginning, each party  wanted to discuss different things, and, as a result, no  agreement was reached. However, "S" believed it was a success  that the joint communique included the union's demands because  the communique would be read by the Council of Ministers.    "Here the game is played in the foreground, and on two  levels  of each of them," journalists were told by "S" Spokesperson  Piotr Zak.    The union activists were aware of the fact that the experts'  talks were an element of the game in the triangle of the prime  minister, the president, and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD].  Waldemar Pawlak wanted to have an additional advantage, the  possibility (for the SLD, the threat) of giving in to "S."  Until 13 April, "S" is waiting for the ministers to make the  political decision--namely, whether to accept the demands.  However, a solution favorable to "S" is almost out of the  question. The All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement and its partner,  Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, would protest such a  decision.  <H5>  Only the President Remains </H5>   Nevertheless, Marian Krzaklewski seems to need a success.  The "S" congress is drawing closer. He will have to explain the  election failure and show what he has done since last June.  Therefore, if talks with the government prove unsuccessful, the  unionists will have to turn to the president, who most clearly  feels like trying to build an alliance with "S" once again.    A year ago, we saw a similar situation. Marian Krzaklewski  did not want to speak with the government. Therefore, a team of  experts was set up, but the talks did not result in anything.    Can the president do more than he could last year? He does  not exert great influence over the government's decisions, and  he is in conflict with the parliament. However, he can veto laws  (last year, when he held talks with "S," the parliament was  already dissolved). The budget law is waiting for his signature.    There is no doubt that, even though the president's veto  would not satisfy the demands of "S," it would certainly be a  success, something the union has not had for a long time.</p>

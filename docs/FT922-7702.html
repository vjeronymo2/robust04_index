			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / America's Cup: Know-how sets up US triumph / Analysis of the reasons why Italy's sailors look certain to founder ITALIAN optimism about winning the America's Cup evaporated 14 minutes into Thursday's race. Il Moro di Venezia had started in a favoured position, to windward and slightly ahead of the US boat. As the two yachts drag-raced off to the left of the course, America3 pulled gradually ahead. No wind shifts, no tactics - just pure speed. Goodnight, Venice. America3 went on to lead by 24 seconds at the weather mark and scarcely faltered in marching to a winning margin of 1 min 4 secs. It put the team built by energy tycoon Bill Koch 3-1 up in the series. Until that crucial moment after the first quarter-hour, there had been some ambiguity in each of the three previous races. The initial encounter, last Saturday, was a typical first-day muddle. The huge spectator fleet of more than 700 vessels was spread across the first leg of the course, causing race director Tom Ehman to utter the immortal phrase: 'Anyone between the Il Moro yacht and Tijuana is in the wrong place. Please head inshore.' Then, Il Moro's skipper, Paul Cayard, made an uncharacteristic gaffe at the start gun, putting the red yacht over early. He was 30 secs behind America3 up the first leg of the course, a margin that scarcely varied during the 20-mile race. Observers drew the conclusion that the boats had equal pace after America3's cautious victory. Thrills and spills during Sunday's race again obscured a few vital statistics. Off an equal start, Cayard was able to push Il Moro fractionally ahead of America3 as they worked up the beat. The crucial manoeuvre was a tack right up onto the white boat as it swerved to duck the stern of Il Moro. Cayard had already given warning that he would use hand-to-hand combat as a substitute if his boat lacked speed. 'I like it when yachting gets physical. Perhaps I should have stayed with basketball,' said the San Franciscan who has been sailing for Italy since 1989. Twice more in that thrilling race, Cayard poked America3 in the eye to stop it getting past. As they ran in shoulder-to-shoulder at the first leeward mark, he turned Il Moro sharply towards the US yacht. Obliged by Rule 38.1 to avoid a collision, helmsman Buddy Melges at the wheel of America3 turned too abruptly and collapsed the spinnaker across the mast, slowing the 75 ft boat to a crawl. At the finish, where the two-second margin was the closest in America's Cup history, Il Moro achieved its victory only because its gigantic white spinnaker billowed across the line ahead of the Americans. 'It was kind of harrowing sitting there waiting for three minutes while the race committee decided who had won,' said Cayard. These dramatics, far from amateur, gave further scope for the wishful belief that the Italians had a competitive boat. An accountant's analysis, however, would have shown that they threw everything including the kitchen sink at opponents who, on that day, were unable to mobilise their own capacity. Race three provided a big win for America3, yet the validity of the result was obscured by a decisive Cayard misjudgement at the start. With a big left-shift to the breeze imminent, he opted for the penalised right side of the course. He said later he knew almost immediately it was a mistake; but being so far to the right, and the entire quarter-mile length of the start line away from America3, exaggerated the effect of the shift. 'I decided on the wrong side and then I invested heavily. Like buying into the stock market in October of '87. It was Black Tuesday,' he added. With the series at 2-1 to the Americans, the bald scientific truth - that Koch's Dollars 75m (Pounds 42m) programme, drawing heavily from US military and space know-how, had produced a faster boat - was still obscured by drama, sentiment and kidology, the traditional side orders at the America's Cup banquet. The main course, however, is always a fast boat. 'Boat speed is a science, sailing is an art,' Koch has said often over the past few months in San Diego. He has used the axiom to pacify those romantics who criticised his juggernaut programme, bristling with scientists and researchers. What Koch has not added is that the former will nearly always defeat the latter. Any European nation planning to spend the cost of a brace of warships on an America's Cup challenge should pause for a history lesson. Since the Second World War, the Americans have won 44 races in these best-of-seven contests, the foreigners just eight. To become the 28th defender of the Cup, Koch admitted to pouring 10 per cent of his net worth into this campaign. When he won the first race of the final - not the cup itself, mark you - Koch set off a Dollars 50,000 firework display that evening in the garden of his home adjoining the San Diego Yacht Club. When Italians want to obscure the cost of things, they quote sums of lire with so many noughts that calculators short-circuit. Nevertheless, the Montedison chemicals and plastics conglomerate is willing to break commercial cover and own up to spending 'in excess of Dollars 60m' on its sponsorship of the five-boat Il Moro di Venezia programme. Montedison celebrated its victory last Sunday over America3 with up-market full-page ads. Any analysis of the 1992 cup produces one stark conclusion. Of 10 syndicates involved, the two that spent the most money finished up in the final. Critics said it had simply become a wallet contest. Perhaps it had been so since the first race in 1851; anyway, arguments about cost are nothing new. Harold Vanderbilt spent so much on his 1937 Ranger campaign that it became an issue in the US presidential election. A harder question to answer in 1992 is whether the stakes are now so high that a willingness to play is prima facie evidence of a shocking lack of financial judgment. Will the cup become solely the playpen of nautical egomaniacs with inherited fortunes?</p>

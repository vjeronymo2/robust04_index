			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- Chairwoman of the C.C.  [Central Committee], the Chondoist Chongu Party Yu Mi-yong in a  statement Wednesday urged the political parties and religious  organizations of South Korea to accede to a contact at an  earlier date to discuss the convocation of a national conference.    She said the choice of the entire fellow countrymen for  warding off the danger of a nuclear war hanging over the nation,  defending peace of the country and opening a signal phase for  the independent and peaceful reunification of the country is the  great unity of the whole nation and the convocation of a  national conference that may help pool the patriotic will and  efforts of the nation.    "We Chondoist believers cannot give up our hope for a  national conference although a tiny handful of those in South  Korea opposed to dialogue and reunification are laying hurdles  in our way," she said, and added: "We urge that our Chondoist  Chongu Party and political parties of South Korea should have  bilateral or multilateral contacts at an early date to discuss  the convocation of a national conference."    She expressed the hope that the South Korean authorities,  though belatedly, would show a positive response to the proposal  for ont vocation of a national conference and take due measures  to select promptly South side's delegates to the preparatory  committee for a national conference so that the committee might  tackle down to its task.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] RANGOON, Jan 27 (AFP) -- Burma's timber trade,  halted during a three-month government probe into malpractice  allegations against both entrepreneurs and corrupt officials,  has been allowed to resume, officials say. Local timber  merchants contacted by AFP said they still needed clearance,  however, from the military commanders with jurisdiction over the  areas where timber concessions are located.    Dozens of people were given stiff jail sentences in  connection with shady deals uncovered during the investigation  by military intelligence, highlighted in the state-owned press.  But local observers noted that prices for timber and wood-based  fuel had risen in the wake of the clampdown. Charcoal, used  widely for cooking, now costs more than 500 kyats per basket, or  around 12 kyats per pound -- almost three times the cost to  consumers previously, the observers said.    A would-be house-owner cited a similar rise: "I'm suddenly  having to pay for my building material almost triple the prices  of just three months ago."    Under a new forest law promulgated in 1992, which strictly  limits extraction of timber for commercial purposes, Burma --  which owns nearly 75 percent of the world's teak reserves --  said it intended to preserve its forest resources. The law  required private timber merchants to apply for official permits  through a competitive bidding system which was intended to  encourage private sector investment in the industry while  curbing illegal logging. But reports of widespread malpractice  involving timber businessmen, abetted by corrupt officials,  triggered a sudden halt to logging in November and the official  investigation.    Thousands of tons of illicit logs were seized and an  unspecified number of smugglers and corrupt government officials  were identified. A recent report in the official NEW LIGHT OF  MYANMAR cited the example of 11 timber merchants and as many  forest department employees who were sentenced this month by a  special court in Rangoon to seven years in jail for illegal  logging, smuggling and bribery. The daily said the government  had recovered cash and assets which were declared state property.    The money collected paid largely for a state-of-the-art  multi-million-dollar international business center on the shores  of Rangoon's Inya Lake. At its recent inauguration, a senior  forestry official said the center had cost the state "next to  nothing."    "We constructed the building practically cost-free because  all the expenses were paid for with fines and penalties slapped  on timber merchants, both foreign and local, caught cheating  us," he said, adding that the illegal logs confiscated had also  gone a long way to defraying the costs. The official disclosed  that one foreign logging company caught red-handed not only had  to pay a hefty fine but was charged double for logs already  extracted, even though the wood was of the "unreserved species."    Reliable sources said meanwhile that some logging  concessions  had been given a three-month extension for extraction if  companies paid stiff fines and double charges to take out the  logs.</p>

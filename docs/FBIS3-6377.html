			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pusan, March 17 (YONHAP) -- As the American  Consulate and the American Center here have been unduly using a  state-owned building without paying rent, public voices are  rising that the American authorities should pay back rent and  return the building to Korea. Public criticism is directed also  to the arbitrary expansion by the consulate of the first and  third floors of the three-story building without obtaining  permission from Pusan municipal authorities.    On Wednesday the consulate authorities even prevented Pusan  Chung-ku Ward officials trying to look into the illegal floor  space expansion from entering the building on the ground that  they had come without giving an advance notice. The building,  originally owned by a Japanese co. in 1919, was used by U.S.  occupation forces upon national liberation and later by the  American Consulate beginning September 1948 upon the  inauguration of the Korean Government.    In 1970 the government had the Office of National Tax  Administration own the building. The ownership of the building  was turned over to the Chung-ku Ward of Pusan in 1983. However,  the government failed to collect rent from or even conclude any  lease agreement with the consulate on the excuse of special  relationship between Korea and the United States. Chung-ku Ward  officials say that the unauthorized expansion of the floor space  is definitely a violation of the construction law, but they  cannot take any action against it any longer because the  three-year period of prescription expired long before.    Faced with the mounting public criticism, the American  Consulate and Center plan to move to elsewhere. Consul Edward  Kloth of the consulate called at the Pusan Chamber of Commerce  and Industry on last March 11 and, while saying he would like to  move their offices to elsewhere, inquired about rent and other  conditions of the chamber and nearby commercial buildings.</p>

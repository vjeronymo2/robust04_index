			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei firmer on small-lot buying Most investors remained inactive ahead of the Bank of Japan's quarterly branch managers' meeting and the Group of Seven summit in Naples, and share prices gained moderate ground on small-lot buying in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average rose 88.52 to 20,631.93. Following a morning session in which the index saw a day's low of 20,573.21 and a high of 20,703.14, it stayed in a narrow trading range. Arbitrageurs, leading sellers during the previous week, took a breather as the yen's ascent, which depressed share prices, halted briefly yesterday. Uncertainty over a possible concerted interest rate move, incorporating a US increase, and falls in Germany and Japan, prevailed. Foreign investors were also absent, but domestic institutions and new investment trusts placed small-lot orders, and volume totalled 248m shares against 372m. The Topix index of all first section stocks moved up 10.57 to 1,672.73, while the Nikkei 300 put on 1.70 at 304.00. Advances led declines by 732 to 280, with 176 issues unchanged, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.81 to 1,356.99. Dealers bought back export-oriented high-technology issues, which faced selling due to the yen's strength. However, some shares which had risen last week on the portable telephone theme lost ground on profit-taking. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which rose sharply last week on hopes of a broader investor base following its planned listing on the London and New York stock exchanges, dipped Y9,000 to Y872,000 on profit-taking. DDI, the long distance telecom operator, declined Y100,000 to Y9.35m. However, Nitsuko, a telecom equipment maker, firmed Y20 to Y1,590 and Kyocera, DDI's top shareholder, added Y60 at Y7,500. Mitsubishi Oil, the most active issue of the day, gained Y40 at Y1,120. The company is seen as a beneficiary of the high yen due to its crude oil imports, while some investors continue to be bullish over the company's previous news of its oil well discovery in Vietnam. Mitsui Mining and Smelting, which gained ground recently on the rise in commodity prices, lost Y4 at Y416. In Osaka, the OSE average moved ahead 172.69 to 23,130.18 in volume of 15.2m shares. Roundup Most of the region had a quiet day, although one or two markets had their moments. SYDNEY fixed upon last Friday's late gains on Wall Street, and the All Ordinaries index rose 21.3 to 1,987.1. Resource stocks were the day's main winners, with the all resources index up 20.2 to 1,283.3. Turnover was ADollars 409m. Foster's Brewing topped turnover with 7.7m shares traded. The stock closed a cent firmer at ADollars 1.09. MIM Holdings, which climbed 4 cents to ADollars 2.90 in 3.5m shares dealt, was the most traded resource issue. The Australian Stock Exchange launched a new stock index called the ASX100 as part of a series of new indices which will be available by the end of the year. Mr Richard Humphry, ASX's managing director, told reporters that the new index, introduced in response to local institutions and managed funds, covers companies among the top 120 by market capitalisation, which have about 1 per cent of their stock traded per month. Mr Humprhry said that funds need a new benchmark: the All Ordinaries index covers 307 stocks, whereas many funds only invest in 30 or 40. WELLINGTON followed gains in Telecom and Fletcher Challenge, up 15 cents to NZDollars 4.68 and 11 cents to Dollars 3.77 respectively, the NZSE-40 index closing 26.45 higher at 2,009.79. SEOUL's composite index rose 12.93 to 951.23 after a rebound in blue chips. Brokers said that unfounded rumours of an expansion of foreign ownership in local stocks helped to boost the market. TAIPEI closed off its highs but the weighted index still ended 61.79, or 1 per cent, better at 6,067.63, after strong buying in electronics. Turnover rose to TDollars 64.42bn, from TDollars 40.96bn in Saturday's shortened session. HONG KONG's turnover shrank to an 18-month low, a preliminary HKDollars 1.30bn, against Friday's adjusted HKDollars 2.29bn and the lowest since HKDollars 954m on January 4, 1993. The Hang Seng index finished 6.09 down at 8,628.28. KARACHI fell sharply at the close on profit-taking before settlement today and on lack of institutional support. The KSE 100 index shed 23.98, or 1 per cent, to 2,314.93. Dewan Salman Fibre, up sharply before the 1994/95 budget, retreated Rs7.50 to Rs164 on profit-taking.</p>

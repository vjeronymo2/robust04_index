			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Elisabeth Crona report: "Aid for Bosnian Reconstruction"] </F>   [Text] Reykjavik -- At the same time as the situation in  Bosnia remains worrying, the Nordic foreign ministers at their  meeting in Iceland yesterday held concrete talks about life  after a peace agreement.    They discussed practical plans for reconstruction, and  social  aid -- something that has never been tried on a large scale  after a war.    Sweden has been making preparations for reconstruction  through the efforts of a group chaired by Foreign Minister Under  Secretary of State Lars-Ake Nilsson. The group has been working  very hard in the last few weeks.    The Swedish Government is hoping that there will be a unique  project involving coexistence, in which new ideas about conflict  resolution will be tested on the spot. Volunteer organizations  will play an important role.    These are therefore being invited to a seminar in Stockholm  later this month. The Helsinki committees, the Red Cross, Save  the Children, and other well-known organizations will take part.  But new approaches will also be tried.    "Perhaps the immigrant organizations in Sweden with their  special knowledge can help," Foreign Minister Margaretha af  Ugglas suggested.    "If we are to achieve any form of population return to the  region we have to try to create security, structures,  surveillance alongside economic aid."    Personally af Ugglas is somewhat pessimistic about the  prospects of peace soon. But the preparatory work for  reconstruction could in itself have a peace-building effect. It  could increase the sides' desire to reach a settlement, she said.    The Nordic countries are also discussing in concrete terms  which area they should adopt in particular in Bosnia in the  event of peace.    "For Sweden it is natural to think of the Tuzla region,"  Margaretha af Ugglas said. "That is where the Nordic battalion  located, and a multicultural society still exists there."    A problems for the Nordic area is, however, that it is not  represented in the top-level meetings on the former Yugoslavia,  despite the considerable involvement of Nordic troops in Bosnia.    That is why Sweden wants to attend the meeting of foreign  ministers in Geneva on 13 May, which was called by U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and will be attended by Britain, France,  and Germany as well as the EU [European Union].    "But since we are not members of the EU or NATO we have some  difficulty in being admitted to the core consultations, at which  the political decisions are reached," Foreign Minister af Ugglas  said.    In a joint statement issued after yesterday's meeting, the  Nordic foreign ministers gave a powerful indication of their  desire to play a larger political role in the peace negotiations  on the former Yugoslavia. Among other things, they referred to  their considerable contribution to UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] and expressed their support for the setting-up of a  contact group which would, together with the international  mediators, draft a proposal for a total cease-fire in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    They also proposed that an advisory group, composed of  countries contributing troops, should be attached to the  Security Council for every UN operation.    Behind the Nordic stance lies a dissatisfaction with the UN  leadership and with the disagreement between NATO and the United  Nations.</p>

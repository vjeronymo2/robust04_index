			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Observer: Tennis date Delegates to the Non-Aligned Movement conference have been making their entry to Jakarta in a variety of ways. The Iraqis arrived virtually unnoticed in an unmarked white airplane, while the Sultan of Brunei, the world's richest person, jetted in on his own jumbo. While most heads of state are staying in the Jakarta Hilton, the Sultan has opted for the Grand Hyatt, where he is understood to have rented a mere four floors. However, The Hilton will be missing another well-known guest. Libya's Colonel Gadaffi has decided to stay at home. This will be good news for tennis players since it will free up court Number four which had been reserved for his tent.</p>

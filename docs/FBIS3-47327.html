			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Regarding UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's report to the Security Council recommending a  stop to efforts to disarm the fighting forces in Somalia by the  use of force by UN troops, and switching to a more conventional  type of PKO [peacekeeping operations], a senior Foreign Ministry  official reacted calmly, claiming "this has been expected  because the United States and other countries have expressed  their wish to withdraw."    The government has, so far, shown understanding of the idea  of "peace enforcement force," although "due to constitutional  constraints, it would not be possible for Japan to participate."  As a nonpermanent member of the Security Council, Japan has  approved of the dispatch of forces to Somalia and the former  Yugoslavia.    Therefore, it is interesting to see how the report will  affect PKO in the former Yugoslavia, which has also been  authorized to take action as a peace enforcement force similar  to Somalia.    Some members of the Liberal Democratic Party and Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] believe that if it is under UN command,  Japan can also participate in peace enforcement forces.    However, right now, the government is even constrained in  its  participation in conventional PKO because the PKO Cooperation  Law freezes participation in UN peacekeeping forces (PKF). The  senior Foreign Ministry official said, "This report is not  expected to affect Japan's policy on PKO."    A more active debate on the use of force in PKO is expected  to occur in light of the Butrus-Ghali report. In anticipation  of a review of the PKO Cooperation Law in the future, this  report will certainly create a stir in the domestic debate on UN  intervention in regional conflicts.</p>

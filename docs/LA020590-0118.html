			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RJR NABISCO REPORTS LOSS IN '89, CITES COSTS OF BUYOUT  </P> <P> RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. today reported a loss for the final quarter and all  of 1989, reflecting the cost of going private through a $24.5-billion leveraged  buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.  </P> <P> For the three months ended Dec. 31, RJR Nabisco lost $144 million, compared  with a $411-million profit in the 1988 quarter.  </P> <P> Sales totaled $3.54 billion, unchanged from a year ago.  </P> <P> The consumer products giant lost $1.5 billion for the entire year and had sales  of $12.76 billion. That compared with a $1.4-billion profit the previous year  on $12.64 billion in sales.  </P> <P> RJR Nabisco blamed the negative results on significantly higher net interest  expenses, its decision to eliminate excess tobacco trade inventories and costs  related to the KKR acquisition, which was finalized in early 1989.  </P> <P> Despite the losses, which were expected, Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. said  the company was making fundamental improvements and had steady operating  results in its tobacco and food units.  </P> <P> The strength of the company's business, and in turn, its cash flow, is crucial  for the success of the buyout, which was accomplished partly through the sale  of $4 billion in junk bonds.  </P> <P> RJR Nabisco's products include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Winston  cigarettes.  </P> <P> </P></p>

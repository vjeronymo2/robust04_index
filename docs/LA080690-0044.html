			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: MIAMI GROUP WANTS EXPOS, OFFERS $117 MILLION  </P> <P> Montreal Expo owner Charles Bronfman has been offered $117.4 million for the  team by a Miami group, $30 million more than his asking price, but he is  continuing to search for a local buyer, according to a published report.  </P> <P> The Montreal Gazette reported Sunday that a Miami group is willing to make a  $30.4-million down payment on the team, which would move to Miami as soon as  construction on a new stadium is completed.  </P> <P> Bronfman has said that he wants to sell the team for about $87 million, but  would prefer to sell the franchise to a person or group who would keep the team  in Montreal. He has set an Aug. 31 deadline for offers from local groups.  </P> <P> Claude Brochu, the Expo president who has been given the job of finding a  buyer, said Saturday: "You've got a lot of agents and people involved in  something like this. It seems like everyone's come out of the woodwork, and  that includes people who just want to make a quick buck."  </P></p>

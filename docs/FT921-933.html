			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Falling trend shown in home repossessions MORTGAGE repossession orders issued by courts last month were down by nearly a quarter on their peak monthly levels last year. The figures, published by the Lord Chancellor's Department, were welcomed by the Council of Mortgage Lenders which said they showed a clearly declining trend in the number of people losing their homes because they were unable to keep up mortgage payments. The figures from the Lord Chancellor's Department show that in February lenders made 12,889 applications for repossession orders and 4,752 orders were issued. That compares with 13,453 applications and 5,408 orders in January. The January and February totals were well below those recorded between April and October last year. Repossessions peaked in July when there were almost 17,000 applications for eviction and 6,951 orders. About 75,500 people were evicted last year for failing to keep up mortgage payments. At the end of last year, 275,000 borrowers were six months or more in arrears and in danger of eviction. Last December the government and main mortgage lenders prepared measures intended to prevent a possible flood of repossessions. Mr Mark Boleat, CML director-general, yesterday warned that the Lord Chancellor's figures were a very inexact indicator of repossessions but said they suggested that, along with lower interest rates, the rescue measures were assisting the situation.</p>

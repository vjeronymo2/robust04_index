The imbalance toward the  south is disappearing and, with the accession of the north and  the east, the touch of Carolingian stuffiness is waning. Since  countries with tested national sovereignty are involved in the  further decisions, the form of a federation of states, of  cooperation of national states and their parliaments, is  beginning to dominate.    The old-established members of the EC scene in Brussels have  long predicted this development with regret, and they are not  wrong: With the geographic and mental expansion, the political  "deepening" of the Union becomes a rhetorical postulate without  any prospect for realization. At least the Scandinavians do not  have any inclination toward integration in the form of a federal  state. We are facing the end of the late romantic period.    With Finland, the Union gets 1,300 km of Russian border and  the proximity of the Baltic states -- with all the flair and all  the risk. In the case of Sweden, Norway, and Austria, the  single market, that is, the real economic and trade policy  advantage of the community, has the greatest attractiveness.  However, particularly Finland and Sweden hope for an increase  in security, at least in political support. With Austria, the  German language section of the EU is growing. However, more  important is its function as a bridge to Hungary, Slovenia, and  Croatia. Here, too, the Union, which has so far been oriented  toward West Europe, is going to receive a fruitful closeness to  the East.    Until the date of accession at the upcoming turn of the  year,  several obstacles -- both in substance and in terms of  referendums -- have to be overcome. These apply mainly to  Norway and Austria. In both countries the result of the  referendums is uncertain; in Finland and Sweden it is considered  relatively certain. Germany has pushed the membership  negotiations forward with great energy. As a result, It is  natural and unavoidable that it has not gained just friends in  the old European Community.</p>

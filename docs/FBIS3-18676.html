			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Javier Solana by </F> unidentified announcer; place not given -- live]    [Excerpt] [Announcer] Let us now talk about the European  Union, the Europe of the 15, with the agreements already  concluded with Finland, Sweden, and Austria. The central  question now is Norway's accession negotiations. Oslo's talks  with the Twelve will resume tomorrow, and on the table are  questions on which agreement is difficult, including our  country's dispute about fishing resources. Good evening,  Foreign Minister Solana.    [Solana] Good evening. How are you?    [Announcer] Tomorrow, or rather in a few hours time, you  will  be traveling to Brussels precisely for these negotiations. What  does the enlargement of Europe, of the European Union, mean, and  above all how will it affect our country?    [Solana] Look, basically it means getting a stronger Europe  from the political point of view: Three countries or four  countries, if Norway joins in the end, are joining, and they are  solid countries from the democratic point of view. And also a  stronger Europe economically, with regard to everything  concerned with the commercial life of Europe, because the  countries that are joining are economically prosperous.  Therefore, we have a greater ability to exert influence in the  world, politically and economically. And from Spain's viewpoint  it means opening new markets, and opening new markets basically  in areas to do with agriculture and fishing, if we achieve what  I believe we will achieve in the negotiations with Norway,  namely an increase in our fishing quota, basically cod.    [Announcer] Yes, Spanish fishermen are interested in  recovering that historical right to fish in Norwegian waters, as  you said, and Spain will therefore, now claim 7,000 tonnes of  fish as a historical quota -- which it ceased catching in 1981  when we Spaniards were expelled. Are we going to recover those  fishing grounds, and what is the Spanish position if Norway  sticks to its position of not giving in?    [Solana] Well, I want to speak very clearly to you, and  through you to the citizens and fishermen of Spain. We will  recover not only those 7,000 tonnes of cod that we are asking  for as a historical right, which we have not had since 1981, but  I believe that we will also be able to consolidate a further  3,000 or 4,000 tonnes of cod a year. And I want to say very  clearly that if we do not achieve this objective or something  close in the area of fishing we will not be able to celebrate  Norway's accession to the European Community, the European  Union. Spain is going to maintain a firm stance on this because  we believe that it is our right. Our right is that when other  countries join they too should open their markets.    [Announcer] Mr. Solana, let us change the subject and talk  about former Yugoslavia. Everything seems to indicate that the  warring parties in former Yugoslavia will have to live together.  It has also been made clear that the Americans and the Russians  have made their mark as powers once more. What role is the  European Union going to play in this conflict, then, and above  all, what is the Spanish position on sending more Blue Helmets?    [Solana] Basically you are asking three things. Firstly, I  believe, and hope and wish, that the peace process is spreading  now in the agreements between Croats and Muslims. I believe  that the understanding on Sarajevo will be a very important step  for peace, and I believe that it will be possible to give it a  final form. As you know, there was a fresh UN resolution  yesterday, even appointing a person to take charge of the  administration -- not the complete administration yet, but that  of the collective services of Sarajevo -- to imprint that sense  of peace.    Secondly, as for Russia and the United States, for many  months the European Community has been asking for Russia and the  United States to be involved, because it was very important when  it came to turning to peace -- or to war then, to peace now.  Russia has a very important role to play with the Serbs and we  knew that the United States had to play an important role with  the Bosnian Muslims, who needed the backing of the United States  in order to turn in the direction that they have just turned.    And thirdly, about further Blue Helmets. Spain has made and  is making a great effort. The normal thing is for us not to  send any more soldiers because we have already fulfilled our  obligations, we are fulfilling our obligations very well. But  if it were necessary, in extremis, I do not think that in any  case we could send more than what in military terms would be a  company or thereabouts. But it would be in an extreme case in  which the need of further forces by General Rose or the United  Nations were a requirement of great importance. [passage  omitted]</p>

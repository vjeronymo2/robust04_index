			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 23 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman  Demirel said on Saturday [23 April] that Turkey is sensitive and  careful on Cyprus issue, "there could not be anything that is  against Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' [TRNC]  constitution" he added.    Asked how he evaluated the U.S. President Bill Clinton's  words saying there will be important developments within two  days on Cyprus issue, Demirel said he did not know Clinton's  statement in detail but "I met TRNC's parliament speaker Halit  Acarkan and learned that they were discussing the issue of  confidence-building measures [CBM's]."    Acarkan earlier said the UN proposed CBM's for Cyprus have  been twisted to the advantage of the Greek Cypriot side.    He said his state was under great pressure to accept the  modified version of the CBM's.    The points included to the original package of July 1, 1993  are, giving the roads leading to the uninhabited Maras [Varosha]  section to the UN control; limitations to be imposed on all  planes registered in Turkey in the Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport  which will be opened to international traffic; customs  procedures to be conducted by an official to be appointed by the  United Nations to Lefkose Airport and Maras; and the violation  of the principle that both sides will enjoy equal advantages.    Demirel said everyone should accept the two separate  communities and that these two are the extensions of two  different nations, should have everything separated, and it is  not possible to reach a solution by being forced to live  together.    The president said he will visit Egypt in May and he may  also  visit Bosnia-Herzegovina to contribute to the peace efforts  there.    Demirel also said he will meet political party leaders on  May  4 and discuss the problems of Turkey.</p>

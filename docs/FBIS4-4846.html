			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa voiced hope Monday [4 April] that the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will play a more  prominent role in studying structural problems facing the world,  a Foreign Ministry official said. Hosokawa made the comment in  a 15-minute meeting with OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye  at his official residence, the official said.    Paye agreed it was a good idea to compare notes on problems  shared by OECD members and strive together to overcome them, the  official said. The OECD chief, who is French, said growth and  employment will be at the top of the agenda of OECD's council  meeting in June.    Paye also spoke of the need to strengthen ties between OECD  and nonmember countries, the official said.    As he was leaving the premier's official residence, Paye  described his talk with Hosokawa as "interesting and friendly."    He also told KYODO News Service, "He (Hosokawa) told me  about  his intent to go on with a program of reform, which is very  important for the further success of Japan."    Paye, who arrived in Japan on Sunday for a four-day visit,  conferred earlier Monday with the ministers responsible for  trade, labor and agriculture.    On Tuesday, Paye is to have talks with the chief of the  Science and Technology Agency, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii,  Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno and leaders of the  Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren).</p>

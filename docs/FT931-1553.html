			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Sites already chosen for vast cut-price malls: Factory outlet units sell branded goods at heavily discounted rates - Two cut-price US retailing concepts that could change British shopping are on their way FACTORY outlet malls have taken the US by storm. From a near standing start 10 years ago, the US now has 270, with 160 in the pipeline, according to research group Corporate Intelligence. The concept is still at a rudimentary stage in the UK. There are more than 1,100 small one-off factory clearance outlets, mainly attached to the plant. Large malls, in which a number of outlets are clustered together, are relatively new. The idea was pioneered in the UK in the late 1980s by the Hornsea Retail and Leisure Park in Humberside. It is owned by Peter Black Holdings, a diversified manufacturing group. The centre, including a model village and adventure playground, has units occupied by manufacturers such as Wrangler, Aquascutum and Knickerbox selling at prices generally a third lower than in the high street. In Street, Somerset, C. &amp; J. Clark, the footwear manufacturer, is building a purpose-built outlet complex next to its headquarters. The most ambitious plans for the expansion of factory outlets in the UK have stemmed from three US-led development consortiums and a couple of UK operators. Value Retail, a consortium of SD Malkin Properties and Chelsea Group of the US and Argent Group and London &amp; Metropolitan of the UK, says it plans ten 150,000 sq ft outlets on motorway corridors. McArthur/Glen, another ambitious US operator, is looking for 25 outlets across Europe, starting with the UK. Prime Group of America, with Richardson Developments and Tarmac, have identified their first locations - a former British Rail works at Swindon, due to begin construction this autumn, and Fort Dunlop in Birmingham. Factory Outlet Shopping Centres, a UK developer, is seeking to convert a building in the West Midlands and one in Croydon, south London. The appeal of the UK to these developers is that the recession has heightened demand for value-for-money and increased manufacturers' problems with end-of-line or returned stock. Some commentators are sceptical about the prospects for this concept in the UK. The appeal to British shoppers of buying last year's fashions from out-of-town malls is largely untested. Manufacturers are concerned about the risk of diluting their brands' image and damaging relations with retailers. Factory outlet developers insist they will create new demand rather than competing for existing shoppers. 'It is opportunistic shopping,' says Mr Scott Malkin, chief executive of SD Malkin. Resistance from retailers, and difficulties in getting funds and planning permission, may limit the number of factory malls. But they may benefit from the growing price-consciousness of consumers.</p>

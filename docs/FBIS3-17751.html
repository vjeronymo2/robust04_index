Thus, factual natural gas supplies over the above period  amounted to 2,445.2 million cu. m. [cubic meters] versus the  expected figure of 1,606.8 million cu. m.    Turkmenistan's natural gas exports to Ukraine, which were  stopped on February 22, have not been resumed, the negotiation  process underway notwithstanding. Turkmenistan is reported as  adamant in its decision not to resume its natural gas supplies  to Ukraine before Ukraine has repaid its debt for Turkmen  natural gas supplies in 1993.    Under the thus repudiated agreement the Central Asian nation  was to supply 1,087.1 million cu. m. of natural gas to  Ukrgazprom during the 11-24 March period.    As a result of an agreement, which the Ukrainian [word  indistinct] reached with Russia's Gazprom joint-stock society on  10 March, the Russian party undertook to supply additional  natural gas to Ukraine in amounts sufficient to temporarily  offset about 80 per cent of what Turkmenistan would have  supplied to Ukraine, had it not discontinued natural gas exports  to Ukraine.    The agreement will remain effective until 10 April, when  Russia and Ukraine are supposed to hold talks about their  account settling. Gazprom is reported to have laid down its  terms, which the two [word indistinct] have refused to make  public, though. It has been tipped off, however, that the  Ukrainian party has been discussing not only a compromise  decision, but also its likely having to accept the Russian  party's terms, if the former variant proves impossible.    According to Ukrgazprom, the Russian party has been sticking  to its temporary commitment almost fully and unswervingly having  supplied additional 837.4 million cu. m. of natural gas  between 11 and 24 March, which is about 77.2 per cent of the  amount Ukraine was supposed to be supplied by Turkmenistan.    Ukraine's natural gas consumption over the same period was  4,096.8 million cu. m. versus the expected figure 4,747.4  million cu. m., according to Ukrgazprom, due both to the warmer  weather conditions and more stringent fuel- and power saving  moves by the government along with some enterprises having  transferred to alternative fuels.    As spokespersons of the Ukrainian State Committee for oil  and  gas maintain, despite these temporarily stabilized natural gas  supplies to Ukraine, the overall situation remains rather  precarious because of Ukraine's faulty and inefficient fuel  clearance system and the fuel consumers' formidable domestic  indebtedness. Moreover so, that the outcome of the 10 April  talks with Russia is too hard to predict.</p>

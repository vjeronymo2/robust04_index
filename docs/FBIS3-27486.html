			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Yan Zhixiang, deputy director of the Civil Aviation  General Administration of China, today called on the civil  aviation industry to bring about an improvement in safety in  1994 and to put a stop to serious flight accidents.    Yan Zhixiang made the above remarks at today's national work  conference on civil aviation's flight safety. He said this year  the character "strictness" will be emphasized in civil  aviation's safety work. He called for practising strict  management, for formulating strict rules and standards, for  strict enforcement of discipline, and for applying the character  of "strictness" in all areas of the civil aviation work. Under  the condition of a fierce market competition, he called on all  to guard against the tendency of only paying attention to  development to the neglect of safety; to overcome the tendency  of stressing production management to the neglect of safety; to  overcome the tendency of stressing efficiency to the neglect of  safety; and to give safety top priority at all time.    Yan Zhixiang pointed out the need to adopt resolute  organizational measures against units which are poorly managed,  which are poorly led, and which are beset with serious safety  problems and to sternly call to account the leaders of those  units. In the future, he said, one of the main criteria for  evaluating and promoting cadres should be made to evaluate their  attaching importance to the safety work and to their ability to  do a good safety work.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WINNING HAND;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FORMER BURROUGHS QUARTERBACK JEFF BARRETT LEFT RENO AND  REVERSED HIS LUCK AT SANTA MONICA.  </P> <P> The prodigal son has turned into one prodigious son of a gun.  </P> <P> Jeff Barrett, a prodigy at Burroughs High who spent an unfulfilling freshman  year at the University of Nevada Reno, has led Santa Monica City College to an  8-2 record and a berth in the Western State bowl game opposite Moorpark at  Moorpark College. Game time is 7:30 tonight.  </P> <P> Along the way he has done a Kilroy job on the school record book -- his name  pops up everywhere.  </P> <P> Barrett, a 5-foot-11, 185-pound sophomore, has set six school career records  and five single-season marks. He has 165 completions in 266 attempts and has  set school records for consecutive 200-plus-yard games (10), passing yards in a  season (2,648) and touchdown passes in a season (26). He led state quarterbacks  in passing efficiency with a 168.1 rating, ranked fourth in total offense and  tied for third in touchdown passes.  </P> <P> His high school career was similarly remarkable. With 6,083 career passing  yards, he ranks behind only Todd Marinovich, Pat Haden, Bret Johnson and Dan  McGwire on the all-time Southern Section yardage list.  </P> <P> Yet when Marinovich and Johnson headed off to USC and UCLA, Barrett, who was in  the same year in school, decided to try his luck at Nevada Reno. And, like many  people who go to Reno, he lost.  </P> <P> In football, he redshirted. As a native Southern Californian, he was out of his  environment off the field. The "Biggest Little City in the World" seemed like  just a little city to Barrett.  </P> <P> "I guess I went through a culture shock," Barrett said. "I wasn't used to  seeing guys wearing cowboy boots all the time and having gun racks in their  truck."  </P> <P> Barrett tried to make the best of a bad situation. Sneaking into casinos --  "there's no way we looked 21," Barrett said -- Barrett and his roommate learned  that if the dealer knocked twice on the table it was time to outrun house  security.  </P> <P> During one snowstorm, Barrett and his roommate went to a grocery store at 4  a.m., bought a sled and proceeded to careen around the middle of campus in the  dark.  </P> <P> "We had to make ourselves be happy, have fun," Barrett said.  </P> <P> Ultimately, though, Barrett realized he would have to fold his hand. The summer  after his freshman year he called the school to say he would not return.  </P> <P> "Once I got off that phone, my whole body was shaking," Barrett said. "It felt  like this huge weight was lifted off my back, and I could start my life over  again."  </P> <P> After considering Valley and Glendale, Barrett followed the lead of Todd Deeds,  a Reno teammate Barrett described as "my security blanket." Deeds had gone to  Santa Monica and he steered Barrett in the same direction.  </P> <P> It took Barrett a while to thaw from his time in Reno. He watched tapes of his  high school games in an attempt to regain his confidence and "prove to myself  that I could play quarterback again." He alternated quarters last season with  Ernie Soto but still managed to throw for 1,510 yards.  </P> <P> This season, Barrett was named Western State Conference offensive player of the  week three times and was chosen WSC Southern Division offensive player of the  year as well as an honorable mention All-American.  </P> <P> "He's our bread and butter," wide receiver Jason Lucky said. "He's our offense.  Without him we wouldn't be anywhere."  </P> <P> It has been a year of living dangerously for Barrett. He has been sacked 15  times, but the number is deceptive because his release allows him to unload the  ball a wink before he can be tackled.  </P> <P> He has never missed a game because of injury, but late in the season Barrett  went to his backup and told him to get ready to play.  </P> <P> "I thought I was getting too worn out," Barrett said. He had slacked off in his  weight training, and a team can be a heavy burden to carry.  </P> <P> Barrett persevered and finished the season cum laude.  </P> <P> An Ivy League aspirant, he already has his Associate of Arts degree. He reads  pass defenses like other people read comic strips. He describes himself as not  the most physically talented "but a little smarter than most."  </P> <P> The Santa Monica coaching staff places an enormous amount of responsibility on  Barrett; he is able to call an audible for virtually every play the team runs.  </P> <P> "It's not apparent when you're watching the game, but he gets you out of a lot  of bad plays," Santa Monica co-Coach Owen Hahn said. "We have a very nice  audible system, which can be as complex as the guy running it. He plays the  whole piano, all 88 keys."  </P> <P> Barrett left the Moorpark defense feeling like a player piano after Moorpark  eked out a 44-38 victory two months ago. He threw for a career-high 376 yards,  completing 19 of 35 passes for four touchdowns. The game, which had seven lead  changes, turned into a series of can-you-top-this gambits between Barrett and  Moorpark tailback Freddie Bradley.  </P> <P> Moorpark's basic pass defense is the cover-three, a zone designed to give  ground grudgingly through short gains. Barrett, however, turned Moorpark's  cover-three into more of a duck and cover.  </P> <P> "I thought we won the game," Barrett said. "Of course, I hope they play  cover-three. . . . There's a lot things I didn't do in that game which I'll  probably do this game."  </P> <P> The game will be his last for Santa Monica but probably not his last as a  college quarterback. Barrett hopes to go back east, and the University of  Pennsylvania is showing interest.  </P> <P> Barrett is ready to go. He and his wife of five months, Kim, plan to be at his  new school by January.  </P> <P> This time when he goes it may not be for good, but it should be better.  </P></p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 1.9 per cent after bleak earnings reports SENTIMENT deteriorated yesterday after bleak earnings reports, and share prices lost ground on small-lot profit-taking and index-linked selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average ended 350.36, or 1.9 per cent, down at 18,204.64. It had opened at the day's high of 18,519.67, falling to a low of 18,203.53 in the afternoon. Volume picked up a little from 189m shares to 200m. Dealers remained on the sidelines on the final trading day for May delivery, while most investors waited for corporate results. Mr Kaoru Shimura at Sumitomo Life, a leading life insurer, said current price levels were too high to buy, but too low for profit-taking. Declines led advances by 581 to 342, with 193 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 11.87 to 1,371.83, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.96 to 1,085.16. Towards the close, the Nikkei's downswing was accelerated by selling pressure in the futures market, which prompted arbitrage-unwinding. Traders said market participants have started to become cautious towards next month's expiry of the June futures. Mr Richard Clayton at County NatWest said low liquidity in the September contract could affect the rolling over of arbitrage positions. Speculative theme stocks remained firm, with Morinaga Milk Industry, the most active issue of the day, rising Y8 to Y860. Okamoto Industries advanced Y40 to Y1,390. Trust banks, which announced weak results for the past fiscal year, retreated. Pre-tax profits at the seven trust banks fell by 34 per cent, due to thinner profit margins and sharp falls in commission revenues. Some trust banks announced cuts in dividends, and investors have become wary of their deteriorating loan portfolios. Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking fell Y31 to Y830. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone receded Y9,000 to Y633,000. The company posted a 15 per cent decline in unconsolidated pre-tax profits for the last fiscal year, and forecast that profits will drop 24 per cent to Y267bn for the current year to March 1993. Electronics issues, which have reported sluggish earnings with some companies expecting a slow recovery, lost ground. Sharp, which expects a 7 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the current year, fell Y70 to Y1,260. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 44.98 to 20,911.50 in volume of 12.7m shares. Small-lot profit-taking amid low volume depressed share prices. Nintendo lost Y200 to Y10,800. Roundup MARKET rumours lifted Hong Kong and Singapore yesterday in a mixed day for the region. HONG KONG broke through 6,000 and stayed there this time, hitting a third record high in four days as the Hang Seng index rose 58.97 to 6,052.08. Turnover was again strong, totalling HKDollars 5.7bn after Monday's record HKDollars 6.4bn. One stimulus was the rumour that Hong Kong Land, the colony's premier landlord, had sold one of its office buildings in the central business district for a price above market value. The company declined to comment but the stock rose 40 cents to HKDollars 13.30, and its parent, Jardine Matheson, gained HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 59.50. SINGAPORE was subject to widespread rumours that interest rates may be lowered by another 0.25 of a percentage point, and the Straits Times Industrial index closed 23.34, or 1.6 per cent, higher at 1,494.29 as turnover jumped from SDollars 70m to SDollars 159m. Traders were surprised by the strength of the market, which grew in intensity towards the last hour. This prompted the belief that buying came from UK funds. MANILA rose as the market looked forward to the likely victory of former defence secretary Mr Fidel Ramos in the presidential elections which took place on May ll. The composite index added 8.07 at 1,440.91 after Monday's 53-point climb. BANGKOK fell as investors waited for a new coalition government to take shape following the resignation as prime minister of Mr Suchinda Kraprayoon. The SET index relinquished 12.84, or 1.7 per cent, to 729.58 in moderate turnover of Bt3.9bn. TAIWAN lost ground after midsession when selling pressure was triggered by falls in many of the small, speculatively oriented shares which had played a leading role in the market's recent rally. The weighted index dropped 94.33, or 2 per cent, to 4,540.00. AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index dipped 9.9 to 1,674.2 in turnover of ADollars 158m, compared with Monday's ADollars 143m. Brokers said investors were waiting for today's ANZ Banking half-year results. BOMBAY had a dull day. After the scandals which have rocked Indian equity markets recently, a lack of initiative yesterday was reflected in a fall in the BSE index of 106.55 to 3,298.74. Volume was described as poor, with only limited institutional interest.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-SEMITIC TIDE PERILOUS, PRAVDA SAYS;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: PARTY PAPER WARNS THAT RAPIDLY GROWING PREJUDICE UNDERMINES  POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS.  </P> <P> Anti-Semitism is growing rapidly in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party  newspaper Pravda acknowledged Sunday, and it now threatens to undermine the  country's political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> Pravda denounced not only the open anti-Semitism of groups on the far right,  such as the nationalistic Pamyat, which blame Jews for all the country's  problems past and present, but also that of Russian nationalists who use  anti-Semitism in their efforts to revive Russian culture.  </P> <P> "This unprecedented anti-Semitism is of great concern because we face an  attempt to disrupt the process of social consolidation," Pravda said in an  article signed by a Soviet historian, S. Rogov. "A law-based state must protect  people of every nationality."  </P> <P> In one of the strongest official warnings against anti-Semitism, the newspaper  said that the country, if it aspires to democracy, cannot quietly content  itself with the expectation that the "Jewish question," a term that itself has  an anti-Semitic undertone here, will be solved when the country's 1.9 million  Jews have emigrated.  </P> <P> Pravda, in a break from official assessments in the past, argued that the  problem is much broader than acknowledged up to now and that it affects the  whole of Soviet society and its efforts at political, economic and social  reforms.  </P> <P> Despite repeated warnings over the past year and a half from the Jewish  communities in Moscow, Leningrad and other major Jewish centers in the country,  Soviet officials have been unwilling to recognize the rapid, even frightening  growth in anti-Semitism and its implications for the country.  </P> <P> Even when foreign leaders, including President Bush and Secretary of State  James A. Baker III, have raised the question, Soviet officials have done little  more than to speak of "social tensions" as a result of the country's severe  economic problems.  </P> <P> Pravda, although approaching the issue in terms of the "Jewish question,"  Zionism and emigration, went well beyond the previous official position to  report, in unambiguously critical terms, the growth of anti-Semitism and the  threat it represents.  </P> <P> "A large number of extremist groups have appeared in the country," the paper  said. "Pamyat and the like are openly reviving anti-Semitism as a means of  their struggle against perestroika. They use such classic falsifications as the  'Protocols of the Elders of Zion,' which had been fabricated by the Czarist  police.  </P> <P> "Again and again, they exploit the myth of the 'Yid-Mason-Bolshevik conspiracy'  against Russia. Jews are being blamed for killing the Czar's family and the  Stalinist repressions, the forced collectivization, the corruption of the  national culture and the destruction of the ecology.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, political anti-Semitism is being cultivated by a number of  literary publications as well. Every issue runs odious speculations. For the  first time in our history, anti-Semitism has become quite popular in some  intellectual circles."  </P> <P> Asking why anti-Semitism could not simply be outlawed, Pravda contended that  this could also be used as an argument for banning Zionism as "a rejection of a  democratic solution for the Jewish question in a multinational state."  </P> <P> "That is why we cannot 'ban' criticism of the Zionist ideology," the paper  said, "and why provocative activities of openly anti-Soviet, pro-fascist  movements (such as the Jewish Defense League of Meir Kahane) cannot enjoy  immunity either."  </P> <P> However, Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation, the largest  of the Soviet republics, said last month that he favors legislation outlawing  anti-Semitism and those organizations that promote it.  </P> <P> "We will have to pass a law to put a barrier before those organizations that  tend to develop in fascist directions," Yeltsin said. "That is absolutely  inadmissible."  </P> <P> A major result of the growth of anti-Semitism has been to encourage Soviet Jews  to emigrate at an ever-faster pace, the article said, forecasting that Jewish  emigration this year will run between 200,000 and 300,000. In the first half of  1990, 50,000 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel, according to reports from  Jerusalem, and the projected total for the year is 165,000.  </P> <P> "The number of visa applications is growing," Pravda said. "One cannot but see  that the fear of pogroms is acquiring the scale of a panic. Visa documents are  being issued for people who are far from sharing the ideas of political  Zionism.  </P> <P> "The problem cannot and should not be solved through mass emigration. The  Jewish question should be solved democratically in the Soviet Union. This  should not impede natural assimilation or threaten Jewish culture or prevent  Jews from going to Israel or any other state. Jewish cultural institutions  should, meanwhile, develop freely and democratically to satisfy the natural  ethnic requirements of Soviet Jews."  </P></p>

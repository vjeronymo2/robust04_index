By signing and submitting this proposal, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective primary participant is providing the certification set out below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The inability of a person to provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification required below will not necessarily result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denial of participation in this covered transaction. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective participant shall submit an explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out below. The certification or explanation will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered in connection with the department or agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination whether to enter into this transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, failure of the prospective primary participant to furnish a certification or an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explanation shall disqualify such person from participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The certification in this clause is a material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the department or agency determined to enter into this transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If it is later determined that the prospective primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to other remedies available to the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for cause or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> default.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The prospective primary participant shall provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate written notice to the department or agency to whom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary participant learns that its certification was erroneous when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The terms ``covered transaction,'' ``debarred,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``suspended,'' ``ineligible,'' ``lower tier covered transaction,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``participant,'' ``person,'' ``primary covered transaction,'' ``principal,'' ``proposal,'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``voluntarily excluded,'' as used in this clause, have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage sections of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contact the department or agency to which this proposal is being submitted for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The prospective primary participant agrees by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitting this proposal that, should the proposed covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction be entered into, it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a person who is debarred, suspended, declared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this covered transaction, unless authorized by the department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or agency entering into this transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The prospective primary participant further agrees by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitting this proposal that it will include the clause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> titled ``Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion_Lower Tier Covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transaction,'' provided by the department or agency entering into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this covered transaction, without modification, in all lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tier covered transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective participant in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower tier covered transaction that it is not debarred,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines the eligibility of its principals. Each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participant may, but is not required to, check the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonprocurement List.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information of a participant is not required to exceed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ordinary course of business dealings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these instructions, if a participant in a covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction with a person who is suspended, debarred,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to other remedies available to the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government, the department or agency may terminate this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction for cause or default.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters_Primary Covered Transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The prospective primary participant certifies to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> best of its knowledge and belief, that it and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principals:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from covered transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by any Federal department or agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Have not within a three-year period preceding this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against them for commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State or local)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction or contract under a public transaction; violation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Federal or State antitrust statutes or commission of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making false statements, or receiving stolen property;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Are not presently indicted for or otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Federal, State or local) with commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (1)(b) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this certification; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Have not within a three-year period preceding this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application/proposal has one or more public transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Federal, State or local) terminated for cause or default.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Where the prospective primary participant is unable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to certify to any of the statements in this certification,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such prospective participant shall attach an explanation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

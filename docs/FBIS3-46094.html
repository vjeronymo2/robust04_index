The title-conferring ceremony was presided over by Zhou  Qishun, vice chairman of the autonomous regional committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and  secretary of the party committee of the autonomous regional  public security department.    Guo Jinlong, Yang Chuantang, and Gyamco, leaders of the  autonomous region; leaders of the TRPAPC; and principal leaders  of the Tibet-based units at and above the regimental level  participated in the ceremony.    Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional  party committee and chairman of the autonomous regional people's  government, read out a promotion order signed by State Council  Premier Li Peng and Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang  Zemin, and delivered a speech on behalf of the autonomous  regional party committee and the autonomous regional people's  government.    Comrade Gyaincain Norbu said that Comrade Zhang Zhu's  promotion to the police title of major general was an honor not  only to himself but also to the TRPAPC. On behalf of the  autonomous regional party committee and the autonomous regional  people's government, he offered warm congratulations to Comrade  Zhang Zhu.    In his speech Chairman Gyaincain Norbu spoke highly of  Political Commissar Zhang Zhu as well as all the officers and  men of the TRPAPC. He said: As a political commissar of the  TRPAPC and as a leader of units construction, Comrade Zhang Zhu  resolutely implemented the party's line, principles, and  policies; carried out various instructions and orders issued by  the TRPAPC and the regional party committee; always placed the  units under the absolute leadership of the party; united and led  members of the party committee to vigorously tackle various  construction jobs of the units; and did an outstanding job  fulfilling the various tasks entrusted by the party and people.  In particular, in the struggle to quell the riots in Lhasa and  to stabilize Tibet's situation, Comrade Zhang Zhu led all the  officers and men in taking a clear-cut stand, standing in the  forefront of the fight against splittism, and waging a resolute  struggle against splittist forces, thereby making remarkable  contributions to safeguarding the unification of the motherland  and to stabilizing Tibet's situation. The autonomous regional  party committee, the autonomous regional people's government,  and the people of all nationalities in Tibet are satisfied with  the work done by the TRPAPC and Comrade Zhang Zhu. He urged  Comrade Zhang Zhu to live up to the ardent expectations of the  party and people, to turn honor into a driving force, to better  unite and lead all the officers and men of the TRPAPC to conduct  intensive study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics to seek unity of thinking  among officers and men, and to persist in using Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's thought on army building in the new period to guide  the construction of the units so as to make new contributions to  protecting Tibet's economic construction, reform, and opening  up.

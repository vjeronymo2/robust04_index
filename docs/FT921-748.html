			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Collor confirms Brazil to back coffee quotas BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT Fernando Collor de Mello said yesterday that his country supported talks on a new international coffee agreement with economic clauses and export quotas, reports Reuter from Brasilia. Asked during a breakfast with foreign correspondents in Brasilia whether Brazil supported a new coffee pact with economic clauses and quotas, he replied: 'Yes, with quotas. But the details of the economic clauses will be discussed in the London meeting.' Brazil, the world's leading coffee producer, will meet other world producers and consumers for talks at the International Coffee Organisation in London early next month. Collor's remarks are the first official confirmation that Brazil will back talks on a pact with export quotas.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> SHAPING NEW EUROPE A COMPLEX, HISTORIC TASK;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: EAST GERMANY'S VOTE INCREASES PRESSURE. THE RUSH TO UNITY MAY BE  MORE DISRUPTIVE THAN EXPECTED.  </P> <P> The surprise landslide victory by East Germany's moderate-right alliance in  weekend elections puts more pressure on strategists already facing a task of  historic complexity: shaping institutions of European integration and security  to replace the outdated structures of the Cold War era.  </P> <P> The process has been compared in its importance to the Congress of Vienna in  1815, which reordered a Continent left adrift by the collapse of the Napoleonic  empire and molded its future for decades.  </P> <P> Modern architects of the "new Europe" taking shape after last year's round of  revolutions in the former East Bloc already faced the additional challenge of  having their work covered live on television.  </P> <P> And now, since East Germany's victorious Alliance for Germany campaigned on the  promise of rapid unification, the timetable for German reunification, one of  the three most crucial elements in the strategic equation, may be faster and  potentially more disruptive than both the United States and the Soviet Union,  among others, had expected.  </P> <P> There was already widespread agreement that a meeting of the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe, planned for late this year, would be a  useful forum in which to discuss "some sort of new security structure for  Europe," noted James Eberle, director of London's Royal Institute of  International Affairs, in an interview Monday.  </P> <P> The conference includes all the European countries, except Albania, as well as  the United States and Canada.  </P> <P> Now, Eberle said, "there will be a renewed pressure to define the agenda for  that conference rather more carefully and closely, and (to) bring up proposals  that will be discussed as part of that meeting."  </P> <P> The East German election results also lend new urgency to the problem of  interim arrangements for the five years or so that it will take to negotiate a  longer-term security solution, Eberle commented.  </P> <P> Those arrangements are part of the agenda of the "two-plus-four" talks under  which the two Germanys are negotiating international aspects of reunification  with the four major victorious powers of World War II -- the United States,  Soviet Union, Britain and France.  </P> <P> "German unity has a potential of dividing the world or bringing it closer  together," said Michael Sturmer, director of West Germany's Research Institute  for International Affairs in Ebenhausen.  </P> <P> Referring to the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he added,  "Germany will make the difference between NATO reform and NATO breakup; between  continuing East-West detente or a new confrontation, between an Atlantic  security framework for the European Community or European impotence."  </P> <P> Beneath the high-sounding verbiage, the talk here about a "new Europe" deals  with fundamental questions of war and peace, of poverty and prosperity.  </P> <P> And it touches importantly on the debate in the United States over the  so-called peace dividend from the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, a  debate that Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) told London's Sunday Times will "determine  the political and economic future of the country for 25 years."  </P> <P> The Cold War may have created a balance of terror on the Continent, but it did  yield a sort of stability. Now, if NATO and the Warsaw Pact become increasingly  irrelevant, what institutions can prevent antagonism between two countries such  as Hungary and Romania from getting out of control? What other mechanism would  allow the nations of Europe to coordinate a response to an attack on one of  their number by a Libya or an Iran?  </P> <P> Not only must any new or remodeled institutions pass the difficult test of  keeping a united Germany committed to its integration in the democratic family  of European nations, European strategists say; they must also minimize the  continental aftershocks from the possible disintegration of an increasingly  unstable Soviet Union. And they must maintain the stabilizing presence of the  United States on the Continent against any temptation that Washington may  entertain to withdraw in the same way it did after World War I.  </P> <P> The most urgent specific question facing the architects of the new Europe  following Sunday's elections is the status of a united Germany in NATO. But it  is far from the only one.  </P> <P> Other alliance members and even a majority of the rival Warsaw Pact now say  that a united Germany in NATO is either essential or at least preferable to  German neutrality.  </P> <P> The Soviets say they want a neutral Germany and insist that NATO membership for  a united state is unacceptable. However, in a possible sign of Kremlin  flexibility, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said after an inconclusive  Warsaw Pact meeting in Prague last Saturday that "this is a question which  requires further discussion and clarification."  </P> <P> Some analysts believe that the Soviets are holding out for a neutral Germany as  a bargaining chip to be traded for Western concessions on other guarantees to  its security.  </P> <P> But even if the Kremlin finally agrees to NATO membership for a united Germany,  it will be at best a temporary reprieve, according to Zbigniew Brzezinski, who  was President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser.  </P> <P> "It's almost inevitable," Brzezinski told Czechoslovakia's Institute of  International Relations in Prague late last week, "that Germany will insist on  changing its status from that of a military partner in NATO to that of only a  political participant . . . . Germany, some 50 years after (World War II) will  insist that it no longer wishes to be, in effect, a quasi-occupied country."  That would lead to the departure of both Soviet and Western forces from its  soil, he said.  </P> <P> That prospect, Brzezinski added, points up the importance of "designing added,  all-European security arrangements." He argued that it is "counterproductive to  advocate a slowing down in the process of German unification. . . . Rather than  try to delay the unification of Germany, it is far more sensible to accelerate  the process of creating an international framework for the new Germany."  </P> <P> While West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday depicted German  reunification as forcing the pace of European unity, others raised doubts about  its impact on the European Community's drive toward economic and monetary  integration.  </P> <P> The British Broadcasting Corp.'s Ceefax news service quoted Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher on Monday as saying that a long transition would be required  before what is today East Germany is drawn into the European Community. She  said that subsidized goods could not be allowed to flood into the Common Market  for fear of undermining Western businesses and that there would have to be  major changes to the community's agriculture and fisheries policies.  </P> <P> Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens had warned previously that the European  Community is in danger of "unraveling" under the pressure of the revolutions in  Eastern Europe. And Jacques Delors, president of the community's Executive  Commission, has described himself as "haunted by anxiety as well as by hope"  over the impact of German reunification on the European integration process.  </P> <P> The heads of government of the community's 12 members have called a special  summit meeting April 28 in Dublin, Ireland, to discuss the implications of  German unification on the community.  </P> <P> "A society only has a certain amount of political resources that can be  concentrated on internal or external problems," commented John Roper,  director-designate of the West European Union's new Institute for Security  Studies. So what he calls the "deepening" of European union "may take second  place to matters of inner-German development in the next five years."  </P> <P> That doesn't mean European integration will be reversed, Roper stressed. But it  does suggest that "we won't be able to accelerate the process."  </P></p>

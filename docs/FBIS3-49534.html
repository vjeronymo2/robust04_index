			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ivo Hlavacek, the director of the legal and consular  department in the Slovak Foreign Affairs Ministry, handed over  to Jenoe Boros, the Hungarian charge d'affaires, in Bratislava  today a written statement in which the ministry expresses its  concern over the activity of the Hungarian governmental office  for Hungarian minorities abroad. The specific reason for the  ministry's concern is that this office drafted and disseminated  in foreign diplomatic circles information on the so-called  Komarno initiative that takes matters out of context and,  according to our ministry, is nonobjective and misleading. The  Foreign Ministry said Slovakia did all it could to meet specific  obligations it had accepted on joining the Council of Europe.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRESS ON FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY URGED BY GOVERNORS  </P> <P> A governors' task force on Saturday urged that all college graduates be  conversant in a foreign language as part of a broad effort to make the United  States more competitive in world trade.  </P> <P> Task force chairman Gov. Thomas H. Kean (R-N.J.), who next year will become  president of Drew University in Madison, N.J., personally recommended that  proficiency in a second language be a requirement to graduate, although his  group's formal report did not go that far.  </P> <P> "Obviously, you do these things gradually," Kean said at a news conference  launching a four-day meeting of the nation's governors on a wide range of  issues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suggests Numerous Ways  </P> <P> The task force, suggesting numerous ways to beef up the teaching of languages  and geography, urged that "an international focus" be incorporated in "the  entire curriculum."  </P> <P> Gov. Gerald L. Baliles (D-Va.), chairman of the National Governors' Assn.,  asked during an appearance with Kean: "How are we to sell our products in a  global economy when we neglect to learn the languages of the customer?  </P> <P> "How are we to open overseas markets when other cultures are only dimly  understood? How are our firms to provide international leadership when our  schools are producing insular students?"  </P> <P> The task force report suggested that states:  </P> <P>  -- Require elementary and high school students to study world cultures and  history.  </P> <P>  -- Include geography and world history in statewide tests of school and  student performance.  </P> <P>  -- Offer foreign languages as early as first grade.  </P> <P>  -- Offer foreign languages during the summer, after school and on weekends.  </P> <P>  -- Provide in-service training for teachers in both international studies and  foreign languages.  </P> <P>  -- Have teacher certification programs test for international awareness.  </P> <P>  -- Augment textbooks with other materials, such as maps, travel books,  newspapers, videotapes and even stamps.  </P> <P>  -- Use technology innovatively, such as linking U.S. students by telephone  with those in other countries.  </P> <P>  -- Increase language and social studies requirements for admission to college.  </P> <P>  -- Require an international element in all college majors, particularly in  business school.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cites Progress  </P> <P> While generally bemoaning the lack of what it called "international education,"  the report did note some recent progress.  </P> <P> Two-thirds of four-year colleges require graduates to meet a foreign language  requirement, it noted, although only one-sixth of these schools require a  language course for admission.  </P> <P> Also, more than half of the four-year institutions report that they have hired  more faculty with international expertise and are offering more courses with an  international focus.  </P> <P> Among signs of progress cited in the report was the California International  Studies Project, consisting of nine regional centers funded by the state. The  centers offer teacher training in foreign languages, geography, economics, the  environment and regional studies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Lesson in Chicken  </P> <P> The report noted that "learning about other nations' resources and cultural  patterns may open up new opportunities for American exports." It said that  Baliles learned this lesson on a recent trip to Hong Kong, where he discovered  that chicken feet were served as a delicacy -- but were in short supply.  </P> <P> The governor immediately called several poultry producers in Virginia and found  that they routinely threw chicken feet away.  </P> <P> "A match was made and his state is now a supplier of chicken feet to Hong  Kong," the report said.  </P></p>

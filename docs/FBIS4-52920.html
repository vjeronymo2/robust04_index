			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hwang Kwang-chol and Hwang Kwang-il, two </F> brothers who defected to the ROK on 6 May, by unidentified  reporter--place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [SEOUL SINMUN] How were  your lives in the coal mine?    [Hwang Kwang-chol] Approximately 1,200 were working in the  coal mine. My life at the coal mine can be characterized by  hard labor and poverty. We were supposed to work three  eight-hour shifts. However, in reality, we often did hard labor  for 12 to 13 hours a day. All we did was pick coal. Members of  a family are assigned to different pits so that they cannot meet  during work. They also work different shifts. Therefore, they  cannot see each other often even at home. We were supplied with  a pair of working clothes a year. Therefore, I had to wear my  brother's when mine was being washed. Most coal miners cannot  bring meals to work.    [SEOUL SINMUN] Then, the efficiency of coal mining must not  be good, is it not?    [Hwang Kwang-chol] Kungsim Coal Mine miners worked in  inclined shafts 2,400 meters below the surface. Pit props were  installed every two meters even though they must be installed  every 70 cm because there are not enough pit props. As a result,  accidents were common. Electricity was 170 volts and not 220  volts because of electric power shortages. As a result,  machines operated at one-third of their capacity. Work  efficiency plummeted, and a coal miner dug a mere one to 1.2  tonnes a day, less than his daily assigned goal of 3.5 tonnes.  When a shaft collapsed in 1991, four coal miners were killed and  tens of others injured. I lost the use of the small finger of my  left hand after a blind end collapsed in June 1992. When I was  working as a blaster, a faulty detonator exploded, and shards  hit my right eye. Fortunately, I did not lose my eyesight.  [passage omitted]    [SEOUL SINMUN] How serious were food shortages?    [Hwang Kwang-chol] No food rations had been given for two  months before I fled North Korea. Even before that, they had  given us a mere 650 grams a day, after taking out conservation  rice or patriotic rice (they were sarcastically called coercion  rice) from our daily ration of 900 grams. Therefore, we had to  pick wormwood in the fields or go out to catch field mice in the  fall.    [Hwang Kwang-il] I suffered much starvation in North Korea.  Therefore, while living in China for 11 months after fleeing  North Korea, I gained 7 cm and 11 kg. Back in North Korea I  usually gained 5 cm and 3-4 kg a year. It was common to skip  three to four meals in a row. As a result, 40 to 50 percent of  children suffered from rickets before entering the people's  school. [passage omitted]    [SEOUL SINMUN] There were rumors that food riots erupted in  areas close to the border with China.    [Hwang Kwang-chol] People in these areas know very well that  Koreans in China are leading abundant lives. Therefore, when  food supply is bad, there are often protests and outcries.  Nevertheless, Public Security Ministry agents carefully contain  such incidents because they are afraid that if they recklessly  suppress such disturbances, riots may erupt.    [SEOUL SINMUN] How about other daily necessities?    [Hwang Kwang-chol] Only water is abundant. Still, it is  difficult to get water during rainy seasons because of floating  cow dung. People brush their teeth with salt because there is no  tooth paste. There is no toilet paper or paper, so people use  corn leaves in toilets. I know the supply of soybean paste and  soy sauce stopped since 1984. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Mulroney to pursue tough line on trade CANADIAN Prime Minister Brian Mulroney visits the White House today in a climate marred by bitter trade disputes and concern that the US is drifting deeper into isolationism. It is just seven years since President Ronald Reagan and Mr Mulroney sang 'Irish Eyes are Smiling' together and swore their mutual allegiance to the free market. But clearly the world no longer seems 'so bright and gay'. Mr Reagan has left centre stage and - if the polls are correct - Mr Mulroney and President George Bush soon could be joining him in political retirement. Mr Mulroney seems to find Mr Bush no less genial personally than his predecessor, but the political realities dictate a tougher line on trade from Ottawa. However, the atmosphere will be lightened by a US Commerce Department decision last week to cut its proposed countervailing duty on Canadian softwood lumber from 14.8 per cent to 6.51 per cent. Mr Derek Burney, Canadian ambassador to the US, said the move would 'help lower the temperature,' but insisted the ruling was 'a tortured attempt to manipulate the facts in order to substantiate a pre-ordained result'. The case will head the list of trade grievances, along with skirmishes over duties on Canadian-made Hondas, beer and magnesium. The Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks is on the agenda. Mr Mulroney would request 'the same kind of flexibility' on agriculture trade talks that the US was demonstrating toward the European Community, Mr Burney said. There are two new problems to discuss. The White House last week requested a dispute settlement panel under the Free Trade Agreement to investigate Canada's wheat pricing methods. Mr Mulroney may now request a panel to examine US agriculture export subsidies. The Canadian prime minister is also expected to emphasise the necessity of US leadership on aid to the former Soviet Union, in advance of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Canada and the US in June. Canadian officials stress that Ottawa has contributed more than Dollars 2bn in aid to the region - about 40 per cent of the US contribution - when the US economy is 10 times larger. Talks will also focus on the looming Group of Seven summit in Bonn, the North America Free Trade Agreement, and the Earth Summit to be held in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TRAIL BLAZERS' ROOKIE PLEADS GUILTY  </P> <P> Portland Trail Blazers' rookie Cliff Robinson pleaded guilty today to punching  a policewoman outside a Portland bar.  </P> <P> Robinson, 23, was sentenced to a year of probation and fined $250 for  fourth-degree assault, a misdemeanor.  </P> <P> Multnomah County District Judge Nely Johnson also ordered him to perform 50  hours of community service and to undergo counseling for anger management. A  disorderly conduct charge against him was dropped.  </P> <P> Robinson, a second-round draft choice from Connecticut, was arrested about 3:30  a.m. April 29 after striking the officer during a fight.  </P> <P> Police said Robinson struck officer Elaine Slone as she and her partner tried  to break up the fight outside Goldie's Restaurant and Lounge.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-10, 225-pound Robinson was a key reserve forward during the regular  season for Portland.  </P> <P> He took over the starting center's spot after Kevin Duckworth broke his hand in  the first round of the playoffs.  </P> <P> "I just want to say I'm sorry for this unfortunate incident and I want to  apologize to the Portland Police Department, the Portland fans and Elaine  Slone," Robinson said in court today. "I never intended for anyone to get  hurt."  </P></p>

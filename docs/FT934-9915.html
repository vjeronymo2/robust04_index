			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / (CORRECTED) Budget 1993: Direct attack on indirect taxation  -The growing lobby opposing extensions of VAT Correction (published 9th November 1993) appended to this article. RAISING taxes on consumer goods and services is firmly on the agenda for discussion as a way to narrow the gap between public spending and revenues, but a range of arguments linked to the fragile recovery may stop Mr Kenneth Clarke in his tracks. For his first Budget on November 30 the chancellor is considering whether to increase Britain's 17.5 per cent value added tax rate. He could also widen the scope of the tax to cover exempt items including newspapers, children's clothing and food. Other options are to raise excise duties on items such as cigarettes, wine and beer. These moves would fit in with the government's aim during the 1980s to push the fiscal burden towards indirect taxes on goods and services and away from direct taxes on incomes. According to Treasury orthodoxy tax changes of this type provide the opportunity to raise extra cash without unduly weakening people's incentive to work. On Treasury calculations a 1 percentage point increase in the VAT rate could bring Pounds 1.7bn extra revenues in the next financial year, while extending VAT to food would raise Pounds 7bn. Any new increases in consumer taxes would come on top of the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel and higher petrol duties already announced for next April. In recent weeks, however, the Treasury has been bombarded with advice from economists and lobby groups that - with demand still weak after the recession - higher consumer taxes could deal a blow to growth prospects. A secondary argument is that higher taxes on consumer goods and services would push up the retail prices index, increasing the possibility that underlying inflation would exceed the government target of 4 per cent. The Henley Centre, a consultancy specialising in consumer spending, has worked out how higher taxes would affect demand for a range of goods, shown in the accompanying table. Factors such as the incomes of the people who mainly buy the items listed and to the degree to which they are considered non-essential 'luxury' items, mean that for a set rise in taxation, demand for soft drinks would fall by a bigger amount than would breakfast cereals. Professor Doug McWilliams, head of the Centre for Economic and Business Research, another consultancy, said a rise in VAT or in excise duties could translate into a shock effect that could hold back economic growth. He added: 'Apart from putting up inflation, a rise in consumer taxes might be an inefficient way of trying to raise money on the grounds that people could decide to shift their spending away from newly taxed goods towards cheaper products.' If the chancellor ignores such warnings and decides indirect taxes must be raised in the Budget he has had no shortage of views from lobbying groups. Executives from about 20 of Britain's biggest retailers took Mr Clarke for lunch at a London hotel last month to ram home the message about how tax increases could hit them. Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of the Dixons electrical goods retailer, pointed out how any 'messing about' with VAT in the Budget could affect the crucial pre-Christmas period. Mr Robin Simpson, director of the Brewers' Society, representing the beer industry, said that by increasing excise duties on beer Mr Clarke would be risking 'killing the goose that lays the golden egg' by stifling demand causing tax revenues to go down. Mr John Wilson, director-general of the British Apparel and Textile Federation, said the imposition of VAT on children's clothes would cause 'considerable harm' to the clothing industry. The exemption from the tax for these items of clothing costs the Treasury some Pounds 600m a year. If Mr Clarke decides that higher VAT or excise duties are required, he will need all his legendary toughness to shrug off special pleading.  --------------------------------  IMPACT ON DEMAND OF VAT-INDUCED         10% PRICE RISE  --------------------------------                    %  -------------------------------- Whisky            -1.5 Soft drinks       -2 New cars          -1.6 Carpets           -0.9 Instant coffee    -1.6 CDs               -0.7 Breakfast cereals  -0.3  -------------------------------- Source: Henley Centre  -------------------------------- CORRECTION THE TABLE in yesterday's article on the effects of possible tax changes in the Budget referred to the effects on specific products of a 1 per cent increase in prices, not a 10 per cent increase as stated.</p>

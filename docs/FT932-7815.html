			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Democratic rebellion poses threat to Clinton energy tax DEMOCRATIC senators launched a rebellion yesterday which threatened to kill or water down President Bill Clinton's proposed energy tax, a cornerstone of his economic proposals aimed at raising about Dollars 70bn (Pounds 45bn) over five years. The revolt came only a day after Mr Clinton headed off dissent over his economic plan in the House of Representatives. Senators David Boren and Ben nett Johnston teamed up with moderate Republican allies led by Senator John Danforth to launch a rival economic plan. This would raise taxes by Dollars 150bn over five years, rather than the Dollars 272bn Mr Clinton proposed, and instead cut Dollars 163bn of spending on health and pension benefits for the elderly. Although the senators presented their plan as a fiscally prudent alternative to the Clinton proposals, their main target is the elimination of the energy tax, levied on fuels according to their energy content, which is opposed by oil and gas producers in their home states. Their opposition to the president's economic bill creates a severe obstacle to its passage. An Oklahoman, Mr Boren sits on the Senate finance committee, and his defection would make it extremely difficult to move the economic bill forward. Mr Johnston yesterday declared the energy tax dead. 'It will not succeed because it will not get the votes,' he said. However, Mr George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, said he was 'convinced that the President's budget plan will pass the Congress largely intact', but explicitly left the door open for further exemptions from the energy tax. Mr Mitchell and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the finance committee, expressed confidence that Mr Boren's plan would not pass the committee, still less the full Senate, while Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary, said long term interest rates would rise if the Clinton budget were to fail. Mr Clinton argued yesterday that alternatives to the energy tax such as a petrol tax fell unevenly on different US regions, while benefit cuts for the elderly would shift the burden of reducing the budget deficit disproportionately on those who could least afford it. Mr Clinton has been able to head off dissent in the House by standing firm and appealing for party loyalty. Many Democrats in the Senate, however, are immune to such appeals. The Democratic majority in the Senate is also much slimmer than in the House of Representatives - 57-43 in the full chamber and just 11-9 on many committees. Less clear, however, is how many Republicans will be willing, for the sake of inflicting a defeat on Mr Clinton, to add their names to the Boren-Danforth proposal. This not only enters the politically explosive territory of pension cuts, but also accepts the increase in top income tax rates proposed in the Clinton plan - traditionally taboo for Republicans. Mr Clinton finds himself caught in a tug of war between the left and right wings of his party.</p>

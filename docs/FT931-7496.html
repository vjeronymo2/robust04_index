			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Observer: Car-thartic Sprechen Sie Deutsch? That is a question Jacques Calvet - Peugeot chairman, Japan-basher extraordinaire, Maastricht opponent, etc, etc - prefers officials from the Bank of France, at least, to answer in the negative. He has two current bugbears. One is the Bundesbank's insularity in refusing to slash interest rates. The other is French cross-party support for an independent central bank which he sees as 'the French humbling themselves in front of the Germans once more'. Hence Calvet, who's after all trying to sell cars in notably inclement conditions, was yesterday muttering that the next step would no doubt be a requirement that his country's central bank staff parlez allemand. Not that devaluation isn't the same thing in any language.</p>

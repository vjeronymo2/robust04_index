			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / The German Rate Cut: Ailing ERM handed a new lease of life - Alarm subsides in Brussels THE German interest rate cuts were greeted with relief yesterday in Brussels, where senior European Community officials have been watching helplessly at the build-up of pressure on the exchange rate mechanism - the designated vehicle for European monetary union. In the previous 24 hours, officials had grown increasingly alarmed as first the Danish krone and then the Belgian franc came under pressure in the foreign exchange markets. After the 10 per cent devaluation of the Irish punt last weekend, the speculative attacks on these 'hard currencies' threatened to rip the heart out of the ERM. The Bundesbank action yesterday marks a decisive move to salvage the system, a senior EC official said. Further, it offers the long-awaited chance of lower interest rates across the Continent, the single most important factor in bolstering economic recovery - one day after the European Commission issued its gloomiest economic forecast for 1993 in 20 years, with growth unlikely to reach 0.8 per cent this year and 1.8 per cent in 1994, and unemployment continuing to rise. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, said yesterday the Bundesbank decision offered a much-needed signal that it recognised it had a responsibility not just to the German economy but to the rest of the Community. This message of mutual interdependence is something he has been preaching ever since coming to Brussels in 1985. Yesterday's interest rate cut underlines that the Bundesbank has nothing to gain from a 'free-for-all' of competitive devaluations in which monetary stability is lost. Just hours before Frankfurt's move, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, raised the possibility of a collapse of the ERM, in which case a smaller group of countries were likely to create new forms of monetary and exchange rate co-operation. This was not the preferred option, he stressed; but something would emerge from the wreckage. Sir Leon was merely expressing publicly what has been said privately on the diplomatic circuit in Brussels since the New Year: that the unabated foreign exchange market assault on the ERM, and, crucially, on the French franc-D-Mark parity, was making it more likely that a nucleus of 'hard core' currencies would move on a fast track to create some kind of monetary union ahead of schedule. Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, confirmed as much yesterday. Moves to link the more stable currencies in the ERM were under discussion, he said, but there should be a flexible interpretation of the economic 'convergence' criteria for Emu to allow Spain to join as well. But relaxing the 'convergence criteria' providing tough targets on budget deficits, public debt as a proportion of GDP and inflation is precisely what the Bundesbank fears most about a single European currency. Last week, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, its president, made clear in a speech that the price of giving up the D-Mark had to be adherence to the convergence criteria. Viewed from this perspective, it is possible to put a slightly less altruistic gloss on the Bundesbank's rate cuts. One EC official suggested that by easing the strains inside the ERM, the Bundesbank had underlined its commitment to the status quo, rather than signalling its willingness to contemplate a 'fast track' approach to Emu.</p>

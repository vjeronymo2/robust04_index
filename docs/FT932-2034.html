			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Arts: Photographing a changing City - Architecture Looking at cities is the best possible way of learning about architecture. The City of London is a a microcosm of the architectural world - and one that is facing problems of renewal after the recent terrorist outrages. There is a whole crop of new committees, public relations outfits and quangos dedicated to the promotion of London, but none of them stress the extraordinary quality of the built world of the City. The best way of understanding a city is to immerse yourself in its changes by walking about it. Even better is to walk about it with a camera. In the excellent Museum of London in the Barbican until July 4 is an exhibition, The Square Mile, that focuses on the City of London through the lens of the camera of artist-photographer Tom Evans. He trained as an architect in Bristol and spent the early part of his career as a personal design assistant to the great engineer, the late Sir Ove Arup. Today he runs a consortium known as CITE, which is concerned with new technology, design and the visual arts, when he is not taking photographs. What is fascinating about his view of the City of London is that it is concerned with architecture as a force for change. He demonstrates that a photograph can make you look again at what you thought was familiar. He also shows that it is possible to record those crucial moments when a city alters direction or destroys a part of itself to renew another part. Tom Evans began his photographic odyssey in the City in 1989, at the height of the great Thatcher building boom. In many ways the City threw caution to the winds, galvanised by the illusory 'threat' of Docklands. Planners and politicians encouraged changes which led to a level of redevelopment that had not been seen since the years following the Blitz. Electronic miracles were to change architecture and office planning for ever - although this is something that has not yet been fully grasped. New buildings grew like mushroom spores: some were filled but many were not. The financial climate of the 1980s acted as a great catalyst for architectural change. Some developers welcomed it with open arms and tried to accept the fact that buildings now have to wear new clothes - or may even have to wear no recognisable clothes at all. Other developers tried hard to hang on to their old clothes, or revive them in new materials. As Tom Evans says in the introduction, 'a new chapter of the City's history was visibly being written in steel, glass and concrete, and the forms created have led to heated debates about the very nature of architecture, planning, and even the purpose of the City itself.' The NatWest tower, designed by Richard Seifert in 1970, was, at 600 feet, the highest building in the City. Now its future is very uncertain: damaged by bombs but not ruined, can it be rebuilt or should it be demolished to allow a new tower to rise? The photograph that shows it, in 1989 from Threadneedle Street, almost suggests its temporary character. In a special section of the exhibition Mr Evans reminds us that in the City the houses of God stand very close to the houses of Mammon. Too close for comfort in the case of Saint Ethelburga's, which was recently bombed in Bishopsgate despite having survived the Great Fire and the Blitz. But he is right to make us look again at the glories of St. Dunstan's tower; All Hallows London Wall; St. Helen's; St. Lawrence Jewry and St. Nicholas Cole Abbey. We should not forget the wonderful interiors of the City's churches; look again at St. Magnus Martyr in Lower Thames Street and forget the horror of the endless stream of passing cars, reflecting upon what T. S. Eliot called the, 'inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.' Only a good photographer or an artist can draw attention to the spaces between buildings; they matter as much as actual buildings in the whole scheme of a city. In many of the newer developments, especially Broadgate, a great deal of thought and design has gone into the new squares and atria. Exchange House from Primrose Street is a good place to see the approach of a careful developer who shows concern for the City as well as his profits. The Thames and the sky are both City spaces and the camera focuses our eyes on the scale and the whole nature of the spaces we move around in each day. I had almost forgotten that the City of London does still have tiny courtyards and alleys - St. Michael's Alley; George Yard; Nicholas Lane. All are agreeable and part of the more human scale that all cities need. Mr Evans quotes Gustave Dore's wonderful lines written in the 1870s about 'the narrow streets and lanes of the City' where he found 'tumultuous episodes of energetic money-making life'. So unlike the silent moves of a silver computer screen. It was a brave idea to try and show how a close examination of the fabric of the City reflects wealth and status. The polished mahogany of old fashioned tailoring shops; the heavy stonework of the Bank of England; the pompous doors of great institutions and the festive facades of St. Paul's Cathedral. What can you say about the thin marble veneers of the 1980s and the sham classicism and strange detail of so many recent buildings? It is the new top layers of the City that are added by every generation that both shock and fascinate. These pictures show the City as a palimpsest in stone and concrete and cheap veneer - and they subtly reveal to us the nature of architectural change. They are a challenge to make you go out into the streets of the City and look and experience the sense of flux: an experience that combines both pleasure and pain.</p>

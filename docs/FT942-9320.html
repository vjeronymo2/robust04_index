			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Pakistan decides to switch to a two-day weekend Pakistan said yesterday it would switch to a two-day weekend on Friday and Saturday from next month, reversing the practice of observing a one-day break on Friday only, Farhan Bokhari reports from Islamabad. Mr Khalid Kharal, the information minister, told a press conference that the change would save up to Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) a year in power, fuel and transport costs. The government also said it would introduce daylight saving time to be able to increase work hours during the winter. The change comes as Pakistan is struggling with one of its most difficult power shortages this year.</p>

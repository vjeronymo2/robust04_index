			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / S African strike looms as talks fail SOUTH AFRICA faces the renewed prospect of industrial strife, after the breakdown yesterday of talks between business and labour aimed at averting a lengthy general strike next month. 'An historic opportunity has been thrown away by employers,' the 1.3m-strong Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) said. It had no option but to go ahead with plans for a stoppage 'for the week of August 3'. Cosatu, the largest union grouping in the country, had been holding talks for the past two weeks with the South African Co-ordinating Committee on Labour Affairs (Saccola), an umbrella employer body. The two parties had hoped to negotiate a pact that would avoid a general strike and help break the country's constitutional deadlock. They agreed a draft charter for 'peace, democracy and economic reconstruction', but then apparently both sides had difficulties in persuading their constituencies to go along with them. Cosatu said the parties failed to ratify the draft accord because of differences about a compromise one-day shutdown on August 3, which was proposed instead of a longer all-out strike. The one-day shutdown would have been a voluntary exercise, in which both business and labour would have participated. Their fruitless efforts coincided with an escalation in the mass action campaign of the African National Congress (ANC) and its allies. This week has seen the ANC embark on an extended series of sit-ins in government offices, police stations and magistrates' courts. Protests yesterday included shoppers running up bills at tills of leading stores and then refusing to pay. Demonstrators also gathered at the Pretoria central prison, demanding an end to township violence and a swift transition to democracy. More than 1,000 protesters have been arrested since Monday, although few have been held for long in police custody. The United Nations special envoy to South Africa, Mr Cyrus Vance, yesterday met President F W de Klerk. Mr Vance's trip, which springs from a UN Security Council resolution last week, is aimed at creating a climate for negotiations. The envoy held two hours of talks with Mr de Klerk, who briefed him on the government's position on constitutional talks with the ANC and other black-led parties and on the country's wave of violence. Mr Vance is scheduled to meet the ANC and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party today. The ANC withdrew from talks on a multi-racial constitution last month in protest at the massacre of at least 43 people at Boipatong township. It accused Mr de Klerk of condoning the attack and of trying to cling to minority rule. Toyota and the National Union of Metalworkers have signed an agreement ending the two-month strike at the Japanese company's Durban manufacturing plants, opening the way for the re-employment of 6,000 sacked workers.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Arts: 'My Night with Reg' goes West - Theatre Alas, poor Reg. I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite bonkability . . . knew him in the Biblical sense. Horatio, in this case, is Guy, a confirmed bachelor who is nearing 40 and who does a lot of listening. My Night with Reg - one of the several success stories of 1994, now reaching the West End after its acclaimed opening in March at the Royal Court's little Theatre Upstairs  - is a wistful comedy by Kevin Elyot about six gay Englishmen during the last ten years. Reg, whom we never see and who dies before the second of the play's three scenes, was a right little goer; but only Guy begins to discover how much so, as each of the other men start to confide in him. Not that Reg was unique. Daniel (his official lover) and John (his most smitten secret lover) used to get around no end until he entered their lives. Once he leaves their lives, they pick up the old promiscuity where they left off. All of this they tell to Guy, who is still languishing, 15 years after Oxford days, with a love for John that he never confesses. Guy knits ('a cover for my door-sausage, actually') and has bestial 'phone sex with Brad, whom he has never met ('a lorry driver, he says. I suspect he's a florist, but what's it matter?') and listens and frets. Yet cruel fate has it that it is poor, neurotic, spinsterish Guy who, to our surprise, departs, of Aids, before the third scene. My Night with Reg switches from farce to pathos and back again throughout; it is studded with lines so funny that the audience guffaws for the next half-minute; it rings so many bells for me that I wonder if Elyot and I have friends in common; and it has brilliant effects of suspense. William Dudley has designed a gorgeous interior set that fills the large Criterion stage. And Roger Michell's direction negotiates the trickiest moments - men in tears or starting to make love with each other - with extraordinary persuasiveness. I wish, however, that the play did not come garlanded with press quotations that speak in superlatives and about genius; and I wish, for its sake, that it did not reach the West End towards the end of a year which has already brought a billion plays about homosexuality to British stages. (How many plays are there around to take one's aunts to, for heaven's sake?) Most of the Reg characters are too close for me to caricature or for me to care much about them. Sure, I experienced a succession of various tiny pangs on their behalf. John Sessions brings immense braggadocio panache to Daniel  -but about half his role consists of comic set pieces, and he delivers them as such. David Bamber overdoes the knock-kneed neurosis of Guy, a role that surely could stand more dignity; I could not believe that the other characters could bear the respect for him they claimed. Only the pathos of John - the most physically attractive and the most spiritually doomed - is seriously affecting, and unusual. And Anthony Calf's interpretation of this dear unhappy beauty, utterly absorbed in his own pointless and charming life, is astonishing - a study in golden hopelessness.

Several power plants, including three 1.2 million-kilowatt  stations in Xiangtan, Wangcheng and Yiyang, have been approved  by the province's Power Industry Bureau for overseas  co-operation.    The bureau has also set up a special working group to raise  foreign capital.    Officials with the bureau said investors from Germany,  Sweden, Australia, France, Britain, Canada, the United States  and Hong Kong show strong interest in investing in Hunan's power  industry.    The New Xiangtan Power Station is expected to cooperate with  investors from Sweden, and a German company is negotiating with  the bureau for construction of the Wangcheng Power Plant.    Last year, TIME Engineering Berhad, a member of the  Malaysian  Renong Group, signed a contract with Lianyuan city to construct  a 250-megawatt coal-fired power station in the city.    Total investment for that project was put at $230 million.    Wu Haichun, general manager of the province's Power Industry  Corp, admitted that Hunan has one of the country's worst  shortages of electricity, but he promised that the province will  make big progress this year. By the end of 1993, the province  had installed capacity of 6.58 million kilowatts, double the  figure in 1980.    However, its per capita consumption of electricity is only  60  per cent of the national average.    Wu said that from l994 to 2000, the province plans to  install  another 9 million kilowatts of capacity, of which 7 million will  be thermal and 2 million hydropower.    But to do that, Hunan needs 30 billion yuan ($3.45 billion).    Wu said the province will use various methods to raise the  capital.    To expand the government's fund for electrical investment,  the province is expected to raise electricity prices this year.    It also plans to raise money from the securities market by  converting power enterprises into shareholding companies.    Hunan Huayin Power Co Ltd, the province's first shareholding  power company, was established last year and is expected to go  public.    The company has issued shares worth 288 million yuan ($33  million), and most of the money raised will be used to renovate  the Zhuzhou Power Plant.    The province also plans to invest 2.75 billion yuan ($315  million) in electrical construction this year, compared with  1.71 billion yuan ($191 million) last year.</p>

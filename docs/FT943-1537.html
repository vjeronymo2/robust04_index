			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Eadie shares dive 20% Shares in Eadie Holdings fell by 20 per cent or 5p to 20p yesterday after the general engineering group reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 262,000 for the first half of 1994. Mr Peter Bromwich, chairman, attributed the setback to the downturn suffered on the roll cages and wheelchairs business, and interest charges up from Pounds 129,000 to Pounds 167,000. However, he was confident that actions taken in improving product and manufacturing facilities, coupled with an increased order book in most of the group, would lead to a second half improvement. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 13.45m (Pounds 13.55m). Earnings per share declined to 0.32p (1.09p) but an unchanged interim dividend of 0.3p has been declared.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (5): Fighting to reverse decline - Big US producers continue to restructure the world's fourth largest in 1991 with output of Dollars 2.74bn - has woken up over the past two years. In the middle of a deep recession, it is attempting with some success to reverse a decline in the 1970s and 1980s that surrendered too many markets too easily to Japanese competition. The decline - as so often in the machine tool industry  - was due to a combination of internal and external factors. As recently as 1982, there were 1,400 active US machine toolmakers, most of which were happy to serve the domestic market with a single product that faced little foreign competition. These companies were completely ill-prepared for the onslaught of Japanese imports from companies with active product development programmes, and to a lesser extent, European suppliers. Last year imports were worth Dollars 2.16bn, accounting for more than half of the Dollars 3.8bn market, according to the magazine American Machinist. In percentage terms, imports have more than doubled their market share in the past decade. The external factor, which is largely outside the industry's control, is the relative decline of the US manufacturing sector on which it relied too heavily. The US now accounts for less than 10 per cent of world machine tool consumption, compared with 20 per cent a decade ago. The continued recession last year reduced machine tool consumption by 19 per cent, while US machine tool production fell 20 per cent. Behind these figures lies the unpleasant fact that US machine-tool buyers were more likely to give up buying domestic machines than to forego purchasing imports. On a brighter note, US machine-tool exports set a new record last year, rising marginally to Dollars 1.08bn - a creditable performance given world market conditions. This suggests that Mr Albert Moore, president of the Association for Manufacturing Technology, was speaking with some justification when he told American Machinist that 'for many US machine-tool builders, exporting has become an integral part of their overall business plan, not just an alternative to the still-weak domestic market.' Fortunately in many respects, the recession of the early 1980s had begun a winnowing-out process that has reduced the number of active US machine tool builders to less than 600. Proportionately, this is a much heavier restructuring than has occurred in Europe, but many of the remaining companies are still too small to invest sufficiently in long-term development. At the top end of the business, however, a handful of companies have realised that the demands of customers for multiple product lines and a more closer working relationship with the machine tool supplier, along with the trend towards machining centres and flexible manufacturing cells, can best be served by large companies with big, integrated product ranges and a commitment to spending on new product development. THE TWO companies leading the fightback, Giddings &amp; Lewis and Cincinnati Milacron, share at least one thing in common: a size that dwarfs most other US machine tool builders. Beyond that, their backgrounds and strategies are somewhat different. The resurgence at Giddings &amp; Lewis began in 1987 with the appointment of Mr William Fife, a former steelworks sweeper who joined the Wisconsin-based company after a spell at Cross &amp; Trecker, another US machine tool builder. Mr Fife removed artificial divisions between product lines, invested heavily in a computer-aided design system, and boosted research spending to 10 per cent of sales. The company went public in a 1989 spin-off from AMCA International - now United Dominion Industries - and after three years of sharply rising sales and profits Mr Fife launched his big move last June. For just Dollars 70m, Mr Fife turned Giddings &amp; Lewis into the world's fourth largest machine tool company by agreeing to buy the heavily loss-making Cross &amp; Trecker. The attraction of the deal, concluded late last year, was the chance to create a much-expanded product line. It also gave a much stronger presence in Europe - a market that is now more than four times bigger than its US counterpart. Mr Fife now has a tough job integrating the much larger Cross &amp; Trecker into Giddings &amp; Lewis, and producing 'one-stop shopping' for factory automation. Cincinnati Milacron is also undergoing a profound change of emphasis that could be of immense significance to the future of the US machine tool industry. The company lost its way in the 1980s after moving away from producing standard machine tools such as machining centres and turning centres to concentrate on highly-engineered, custom-built machines. With Milacron working on long-lead time orders in an era of high inflation, imported product got the chance to move onshore, according to Mr Daniel Meyer, chairman and chief executive. 'Now we are going back to where we were very strong,' he says. The renewed emphasis on standard products, taking on Japanese competition directly, is a key element of Milacron's much-vaunted Wolfpack programme. This is a more ambitious sequel to the company's mid-80s revival in its plastic injection moulding machine business. The programme has involved considerable restructuring to ensure that Milacron remains competitive manufacturing in the US, and a reversal of some earlier diversification moves. Hence, in 1990, the sale of Milacron's industrial robot business to ABB Robotics. Already, Wolfpack has resulted in a much stronger new product development programme, backed up by a big effort, says Mr Meyer, to 'get more people out knocking on doors to sell our products.' However, if the long-term outlook for both companies looks encouraging, neither has completed its reshaping efforts. This explains why both Mr Meyer and Mr Fife are relieved that the US government is extending for two years the voluntary restraint agreements (VRAs) on the import of certain CNC machine tools from Japan and Taiwan. 'This goes right to the heart of the Wolfpack programme. We need another two years to complete it,' says Mr Meyer. Mr Fife has also welcomed the breathing space offered by the VRA extension. The extensions - which were opposed by some other US machine tool builders - are still being negotiated, and will be backdated to the beginning of the year once agreement is reached. But the Bush Admistration has made it clear they will not be renewed again.</p>

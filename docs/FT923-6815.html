			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Prolific likely to part with its troubled Danish parent PROLIFIC INSURANCE, the UK life insurance and unit trust company, has had an uneasy home since it was acquired in 1989 by Hafnia, the troubled Danish insurer. Hafnia paid Pounds 90m - widely felt at the time to be overspending - for what had been part of Provincial and Prolific, a company for which the economist John Maynard Keynes had worked as a fund manag-er. The price, however, at 50 times historic earnings, was in retrospect too much for a company which has seen its funds under management shrink since then. It is currently managing about Pounds 900m, about Pounds 350m of which are the assets of its largely unit-linked policy holders. The bulk of its other funds are stand-alone unit trusts sold under the aegis of its Prolific Unit Trust and Prolific International companies. Hafnia is believed to be in talks to find a buyer for its stand-alone insurance company but that it was unlikely to achieve a price along the lines it paid three years ago. Yesterday Prolific went to pains to point out that it was structurally insulated from the difficulties facing its parent. 'Prolific's operations are structured so that the investments are all held by trustees or custodians and the assets are therefore totally protected,' it said in a statement. 'Prolific's regulators in the UK, Imro, have been kept informed of the Danish developments and are happy with the position as it relates to the UK companies.' According to returns filed with the Department of Trade and Industry for the year ended December 31 1991, Prolific had a regulatory solvency margin of roughly 8 per cent, twice the minimum set by the DTI. With a required minimum margin of Pounds 6.6m, Prolific had assets valued at Pounds 13.3m. Analysts said that Hafnia would not have been able to gain access to Prolific's excess capital without conducting a time-consuming revaluation and that it was unlikely to have done so since the returns were filed. The returns also show that inter-company loans made by Prolific were actually reduced in 1991, from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 500,000. The DTI returns do not specify whether the loans were to Hafnia or to any other entity. Hafnia said that the unit trusts had never held the shares of Hafnia or of any of its main shareholders. Ironically, analysts point out, a Hafnia fire sale of the company may well improve Prolific's fortunes. Although it ranks at best 40th among UK insurers in size, it still has an attractive franchise. Its unit trusts are sold largely through independent financial advisers and are offered through some of the largest chains. Without its troubled parent Prolific's prospects might well improve. 'Its been very frustrating for us because the investment performance has been very good but the headlines have been dominated by the troubles of our Danish parent,' said one Prolific fund manager. According to the latest figures from Micropal, the unit trust performance measurement service, 10 out of Prolific's 13 unit trusts rank in the top half of the performance league and seven of these rank in the top 25 per cent.

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRIVE-IN CANCELS SCREENINGS AFTER BRAWL  </P> <P> Fearing a repeat of a Friday night brawl that led to the wounding of an  18-year-old suspected gang member, the manager of a Westminster drive-in  theater Saturday canceled the weekend showings of a newly released movie that  depicts Latino gang life in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "We will not be playing it until further notice," said Joan Ruth, manager of  the Hi-Way Drive-In.  </P> <P> The showing of "Angel Town," the story of a former kick boxer who moves in with  a Latino family living in the middle of a gang-infested neighborhood, was  marred by a brawl that involved as many as 100 gang members.  </P> <P> As the film was playing on the large outdoor screen, rival gang members  wielding baseball bats began smashing car windows and fighting with each other,  Lt. Robert Burnett said.  </P> <P> The shooting occurred near the entrance of the drive-in and the violence  spilled out to the street, police said. Jesus Martinez Orjel was wounded in the  chest by a small-caliber handgun, Burnett said. Martinez was taken to UC Irvine  Medical Center, where he was listed in stable condition.  </P></p>

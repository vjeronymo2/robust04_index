			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WATER PIPELINE BID APPROVED  </P> <P> A bid to construct an 11-mile-long, $75 million water pipeline through Las  Posas Mountain and San Marcos was awarded Monday by the San Diego County Water  Authority to a Vancouver, Wash., company.  </P> <P> Water officials say that when the nine-foot-diameter, steel pipeline becomes  operational -- two years from now -- it will allow the wholesale water purveyor  to buy an additional 5% more water for distribution to the 25 public water  agencies it supplies throughout the county.  </P> <P> The new pipeline will also help the County Water Authority better distribute  water throughout the county, said senior civil engineer Gary Stine.  </P> <P> The new pipeline will connect to an existing California Aqueduct pipeline about  five miles north of San Marcos, travel through the Twin Oaks Valley and run  through a 1,685-foot-long tunnel to be blasted through Las Posas Mountain on  San Marcos' south side. The pipeline will then reconnect to the main water  artery near Questhaven Road in the Elfin Forest area, Stine said.  </P> <P> The bid was awarded to Kiewit Pacific Company, one of five competitors for the  two-year construction project expected to begin in about a month.  </P> <P> Stine likened the additional pipeline to the construction of a freeway to  parallel an existing one, saying it will allow the water authority to more  efficiently distribute water to the water agencies that buy water from the  wholesaler.  </P> <P> Some water reservoirs in the county occasionally run low on water because of  distribution problems that will be corrected with the new pipeline, he said.  </P> <P> The pipeline will have the capability to carry 400 million gallons of water per  day, Stine said.  </P></p>

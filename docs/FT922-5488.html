			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Passing shares to my children I WISH to pass on some sizeable shareholdings (pre-1982) to my children, avoiding Capital Gains Tax and hopefully inheritance tax. a) Can I double the flow by transferring some of my holding to my wife as an exempt arrangement, for her then to make similar annual gifts to the children? b) If this is valid, what interval is necessary? Can the first gift to children follow as soon as new certificates in my wife's name are to hand? You cannot simply use your wife as a puppet. If you decide to give her parcels of shares, she may decide that her enlarged investment portfolio is greater than she needs, and she may therefore decide to make gifts to the children, but the decisions must be hers - with no prompting or pressure from you. The longer the period between your gifts to her and her gifts to the children - should she decide to make any such gifts - the easier it will be for her to convince the Inland Revenue that she acted independently. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

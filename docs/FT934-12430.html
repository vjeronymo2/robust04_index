			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Japan promises to open building sector THE US yesterday postponed the imposition of economic sanctions against Japan after Tokyo announced plans to inject fresh competition into its scandal-ridden public sector construction market. This is the first tangible sign of improved US-Japanese relations since the arrival in August of the coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, which has pleased the Clinton administration by promising to scrap restrictive practices and to cut red tape generally. It comes against a backdrop of continuing serious differences between Tokyo and Washington on foreign access to all Japan's markets. But it indicates that Japan and the US are on the way to resolving differences on public procurement in construction, which had threatened to provide another stumbling block to completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said he would recommend to President Bill Clinton a delay until January 20 in the sanctions against Japan which had been due to go into effect on November 1. In the meantime, the US will monitor Japanese reform efforts. The Japanese proposals would make it easier for foreign companies to tender for construction projects by national and regional government and agencies, worth Y8,527bn (Pounds 53.2bn) this year, according to the finance ministry. That is, however, a small fraction of the total private and public sector construction market, estimated to be worth at least Y100,000bn by Mr Etsusuke Masuda, director of equity research at Salomon Brothers Asia. Tougher penalties against companies caught bribing officials or rigging bids are also proposed. This is a response to the widening net of construction industry scandals, involving Japan's top six construction companies, uncovered by public prosecutors over the past few months. The plan proposes that open bidding will be allowed for projects above specific thresholds, in contrast to the present system in which only companies designated by procurement authorities can tender, a prime source of corruption. The plan does not specify the threshold above which projects will be available for open bidding, expected to be set at around Y700m, say officials. Until now, Japan has insisted on a threshold of Y1.5bn. The new proposal would bring Japan closer to the Dollars 4.5m per contract threshold preferred by most Gatt members. Foreign bidders would be assessed on technical merit, rather than, as now, on their inevitably skimpy record in Japan.</p>

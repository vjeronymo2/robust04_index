Aizpeolea report: "Gonzalez Increases His </F> Power in Curbing Guerra"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez, secretary general of  the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party], has more freedom of  action today than he had 48 hours ago. The clear defeat for the  Guerraists (with 28 percent of the delegates to the federal  congress) by the renewalists and integrationists (72 percent) at  the provincial congresses prior to the March congress gives the  Socialist leader a much freer hand to design an Executive  Committee to his liking. The victorious renewalists offer  Gonzalez freedom for his political activity. The losing  Guerraists were demanding a presence in the power apparatus, but  their defeat will prevent them from setting conditions. Even  so, the supporters of the party's "number two" were disguising  their disappointment with the idea that the PSOE is approaching  the 33d congress "utterly divided."    Renewalists and integrationists have succeeded in winning a  majority in 14 of the 20 Socialist federations, the Guerraists  in just six. The big surprises were Andalusia and Murcia, fiefs  traditionally controlled by supporters of Deputy Secretary  General Alfonso Guerra, where the renewalists or Felipeists have  prevailed. The Felipeists' representation is now 72 percent,  since their nine federations have been joined by those which  formally call themselves integrationist. This is the case with  Valencia, the Basque Country, the Canary Islands, Catalonia, and  the Foreign Federation (party members living abroad). Their  leaders -- Joan Lerma, Ramon Jauregui, Jeronimo Saavedra, Raimon  Obiols -- are Felipeists but have received a Guerraist minority  in their ranks.    The provincial congresses of Madrid (52 delegates) and Leon  (20 delegates) will be held next week. With these and others  pending in the local associations of La Coruna (three) and Lugo  (one), the process prior to the the 33d congress will have been  completed. In this situation, the Felipeists now have 585  delegates, against the 226 delegates of the Guerraists.    Guerra's supporters were disappointed yesterday at having  achieved a result very distant from their aims, which they put  at 40 percent of the representatives. Their calculations failed  them over the past three days because of the mirage of the  outcome in the votes in the local associations, prior to last  weekend's provincial congresses. The unexpected loss in  Andalusia and Murcia -- which account for almost one-third of  the 887 delegates to the congress -- has made them reduce  drastically their optimistic forecasts, now that the party  members have voted secretly.    The renewalists have experienced the situation differently.  The fact that the powerful Andalusian federation is swelling  their ranks is regarded as the most important success in this  whole struggle, since it was Guerra's fief. The Guerraists won  35.3 percent of the Andalusian votes, as against 64.7 percent  for the renewalists, which means that the latter will send 149  delegates to the congress, against 81 for the Guerraists.  <H5>  Unexpected Triumph </H5>   The renewalists' satisfaction has been rounded off by their  absolutely unexpected success in Murcia, where the Guerraists  have become a minority by two votes. The renewalists have also  triumphed in their traditional fiefs, such as Castilla-La  Mancha. Even an alternative list put forward in Toledo by  Fernando Mora, secretary to former Interior Minister Jose Luis  Corcuera, was swept aside. Yesterday, in light of the results,  Castilla-La Mancha premier and prominent renewalist Jose Bono  stated: "Unity, which will undoubtedly prevail at our congress,  will no longer be achieved through impositions. Because renewal  has won, integration will be possible."    Gonzalez and Guerra followed the weekend's process  expectantly. Nothing is known about the "number two," but  something is known about the secretary general. Gonzalez will  continue with his view that his role is that of arbitrator, and  it is now up to him to reduce the tension which this process has  created in his party. Over the past few days, Gonzalez has  expressed his desire to have sufficient freedom to design an  Executive Committee of integration with which he can work  comfortably. With these results he has achieved this.    With the argument that the less power Guerra has, the less  pressured Gonzalez will feel, the renewalist leaders deem it  good for their strategy that the Guerraists have lost ground  over the past few days. From this viewpoint, Alfonso Guerra  will no longer have sufficient strength to impose all the  henchmen he would like to have in the new Executive Committee,  so his future depends on what Felipe Gonzalez decides.    Over the next few days the Socialist leader will continue to  hold meetings with all regional party secretaries in order to  learn their views on the situation following these internal  elections and on what the next Executive Committee should be  like. So far he has met with renewalist Jose Bono, Basque  Socialist Party Secretary General Ramon Jauregui, and Valencian  premier Joan Lerma. The last two men, both renewalists, will  lead delegations under the integration label, since prominent  Guerraists figure in a minority in their ranks. After meeting  with Gonzalez a few days ago, Lerma also met with the deputy  secretary general.    Gonzalez wishes to settle the debate on the lists  immediately, and redirect the PSOE's concern to the political  reports. Last Thursday, he clearly said that he will disclose  no more names of the Executive Committee's future members until  the March congress. Gonzalez has remarked that the many  international delegations which will be attending the congress  are very interested in learning what the Socialist Party's  proposals are after 11 years in power.

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Islington to appeal over swaps ruling ISLINGTON Borough Council in north London has decided to appeal against last month's High Court decision that it should repay more than Pounds 1m made under invalid swap agreements to WestDeutsche Landesbank. The ruling was made in the first test case since the Lords ruled two years ago that councils had no power to enter interest-rate swap agreements. The Lords' decision left 80 banks facing losses of Pounds 560m. On Friday, Kleinwort Benson won a second test case against South Tyneside council. It was awarded almost Pounds 2m in principal and interest payments.</p>

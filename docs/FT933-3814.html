			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / International Company News: Fortis takes ASLK-CGER stake FORTIS, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, yesterday agreed to take an initial 25 per cent stake in ASLK-CGER, the Belgian state-owned savings group, for BFr15bn (Dollars 425m), as a first step towards acquiring a 50 per cent holding for a total of BFr35bn. The deal, which hinged on yesterday's agreement by the Belgian government to amend national legislation, effectively paves the way for the first big privatisation under the country's four-year programme of selling off state assets to reduce the budget deficit. Fortis, which is jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and AG of Belgium, will deposit BFr15bn into an escrow account next week to pay for the 25 per cent stake. The company will be given a put option on these shares in case final agreement cannot be reached on the remaining 25 per cent stake. It aims to buy a further 24.9 per cent stake by October 15 for BFr20bn. The remaining 0.1 per cent stake will be transferred on January 1, 1995, completing ASLK-CGER's transformation into a 50-50 private-public partnership. Under the legislative amendments approved in Brussels yesterday, the Belgian government will be allowed to reduce its stake in ASLK-CGER to a minimum of 25.1 per cent. A Fortis spokeswoman in the Netherlands said the company may be interested in lifting its stake above 50 per cent eventually, but added that this was premature. The company is examining how it will pay for its stake in ASLK-CGER, which, like Fortis itself, is active in insurance and banking.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / World Trade News: SA-Japan flights agreed SOUTH AFRICA has reached in principle an agreement with Japan to allow the first direct flights between the two countries from next year, writes Gordon Cramb in Tokyo. The transport ministry in Tokyo said yesterday the accord, still subject to parliamentary and other approvals, had followed talks in Pretoria which ended on Friday. Japan restored diplomatic links last year. It was South Africa's leading trading partner until 1987 when it curbed further growth in commercial dealings. Sanctions have since been lifted, but bilateral trade remained unchanged in dollar terms last year at Dollars 3.57bn, with South Africa enjoying a modest surplus. Japanese carriers are to be allowed a total of two flights a week into Johannesburg from any departure point, while South African Airways is to have the same number of weekly slots at the new Kansai international airport being built near Osaka. But Japanese holidaymakers are likely to be wary of South Africa until political violence there is quelled.</p>

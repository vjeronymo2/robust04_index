			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: A tremor on the veldt . . . After months of being told by eager brokers that South Africa was now an excellent place to put money, this week's surprise resignation by respected finance minister Derek Keys proved something of a shock to investors. Although his official statement stressed his decision arose from personal and not policy concerns, the suddenness of the announcement and the lack of a detailed explanation led to widespread fears that a serious clash inside the cabinet actually was responsible and that economic policies might soon be jettisoned. As the news reached the markets, gilts soared (moving above 15 per cent), stocks tumbled and the financial rand, the barometer of international financial confidence, dropped sharply. South African stocks in London were hit particularly hard, and market sentiment will be tested on Tuesday when the first global launch of a convertible bond issue by a South African company, life assurer Liberty Life, is priced. Yet, despite the government's inept handling of the affair, it seems increasingly clear that Keys' move does not signal any change in direction. The appointment of an apolitical career banker, Christo Liebenberg, as his successor and strong statements by both President Mandela and deputy finance minister Alec Erwin, stressing their commitment to fiscal discipline, have helped to reassure the markets. While there is lingering disappointment that a man as capable as Keys has decided to go, and some fears that Liebenberg might not be up to the political challenges, there is general relief that the spirit of the coalition government of national unity is intact and its public commitment to cutting the budget deficit unchanged. 'I think it has served as a wake-up call,' said one Johannesburg dealer. 'Everyone knew things couldn't go perfectly forever, and the overall picture still looks pretty good.' This month sees the launch of the UK's first South Africa unit trusts by Credit Suisse and Save &amp; Prosper, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. The fund managers are unperturbed by this week's events. 'It is a glitch and does not change the investment case,' said Neil Gregson, Credit Suisse fund manager. 'The markets were initially in turmoil on rumours of the resignation and, although bonds may stay weak, the currency will probably soon be back to where it started.' Marina Lloyd, Save &amp; Prosper's fund manager, added: 'We have stressed that political risk will remain in the short and medium term, but we do feel there is huge potential for the economy.'

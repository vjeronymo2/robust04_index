			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: A noble bass NICOLAI Ghiaurov sang a Wigmore 'Master Concert' on Thursday, thoroughly satisfying and therefore remarkable. Recitals by opera-stars tend to be dicky affairs. Sooner or later they get to the operatic arias their fans expect, which are almost always disappointing with mere piano accompaniments; for anything that comes before, they may lack experience or aptitude. Most often with Italian voices, the first hour or so is filled up by 18th-century songs and perhaps a little Rossini. French artists try on some Gounod, Massenet or Debussy, perhaps even Hahn or Poulenc; Germans inherit the richest song-repertoire of all, and are most rigorously drilled in it. Artists from musical fringe-countries have to live up to grander foreign challenges. Without any hint of trimming his style Ghiaurov sang only recital-scale songs, all in Russian but for the dry Ibert 'Don Quichotte' numbers. His bass is magnificently black, stylish too, and unlike most opera singers he knows how to shift gracefully into recital-mode. Though his short programme might (for all I know) have comprised all the song-repertoire at his disposal, he delivered all of it superbly. In his opening Tchaikovsky group he was still warming up, but the whole-body reverberations of his voice made themselves powerfully felt even before he reached 'Don Juan's Serenade'. That drew as much upon his wry urbanity as on the depths of his bass; and his Ibert songs exploited both on a perfectly judged scale. After the interval he explored four Dargomizhsky character-studies - penetrating, ironical, brilliantly varied - with the utmost psychological finesse, and then explored Mussorgsky's Songs and Dances of Death. Those had more sonorously tender, open, shuddery, lethal finality than in any live performance I can remember. By then Ghiaurov was calibrating his cavernous tone exactly to the scale of the hall, with profound effect. There were awed 'bravo's' - though his accompanist Pavlina Dokovska was merely alert and competent, not much more. With a partner who matched him in stern depth and weight, Ghiaurov would be mightily dismaying in this grim music. Sponsors: the Friends of the Wigmore Hall</p>

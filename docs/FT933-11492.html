			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Arts: Warmth in the frozen north - Kuhmo Festival West of the Russian border and just below the Arctic Circle, the Finnish town of Kuhmo boasts 13,000 souls and more than 600 lakes. In the ordinary English sense of 'town', only slightly more than half the population lives there, with the rest scattered amid 5500 square kilometres of Kainuu wilderness. Kuhmo 'town' was badly hit in the last war; nothing of distinction remains to it but its fine, spacious wooden church from the last century - and the beautiful Northern lakescape. For no fathomable reason, the cellist Seppo Kimanen decided to found a 'Kuhmo Chamber Music' festival there in 1970. (The locals were bemused; many of them still are.) It has become one of the world's happiest music festivals, as this year the 24th festival confirmed again, in spite of carnivorous mosquitoes. Outside of Scandinavia not many people know that, except for musicians; and it would be self-defeating if many more did. There is a magic formula, as it happens, though it is flexible enough to be re-interpreted every year, and may anyhow be unfeasible anywhere but in Kuhmo. It goes something like this: From many countries, invite the keenest, most musicianly chamber-players available, including full-time ensembles such as the Lindsay Quartet (Kuhmo regulars) but also established soloists whose careers leave too little space for chamber music except in their holidays. For derisory fees but superior rewards, let them deliver their best party-pieces, individually and plurally, but insist also that they work with newly-met colleagues on fresh performances of music old and new. Further, some will be teaching and/or running master-classes for the 'Music Camp' of student talent from around the world. Shape all that into a programme with some coherent themes: this July, we had all Mozart's and Boccherini's quintets, Haydn piano trios, a survey of recent Icelandic music, Austro-German and French classics, old and new music from Japan (Kimanen's wife is Yoshiko Arai, leader of his Sibelius Quartet). Add some premieres, some recherche rediscoveries and some pieces for odd ensembles. Make it all so intensive, with music practically round the clock, that the idyllic simplicity of the place will be the perfect restorative. The marathon Saturday night concerts - 'night' is the wrong word - are still going on while sunset merges into sunrise. Nobody dresses up, neither artists nor the audience. It is a rare, illuminating pleasure to hear first-class musicians working out ideas and responding to each other, so to speak, on-the-hoof. If something does not work, no harm done, no reputation endangered; contrariwise these performances can strike brighter sparks, again and again, than stuff polished for the international circuit. It is a boon to have such artists to introduce the unfamiliar pieces, too, which may never have enjoyed playing of this calibre. This year, for example, the flautist Philippa Davies, the clarinettist Michael Collins and the cellist Robert Cohen came from Britain, Stephen Burns brought his trumpet from America, and the pianists Christian Ivaldi and Philippe Cassard were on hand to ensure strict faithfulness to French style (the Franco-British collaborations in Poulenc were splendid). More about all this in the Weekend FT, especially about Kuhmo's wonderful new concert hall.</p>

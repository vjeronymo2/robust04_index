			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / French outburst over UK may be a cry for help: Prime Minister Beregovoy's attack on British policies was not solely for home consumption THE outburst against Britain last week by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister - triggered by Hoover's decision to close a vacuum cleaner factory in Dijon and shift production to Scotland - was one of the stiffest public criticisms ever heaped by one European Community head of government upon another. But there is more to it than meets the eye. French officials stressed that while they did not want to spark a diplomatic row, Mr Beregovoy's statement - that Britain was heading down a dead-end - was not only heartfelt, but it was a symptom of a general malaise, deeper than the Hoover problem. This includes anxiety over Britain's refusal to sign the EC social charter - designed to reduce differences in labour conditions between community countries - its delay in ratifying the Maastricht treaty on monetary and political union, and the competitive advantage accorded to British exports by the fall in sterling's value after its exit from the European monetary system. A few days earlier, Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, had criticised Britain's policies of 'every man for himself'. In short, Britain looks a decreasingly reliable friend at a time when France needs all the help it can get to counterbalance growing German power. 'We need Britain, but it is not always there, especially on many European issues. This weighs on many other subjects,' said a French foreign office official. As Mr Beregovoy said a day earlier: 'One must know if Great Britain wants to be a full part of Europe. . . Great Britain must be placed in front of its responsibilities.' The shadow of next month's parliamentary elections, in which the ruling Socialists are set for a humiliating defeat, helps to explain why the government is in no mood to make friendly gestures to London. One of Mr Beregovoy's officials explained that the fight over Hoover was all part of the government's attempts to defend its European policies in the face of sceptics in the opposition Gaullist RPR. The Gaullists based their Maastricht referendum campaign on the theme of how the EC could harm powerless French citizens. 'I recognise it was a bit quick tempered. . . but Britain has been taken a bit as a counter-model in an election campaign in which, to put it very bluntly, social policy on the left stands against economic liberalism on the right,' the Beregovoy aide explained. Just how much relations with Britain have become part of the election campaign was underlined when Mr Philippe Seguin, the RPR member of parliament who led the anti-Maastricht campaign, told the newspaper Le Monde that France and Britain should seek more common positions on European policy. But how serious are the other sore points? Mr Beregovoy cares deeply about the social charter, which he said was essential to getting ordinary people to support European construction. He even claimed that Mr Major could increase his parliamentary majority by signing the charter, an idea likely to cause merriment in Westminster. He made no reference to the attacks on the franc in his criticism of Britain, but there is a general suspicion in French government and opposition circles that there is US and UK political pressure to break the link between the franc and the D-Mark, defence of which has the status of a religious crusade among mainstream French politicians. Even the mild Mr Raymond Barre, a former prime minister, last week denounced 'a political assault' from 'Anglo-Saxon circles' against the franc/D-Mark parity and the Franco-German alliance. Meanwhile, France has just started to feel the effects of sterling's competitive devaluation. This is unlikely to improve tempers in the government. UK exports to France rose 5.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year, according to the British government. Yet all this is unlikely to spark a serious diplomatic row. Neither side wants one, as French and British diplomats in Paris emphasised. Some British Conservative MPs did react angrily, accusing Mr Beregovoy of electioneering. If he was indeed electioneering, it fell on deaf ears. The day after, not a single French national newspaper reported his outburst.</p>

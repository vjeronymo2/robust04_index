			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Finland's Dollars 1.5bn global issue priced to attract US investors A stronger tone to government bond markets yesterday helped provide a marginally better backdrop for the launch of two global bond offerings, totalling Dollars 3bn, for Freddie Mac, the US mortgage agency, and Finland. However, the weakness of the dollar continued to dampen European and Asian demand for dollar-denominated paper. Finland's Dollars 1.5bn issue of 10-year bonds was launched at an indicated yield spread of 55 basis points over the 10-year US Treasury. Dealers said that initial indications had suggested a spread of 50 basis points, but the wider margin proved necessary in order to attract US investors. Because of the weakness of the dollar, the deal had to be priced to sell to US investors, dealers said. Normally, the bid for a European sovereign borrower such as Finland would be stronger in Europe than the US. 'Our experience at the moment is that European investors will only come in when they see an anchor bid in the US,' said one head of syndicate in London. This means that in many cases new issues are being priced more generously than secondary market levels would indicate. Freddie Mac's debut global offering, launched after several weeks of investor roadshows, benefited from having a five-year rather than a 10-year maturity, which allowed the deal to draw in European retail investors. The deal will be priced today at an indicated spread of 16 to 18 basis points over the five-year Treasury yield. In the floating-rate note sector, Italy's three tranches of notes in dollars, yen and D-Marks were all priced yesterday in the middle of the ranges indicated (12 basis points over Libor for the dollar tranche, nine basis points for the yen tranche and 13 for the D-Mark tranche). In spite of its more generous pricing, dealers said the D-Mark segment was struggling somewhat. In the sterling domestic market, Kilroot Electric, guaranteed by Kilroot Power, a Northern Irish power station, launched a Pounds 198.5m issue of bonds via BZW and Salomon Brothers. The deal is the first limited recourse financing of a power station in Europe through a bond issue. However, in the wake of privatisation, many power projects are now approaching a stage of maturity where refinancing in the bond market may be attractive. The proceeds will be used to repay existing bank debt. The issue has a semi-annual coupon of 9.5 per cent and an average life of 16.4 years, due to amortisation and a sinking fund. BZW said it was placed mainly with UK pension funds and insurance companies.</p>

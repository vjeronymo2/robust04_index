			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Directors at 3i resign after cuts THREE directors of 3i, the venture-capital company owned by the Bank of England and the clearing banks, resigned yesterday as a result of staff cuts announced last month, Charles Batchelor writes. Two of the directors, Mr John Petrie and Mr Clive Brook, headed 3i's Brighton and Milton Keynes offices respectively. Those offices are to close as the branch network is streamlined. The other director to resign was Mr Stephen Denford, in charge of 3i's Southampton office, which will remain open.  The three resignations leave 3i with a total of 26 directors responsible for UK investments. The senior decision-making body at 3i is its six-strong executive committee. The cost-cutting programme announced in October involved the closure of five of 3i's 22 regional offices and the shedding of 100 jobs. 3i has been forced to postpone public flotation several times in recent months because of the recession.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Our informed military sources in Sanaa inform that  there is an obscure difference between the ranks of the  commanders and officers in north Yemen on the issue of the  failed war which was led by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih against the  people in the Democratic Republic of Yemen. The information  says that secret meetings were held during the last three days  between the groups of the non-Sanhanian [not further identified]  commanders, which made 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih issue orders to  collect all the forces and means that remain with him and to  raise his photographs [as heard] on them in 48 camps in an  attempt to delude the others that he is still strong after it  had become certain to him that his recent directives to enter  Aden had failed. The sources confirmed that time for 'Ali Salih  is no more gold [as heard] and he is now thinking of what will  secure the establishment of the regime of the iron fist in Sanaa.</p>

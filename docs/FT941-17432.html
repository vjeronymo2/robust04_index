			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Weakening bonds hold Dow to narrow gain Wall Street US blue chip stocks edged higher yesterday but the broader indices slipped, as a weak bond market overshadowed two favourable readings on the economy, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.51 ahead at 3,756.60, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.02 at 465.43. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged up 0.09 to 477.24, but the Nasdaq composite dropped 6.04 to 770.76 in a decline exaggerated by thin trading. NYSE volume came to 279.2m shares. The initial trading day of the new year brought one of the first tangible signs of sustained economic expansion in the first quarter. The National Association of Purchasing Management said its December composite index of manufacturing conditions, an important leading indicator, rose to 57.9 per cent from November's 55.7 per cent reading. It was the highest since January 1993. Separately, the Commerce Department announced that construction spending in November had climbed 1.8 per cent, for the seventh consecutive gain. However, the report carried less significance for the bond market, which is looking ahead for signals of mounting inflationary pressures. In late trading the benchmark 30-year bond was down a point to 97 13/16 , hovering at its lowest level since August. In reaction to the downturn, an early 10-point gain in the Dow Industrial index was eroded quickly and many issues finished well off their opening quotations. Among a handful of blue chips showing solid gains, Du Pont was up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 49 1/2 , Philip Morris Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 57 5/8 , Alcoa Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 70 5/8 and IBM Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 57 3/4 . A like number of issues showed substantial declines. Ford retreated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 63 3/8 , Allied Signal Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 77 3/4 , Goodyear Tire Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 and Sears Roebuck Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 51 1/4 . Federated Department Stores jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 23 after revealing plans to seek control of the bankrupt RH Macy, and create the largest US department store chain. Toys 'R' Us shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 40 in spite of better than expected Christmas sales. The fall followed the announcement of a management transition at the company. Mining issues gained ground on higher gold prices. Placer Dome added Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 27 5/8 , American Barrick Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 30 1/4 and Newmont Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 49 1/4 . The Toronto market was closed.</p>

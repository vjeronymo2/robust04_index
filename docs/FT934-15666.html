			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / BCCI trial opens in Abu Dhabi THE trial in Abu Dhabi of 13 former officers of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International has been adjourned until 13 November following a preliminary hearing on Saturday. All of the defendants in court - 11 of the 13 charged - pleaded not guilty to the charges which include fraud, forgery, bribery and mismanagement. If found guilty, each could face up to three years in jail on any one of the charges. Mr Mohammed Saleh Naqvi, a former chief executive, is charged on nine counts. Others, including Mr Agha Hassan Abedi, the bank's founder and president who is being tried in absentia, face up to a similar number. In his opening statement, Mr Adli Mahmoud, the Egyptian public prosecutor, said the attorney general's office had had severe difficulty identifying the nature and extent of the alleged fraud because of the 'family system' on which the bank operated, where those concerned were bound by friendship and personal ties originating in Pakistan. As bank officers, 'they were all very careful not to give information which could harm each other', he claimed. Abu Dhabi's exposure to BCCI and related entities amounted to Dollars 9.4bn, of which some Dollars 1bn may be recoverable in the longer term. If, as is possible, the private department of Sheikh Zayed, the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, institutes civil proceedings against the accused to seek compensation for financial losses, then the court proceedings could run on indefinitely. It is more likely, however, that the criminal trial will proceed on its own, in which case the trial could last up to six months.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Project finance Reports that the government may be prepared to invest up to Pounds 1.5bn of public funds in the Channel tunnel rail link provide further confirmation that a sea change may indeed be sweeping through Whitehall. Such numbers, though, must be treated with scepticism, given that the talks between the public and private sectors are at such an early stage. It would be bizarre if the government chose to publicise the precise level of its funding commitment in advance. That would only weaken the Treasury's negotiating hand. The suspicion must be that the headline number may include the costs the government has already sunk into Eurostar's new train sets and into upgrading existing rail lines. It is far from clear how much new money will be forthcoming. However, considerable public generosity will be required to prime the pump and entice the private sector into participating in the project. The link may be a political imperative but the government will have to work in a competitive global marketplace for capital and skills. Perhaps Sir Alastair Morton's private finance working group, which meets again today, can help ginger up Whitehall thinking some more.</p>

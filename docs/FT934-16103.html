			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / World Trade News: General in the war for free trade - Gatt chief who leaves nothing to chance in his quest for a Uruguay Round deal WITHIN a month of his arrival in July as head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Mr Peter Sutherland put the world trade body on a virtual war footing. With what is now generally agreed to be the final deadline for the Uruguay Round of trade liberalising talks just 10 weeks away, he is leaving nothing to chance to secure a successful outcome. Once a week and sometimes more often, a dozen close aides gather in Mr Sutherland's office overlooking Lake Geneva to take stock of the final stages of the negotiations and to plan strategy for the coming days and weeks. Where are blockages emerging? Which countries need chivvying? Should certain delegations be brought in for consultations with Gatt staff? Would a telephone call from Mr Sutherland to the relevant minister be helpful? 'We are looking at anything that would drive the process forward,' says one member of the strategy group. It includes Mr Richard O'Toole, Mr Sutherland's chef de cabinet (who performed the same function in Brussels in 1985-89 when Mr Sutherland, an Irish lawyer, was EC competition commissioner), the three deputy directors general and senior staff responsible for specific areas of the Uruguay Round negotiations. Mr Sutherland argues that if no deal is reached by the December 15 deadline, when US negotiating authority expires, the seven-year-old round is doomed. This, he believes, would be a disaster not only for world growth prospects but for global economic security and political stability. A collapse of the negotiations would not mean a continuation of the status quo but a disintegration of the present system of trading rules and an upsurge in trade conflicts and protectionism, with dangerous consequences for economic and political reform in the developing world and eastern Europe. Mr Sutherland's central message to world leaders is thus that the Uruguay Round is not an 'optional extra' but 'arguably the most important and urgent issue on the world agenda today'. 'It's a softening-up period designed to get people desperate for a deal,' says one insider. 'We're trying to create a climate for negotiation that will ensure the flexibility needed to conclude the round successfully.' So far this campaign has had two principal dimensions - an unprecedented effort to spread the word through the news media and a gruelling personal travel schedule for Mr Sutherland. By the end of October, he will have met ministers and sometimes heads of government of virtually every important trading nation. He has already met ministers from most leading industrial countries and Latin American countries, visited Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, to discuss the critical issue of farm trade reform. He has also been in regular contact with Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. This weekend he will be in Singapore for talks with ministers from the Association of South-East Asian Nations, and later this month he will travel to Tokyo to see Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister. Mr Sutherland has used these opportunities to give dozens of speeches, news conferences and press interviews and to use his considerable gifts of persuasion to sway opinion formers behind the scenes. During his recent trip to the US, for instance, he 'spoke to just about everyone who makes or influences US decisions on trade', according to one observer, including Mr Kantor, congressional leaders, business groups and journalists. Another tactic has been to publicise the far-reaching benefits of a Gatt deal to counter the noisy but limited interest groups demanding trade protection. A first well-timed and telling fact sheet issued just before the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo in July stressed the role of trade in creating new and better jobs in industrialised countries. A second, released in August, drew attention to the high and often hidden costs of trade protection for consumers and taxpayers. In the next, even more difficult, stage of his overall strategy, Mr Sutherland will be hoping to translate the political desire for a Uruguay Round agreement into the concessions necessary to secure it. He has already warned the US and EC that the onus is on them to make the Round a success. But he is urging all governments to be more forthcoming in the critical negotiations under way in Geneva on improving market access for foreign goods and services, and has called for restraint in trying to open up the draft accords on fair trade rules compiled in 1991 by Mr Arthur Dunkel, his predecessor. For the moment, the main priority is to get a wide-ranging package of tariff cuts and other market-opening measures that will give the 116 participants tangible benefits from the Round. This, it is hoped, will pave the way for difficult concessions on the rules, including the 'multilateralisation' of the troubled US/EC Blair House accord on farm subsidies. Mr Sutherland concedes there is still a 'substantial risk' the talks could founder. If so, it will not be due to lack of effort on his part. He and fellow-lawyers Mr Kantor and Sir Leon have the ability to reach a deal, says one seasoned Gatt-watcher. 'If these guys can't do it, nobody can'.</p>

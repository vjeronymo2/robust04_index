			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: MEDICAL  </P> <P> Luther Medical Products Inc., a Tustin-based catheter manufacturer, said it has  received $500,000 from a Japanese firm for the rights to market Luther's newest  catheter in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and Hong Kong.  </P> <P> Tate Scott, Luther's executive vice president, said the Japanese firm does not  want to be identified until it begins its overseas marketing campaign sometime  within the next 12 months. Scott would say only that the firm is a major  distributor of catheters in Japan.  </P> <P> Scott said the catheter covered by the new licensing will be sold under the  trade name ACTIV. He said the catheter is exceptionally thin and thus easier to  insert in veins for intravenous feedings and medications. Once in the vein, the  catheter expands to allow greater flow of medication and softens to increase  patient comfort.  </P> <P> Scott said Luther's agreement with the Japanese marketing firm extends over 10  years.  </P> <P> Discussions are under way with other companies to distribute ACTIV catheters in  the United States and worldwide, Scott said.  </P></p>

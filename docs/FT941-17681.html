			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: Rothmans Asia plan thwarted Rothmans International's radical plans to merge its tobacco operations in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia into a single company have been rejected by shareholders in the Malaysian company. The vote dealt a heavy blow to Rothmans' ambitions to strengthen its position in the developing cigarette markets of the Pacific Rim. Independent directors of Rothmans of Pall Mall (Malaysia) - 50 per cent owned by the international group - had recommended the merger, which had earlier been agreed by shareholders in Rothmans Industries of Singapore. Mr Anthony Jones, managing director of the Malaysian company, said he was 'very disappointed' by the rejection. Shareholders' concerns had been adequately addressed at meetings during the past week, he believed. 'Frankly, I'm a little nonplussed at the result.' Rothmans has not disclosed details of the shareholders' objections but they are understood to have argued strongly for maintaining an independent Malaysian company rather than pooling resources in a regional operation. Leading dissenters are believed to include the Malaysian government's main investment arm, which holds 17.87 per cent, and the armed forces retirement fund, with 8.79 per cent. Analysts, who expect shares in the Malaysian and Singapore companies to fall sharply when trading resumes on Monday, said investors may also have been worried about dilution of their stakes in the merger and the prospect of slow returns from new markets. Rothmans, which would have owned 50 per cent of the new company, with the rest split between Malaysian and Singaporean shareholders, said the restructuring would have caused initial dilution of earnings but held out the prospect of higher future dividends. The group now has to decide whether its plans can be revised to win Malaysian support or to continue its merger of the Hong Kong, a wholly-owned unit, and Singapore interests without Malaysia. Mr Jones, however, conceded yesterday that 'without Malaysia in the mix, it's not as attractive an option. Malaysia was very central.' Rothmans' merger strategy - launched last February - would have enabled the group to concentrate cash resources and management expertise to accelerate the exploitation of the region's cigarette markets. The Hong Kong operation holds rights to markets in China, which accounts for a third of world cigarette consumption with 1,700bn cigarettes a year, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. But high development costs in marketing and establishing sales and distribution networks have so far resulted in trading losses. The Singapore company has access to growth markets in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Burma, as well as estimated cash reserves of Pounds 84m (Dollars 124m). Malaysia, with a mature domestic market in which growth is slowing, has an estimated Pounds 207m cash. The merger would thus have created a regional company - capitalised at more than Pounds 1bn - with greater potential for future growth than any of its constituents, according to analysts.</p>

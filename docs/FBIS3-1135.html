			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report summarizing allegations contained in the Goldstone </F> Commission report on police involvement illegal weapons  distribution and other activities by correspondents John Perlman  and Bronwyn Littleton]    [Text]  <H5>  The Allegations </H5>   These include gun-running to men involved in hit squads, the  illegal manufacture of weapons, the issuing of false documents  and passports and the orchestration of violence to destabilise  the country.    According to a written memorandum from "Q" [former South  African Police officer who supplied information to the Goldstone  Commission] generals Basie Smit and Krappies Engelbrecht,  supported by IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] members Themba Khoza  and Victor Ndlovu, initiated the gun-manufacturing project for  the purpose of orchestrating violence.    Until about 18 months ago, the unit was involved in the  manufacture of homemade weapons on the East Rand and in  Silverton. Warrant-Officer Snor Vermeulen, Warrant-Officer  Lionel Snyman and Warrant-Officer Dawid Britz -- all members of  C10 -- directed this operation. Other weapons from Koevoet  [former South-West Africa counterinsurgency unit] supplies had  been transported to Vlakplaas and later to Murrayhill (Mechem).  The weapons were cleaned in acid and their serial numbers  removed. The weapons were then placed in black bags and  distributed to IFP members. Later, weapons were also received  from Mozambique. When the unit's arms supply ran low, they  bought weapons from Brooklyn Circle Arms. Five former  operatives of Vlakplaas testified to the following.    A large quantity of weapons from Koevoet was transported to  Vlakplaas in the late 1980s, including AK-47s, mortars, RPG-7  rockets and hand grenades. Many of these weapons were supplied  to Inkatha. Later the arms were transferred to a nearby farm  and some were stored at the Speskop military installation.    Former Vlakplaas commander Eugene de Kock had arranged for  the purchase of firearms from a weapons shop in Pretoria,  including Glock pistols. The weapons were bought in the name of  Badger Arms, one of several front companies run by De Kock.    The men worked extensively with false documents, including  passports. When Vlakplaas eventually disbanded, Brigadier  Beukes and Colonel Cronje, both of SAP [South African Police]  headquarters in Pretoria, arranged false identity documents and  passports.    This information was tested through the Department of Home  Affairs and the SAP and found to be true.  <H5>  The Men Involved </H5>   According to the main informant, known as "Q", Unit C1 at  Vlakplaas, later known as C10, under the command of Colonel  Eugene de Kock, had been involved since 1989 in violence aimed  at the destabilisation of South Africa, including the  organisation of hostel and train violence. The operations were  under the command of Lieutenant-General Baise Smit and  Major-General Krappies Engelbrecht. Lieutenant-General Johan de  Roux, head of Crime Combating and Investigation Services, had  full knowledge of, and was involved in, these activities. Dries  (Brood) van Heerden, a former Vlakplaas man now a senior  security official at ABSA [Almagamated Banks of South Africa]  bank, was involved in distributing the weapons, employing only  Zulus loyal to the IFP. He was assisted by another ABSA  official, Douglas Crew.    Others involved in the project were Eugene de Kock, Brood  van  Heerden, Willie Nortje, Charlie Chate, Chappies Klopper, Snor  Vermeulen, Lionel Synman and Dawid Britz, all from unit C10,  Vossie de Kock and Koekies Koekemoer of the East Rand Murder and  Robbery Unit; Larry Hinton, Laurie Wasserman and Andy Taylor of  the Durban security police; and the then KwaZulu Police  Commissioner General Jac Buchner.    Evidence was that Engelbrecht had at all times been involved  in the projects and approved payments from the fund.  <H5>  The Inkatha Connection </H5>   IFP Transvaal leader Themba Khoza was recruited by Brood van  Heerden and Victor Ndlovu later joined them. They distributed  weapons. Khoza was caught at a roadblock with some of these  arms on September 4 1990. Unit C10 paid his bail and legal  fees, Khoza concocted a story about the weapons and was  acquitted.    The project also involved crash courses in weapons and  grenade training for IFP members.    Khoza was issued with a car and he and Victor Ndlovu were  paid as "informers" using false names. They were also supplied  with firearms.    Some of the arms distributed to the IFP were manufactured by  Vlakplaas members at Mechem, a subsidiary of Denel.    The commission further noted that an investigation into  KwaZulu Police [KZP], hit squads, made public last December, had  been blocked by a Brigadier E du Preez "in direct contradiction"  of a decision made after a meeting with President de Klerk.    The commission said there was "convincing evidence" that  "elements in the KZP have been and are still involved in hit  squad activities in Natal and also in the Transvaal". An  officer investigating this said there was evidence "indicating  the involvement of members of the SAP security police in hit  squad activities".    The commission criticized the deputy-commissioner of the  KZP,  Major-General Mathe, whose name "over years (has) been linked  with improper conduct in the course of his official duties".  <H5>  The Cover-Ups </H5>   The commission was told that on Engelbrecht's orders, all  files and correspondence relating to Inkatha were to be  destroyed. The commission also received information that  Engelbrecht had instructed C10 members of dig up information  compromise Goldstone so that he could be "persuaded" to drop the  inquiry.    Lieutenant-Colonel Botha told the commission that  Engelbrecht  had requested a Brigadier Schoeman to report that Englebrecht's  department was not involved in the matters under investigation.    The commission also has information that Smit helped to  quash  an investigation of motor theft against Lieutenant Piet Botha,  one of the directors of Intercol.    Two police officers, Colonel Roelf Venter and Major Henning  Brand, approached Major du Plessis and attempted to find out  how the Goldstone Commission investigation was proceeding.  Venter later asked Du Plessis to keep Engelbrecht informed on  who was giving information to the commission and what the  National Intelligence Service was passing on.    At the suggesting of the Commissioner of Police, General  Johan van der Merwe, and Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel,  the allegations were put to generals Smit, Engelbrecht and Le  Roux and colonels De Kock, Venter and Bellingham. Venter said  Engelbrecht had put a stop to his investigation into alleged  arms importation by De Kock.  <H5>  Guns for Money </H5>   There was testimony that De Kock himself took some of the  money he received in payment for the arms. De Kock was paid by  the IFP for the weapons. Although he left the SAP almost a year  ago with a R[rand]1.2-million "golden handshake" -- with the  approval of the Cabinet -- he continued with the project. De  Kock, Vermeulen, and other operatives Paul van Dyk, Jeff Bosigo,  Joe Mamesela and Lucas Kalino, left the SAP with huge payouts to  keep them quiet. The Askaris [former African National Congress  guerrillas working for police] were paid between R200,000 and  R600,000 each.    The commission was supplied with information about two front  companies, Eastech and Intercol, set up by De Kock was in excess  of R1 million and was approved by the Cabinet.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Electronic bridge clears way for quicker settlement THE new electronic bridge set up last weekend by the world's two largest securities clearing houses is expected to save millions of dollars in transaction costs as well as improving processing speed and market liquidity. In response to the sharp rise in cross-border trading over recent years, Cedel, the Luxembourg-based settlement firm owned by an international consortium of 104 banks, and Brussels-based Euroclear, which is owned by 119 financial institutions and operated by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co, signed an agreement in March 1992 to upgrade the bridge agreement which has existed between them since 1980. The new bridge is aimed at offering customers 'greater efficiency and liquidity, better cash management facilities and improved reporting,' said Mr Andre Lussi, Cedel's chief executive. Previously, transactions between customers of both houses were complicated by the fact that Cedel cleared trades during the day while Euroclear operated overnight, causing a time lag between delivery of securities and payment for them. This meant that users of both systems were losing a day's worth of value and liquidity, and that they had to bear the burden of covering positions exposed by the time lag. With its move to multiple overnight processing, Cedel's clients can settle back-to-back trades with Euroclear participants for same-day value. Clearing information is exchanged twice a night, so that the clearing houses can report their settlements to the banks by the following morning. There are plans to add a third file exchange per night in about a year. Cedel stands to gain most from the new bridge agreement. Until now, the firm has been compensating its clients for the losses caused by the settlement delay. The subsidy cost Cedel some Dollars 65m in 1992 alone, said Mr Lussi. Moreover, Cedel claims it has gained a competitive edge as it will now be processing trades around the clock. However, both houses are likely to move to 24-hour settlement processing eventually. 'There is no question (the bridge) makes Cedel much more competitive,' said Mr John Olds, Euroclear's chief executive. The reason Euroclear went along with the innovation was that 'the market wanted this issue resolved and wants to be able to choose between two viable competitors,' he said. Observers now hope Cedel's savings will primarily benefit its customers. 'Hopefully most of the savings will be passed on to the banks,' said Mr John Langton, chief executive of the International Securities Market Association. Competition between the two houses is set to sharpen as a result of the new bridge. 'It will be interesting to see whether Cedel can claw back some market share' now that they are operating on a level playing field with Euroclear, said Mr John Dowsett, a partner with Luthy, Baillie, Dowsett, Pethick. Until now, Euroclear has held the lion's share of securities turnover. Mr Olds of Euroclear said he would not be surprised if Cedel did gain market share, though he was quick to add 'we have no intention of giving them our business.' At the end of the day, however, the real winner will be the market, observers agree. 'I am delighted to see a new delivery-versus-payment system in place,' said Mr John Langton of ISMA. 'It will be a benefit to the market as a whole.' The bridge comes as ISMA members consider formally changing the Euromarket's existing settlement period from trade date plus seven working days to trade date plus two to three working days. 'I think it's absolutely essential that before the two to three-day period is agreed the bridge is in place,' said ISMA's Mr Langton. Technically, one to two day settlement has been feasible for some time, but its formal implementation may be facilitated by the bridge, observers say. A reduction in the 'open' period between transaction and settlement is seen as reducing the level of counterparty and market risks. Moreover, with shorter settlement, banks need to hold less capital in order to meet regulatory requirements. Both clearing houses emphasise the flexible nature of the new bridge arrangement, the so-called 'evolving bridge'. Contrary to the former bridge agreement, which covered only the most basic areas of mutual interest, the new bridge is designed to to adapt to changing customer requirements and technological changes, and the two houses plan regular contact to discuss these issues as they arise. 'We are competitors, but we have excellent co-operation, and that's good for the market,' Mr Lussi said. Market participants now hope this bridge will lead to similar developments among other clearing houses. 'The market has been very much focused on the relationship between the two competing clearing systems, but what we're doing will probably be repeated in many markets,' said Mr Olds.</p>

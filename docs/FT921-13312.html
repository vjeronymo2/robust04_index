			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls for the fourth consecutive day SHARE prices fell on light selling, and the Nikkei average closed lower for the fourth consecutive trading day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei, which closed below 21,000 for the first time in 15 months on Monday, lost a further 55.52 to 20,858.30. The index rallied during the morning session, setting a day's high of 21,241.31, but later retreated to the day's low of 20,638.04 in the afternoon. Volume remained thin, totalling 230m shares, as institutional investors stayed on the sidelines. Declines led advances by 607 to 358, with 178 issues unchanged. An estimated 211 stocks fell to their lowest levels since the beginning of 1991. The Topix index of all first section issues shed 5.48 to 1,569.43, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved 6.25 to 1,214.26. The Nikkei average gained momentum in the morning on hopes that the Big Four brokerages - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - would announce a support plan for the market. However, a fall in futures prices triggered arbitrage-related unwinding, and disappointment that no concrete measures were announced by the brokerages sent the index lower. Comments by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, disconcerted some market participants. While Mr Hata expressed concern over the sluggish state of the stock market, he pointed out that the Japanese economy had underlying strength, and added that if economic fundamentals were assessed correctly, stock prices should go up. Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities said the market lacked energy, and would move sideways in the near term. 'The index could briefly fall below 20,000,' he added. Some high-technology issues rose on bargain hunting by foreign investors. Hitachi put on Y16 to Y920 and Toshiba Y16 to Y640. Foreign investors were sellers of Mitsubishi Estate, which weakened Y60 to Y1,160. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries fell Y14 to Y640 on small-lot selling. Projections of favourable earnings for the current year had prompted buying late last year, and foreigners were seen supporting the issue yesterday. But domestic investors, discouraged by the recent decline in the share price, were seen liquidating their holdings. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 78.93 down at 22,194.93 in volume of 130.6m shares. Selling by individuals to meet margin calls depressed the index. Business centred on large-lot cross trading by financial institutions. Osaka Gas, the most active issue of the day, dipped Y10 to Y539. Roundup TOKYO'S weakness continued to weigh on markets in the Pacific Rim. AUSTRALIA fell 1.3 per cent on comments by Mr Paul Keating, the country's treasurer, that there would be no further easing of interest rates for the moment. The All Ordinaries index finished 21.9 lower at 1,646.6. Turnover increased to ADollars 243m from ADollars 183m. Leading shares were worst hit, with market leader BHP receding 20 cents to ADollars 13.88. CRA lost 12 cents to ADollars 12.78. Adelaide Brighton relieved the gloomy picture, rising 9 cents to ADollars 1.90 amid rumours that Pioneer International will launch a takeover bid. Pioneer was down 4 cents at ADollars 3.08. NEW ZEALAND followed Australia lower. Weakness in Fletcher Challenge, which closed 8 cents down at NZDollars 3.43 on volume of 1.4m shares, weighed on the market. The NZSE-40 index slipped 10.61 to 1,484.43 in turnover of NZDollars 23.5m, against NZDollars 13.9m on Monday. Robt Jones Investments was the most heavily traded issue with 3.7m shares changing hands amid continued heavy selling from Wellington broker Doyle Paterson Brown. The stock, however, ended steady at 30 cents. MANILA finished mixed in moderate trading. The composite index eased 2.0 to 1,301.0 as turnover rose to 163m pesos from 140m. Philippine Long Distance Telephone fell 25 pesos to 975 pesos, following its overnight decline in New York of Dollars 1.12 to Dollars 37.5. Meralco 'B' advanced 12 pesos to 160 pesos. BANGKOK lost ground as investors began taking profits, boosting turnover to a record. The SET index ended 3.81 off at 776.01 in turnover of Bt12.5bn, breaking last Friday's record of Bt12.34bn. SINGAPORE turned higher as dealers reported institutional interest coming from the UK through Hong Kong, and some from Japan. The Straits Times Industrial index added 10.46 at 1,535.85 but turnover eased to SDollars 164m from SDollars 177.3m. KUALA LUMPUR was in easier vein as profit-taking set in after the recent series of gains. The composite index slipped back 1.66 to 570.57. Gaming and resorts issues strengthened after company officials denied reports of an increase in the gaming tax. Resorts World rose 25 cents to MDollars 10.10 while Genting gained 40 cents to MDollars 12.10. SEOUL's composite index weakened 3.87 to 630.00. Turnover was active at Won416.4bn, up from Won397.7bn. The decline was mainly due to a fall in financial and large manufacturing shares, which represent the heaviest portion of the index. TAIWAN continued to rise, the weighted index adding 32.71 at 5,135.35 in turnover of TDollars 62.84bn, after TDollars 53.36bn, the highest since May 1991. BOMBAY registered an all-time high of 2,157.87 before retreating on heavy selling by state-owned investment institutions. The BSE index closed at 2,115.71, up a net 8.64. KARACHI fell for the fifth straight session because of political unrest in the southern province of Sind. The 100-share index lost 47.94 to 1,572.80.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Barclays incurs Pounds 30m after-tax loss: Bad loans have taken the bank into the red for only the second time in its history BARCLAYS has made an after-tax loss of Pounds 30m in the first six months of the year. It is only the second time in the bank's 300-year history that it has disclosed a deficit. It is also the first time that Britain's biggest bank has made a loss due to problems in its core UK operations. Its previous trading deficit in 1987 resulted from provisions against possible losses on loans to less developed countries. The Pounds 30m loss compares with a Pounds 242m profit in the first half of 1991. The sharp decline stemmed from a record charge of Pounds 1.07bn to cover losses on loans, mostly in the UK. However, the board maintained the dividend at 9.15p a share, all of which was paid out of reserves, which meant there was a net drain on capital resources during the period of Pounds 206m. A Barclays executive said the board had debated intensely whether to cut the dividend, culminating in a decision on Monday afternoon by the finance committee. Sir John Quinton, Barclays chairman, said, however, that a cut in the final dividend was possible. 'In the present uncertain economic conditions, it is too early to comment on the final dividend,' he said. He expected loan losses to continue to be high for the next two years, but he was hopeful they would not exceed Pounds 1bn. The bad debt charge included Pounds 200m in respect of problems experienced by five large borrowers. These are thought to include the three property companies Heron Corporation, Olympia &amp; York and Mountleigh. Sir John admitted there had been some 'bad lending' at Barclays and that the bank was reforming its procedures for scrutinising loans. Staff numbers were cut by 2,331 in the half year, most of the reductions coming in the UK. Another 1,500 jobs are expected to go in the second half. Profits of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking and foreign exchange division, fell from Pounds 154m to Pounds 99m. Recently purchased banks in France and Germany, Europeene de Banque and Merck Finck respectively, are still only breaking even. Group profits before tax and provisions rose 16 per cent to Pounds 1.17bn. After provisions, pre-tax profit was Pounds 51m, down from Pounds 378m. An exceptional debit of Pounds 82m covered a fall in the value of businesses being sold. Net interest income rose 4 per cent, because of a widening in the margin between what Barclays pays for deposits and the rate it charges on loans. This increase in the loan margin offset a reduction in the volume of loans outstanding in Barclays' books and also the effects of an increase in the amount of loans classified as non-performing, from which Barclays earns no interest.

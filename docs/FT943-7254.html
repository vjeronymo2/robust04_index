			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Kerry rises 10% to Pounds 15m Kerry, the Irish food group, reported a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to IPounds 15m (Pounds 14.8m) for the first six months of 1994, following strong performances by the food ingredients and convenience food divisions. Overall sales increased 6.5 per cent to IPounds 420m, mainly due to increases in the domestic Irish market and in North America, where Kerry has expanded its food ingredients operations. There was a small decline in sales in European and other markets reflecting the scaling down of the red meat business, signalled earlier this year. Higher margins in the food ingredients and processed foods divisions pushed up operating profits to IPounds 23m, representing margins of 5.52 per cent (5.43 per cent). Sales from food ingredients were up to IPounds 173m (IPounds 153m) due to organic growth and increased contributions from North America. Kerry is starting to feel the benefits of 1993's acquisition of two food ingredient companies in Canada for Dollars 20m, said Mr Frank Hayes, director of corporate affairs. Earlier this year Kerry acquired another food ingredients business in Mexico for Dollars 20m and continued expansion of the foods ingredients division remains the strategic goal, said Kerry's chairman, Mr Michael Hanrahan, yesterday. Kerry Foods, the convenience foods side, also reported increased sales, up from IPounds 127m to IPounds 139m. The scaling back of Meadow Meats, the red meat operation, resulted in a fall in sales in that division to IPounds 80m (IPounds 89m). Kerry Agribusiness, reported a small increase in sales from IPounds 26m to IPounds 28m. Earnings per share emerged at 7.9p (7p). An increased interim dividend of 1p (0.91p) is declared. COMMENT A solid set of results slightly ahead of most forecasts leaves Kerry well positioned to fulfil ambitious full year earnings forecasts of between 20p and 21p per share and full year pre-tax forecasts of about IPounds 39m. The second half will be aided by the beef slaughter in the autumn, further benefits from the Mexican and US acquisitions and a maiden input from Mattesons-Wall's, bought from Unilever in July. Kerry will have it all to do if it is to live up to these expectations, but the company's aggressive management have rarely disappointed in the past. The prospective p/e of between 16.5 and 17 is expensive relative to the rest of the Irish food sector, but reflects Kerry's transition towards being an international food ingredients and processed food company. Comparisons of other international food ingredients companies are perhaps now more relevant as the scaling down of the red meat division will shift the balance further towards these parts of Kerry's operations.</p>

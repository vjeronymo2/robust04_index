			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Mersey port decision attacked Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency, has rejected Pounds 20m plans by Mersey Docks and Harbour Company to build a floating roll-on, roll-off stage and a 27-acre freight terminal at Birkenhead to exploit growing Irish Sea trade. The corporation has instead named London &amp; General Property as the preferred developer of 50 acres of riverside land. It proposes a Pounds 74m scheme, including a floating stage and a 15-acre freight terminal, to be run by an unnamed port operator. Its centrepiece is 27 acres of speculative long-term property development. Mr Trevor Furlong, chief executive of Mersey Docks, said: 'It is absolutely crazy handing over workable waterfront sites for this sort of development. It will constrict expansion of the Mersey as a port. We are growing rapidly and successfully. Who knows what might be needed in 10 years' time?' A clash is likely, with each side mobilising cross-party political support. The dock company can stall the development as it owns part of the land London &amp; General wants for its freight terminal - which also depends on filling in part of Wallasey Dock, over which the dock company has total control. Mersey Docks' legal rights over part of the waterfront involved will enable it to charge another operator whatever it likes for its use. Mersey Docks had rejected a plan similar to London &amp; General's as impractical. The crucial piece of land is called Twelve Quays and is opposite Liverpool Pier Head and the Albert Dock, the development corporation's flagship waterfront tourist project in Liverpool. The dock company wants Twelve Quays as its freight terminal. London &amp; General wants to make it into a science park for emergent technology companies. London &amp; General has three months to finalise plans. Its consortium will include Capital and Regional Properties. Mr Furlong said Mersey Docks would welcome discussions.</p>

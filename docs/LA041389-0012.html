			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> IT'S AN ISSUE OF RIGHT AND WRONG  </P> <P> The Supreme Court's abortion ruling did not occur in a vacuum. It followed the  turbulent 1960s, in which many standards for right and wrong were jettisoned in  favor of a "do your own thing" mentality.  </P> <P> Just as the "me decade" inevitably followed the repeal of a moral code, so did  legalized abortion result from this new emphasis on self. Divorces skyrocketed,  venereal diseases became epidemic, drugs began killing our children and  trashing our cities, pornography moved out of darkened pool halls to foul the  mainstream, ethics were regularly violated in high places. Having abandoned our  compass, our ship lost direction and ran aground, like the Exxon tanker in  Alaska, spewing forth cultural pollution that has yet to be cleaned up.  </P> <P> This debate is not about how many people each side can put in the streets, how  much money the abortion industry can spend on newspaper and television ads or  how many lawyers can file amicus briefs. It is about right and wrong.  </P></p>

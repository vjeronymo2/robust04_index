			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The fact that NATO's Partnership for Peace program  has already become part of Russian policy was confirmed today at  a meeting between Oleg Soskovets and George Joulwan, NATO's  commander in chief in Europe. In a conversation with the U.S.  general, the first deputy prime minister noted that the CIS  countries have not become really independent since gaining  political independence. In the Caucasus, Tajikistan, and  Moldova, Russia is forced to conduct peacekeeping missions.  Moreover, it hopes for assistance in these operations from the  North Atlantic alliance.    The NATO commander in chief agreed with the first deputy  prime minister's assessment of the situation in CIS trouble  spots, and stressed that NATO is undergoing a period of  transformation from a military bloc into a peacekeeping one.  However, it is in no haste to participate in such operations.  George Joulwan proposed to Oleg Soskovets that joint  Russian-NATO exercises be held in any European country of  Russia's choice and at a time convenient to it. Russia agrees  in principle. The details will evidently be discussed tomorrow  at George Joulwan's meeting with [Defense Minister] Pavel  Grachev.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Pollution fund run by IADB may end Nafta conflict A PROPOSAL to establish an environmental fund within the InterAmerican Development Bank to help tackle pollution problems on the Mexican border with the US is being examined by the two governments. The suggestion, which comes from the IADB, is aimed at helping to defuse opposition by environmentalists to the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico. The Nafta agreement has to be ratified by the legislatures of all three countries, but is opposed by an important section of the US Congress. Side agreements to cover labour and environmental issues - meant to prevent companies shifting operations to Mexico to take advantage of lax enforcement of labour and environmental standards - are now being negotiated. The trust fund would be supported by the three Nafta and set up with only a small amount of paid-in capital: a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) fund would require Dollars 250m to be paid in, with the rest callable. The cost to government budgets would be substantially reduced. Once established, the fund could then borrow on international capital markets, with the guarantee of its three government shareholders, at relatively low interest rates. The fund would be administered by the Bank, which has experience in lending for environmental improvements throughout Latin America, and would lend to regional and municipal authorities and utilities in Mexico. One idea gaining ground in Washington has been for the establishment of a North American Development Bank to fund environmental clean-up and help areas which suffer job losses apparently because of the agreement. However, such a bank would be expensive to establish and would take a long time to start operations. On the other hand, other mechanisms would probably be required to cover problems in Canada or the US - such as job losses or clean-ups on the US side of the border with Mexico - since all the Bank's past experience has been in Latin America and the Caribbean. With the fund borrowing at market interest rates, it would be unable to provide concessional resources.</p>

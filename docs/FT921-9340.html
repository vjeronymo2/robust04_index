			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Amstrad Things have come to a pretty pass for Mr Alan Sugar when he finds himself making more money from running a football club than from making computers. On Monday Tottenham Hotspur moved into unexpected profit; yesterday Amstrad turned in its first ever loss. A quick glance at the interim figures confirms that there is little danger of Amstrad going bust. For a start, it has Pounds 40m of net cash, so its balance sheet looks robust enough to withstand any write-downs that may be needed to clear unsold stock. But the maintained interim dividend scarcely matters when set against the poverty of the trading outlook. The central problem remains the long-term decline in the market for personal computers. Price discounting by once up-market competitors has continued to queer Amstrad's pitch at a time when demand for its other products has been affected by the recession. The group is busy restructuring, but the odds seem against it recovering the momentum it enjoyed before the debacle of the PC2386 series of computers two years ago. The market might appear to disagree with the conclusion that the glory days are over for a company whose pre-tax profits in 1988 were bigger than its present Pounds 159m market capitalisation. Amstrad shares rose by 8 per cent yesterday, but the longer-term performance tells a different story. Over the last five years, the shares lost 85 per cent of their value relative to the market. As the old maxim has it, when they fall that far they never come back.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / House prices increase in linewith recent sales revival HOUSE PRICES in the UK rose by 1.2 per cent in March, the largest monthly increase for four years, the Halifax Building Society said yesterday. The seasonally adjusted figures suggest that the recent revival in sales reported by house builders, estate agents and building societies is starting to have an impact on prices - although the society warned against reading too much into one month's figures. Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, nonetheless welcomed the figures, saying they provided further encouraging signs of recovery in the construction industry. Halifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender, said: 'Whilst this a very encouraging sign that the housing market is beginning to recover we will need a few more months of strong activity and stable or rising prices before we can be confident that a sustained upturn is under way.' Halifax said the 1.2 per cent rise was the biggest since March 1989 when prices increased by 1.6 per cent. Before seasonal adjustment the figure represented a 2.2 per cent increase. Nationwide, the second largest building society, last week reported that house prices had risen by 1 per cent in March compared with February, on an unadjusted basis. Despite this, the average price of a house in the UK of Pounds 61,510 last month was still 5.2 per cent lower than in March last year. Halifax, however, was encouraged that the rise in inquiries from potential purchasers seen since the beginning of this year was starting to work through to increased mortgage applications and offers. The value of new commitments to mortgages by building societies rose by 40 per cent in February from January. House builders say net reservations - agreed sales on which a deposit has been paid less cancellations - have risen by between a fifth and a quarter compared with the first 13 weeks of last year. Halifax said that despite last month's increase it was sticking to its forecast that prices would generally remain flat during the next few months before starting to rise towards the end of this year. Nevertheless, some stability seemed to be returning to prices, slightly earlier than expected. The team which previously prepared construction forecasts for the National Economic Development Office says the decline in construction output this year is likely to be less than expected because of the recovery in the housing market. JFC Construction Forecasts said yesterday it had reduced its forecast for the decline in output to 1.5 per cent from 2 per cent previously. It said housing repair, maintenance and improvement work was likely to increase because of increased confidence in the market. This would boost total construction output.</p>

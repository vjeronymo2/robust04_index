			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Lim] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 18 (AFP)--Hong Kong's biggest press  group launches Tuesday the territory's third English-language  daily -- planned to reach the stands next month -- with an  independent editorial stance as its selling point.    "We're ready to start publishing on February 1," said Steve  Vines, the new paper's editor, who claimed the EASTERN EXPRESS  -- owned by the Oriental Press Group -- would be "independently  minded" with no political affiliations.    Local analysts have welcomed the emergence of a new English-  language newspaper, with many saying the newspaper had taken the  best selling point by insisting on its independence at this  politically sensitive time.    While, in theory, a free press flourishes in Hong Kong, in  the transition to China's takeover of the British colony in  1997, the future of the press remains uncertain.    As a result, some dailies are shifting stances towards  China,  with many engaging in self-censorship to avoid offending  Beijing, giving the EASTERN EXPRESS the chance to exploit the  psychological advantage of being "neutral."    The two established English-language dailies have taken  notice of the market newcomer, changing formats and offering  giveaways in an effort to keep their readers from deserting to  the EASTERN EXPRESS.    The market leader SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST -- which Tuesday  touted its spruced up "bigger, better" business pages -- is  offering nine Mercedes Benz cars in a competition for its  readers.    The HONG KONG STANDARD has also radically changed its format  and logo, and now offers a weekly colour magazine and the CHINA  DAILY'S BUSINESS WEEKLY as a supplement every Monday.    "We are delighted by the response from our competitors,"  Vines said. "We will have a place in the market," he said  confidently.    The ORIENTAL EXPRESS [as published] has bought German-made  presses at a cost of 24 million dollars which will print more  than twice as fast and with about the third of the labour of  current presses in use here.    The new daily plans an initial circulation of 60,000 copies  a  day.    Its sister publication, the Chinese-language ORIENTAL DAILY,  currently claims a readership of 1.6 million.    The emergence of the new newspaper followed the purchase by  Chinese-Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok -- who has substantial  business interests in China -- of a 24.9 percent stake in the  SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST.    Kuok's acquisition prompted fears the SOUTH CHINA MORNING  POST would adopt a more pro-China stance, although the reclusive  entrepreneur has said he planned no change in its editorial  policy.    The Chinese language press ranges from pro-Beijing to  pro-Taiwan.    The launching of the EASTERN EXPRESS adds to the colony's  existing 67 newspapers and 608 periodicals -- including 39  Chinese- language dailies and two English-language dailies --  the world's highest rate of newspapers per person.    Timothy Hamlett, a media lecturer at the Baptist College,  said the new newspaper would give Hong Kong an average of two  and a half newspapers per person in the colony of six million  people.    But, he said, despite the saturated press industry, "the  launching of a third English-language daily is worth  experimenting" with.    "There is an obvious temptation to take the non-left wing  stance," he said, "whether it will work is another question."    "It is a fantastic development," said media analyst James  Miles of Asia Equity, but he predicted it would take at least  six months to see whether the newspaper was profitable.    "It will offer more choice to consumers," said media analyst  Kirk Sweeney of Lehman Brothers.    "It remains to be seen whether the editorial policy will be  independent," he added.</p>

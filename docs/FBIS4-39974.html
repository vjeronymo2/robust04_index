			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian presidential aide, Georgiy Satarov, said he  does not believe that the fact of Boris Yeltsin asking Anatoliy  Chubays not to be in charge of privatization in Moscow forecasts  the latter's resignation.    Saratov told Interfax in an interview Friday that the  disagreement between Chubays and Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov had  only a few more weeks to run. He said that after this a new  stage would begin and the argument would no longer be relevant.    The essence of the conflict between Chubays and Luzhkov is  the latter's demand to carry out a privatization campaign in the  city in line with a special program which is at odds with  nationwide legislation. This would help the Moscow authorities  to increase the price of real estate. Chubays believes Moscow  facilities should be privatized in line with the nationwide  scheme without any special conditions.    Speaking at a news conference in Moscow Friday, Boris  Yeltsin  said that as the two sides could not agree, he had decided that  privatization in Moscow should proceed according to a special  program which would not be applied to other areas of the country.</p>

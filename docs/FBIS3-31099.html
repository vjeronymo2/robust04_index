			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Regular Friday interview with Slovak Prime Minister </F> Vladimir Meciar by Martiln Bartisek in Bratislava on 11  February--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Bartisek] This week you paid a very short visit  to NATO headquarters in Brussels to sign a document on  Slovakia's joining the Partnership for Peace program. On this  occasion, you said that the Slovak Republic was prepared to  immediately conclude an agreement with Hungary on reconciliation  in all spheres, putting their relations on a new basis.  [passage omitted]    [Meciar] I discussed this issue with the Hungarian prime  minister during our meeting in Prague. It is not possible to  build on the past, while forever returning, in the negative  sense, to what happened in the past. It is necessary to say  that we are going to outline a new program for relations between  the two states. It is necessary to declare clearly that we are  interested in European integration and to respect these  regulations in relations between us, too. [passage omitted]    Without a settlement of these relations and without  embarking  on cooperation and mutual integration, our integration into  Western Europe is not possible--and, of course, no security  structure would ever accept quareling neighbors.    [Bartisek] Can one say that both sides, Slovakia and  Hungary,  are going to meet each other halfway?    [Meciar] It would be premature to put it this way, but  certainly the Slovak side has made an offer. [passage omitted]    [Bartisek] As prime minister, speaking about Radio Free  Europe [RFE], private stations, or, rather, already paralyzed  Slovak radio, which one do you prefer as your source of  information?    [Meciar] I have not listened to RFE since 1989. It is their  problem how they [word indistinct] report current affairs, but,  as far as I know, they are being listened to by 1.04 percent of  the population of the Slovak Republic. And they have to put not  insignificant money into it. However, this is a matter for RFE.    While tuning, I sometimes catch one of the private stations.  I have a habit, perhaps a negative or perhaps a positive one, of  working with the radio on in the background. My radio is on  constantly.    I do not think that Slovak radio is in bad shape. I think it  is in a phase of looking for its identity, its new  organizational structure; rationalization of its management is  under way. This may improve its conditions. Of course, if  certain steps are taken as regards the management, the  government will come to help. We, more or less, are just  watching to see how you are coping with some internal matters.  I can say that most frequently I listen to Slovak radio. You  are not in such a bad situation. It is necessary to be aware of  the fact that you have embarked on a rather complicated internal  struggle, and this always costs something. You need time to  achieve consolidation. However, this is not unique to radio; it  is something that can be applied to the entire state.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 4 TEEN-AGERS INJURED IN HEAD-ON COLLISION  </P> <P> Four Saugus High School students were injured, none of them seriously, when  their car was hit head-on by a second vehicle on a two-lane stretch of upper  Bouquet Canyon Road, the California Highway Patrol reported Saturday.  </P> <P> The driver of the second car, William Hunt, 43, of Saugus was arrested on  suspicion of felony drunk driving, said CHP Sgt. Scott Jones.  </P> <P> Hunt was being held at the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station jail in lieu  of $50,000 bail.  </P> <P> Hunt was driving his 1990 Thunderbird north on the narrow roadway shortly after  10 p.m. Friday when his car swerved into the southbound lane, colliding with  the car carrying the students, Jones said.  </P> <P> The 17-year-old female driver of the second car, a 1987 Volvo, received  moderate injuries in the crash, authorities said. Injuries to her three  passengers, a boy and two girls, were minor, Jones said. The teen-agers' names  were not released. All were treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in  Valencia, where the driver was in stable condition Saturday, a spokeswoman  said.  </P> <P> Jones said the teen-agers, who were returning home from a party, probably would  have been injured more seriously had they not been wearing seat belts.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed recalibrated DRG relative weights are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constructed from FY 1993 MedPAR data, received by HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through December 1993, from all hospitals subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment system and short-term acute care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals in waiver States. The FY 1993 MedPAR file  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes data for approximately 10.5 million Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The methodology used to calculate the proposed DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative weights from the FY 1993 MedPAR file is as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To the extent possible, all the claims were regrouped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using the proposed DRG classification revisions discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above in section II.B of this preamble. As noted in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II.B.4, due to the unavailability of revised GROUPER  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> software, we simulate most major classification changes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximate the placement of cases under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification. However, there are some changes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be modeled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Charges were standardized to remove the effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differences in area wage levels, indirect medical education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs, disproportionate share payments, and, for hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Alaska and Hawaii, the applicable cost-of-living  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The average standardized charge per DRG was calculated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by summing the standardized charges for all cases in the DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and dividing that amount by the number of cases classified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the DRG.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We then eliminated statistical outliers using the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion as was used in computing the current weights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> That is, all cases outside of 3.0 standard deviations from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mean of the log distribution of charges per case for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each DRG were eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The average charge for each DRG was then recomputed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (excluding the statistical outliers) and divided by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national average standardized charge per case to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the relative weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We established the relative weight for heart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transplants (DRG 103) in a manner consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology for all other DRGs except that the heart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transplant cases that were used to establish the weight were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to those Medicare-approved heart transplant centers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that have cases in the FY 1993 MedPAR file. Similarly, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited the liver transplant cases that were used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish the weight for DRG 480 (Liver Transplant) to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals that are Medicare-approved liver transplant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> centers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Acquisition costs for kidney, heart, and liver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transplants continue to be paid on a reasonable cost basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unlike other excluded costs, the acquisition costs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrated in specific DRGs (DRG 302 (Kidney Transplant);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DRG 103 (Heart Transplant); and DRG 480 (Liver Transplant)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because these costs are paid separately from the prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment rate, it is necessary to make an adjustment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the relative weights for these DRGs from including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effect of the acquisition costs. Therefore, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtracted the acquisition charges from the total charges on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each transplant bill that showed acquisition charges before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computing the average charge for the DRG and before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminating statistical outliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When we recalibrated the DRG weights for previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years, we set a threshold of 10 cases as the minimum number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of cases required to compute a reasonable weight. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose to use that same case threshold in recalibrating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DRG weights for FY 1995. Using the FY 1993 MedPAR data set,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are 35 DRGs that contain fewer than 10 cases. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computed the weight for the 35 low-volume DRGs by adjusting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the original weights of these DRGs by the percentage change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the average weight of the cases in the remaining DRGs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The weights developed according to the methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above, using the proposed DRG classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes, result in an average case weight that is different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the average case weight before recalibration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the new weights are normalized by an adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor, so that the average case weight after recalibration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is equal to the average case weight before recalibration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This adjustment is intended to ensure that recalibration by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> itself neither increases nor decreases total payments under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prospective payment system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning with FY 1991, reclassification and recalibration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes be made in a manner that assures that the aggregate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments are neither greater than nor less than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregate payments that would have been made without the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes. Although normalization is intended to achieve this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect, equating the average case weight after recalibration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the average case weight before recalibration does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessarily achieve budget neutrality with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregate payments to hospitals because payment to hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is affected by factors other than average case weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, as discussed in section II.A.4.b. of the Addendum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to this proposed rule, we are proposing to make a budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neutrality adjustment to assure the requirement of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act is met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

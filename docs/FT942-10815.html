			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Biotechnology (6): Moving on to the fast track - Clive Cookson finds that a sizeable industry is beginning to emerge in Europe Don't be misled by the apparent quietness of the European biotechnology scene compared to the US. While American biotechnology is a cacophony of hundreds of independent companies shouting exaggerated claims about wonder drugs in the early stages of development, the loudest noise to be heard from the European industry is moaning about over-regulation by the EU and national governments - particularly on environmental and patent issues - which allegedly puts it at a disadvantage in competition with the US. In reality, the gap between Europe and the US is narrower than it sounds. The illusion of a huge US lead results partly from the customary habit of Americans to be more positive about their achievements than Europeans and partly because the structure of the industry is so different on each side of the Atlantic. US biotechnology is driven entrepreneurially by young companies most of which have no products on the market yet. They burn millions of dollars a year in research and development and their existence depends on screaming good news at would-be investors. In contrast, European biotechnology has developed primarily in large pharmaceutical and chemical groups on one hand and in universities and non-profit research institutes on the other. Neither camp is so dependent as the US companies on public relations hype to raise money. Even so the first survey of European biotechnology, published in March by Ernst &amp; Young, the US-based business consultancy, identified 400 biotechnology companies in Europe. That may be only one third of the American total but it is more than Ernst &amp; Young had expected. The consultants say that when they embarked on the study, their perception 'was of an industry lagging behind that of the US on almost every measure, bar the quality of the initial science. What was found, however, was a sizeable industry emerging, one that is learning how to shape its future and that realises the scope of its potential contribution to the future European economy towards the year 2000 and beyond'. Ernst &amp; Young predicts that the European biotechnology market will grow 15-fold to reach Pounds 63bn by 2000 and provide 2m new jobs. The key factors accelerating the growth of the new industry include: More uniform regulatory policies, driven by EU legislation; Increasing awareness of the sector's importance by investors, governments and the EU (last year's EU White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment highlighted the potential of biotechnology); Further development of centres of scientific excellence, clustering around universities; Emergence of exit routes for venture capitalists; More strategic alliances between small biotechnology companies and large pharmaceutical and chemical groups. A particularly important change in the European financing environment came in June last year when the London Stock Exchange relaxed its listing rules to make it easier for young biotech companies without a profitable track record to go public. Since then 11 companies, led by British Biotechnology, have raised Pounds 200m through initial public share offerings in London, although no stock exchange on continental Europe has yet followed London's example. Ernst &amp; Young predicts that at least 20 biotech companies will be listed in London in a year's time. Initial public offerings on the LSE will raise Pounds 1bn for biotech companies over the next two to three years. When it comes to strategic alliances, however, the most common pattern is still for the large European pharmaceutical groups to form partnerships with US biotechnology companies. Roche of Switzerland led the way with its Dollars 2.1bn purchase of a majority stake in Genentech in 1990; the Swiss group also has minority stakes in Chiron and Protein Design Labs and collaborative agreements with Amgen, Synergen and Hybridon, among others. An analysis by Roche of the 55 'major R&amp;D alliances' formed by the global pharmaceutical industry in 1993 shows that 52 of the 55 'technology providers' were US biotech companies and just three were European. The corporate partners acquiring the technology included 21 European, 16 US and six Japanese pharmaceutical groups - and 11 established US biotech companies. European companies are beginning to make good use of their US contacts. For example Schering of Germany has developed Betaseron, the first drug proven to have a clinical effect on multiple sclerosis, in collaboration with Chiron, the Californian biotech company, which is manufacturing it in the US; Betaseron came originally from Triton, a small US biotech company which Schering bought from Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant. The European industry has complained consistently about regulatory burdens that are more onerous than those in the US and Japan. There has been a particular problem with environmental controls (obtaining permission to release genetically modified organisms into the environment) but European companies say that the whole approach of EU biotechnology regulations - concentrating on the process rather than the product as in the US - has made life unnecessarily difficult for them. But within the past year the EU and national governments have responded to industry concerns by streamlining regulations. A further boost will come from the European Medicines Evaluation Agency which is being established in London to provide centralised licensing of new drugs from 1995. It is likely to give the EU a faster and cheaper approvals process than the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>

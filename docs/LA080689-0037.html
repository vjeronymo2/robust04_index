			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILD'S PLAY: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> ALTERNATIVE ZOOS  </P> <P> A TRIP TO THE zoo is a favorite outing, but weekends often bring capacity  crowds. Parents who have elbowed their way in for a glimpse of the chimps once  too often will probably like to know that there are several Southern California  colleges where animals are regularly on view -- usually without the crowds.  </P> <P> Because Moorpark College in Moorpark offers courses for would-be zookeepers and  animal trainers, the college keeps more than 350 exotic animals on campus.  Although the stalls are not open to the public, people are welcome to observe  the animals from a walk that encircles the compound. Animals in residence  include tigers, lions, wolves, coyotes, water buffalo and ocelots. There is  also a petting zoo with goats, sheep, rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as a  weekly animal show at the wildlife theater.  </P> <P> Cal Poly Pomona maintains barns that house sheep, pigs and cattle, as well as  the stables of its renowned Kellogg Arabian horses -- all of which can be  visited. During the school year there is also a monthly horse show at the  state-of-the-art Arabian Horse Center, a tradition that dates back 63 years to  founder and breakfast cereal magnate W. K. Kellogg. The show includes jumping,  vaulting (gymnastics on horseback), trick horses and costumed riders.  </P> <P> Time was when most youngsters either lived on a farm or knew someone who did.  Today's urban and suburban kids can get a idea of agricultural life from a  visit to the Pierce College Farm in Woodland Hills. This working farm is home  to chickens, horses, sheep, pigs and cattle. Because these are farm animals,  not pets, children are able to observe but not touch the animals. The walking  tour of the farm lasts about 2 hours (no strollers; backpacks OK). The Pierce  College Farm is also the site of an annual rodeo each May.  </P> <P>  The Moorpark College Exotic Animal Compound in Moorpark: Weekly animal show on  Sunday at 3 p.m.; admission is $2 adults, $1 for children. The petting zoo is  open from 10 a.m to 2:30 p.m. daily; admission 50 cents. No reservations  needed, but larger groups can make arrangements for special shows.  </P> <P>  Cal Poly Pomona in Pomona: The barns and stables are open from 8 a.m. to 4  p.m. daily; no charge. Families can tour the barns unescorted; larger groups  must make an appointment for a guided tour. Horse shows are held October to  June on the first Sunday of every month.  </P> <P>  Pierce College Farm in Woodland Hills: Public tours each at 10 a.m. on  Saturday; tours are 50 cents per person. Reservations required. No tours in  August. School groups can tour Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. during the  school year.  </P> <P> </P></p>

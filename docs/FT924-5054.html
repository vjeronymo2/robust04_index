			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Money Markets: No change expected EUROPEAN interest rate markets ended the week on a depressed note yesterday, and few dealers now expect any easing in official interest rates in Germany, France or the UK before the end of the year, writes James Blitz. A month ago, the speed with which Germany was entering recession made dealers confident that the Bundesbank would ease official interest rates by at least 50 basis points before the end of the year. The recent tension in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism also raised the prospect of Germany being forced to ease policy in support of vulnerable currencies in the currency system. A wave of bearish comments from members of the Bundesbank council has recently made the market revise that optimism. Yesterday, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the deputy president of the central bank council, added to the mood by saying that German rates were 'not too high' and that German monetary policy must stick to its anti-inflationary course. An acceleration in West German consumer prices in November dashed hopes of a cut: there was a rise of 0.5 percentage points in November from October, implying a 3.7 per cent rise on the year. No market reflects the change in sentiment as much as Euromark futures. Yesterday the December contract closed down another 3 basis points on the day at 91.19. That is some 55 basis points below the level that the contract was at on October 13. The price now assumes that 3-month German cash will be at 8.81 per cent when the contract matures in three weeks time. Three-month money was trading at 8.87 per cent yesterday. Similar sentiment is being felt in French markets. There is still lingering uncertainty about the franc's position in the ERM, and yesterday the December contract closed down 23 basis points from its highs for the day at 89.87. With 3-month money priced at 10 3/8 per cent yesterday, this reflects virtually no change in official French rates. Now that sterling is out of the European system of fixed exchange rates, there is no reason why UK market rates should shadow continental moves. Nevertheless, recent weeks have only underlined the feeling that base rates will stay at 7 per cent until well into next year. 'We are in for a long spell of technical markets in sterling,' said one London-based dealer this week. Three-month money yesterday closed at around 7 1/4 per cent, unchanged on the week.</p>

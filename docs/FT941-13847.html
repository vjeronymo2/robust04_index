			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / West's resolve dissolves into uncertainty President Bill Clinton of the US was right to warn his Nato partners at their recent summit in Brussels not to make threats about military action in Bosnia which were never likely to be carried out. The events of the last few days have underlined precisely what he was talking about. In spite of UN Security Council and Nato resolutions on the use of air strikes - Nato leaders made a solemn declaration on the subject less than two weeks ago - there are no indications that these are imminent. Indeed, at least one of the countries with peacekeeping troops on the ground in Bosnia  -Canada - has already made clear its opposition to such strikes. The determination of others is also in doubt. Yet the Nato declaration on the subject was couched in the clearest possible terms. 'We reaffirm our readiness, under the authority of the United Nations Security Council and in accordance with the alliance decisions on August 2 and 9 1993, to carry out air strikes in order to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, the safe areas and other threatened areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' it said. After last Saturday's attack by Bosnian Serb gunners on a district of Sarajevo only a few hundred metres from UN peacekeeping force headquarters, in which six children were killed, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian government's Moslem prime minister, appears fully justified in making his latest appeal for Nato air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. Sarajevo, after all, has been designated by the UN as a 'safe area,' a status which has never been respected by the Bosnian Serbs. After his unseemly squabbles with General Jean Cot, whom he obliged to retire as French commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, has at last confirmed he is ready to order air strikes in Bosnia if asked to do so by his special envoy in Yugoslavia, Mr Yasushi Akashi. But it seems doubtful, to say the least, whether he is prepared to authorise such bombardments other than to allow Canadian peacekeeping troops in the eastern Moslem enclave of Srebrenica to be relieved. To confuse the situation even further, the main countries with peacekeeping troops on the ground in Bosnia - France, Britain, Spain and Canada - have adopted self-contradictory positions on the subject. On the one hand they have put their names to the Nato declaration; on the other they have always opposed military action which could put the lives of their own troops in danger. That situation would be clarified if, as Britain and France have intimated, they withdraw their troops at the end of spring. But what, only a few days ago, appeared to be almost a foregone conclusion, has once again become questionable. Both countries have made it clear that the decision to go or stay would not be taken unilaterally but was one for all the nations participating in the UN Protection Force (Unprofor) to take. Furthermore, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, seems to be in greater doubt about the wisdom of withdrawal after his visit to British troops in central Bosnia at the end of last week than he was before. The foreign secretary said that the UN aid effort in a region contested by Bosnian Moslems and Croats was working better than was generally realised. A record six aid convoys had got through two days earlier. He added that British troops believed they should stay, not only because aid convoys were getting through, but because there was a strong feeling in the region that if Unprofor troops were to leave 'the savagery of the war would be substantially worse'. Hardly surprising, therefore, that a decision on whether to withdraw British troops is not imminent. With the UN, Nato and their main member nations in a state of suspended animation, and the Geneva peace talks as deadlocked as they ever were, the prospects for any further international action in Bosnia remain decidedly dim.</p>

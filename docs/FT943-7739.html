			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / UN wrestles with global warming Turning the ambitious aims of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit into reality is the task facing officials meeting today at the United Nations in Geneva. Representatives from more than 100 countries will wrestle this week with curbing global warming, an issue ducked at Rio. The most controversial point is whether to draw up international targets beyond the year 2000 for curbing emissions of gases thought to cause global warming. 'Rio was one of the fastest international agreements on the environment that has ever been reached,' said one observer at the Geneva preparations, 'but some of the most important issues about how to implement it have been left until now.' This summer's heatwave in Europe has renewed interest in the threat of global warming, which scientists believe may follow a build-up of 'greenhouse' gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Rio's framework convention on climate change, together with a separate treaty on protecting the diversity of species, were the Earth Summit's most tangible achievements. But environmental groups such as Greenpeace have criticised the climate change convention for failing to address emissions beyond 2000. Under the convention, industrialised countries have pledged to draw up plans to bring emissions of 'greenhouse' gases back to 1990 levels in 2000, but make no commitments beyond that year. UK ministers have warned that UK emissions are likely to rise sharply after that. The convention also asks developing countries to improve energy efficiency. However, there is controversy about how those efforts should be funded. Signatories have agreed that funding should be channeled through the Global Environment Facility, a fund administered jointly by the UN and World Bank. But there is still disagreement over the criteria used to select projects, and the route through which payments should be made, including whether the money should be distributed by developing countries' governments. Officials are under pressure to resolve issues before the UN conference in Berlin in March.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 26 Feb -- The Russian side has adopted the  only correct stance in the settlement of the Bosnian conflict:  "The best path to peace is the one that does not produce human  casualties." This was stated at a news conference today by  Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff  of the Russian Armed Forces.    The situation in the region of the conflict, the general  said, remains complex. The NATO ultimatum on bombardments has  not been lifted. An increase in forces is essential. This is  why, at the suggestion of the Russian president, the Federation  Council decided to send an additional contingent of Russian  "blue helmets."    They have been given the task, Mikhail Kolesnikov said, of  separating the opposing sides, preventing attempts to transfer  heavy weapons to other parts of the Balkans, ensuring unhampered  access to Sarajevo for humanitarian aid convoys, and creating  conditions for the deployment of additional UN forces.</p>

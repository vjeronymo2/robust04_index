The announcement, which dealt with the Iranian commitments  concerning increasing the financial, diplomatic, and  media-related support provided by Tehran to this movement, was  made during meetings that were held between Iranian leaders and  a Hamas delegation currently visiting Iran, which is headed by  Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the movement's Political Bureau, and  Ibrahim Ghawshah, its official spokesman. So far the delegation  has held a series of meetings with high-ranking Iranian  political, military, and security officials. In order to  underscore Iran's determination to more effectively oppose the  agreements concluded between the PLO and Israel, Iran's  spiritual leader, 'Ali Khamene'i, also met with the Hamas  delegation. It should be pointed out that Khamene'i, as of the  last few weeks, has personally taken over the supervision of  Iran's efforts to frustrate the peace process.    Analysts are of the opinion that there are indications of  the  existence of differences in points of view between Iran and  Hamas.    In an interview given yesterday by Abu-Marzuq to the  newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, which is published by Khamene'i,  the Hamas leader expressed his belief that the PLO and Israel  would not be able to accomplish the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho by the 13 December deadline. Abu-Marzuq hinted that  the agreement would fail because of the contradictions inherent  in it. He also expected that U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's current mission to the Middle East would be a  failure. The Hamas leader's point of view is close to that of  Syria, which is that it is necessary to remain uninvolved in the  agreement between the PLO and Israel and thus allow it to fail.    However, Iran believes that it is necessary to take  additional measures in order to guarantee that this agreement  fail. These measures, according to statements by the Iranian  media, should include escalation of the armed conflict and  intensification of the intifadah.    But Abu-Marzuq is apparently convinced that the agreement  still has the support of the Palestinians and that any parties  attempting to blow it up might thus be risking their political  positions. Hamas leaders also affirm that it is necessary not to  provide Israel and the PLO with a pretext for holding Hamas and  other hard-line groups responsible for the "inevitable failure"  of their agreements.    In his interview, Abu-Marzuq said the plan for autonomy, no  matter how limited, can never work as long as the Israeli  settlers do not withdraw from the occupied territories.  Khamene'i had decided to call for the holding of an  international conference to be attended by the parties and  nations opposed to the agreement. But he failed to obtain the  support of Syria and the Palestinian groups for such a  conference.    Apparently the idea of forming a new "rejectionist front"  has  been delayed until next year. One of the reasons for the delay  has been Syria's wish to bide its time in order to see what can  be achieved by means of U.S. mediation.    Another reason is the fact that the hard-line Palestinian  groups believe that Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat, during the  next few months, will exhaust his supply of good intentions and  thus pave the way for the emergence of a new leadership that  will be more of the hard-line type.    The final reason is that the Arab hard-liners are reluctant  to hand over the reins of control of an Arab issue to a non-Arab  country, that is, Iran.</p>

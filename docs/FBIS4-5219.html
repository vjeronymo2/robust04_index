			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa renewed his call on Friday to create a new large  parliamentary group of various political parties within the  House of Representatives with his Japan New Party serving as its  core.    Hosokawa made the appeal at a plenary session of his party's  38 legislators a few hours after announcing his decision to give  up the premiership, JNP legislators said.    "We have to assemble people with the ideal of reform while  making our party the core of the new group," Hosokawa said.    The premier proposed naming the new group "Reform."    The JNP legislators agreed to give Hosokawa a mandate to  decide how to proceed with the project to form the new  parliamentary group.    The idea had earlier come under a barrage of criticism from  the new party Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Social Democratic  Party, which charged that such a proposal, if realized, would  lead to the formation of a new large party amalgamating the JNP,  Shinseito and Komeito.    The premier's renewal of the call may add fuel to a  simmering  intracoalition rivalry between the Sakigake-SDP camp and the  JNP- Shinseito-Komeito camp at a time when the coalition is  moving to pick a successor to Hosokawa, political analysts said.    Hosokawa also told the plenary session he had decided to  dissolve the current JNP-Sakigake parliamentary group, the  legislators said.    Meanwhile, JNP executives said the party had decided to  report the formation of the new parliamentary group "Reform" to  the Secretariat of the lower chamber.    In addition to the 38 JNP legislators, two United Social  Democratic Party legislators had decided to join the new group,  they added.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: BAT to merge fund management activities BAT Industries said yesterday that it was merging the fund management operations of its two insurance companies, Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar, into a new company reflecting what it sees as fundamental changes in the financial services industry. Mr George Greener, chief executive of BAT's UK Financial Services, said: 'We believe fundamental change has already taken place in the financial services industry.' One of the objectives of the new company, to be known as Threadneedle Asset Management, will be to increase BAT's asset management for third parties, particularly pension funds. 'I believe the days of distribution-led business are finished. We want to improve our image in the marketplace and improve our performance,' Mr Greener said. 'We need to be transparent to independent financial advisers and to external clients.' New rules taking effect in January 1995 will require life insurance companies to tell prospective customers much more about the charges for each policy and how much each sales agent is paid in commission. Mr Greener believed that superior investment performance would do much more to enhance sales than the expansion of the sales force which has been the traditional route through which life insurers have gained market share. BAT intends to retain its two insurance brands and will not seek to merge Allied Dunbar with Eagle Star. There will also be a separate unit to manage property investments. Mr Greener also said that in BAT's repositioning effort, it was also looking at acquisitions. He declined to be drawn on the type of acquisition except to say: 'I have always been interested in the concept of bancassurance.' Mr Greener said he does not expect any significant redundancies to result from the merger. However, rationalisation of back office activities could pare expenses by 10 per cent to 20 per cent over the medium term. The two companies between them have 60 fund managers and broadly similar investment approaches.</p>

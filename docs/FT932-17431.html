			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Newspaper's free flights offer probed THE Advertising Standards Authority has begun an investigation into the Sunday Times's offer of free air miles to its readers after receiving complaints alleging that the terms of the promotion were misleading and contained unreasonable restrictions. The authority said it had received 21 complaints from the public about two Sunday Times schemes since they were launched on February 21. That compares with only 14 complaints about Hoover's much-criticised offer of free flights to purchasers of its domestic appliances. The Sunday Times campaign promises '500 instant air miles for every reader'. Under one scheme readers are invited to collect vouchers worth 500 miles every week over a three-month period and send them in for redemption. The authority said readers had complained that the Sunday Times did not make sufficiently clear that the air miles concerned could be used only towards the purchase of tickets to destinations specified by the newspaper. Among the destinations were Jeddah, Tehran and Abu Dhabi, which readers had pointed out were unlikely choices for a holiday. Though some more popular destinations, such as Melbourne and Hong Kong, were also included, the authority said it could be difficult to collect enough air miles to cover the full fares in the three months allowed. The authority said it had also received complaints about a second scheme, under which readers collect weekly vouchers worth 10 air miles which they can use to buy a ticket to a destination of their choice. The authority said it was investigating whether the Sunday Times had made sufficiently clear that the offer was valid only if all the vouchers were collected over a 12-month period and put in special booklets. The Sunday Times confirmed that it had received a letter from the authority about its investigation, but had no comment until the outcome was known. The newspaper said it had received 'a handful' of complaints about the schemes. The investigation is being made under a voluntary code on sales promotions set up by the advertising industry.</p>

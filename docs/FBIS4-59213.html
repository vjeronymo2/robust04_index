			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 6 May on  page B5 carries a 2,000-word interview with Jerusalem Mayor Ehud  Olmert by Nadav Shragay. The place and date of the interview  are not given. Asked about Palestinian political activity  emanating from Orient House and other PLO offices in East  Jerusalem, Olmert says that the Palestinians are preparing for a  difficult struggle over Jerusalem, adding that he has already  warned the government about what is taking place in East  Jerusalem. He remarks: "I do not know how much determination  the government is evincing with regard to this issue. Let me  say with all due caution: I am not claiming that Peres and  Rabin want to divide the city. It would be unfair and unjust to  say this, but this does not mean they are doing what is  necessary to prevent this from happening. They are avoiding  taking the necessary steps in order not to harm the negotiations  with the PLO."    Asked about steps he would implement in this respect, Olmert  says: "I would take any step necessary to curb Palestinian  political activity in East Jerusalem, barring infringements on  civil rights, such as freedom of speech." He adds: "I would  close down Orient House, and not only Orient House. I would not  like to say anything beyond this." Asked about a purported  secret agreement between Israel and the PLO, according to which  the Arab villages in Jerusalem will be put under Palestinian  sovereignty while the new Jewish neighborhoods will remain under  Israeli sovereignty and the Old City will receive international  status, Olmert says that such plans are occasionally floated  unofficially; however, he emphasizes, "I know for certain that  there is no such agreement or understanding." Asked whether it  is possible to achieve peace with the Arab states and the  Palestinians without compromising on Jerusalem, Olmert asserts:  "The answer is unequivocally affirmative. They never really  cared about Jerusalem. The city never served as the capital of  any Arab country. At some future point, they will have to  decide whether all the great achievements they have scored  should be compromised in order to realize their demand for a  political position in Jerusalem. I believe they realize that  their room for maneuver in Jerusalem is negligible."    Queried about his construction and development plans in  Jerusalem, Olmert states: "If you want to know whether I  support confiscation of land where necessary for construction  and development in Jerusalem, the answer is: absolutely yes."  He adds: "I believe Jerusalem should expand eastward, because  further westward development would soon turn Jerusalem into a  suburb of Tel Aviv." Olmert concedes that "naturally, this  planning concept has political ramifications." Asked whether  this concept might lead to the conclusion that the city's  jurisdiction should be extended eastward to include land slated  to be incorporated in the autonomy, Olmert answers: "This may  very well be one of the results, and it might be necessary to do  so in the near future."</p>

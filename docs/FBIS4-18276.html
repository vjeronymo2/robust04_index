			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, March 31 (AFP) -- A group of Bosnian business  leaders came to Paris Thursday [31 March] looking for help in  rebuilding Bosnia-Herzegovina's economy, following a peace deal  bringing Moslems and Croats together in a new federation.    Everything needs to be rebuilt in that devastated country,  making Bosnia the biggest market in the world for public works,  President of the Sarajevo Chamber of Commerce Mensur Smajlovic  said Thursday.    A cooperation agreement was signed Thursday by Smajlovic and  his Paris counterpart Bernard Cambournac to help the ravaged  economy and the emergence of a private sector.    Projects should include cooperation in trade and  manufacture,  the transfer of engineering and banking know-how, advice to  companies on reorientating themselves to Western markets, and  training programmes.    Further talks were expected Thursday evening with French  companies at a meeting organised by the employers' confederation  CNPF.    A group of French industrialists is due to visit Sarajevo in  the next few weeks to assess priorities, with advice from the  French military which has a large presence in Bosnia's UN  Protection Force.    A delegation has already been sent by the French ministry of  defence to work out ways of assessing damage quickly, a ministry  official said.    Thursday's Paris visit also came a day after the United  Nations named the American William Eagleton as international  coordinator for reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Bosnian delegation, invited to Paris by French Defence  Minister Francois Leotard, outlined the terrible toll taken by  three years of economic blockade and two years of war.    Smajlovic estimated the loss to the country's gross domestic  product at more than $15 billion and the loss of world exports  at $5 billion over three years.    In Sarajevo alone, 500,000 apartments have been destroyed  and  most roads, bridges, tunnels and water supply systems in the  republic are unusable. Several hundred factories are also out  of use.    Damage on the railways is put at between $300 and 500  million. Rebuilding the most important line, between Sarajevo  and Ploce, would cost around $15 million, he said.    The director-general of Bosnian telecommunications, Hajrudin  Suman, put the damage to the telephone network at a total $2.5  billion. Around $100 million worth of aid has already allowed  some parts of the system to go back into operation, he said.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Snia BPD advances shake-up by merging subsidiaries SNIA BPD, the chemicals, bio-engineering and synthetic fibres subsidiary of Italy's Fiat group, yesterday moved a step further in restructuring its operations with the merger of two quoted subsidiaries. Snia Technopolimeri, a stock market-listed operation which specialises in plastic films for packaging, is to be merged into Caffaro, the group's chemicals subsidiary, which is also quoted. The combined concern will have sales of around L645bn (Dollars 460m), double that of its two components individually. The announcement of the deal comes shortly after EniChem, the chemicals subsidiary of the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, announced plans for a major shake-up of its operations. The parent company will take charge of a number of formerly independent operating units. Incorporating the 10 subsidiaries involved should also produced considerable cost savings, estimated at up to L200bn a year. After the changes, EniChem, which currently has a holding company structure, will directly control a group with 16,000 employees and sales of around L6,500bn. IRI, the Italian state holding company, is to take temporary control of the defence and aerospace interests of Efim, the state-owned group put into voluntary liquidation in July, pending a full takeover. The agreement seals an announcement by the Italian government that the two activities, comprising predominantly the Oto Melara defence unit and the Agusta helicopters concern, would be 'rented' to IRI's Finmeccanica unit for up to six months. A price will be negotiated during the 'rental' period, to start on January 1. Both units are likely to be incorporated in Finmeccanica's listed Alenia aerospace and defence subsidiary.</p>

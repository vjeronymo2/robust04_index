			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> URAM AMONG FEW SPEAKING UP FOR MEDICALLY INDIGENT  </P> <P> Congratulations on your excellent, in-depth interview with Thomas Uram  ("County's Health Care Boss Fights a Fund-Short Battle," Sept. 2). He may be  the only official in the county with the credibility and courage to explain to  the public what the indifference of our lawmakers to the health-care system has  done to the well-being of the poor and to describe the damage to the surviving  medical-care resources still available to the not-so-poor.  </P> <P> Uram is the most visible public servant to describe the enormity of the local  health-care calamity. But he is not the only Paul Revere. The alarm has been  sounded to all the media, to the Board of Supervisors, to the governor, to all  who would listen by the shock troops of our medical defense system, the  emergency room physicians, and by the Orange County Medical Assn., whose  president and Access to Care Committee have for months been screaming a  monologue at the deaf.  </P> <P> Doctors are best able to observe how the blight of fiscal drought is withering  the infrastructure of all local medical facilities. But when they speak out,  they are accused of vested self-interest. It seems that the image of the  Mercedes trunk lid closing on a golf bag will never be too hackneyed to be  trotted out yet one more time by the politicians.  </P> <P> Cynically, it is argued that doctors want medical care for the poor just so  they can receive fat fees. No lawmaker wants to recall that physicians have  been serving the needy for little or no fees ever since the sale of the Orange  County Hospital years ago freed the county of any fiscal responsibility for its  medically indigent.  </P> <P> Legislators know of the crisis, but money is tight, and everyone has "read his  lips," and nobody has the nerve to mention the "T word."  </P> <P> Besides, the poor are a feeble constituency. They have no powerful citizen  groups to argue for them in the Legislature. There are no MADD lobbies for the  impoverished, no Gray Panthers battling for the destitute. Each of these  lobbies has its own important agenda that it is not willing to share with the  medically indigent.  </P> <P> The print media has mentioned the plight of the poor only in the abstract and,  until today, without much emotional energy. It is the people -- the same  ordinary, compassionate citizens who responded to the famine in Ethiopia -- who  should be appealing to their government for funds for this crisis, but there  are no pictures of potbellied children with flies on their eyes dying in the  streets of Santa Ana or Laguna Beach to evoke their pity. Not yet.  </P> <P> If doctors are not credible and politicians are afraid to act and the ordinary  citizen doesn't yet realize or care about the magnitude of the problem, where  are the clergy? Traditionally, in our culture, when social systems break down,  it has been the church and the synagogue that speak for the downtrodden.  </P> <P> Thomas Uram, the compassionate and courageous head of the Orange County Health  Care Agency, ably abetted by two Times reporters, has graphically described the  future of health care in Orange County as beyond crisis and headed for chaos.  </P> <P> If we, the citizens of this county, don't force immediate and meaningful  governmental action, the legacy of Howard Jarvis and Proposition 13 will be a  return to an ice-floe mentality, and we will all be physically more vulnerable  and certainly morally bankrupt.  </P> <P> ARTHUR D.

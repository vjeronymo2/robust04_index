			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Observer: Plane fair Remember the fuss about John Major's clapped-out plane which shuttled him around central Europe last month? Well, liberal-minded Croats must think he is a wise, thrifty hero compared with their President, Franjo Tudjman. Tudjman's sense of importance of a republic which is the size of Wales, reached new heights when the United Nations, rather reluctantly, decided to add Croatia's membership to the UN. Slovenia, and war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina, joined at the same time. While his neighbour from Slovenia Milan Kucan simply purchased a return ticket to New York, and Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic had to stay in his besieged capital Sarajevo because it was too dangerous to leave, Tudjman's response was different. He promptly spent Dollars 18m on a new plane.</p>

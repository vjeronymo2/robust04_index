			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Role of Existing Information Infrastructure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By a variety of measures, the United States' existing information infrastructure is the most advanced in the world. Therefore, if an applicant requests support to construct new transmission capacity, there should be a clear discussion of why utilization of existing networks and systems cannot be relied upon efficiently and economically to meet the project's needs. A proposal should address whether incorporation of existing information infrastructure into the overall plan is feasible. Under this section, applicants should address questions such as:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> What information infrastructure is currently available to the applicant?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> How can commercial and non-commercial providers of telecommunications and information services help the applicant meet its information needs?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Accommodation of Future Technology and Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As communications and information technologies rapidly evolve and improve, existing technology can quickly become obsolete. For this reason, all applicants should consider how they intend to address this issue. The capacity for upgrades and improvements, as well as the flexibility to accommodate changes in the volume or types of uses, should be considered from the beginning of any planning or development process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Contribution to the Formation of the National Information Infrastructure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants should explain how their proposed projects can make a contribution to the development of the National Information Infrastructure. Some questions that an applicant could consider are:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> What applications and services are being provided through the existing information infrastructure?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> How will the project ensure connectivity to other systems outside the immediate state or community?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What monitoring or evaluation plan will be utilized?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Specific Evaluative Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Category One_Demonstration Projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This category is open to any state or local government, or any non-profit entity. For purposes of this notice, a ``local government'' is any branch of government below the state level. This term also includes special purpose subdivisions, or government-funded entities that have responsibilities beyond the political boundaries of a single state, and Indian Tribal governments. A ``non-profit'' entity is any foundation, association, or corporation, no part of the net earnings of which inures, or may lawfully inure, to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. This is the same definition used in 47 U.S.C. 397 (1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evaluative criteria. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A major criterion under this category will be the capability of the applicant actually to carry out the proposed project and/or the applicant's ability to deliver the proposed service or services. In addition to the general evaluative criteria set forth above, applicants for demonstration projects should address the following criteria in their applications: (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Connection to end-users. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In formulating their proposals, applicants should be mindful of the needs of eventual end-users. Any system or network proposed for NTIA funding should include capacity for providing a range of information services, consistent both with the mission of the entity and the present and future requirements of end-users. Questions applicants might address are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> To what degree does the project duplicate other services available to users in the projected service area?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To what degree does the project include provisions for multifunctional activities_such as education, health care, community information services, etc._and access to related information sources?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Will the project be structured to respond to increased demands for services from users?  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Efficiency and economy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In this era of limited fiscal resources, it is essential that each dollar be spent in the most efficient and economical manner possible. Some questions that the applicant might consider under this criterion are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Is the proposed acquisition of information infrastructure, with NTIA grant funds, the most efficient and economical?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Why is the applicant's choice of technology the most appropriate to the proposal?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> How will the system or equipment funded by NTIA be maintained? Is its operation assured for a reasonable amount of time after installation?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

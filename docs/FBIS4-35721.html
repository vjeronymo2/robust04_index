			<p>BFN     [Text] During his participation in the NAM [Nonaligned  Movement] Intersummit Meeting in Cairo from 31 May to 2 June,  [Thai] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri held a  meeting with his Libyan counterpart to clarify the controversy  over the Libyan Government's repatriation of Thai workers. He  informed the Libyan foreign minister, who also came to Cairo to  attend the nonaligned meeting, that the whole problem can be  attributed to a misunderstanding among several concerned parties  including the Thai mass media. Citing the vote Thailand cast  for Libya at the World Health Organization, he told his Libyan  counterpart that Thailand always supports Libya, adding that  Thailand has never thought of making any false charges against  that country. He said only two out of 60 Thai job placement  firms were involved in sending Thai workers to Libya without  government permission. He asked that the Libyan foreign  minister clarify his country's policy toward Thai workers.    The Libyan foreign minister replied that as a matter of  fact,  Libya has no bias against Thai workers. Preventive measures  against law violations have been applied to workers from all  countries, not specifically Thailand. The Libyan people admire  and praise Thai workers for their honesty, diligence, and  workmanship, and learned about Thailand from them.    The Libyan foreign minister also proposed that the Thai  Government open an embassy in Libya so that it can look after  the 25,000 Thai workers there more closely and further  strengthen bilateral ties.    Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri foreign minister replied  that  the proposal was accepted for serious consideration and hope  that Thai workers in Libya will continue to contribute to the  strengthening of the Thai-Libyan relations.</p>

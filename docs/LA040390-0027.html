			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN'T ELIMINATE 6TH GRADES  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel ruled Friday that the Palos  Verdes Peninsula Unified School District cannot eliminate the sixth grade at  two elementary schools and allow fifth-graders to transfer to the school of  their choice next fall.  </P> <P> The district wanted to close sixth-grade classes at Mira Catalina and Rancho  Vista elementary schools, allowing the students to attend either Ridgecrest or  Malaga Cove intermediate schools or Miraleste High School, where a sixth grade  would have been created. The judge said the plan conflicts with her 1988 ruling  barring the district from making changes until an environmental impact report  is completed.  </P></p>

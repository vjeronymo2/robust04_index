			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pressure is rising among the conflicting factions in  Bosnia. Western leaders are all making statements about the  situation and are saying that the NATO ultimatum will be carried  through if the artillery weapons surrounding Sarajevo are not  surrendered. One of the latest statements on the matter came  from the U.S. defense secretary. William Perry stated that at  the moment the military options are evident. But despite the  strong stand, the international community continues divided.  Russia has called for a UN Security Council meeting, which is  due to take place within a few hours. The Russian diplomats say  that air strikes should only go ahead if Sarajevo is shelled  again.    The Russian deputy minister for foreign affairs is in Lisbon  and spoke about the situation. He was evasive. More details  from Pedro Leal:    [Begin recording] [Leal] Good morning Deputy Minister Sergey  Krylov. What will be the stand defended by Russia at this  afternoon's Security Council meeting?    [Krilov, in Portuguese] We will be defending our stand,  which  is that to start any sort of action it is necessary to continue  carrying out all resolutions approved previously.    [Leal] Does that mean that Russia is against NATO's  ultimatum?    [Krilov] It means that only the Security Council can issue a  mandate.    [Leal] Do you mean that Russia will submit NATO's ultimatum  to the Security Council's vote?    [Krilov] I would not say that.    [Leal] And what is Russia's intention in relation to the  Bosnian issue?    [Krilov] Our intention is that it is necessary to continue  this political line of promoting peace among the conflicting  sides.    [Leal] Does that mean that you are against air strikes on  artillery positions in Bosnia?    [Krilov] You must be well aware of the fact that the  ultimatum itself has already produced results.    [Leal] Does that mean -- I will ask again -- that you are  against strikes?    [Krilov] I believe that military force is the last resort.  When we all give up, then it can be used. We still have [word  indistinct] we still have the possibility of continuing with the  negotiations. This is a better option.    [Leal] What will be Russia's diplomatic approach if NATO  carries out its ultimatum on Bosnia?    [Krilov] We still have a few days left before that can  happen, and it is necessary to use other possibilities.    [Leal] One last question -- what will you be discussing this  afternoon at your meeting with Portuguese Minister for Foreign  Affairs Durao Barroso?    [Krilov] I will only be able to tell you that after the  meeting. [end recording]    That was Pedro Leal talking to the Russian deputy minister  for foreign affairs, who is visiting Portugal [end recording].</p>

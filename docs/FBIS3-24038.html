			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Claudia Melnic, minister of finance of the </F> Republic of Moldova, by Ivan Koretskiy, under the "Our  Interviews" rubric; place and date not given: "Claudia Melnic:  We Have Destroyed a Lot, Let Us Create"]    [Text]    [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, you have quite a busy  schedule, and due to this our conversation has been postponed a  number of times. Tell me please, what does the minister of  finance and the ministry headed by her work on so intensively?    [Melnic] It so happened that the adoption of documents that  are highly significant for the economy, business life, and the  social sphere occurred at the end of last year and the beginning  of this year. These are entire packages of solutions associated  with the introduction of a national currency, amendments to  laws, and the introduction of excise taxes. Some of them have  already been published in the press in the form of edicts of the  president of Moldova, and the rest are still being worked on.    Unfortunately, the Parliament did not complete its  law-creating activities, and we have to look for a way out of  the situation. The economy must work, and the budget must be  replenished through both production and taxes. Some of the  taxes--on real estate, natural resources, bank profits, and  insurance operations--are already operational. A number of  laws--on the value-added tax, on local taxes--have been  developed and are being considered by the Parliament and the  government. Apparently, they will also be enacted by a  presidential edict in order to be subsequently submitted to the  new Parliament to be discussed and adopted. All of them will  become components of the state tax system. In this manner, we  are trying to lay the foundation of a tax system that would be  in line with the conditions of a market economy and would make  it possible to make mutual relations between the state and  producers, entrepreneurs, and the population stable.    At present, the view exists that our tax system is  oppressive, although international experts evaluate it as being  reasonable. Thus, in the year 1993 the total amount of tax  revenues, including the social fund, is expected to reach 11-12  percent of the gross national product. In 1991, it stood at 38  percent, and in the current year 1994--15-18 percent. Therefore,  a stable tax system is emerging here, and it is beginning to  regulate the process of capital flows and to secure a balance of  sectors and areas of entrepreneurial activities.    [Koretskiy] Madam Minister, you have referred to the  value-added tax. It will affect primarily those to whom we  attach hopes for overcoming the crisis--the producers. A lot  depends on what this tax will be.    [Melnic] Indeed, this is one of the key aspects, and not  just  here, but in the CIS countries--after all, we have all come out  of the same economic system. For now, the value-added tax is not  changing. It should be coordinated with all economic partners.  Unfortunately, this issue was removed from the agenda at a  meeting in Ashgabat, because an agreement on the uniform rate of  the value-added tax in the process of switching to world-market  prices on 1 January 1994 and on arrangements for its collection  could not be reached.    It is not advantageous for the republics to add this tax to  the world-market prices for raw materials, because in this case  the cost of manufactured goods will be higher than world prices.  This means that products will be noncompetitive from the start.  A balanced approach is required of us in this instance.    [Koretskiy] So have we been importing and exporting products  at world-market prices from New Year's day on?    [Melnic] The issue of world-market prices has been resolved.  In the process, we succeeded in defending the interests of the  republic. For example, Russia tried to secure the setting of  world-market prices only for the products that are quoted on the  world market, i.e. oil, electricity, metal, timber. In this  case, it will turn out that nobody needs our tomatoes, even at a  negotiated price. We believe that the right of all CIS countries  to use world-market prices in settlements among themselves is  unshakeable. This is a complicated problem....    However, I would like to go back to your first question and  say that the Ministry of Finance has done a great volume of work  to come up with funds for the additional social protection of  the low-income strata of the population. You know that an edict  on the minimum wage has been issued, and that it is built on a  differentiated approach to various groups of the population.  This is associated with the sharp growth of expenditures for  energy resources. For example, the expenditure of funds for  heating comes to 15-17 lei per person. Meanwhile, the growth of  the average wage is falling behind considerably.    [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, this begs the natural  question: Why do wages never keep up with expenditures? Our  readers are asking in their letters and telephone calls: How is  one to survive in the future, given that a consumer basket costs  80-100 lei, whereas the minimum salary comes to 13 lei?    [Melnic] I would like to note that the welfare of the people  does not hinge on edicts to raise wages. Wage increases  immediately entail quite a tangle of closely intertwined  economic, financial, and political problems. We have put the  state budget together based on the average monthly salary of 15  lei, aiming at smooth quarterly salary raises. Any abrupt leap  amounts to an impulse for inflationary processes and the growth  of prices. For our part, we are trying as best we can to contain  these processes which affect the population adversely.    There have been certain shortcomings in the policy of  remunerations for labor and social welfare. We should inform the  population in advance about the expected price increases, the  rate of inflation, and wage increases. However, we must also  talk about something else. I have here on my desk data on the  average monthly salary for November 1993. For the employees of  state structures, it came to 63.4 lei, transportation  employees--58.7 lei, industry personnel--84.2 lei, and the  employees of the agrarian complex (kolkhozes, sovkhozes)--35.5  lei. This does not include payments in kind. Therefore, a  judgment cannot be formed solely on the basis of the size of the  minimum wage.    Still, our social fund is very weak. The priority task of  both our government and Parliament and those of the future is to  reinforce it, so that the people will feel confident. The people  should be protected.    [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, what is your assessment of  last year?    [Melnic] It was a difficult year, but during the year we  succeeded in the most important endeavor--to keep the peace. Not  everything has yet been settled in mutual relations with the  Dniester area, and the time has come to take measures to resolve  this issue. I think that the new Parliament will be up to that.    Here is another favorable aspect: During the year, our  production smoothly and inconspicuously discontinued its fall  and stabilized, and on some scores we even have increases. We  succeeded in limiting expenditures and containing the growth of  prices compared to other CIS countries. We avoided a crisis in  the budget system and, you will recall, there were no delays in  the payment of wages and funding for expenditures as we had had  before.    The volume of work for our ministry was simply tremendous.  After all, the budget was approved thrice in one year. Besides,  the state succeeded in settling its balance of payments, and now  we can make provisions for financial reserve and conduct  negotiations about credit. The state budget for 1993 was  implemented by 104.3 percent on the revenue side, and the  republic budget--by 101.4 percent.    [Koretskiy] Is it really that everything was good, and no  mistakes or miscalculations of any kind were allowed to occur?    [Melnic] Unfortunately, as early as the beginning of the  year, the government failed correctly to allocate capital  investment. Later, in the middle of the year, we were forced to  "freeze" 600 facilities under construction. We were not always  able correctly to project the rate of inflation, which was  mainly dictated by leaps in the prices for energy resources. We  did not manage to do many things, because of the absence of a  legislative base. As I have said before, we are now making up  for it by way of presidential edicts, so that reforms will not  get bogged down.    There were miscalculations, indeed. For example, we did not  succeed in fully restoring the system for managing the state  sector on a new, market foundation. It is known that the old  system has been completely destroyed. An owner should manage his  property; otherwise, the threat of losing this property will  arise. After all, in the process of privatization the state will  retain about 65 percent of the property, and it is necessary to  manage it wisely in order for the state to be a guarantor of  welfare and the effectiveness of operation of its enterprises on  an equal footing with other owners.    It is also necessary to streamline the system of  remunerations for labor, in order to avoid the tremendous  imbalance whereby at one enterprise they make 20 lei and at  another, 200 lei, with no regard for labor productivity. For the  state sector, we should make the procedures for the distribution  of profits between accumulation and consumption more rigid, so  that enterprises will use their profits for production purposes,  investment, and incentives for production, rather than just  wages. It is possible that we will have to limit wages, say, to  the level of 25 times the minimum wage, that is, set a limit for  remunerations for labor. For example, such restrictions apply in  countries such as Japan and Switzerland. These measures will  become acutely necessary if the economic forms of affecting  consumption produce no results.    [Koretskiy] What were the successes of the year?    [Melnic] Certainly, the adoption of a national currency,  although we did not succeed in including the entire republic.  The Ministry of Finance has always come out for settling  relations with the Dniester area prior to the introduction of  the national currency. A great many problems will now develop.  After all, the people have not severed family, business, or  production relations, and for that reason all of them are now  experiencing great inconvenience. The inconvenience is  associated with elementary payments for all services,  deliveries, and purchases. It appears to me that the authorities  of Tiraspol should take some measures so that the leu will  circulate similarly in the eastern rayons of the Republic of  Moldova, although for them this is also a political issue. After  all, they cannot live on ration cards forever. The currency  should work, and should bring the people closer together.    Last year, we also succeeded in preparing a draft budget for  1994 and in getting it approved ahead of time, prior to 1  January 1994. I will say frankly that the employees of our  ministry and I are very happy about this fact, because a budget  approved before the beginning of the year (for the first time in  the last three years) means stability for all producers,  consumers, and the social infrastructure. It is already clear  which taxes will be levied, where profits will go, and how much  will have to be withheld and for what.    It is possible that the budget for the second half of the  year will have to be updated. Everything will depend on the size  of emission, the growth of prices, and inflation. However, I  will stress that everything depends on ourselves, on the rate of  production, all the more so because the Ministry of Finance will  not receive credit from the National Bank of Moldova this year.  We should cover the deficit in full by issuing securities and  receiving foreign credit.    In general, international credit, support from the World  Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Governments of  the Russian Federation and Romania were very helpful in  overcoming the economic crisis caused by the war and the  drought. With this credit, the government purchased grain,  seeds, fertilizer, spare parts, fuel, and medicines. The  production and social spheres were supported out of them.    [Koretskiy] Perhaps, as a former banker and the current  minister of finance, you, Claudia Vasilyevna, know the saying  about credit which is as old as the hills: You take someone  else's, and you give back yours. How are we going to settle for  the debt? Are we not taking on too much credit?    [Melnic] Of course, it would be better to do without credit.  However, this is not possible in the environment of a  transitional economy. After all, our state, just like the rest  of the CIS countries, is insolvent. Meanwhile, we need to live,  work, turn out products, and buy goods. You will seek credit  whether you like it or not. The terms on which it is received  are another matter. The government has done a lot of work in  this area, so that these outlays will be used wisely and that  the consequence of their use will not place a heavy burden on  our children. I will say that a memorandum on the economic  policy of the state has been signed for 1994. It has been  discussed with international experts and gained approval.  Therefore, our economic policy has been found correct. In  December, the IMF resolved to grant us credit in the form of a  stand-by facility which opens certain prospects in Moldova's  relationship with the rest of the world.    We now need to support production in every way possible,  give  incentives to producers and the structures working to benefit  them. This is a way out of the situation and a guarantee for the  repayment of credit. Why import when it is possible to produce  here, locally, with material, tax, financial, and credit  support? This means an increase in production, an abundance of  goods, new jobs, and the growth of exports. In this case, it  will be easier to settle for credit.    [Koretskiy] Madam Minister, allow me to familiarize you with  one of the numerous letters received by our newspaper and  addressed to the government of which you are a member. In the  letter, a reader complains: "The impoverishment of the people  progresses year after year. For years, the people set aside  their savings at the most reliable bank, the Savings Bank, only  to be left high and dry now. Through the effort of our rulers,  our savings have turned to dust. At present, one cannot buy a  funeral shroud with them, let alone ensure a decent funeral for  himself...."    [Melnic] I must note that these accusations are not leveled  at the real culprits, and I will explain why. The shock therapy  of 1991 blew the savings of the people away like a whirlwind.  The Government of the USSR and our Moldovan Government had a  hand in it. Until 1 January 1992, about 5 billion rubles [R]  were borrowed from the Savings Bank of Moldova with a view to  covering the deficit of the Union budget. By now, this debt has  been fully paid by the government. All arrears on various  compensation payments have also been paid in full. The Ministry  of Finance has also paid in full the value of the state  securities of the former USSR. Therefore, all of our  relationships with the deposits of the population have been  completed.    I believe that indexation should be performed out of the  profits of the Savings Bank, in keeping with the Law on  Indexation. It is the savings banks that administer profits  rather than the state. They charge 200-270 percent in interest  rates on credit, and pay next to nothing to the depositors.  They, the depositors, should demand appropriate payments and  indexation directly from the Savings Bank.    [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, you are the only female  minister of the government. Tell us how you handle this burden  of responsibilities.    [Melnic] This is not a job for a woman. You are busy 16-18  hours a day, and then you have a family and children! In  addition, you take work home every evening in order to manage,  and there are no days off.... One needs nerves of steel and  health to endure this.    I have endured because I continuously got support from my  male colleagues. I will say frankly that on occasion I have  abused the fact that I am a woman in resolving significant  issues of principle. However, this is no way out anyway. I hope  that a man will come to this position who will have enough  willpower, persistence, and experience to implement the  financial stabilization policy.    [Koretskiy] Should this be interpreted to say that you are  completing your political career?    [Melnic] I have never considered myself a politician.  Considering myself a specialist--indeed, and then a specialist  of the old school, for whom the words of a song, "Think about  the motherland first, and about yourself next" is the creed of  life.    I came to this position contrary to my own wishes and the  wishes of my loved ones, and solely on the condition that there  would be no more war, and that the government of national accord  would not allow this nightmare to occur.    Despite all the difficulties, this has been a happy and  interesting period in my life. Together with the staff of the  Ministry of Finance, who are capable of moving mountains, we  have managed to accomplish a lot, and this is gratifying.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago traders tired of being early birds OLD HABITS die hard. At the Chicago Board of Trade, where the opening bell for grain futures had rung at 9.30am for 100 years, traders are having trouble adjusting to starting work an hour earlier. In response to a petition by disgruntled members, the exchange will on November 30 hold a vote on whether to ditch the new schedule. The CBoT moved to an 8.30am opening in July in an effort to position its agricultural contracts more prominently in the European business day. The action came after a membership vote in May of 583 to 347 in favour of the plan. While CBoT agricultural volume increased through the summer, traders say the surge was due to midwestern floods and a drought in the south-east which reduced maize and soyabean harvests. The extra hour of trading has done little to boost European business, critics say, and they're tired of the inconvenience. The board of director's decision to put the issue to a membership vote for a second time this year reflects the fragmented state of the exchange's leadership. Mr Patrick Arbor, the chairman, strongly supports the earlier hours, and believes they should be tested for a full year to see if they improve exchange competitiveness. Lumber futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange skidded yesterday despite news on Wednesday that US housing starts had reached their highest level in four years in October, and that the issue of housing permits, an indicator of future building activity, was also on the increase. Lumber prices for January delivery dropped as much as Dollars 10 per 1,000 thousand board-feet as traders reacted to weak prices in the underlying cash markets. The futures contract, which peaked at Dollars 419.60 on November 9, has retreated by nearly Dollars 50, in part because high prices have discouraged wholesale buying at sawmills, and wood delivered against the November futures contract has dumped cheaper supplies on the secondary markets. 'The mills are trying to market lumber at a cash price of about Dollars 390, while the secondary market is at Dollars 370,' said Mr Curt Cunningham, a forest products analyst at Pacific Trading in Seattle. At Dollars 373, the futures contract was indicating a cash price of about Dollars 362, he said. Over the longer term, strong housing demand and sharply reduced timber cutting would support prices, he added. 'I think you'll probably see futures move to last year's price peaks or higher.'</p>

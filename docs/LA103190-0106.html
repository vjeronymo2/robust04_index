			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 128 MIGHT DOUBLE MOST SEWER BILLS IN O.C.;  </P> <P> ELECTION: MOST COUNTY OFFICIALS OPPOSE BIG GREEN, CONTENDING THE PRESENT  TREATMENT SYSTEM IS ADEQUATE.  </P> <P> A little-known provision of the sweeping Big Green initiative could force  Orange County to double the sewer bills of most residents and spend $1.4  billion to improve its system for treating waste before it is pumped into the  ocean.  </P> <P> As a result, most city and county officials in Orange County oppose the  statewide environmental initiative on the Nov. 6 ballot, arguing that the  county's existing sewage treatment already safeguards the ocean and that the  costly project would yield negligible benefits.  </P> <P> Environmentalists contend that the improvements are necessary because  California's ocean waters are being filled with millions of gallons of waste  every day that could pose a risk to swimmers and turn waters into "dead zones"  for marine life.  </P> <P> "Eventually, there will be sudden and irreversible collapse of the ocean  ecosystem, and we don't think it's worth the risk," said Carl Pope, the Sierra  Club's deputy conservation director and an author of Proposition 128, better  known as Big Green.  </P> <P> At issue is a provision generally overlooked amid the initiative's wider issues  of global warming, ozone depletion and pesticide use.  </P> <P> It would require all sewage to undergo secondary treatment, an advanced process  that eliminates 85% of solid pollutants, before it is released into the ocean  or waterways, beginning in the year 2000.  </P> <P> Such treatment is required by federal law, but Orange County is the largest of  60 areas nationwide that have been granted an exemption from the Environmental  Protection Agency, mainly because its effluent is considered "high quality" and  is released five miles out to sea. Only three small towns in California have  similar waivers.  </P> <P> "We don't see any justified reason to spend $1.4 billion when there's no  demonstrated problem," said J. Wayne Sylvester, general manager of the Orange  County Sanitation Districts. "Based on the scientific work we did and the ocean  monitoring, we believe very strongly that the current program protects the  ocean."  </P> <P> The higher sewer rates and a cleaner ocean are the factors in Big Green that  could have the most direct impact on Orange County residents. The far-reaching  ballot measure also sets up a $500-million oil-spill fund, phases out  cancer-causing pesticides, cuts greenhouse gases by 20%, conserves redwoods and  tackles many other environmental issues.  </P> <P> The high cost of Proposition 128 is the major ammunition being used by  opponents, who estimate that its implementation will cost California $8 billion  to $12 billion per year. Environmentalists dispute that figure, saying  Californians will eventually save money in health and environmental costs.  </P> <P> A Times Poll conducted last week showed Californians are split on the  proposition: 44% oppose the measure and 42% support it.  </P> <P> The focal point of the sewage debate is a pipeline that stretches from the  shore of Huntington Beach near Brookhurst Avenue five miles out to sea, resting  on a bed of rocks at a depth of 200 feet.  </P> <P> Every day, 260 million gallons of waste water is discharged into the ocean  through the pipeline. Half of this has undergone secondary treatment, while the  other half has undergone a less thorough stage of treatment called advanced  primary.  </P> <P> Under the existing system, an average of 75% of the solid substances in Orange  County's sewage is eliminated, compared to 85% if all of it were subjected to  secondary treatment. The difference amounts to about 32 tons of solids a day  pumped into the ocean, according to a sanitation agency report.  </P> <P> In addition, 370 pounds of toxics a day would be discharged, instead of the  current 550 pounds, the report said. Bacteria concentrations -- an indicator of  viruses and other threats -- would drop from the 1.3 million organisms per 100  milliliters using the current system to 200,000.  </P> <P> Sanitation officials say the initiative might not apply to Orange County's  sewage because, unlike that of other areas, it is discharged in federal waters  that are beyond the usual 3-mile state limits. If the measure passes, legal  challenges are probably the only way the issue will be resolved in Orange  County.  </P> <P> Environmentalists who drafted Big Green said they hadn't considered Orange  County's unique situation with its deep-sea pipeline. But they intended the  county to be included, and they believe the courts would agree.  </P> <P> "They would have to comply unless they can demonstrate it doesn't reach state  waters. But the ocean doesn't work that way," the Sierra Club's Pope said.  "Orange County's (waste) winds up in our waters."  </P> <P> To pay for the improved treatment system, sewer bills would increase for about  2 million Orange County residents, from Irvine north to the county line, who  are served by the Orange County Sanitation Districts. South County residents  are served by different agencies that already comply.  </P> <P> An average residential sewer bill would gradually increase from the current $53  per year to $113 if the county switched to full secondary treatment, sanitation  officials say.  </P> <P> Almost two years ago, the sanitation agency conducted a study on the costs and  impact of switching to full secondary treatment. Officials concluded at that  time, before Big Green was drafted, that it would cost $1.4 billion to build  new facilities and improve the existing ones. Because of the high cost, the  board decided last year to apply for a 5-year renewal of the federal waiver  instead, and it is now under consideration by the EPA.  </P> <P> Environmentalists agree that the sewage project would be expensive, but they  said they doubt that it would cost $1.4 billion, since half the sewage already  receives secondary treatment.  </P> <P> The county's sanitation board, made up mostly of city council members and  county supervisors, voted 29 to 1 earlier this month to oppose the initiative,  saying it imposed "significant cost with no discernible benefit."  </P> <P> Marine scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, including  Roger Revelle and Edward Goldberg, are among those opposed to spending money on  secondary treatment because they say there is no scientific evidence that it is  needed. Revelle, director emeritus of Scripps, is the nation's premier marine  expert, and Goldberg, a chemist, won the Tyler Prize in 1989, one of the  highest awards for environmental achievements.  </P> <P> The Orange County sanitation agency's study concluded that the bacteria and  other pollutants in the treated sewage pose no risk to public health because  they are dumped far offshore after being diluted. The impact on marine life is  less certain. Marine biologists say the mix of tiny worms, clams and other  organisms in the 16 acres of ocean floor around Orange County's discharge pipe  has changed, but scientists have not determined if the changes are bad, good,  or insignificant.  </P> <P> Councilman Peter M. Green of Huntington Beach, the city most affected by the  effluent, is a supporter of Big Green.  </P> <P> Green said the initiative has so many clauses that are important to Orange  County, such as creating an oil-spill cleanup fund and giving state health  officials some authority over malathion spraying, that it deserves voter  approval.  </P></p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Trustees' investment powers to be widened - Charities CHARITIES could benefit by several hundred million pounds as a result of a government concession giving charitable trustees wider discretion in how they invest their funds. Ministers are to draw up regulations to give charities broader powers of investment than provided for by the Trustee Investment Act 1961. This says that only half a charity's assets can be invested in shares rather than in gilts. The regulations are expected to be drawn up over the summer and to come into force at the begining of next year. Though the new regime has yet to be decided, charity organisations are looking for a system that would allow three quarters or four fifths of a charity's assets to be invested in shares. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, estimates that charities have lost about Pounds 400m a year because of the restrictions in the Trustee Investments Act. The move follows an embarrassing defeat for ministers before Christmas during discussion of charities legislation in the Lords. The concession represents a victory for the Home Office over the Treasury, which had previously taken the line that the question should not be dealt with separately from the broader consideration of the 1961 act. A consultation paper on the issue has been promised 'in due course', but there is no prospect of this being published before the election. Ministers held out, however, against another change on which they were defeated, which would have limited trustees' liability to the assets of the charity. Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister, said the government would consider how to address the point - raised by peers  - that unlimited personal liability deterred people from becoming trustees of unincorporated charities. However, he said that was too complex to be dealt with quickly enough for inclusion in the bill.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (15): Information 'highway' to stimulate regeneration - Community enterprise At first sight, the electronic world of the information 'superhighways' is far removed from the unemployed of Hartcliffe, a deprived part of south Bristol which gained national notoriety in 1992 because of rioting, writes Roland Adburgham. Hartcliffe is not a typical inner-city suburb. When its post-war housing estates were built by the local authority, the planners might have believed they were creating a desirable environment. Set within sight of fields and hills, Hartcliffe has wide streets, green spaces, houses with gardens and only a handful of high-rise blocks. In common with many other imposed ideas, it was badly flawed. Hartcliffe lacked shops and community facilities. It was isolated by several miles from the city centre with no rail service and poor road connections. Crucially, there was no social mix of housing. There was also over-dependency upon a single employer, a Wills tobacco factory. When that closed four years ago, about 4,000 people lost their jobs. No alternative use for the factory has yet been found by Hanson, the owner. Despite the establishment of a business park in Hartcliffe, attempts for large-scale job creation are handicapped by the inadequate transport links. Unemployment is above the Bristol average and rates of economic activity are low. It is against this background that an innovative project has been launched as a stimulus to regeneration. The South Bristol Learning Network (SBLN) intends to develop a cable-based telecommunications infrastructure not for commercial gain but community gain. The concept is that cable, by linking houses, businesses, schools and other organisations, helps to circumvent transport problems and provides access to local, national and international information sources. The network has potential for use as a billboard, for interactive TV programmes, public access broadcasting and teleworking. The hope is that it will improve the skills of the labour force, encourage lifelong learning and help to rebuild a sense of community. Funding of Pounds 750,000 has come from Avon training and enterprise council, which secured the money last year under the government's Tec Challenge competition. The partnership project, developed jointly with South Bristol College, is using a cable network laid by United Artists. Mr John O'Hara, the evangelistic project leader, sees the network as a prototype which can be replicated across the country. Considerable interest has already been shown in the US. He emphasises how the SBLN contrasts with the usual 'top down' development of information superhighways, with little involvement at community level. 'The potential for cultural change is immense,' he says. 'While the first responses of local people are usually negative, subsequently they become more positive as they see how they can shape the technology for their own ends.' Staff for the SBLN have been recruited locally from among the unemployed, who mostly lacked skills in new technology. More than 50 employees have been trained, more than half of whom had been previously out of work for at least six months. They come from a variety of backgrounds and ages, ranging from 19 to 60. An assessment of the project for Avon Tec reported: 'They have set about their tasks with enthusiasm, drawing on previously untapped energy and expertise.' This month, the SBLN started 'cyberskills' workshops at ICL's offices in Bristol to create a city-wide awareness of the potential of multimedia. Mr Malcolm Napier, ICL's business development manager responsible for the company's lifelong learning strategy, describes the workshops as 'giving first-hand experience of what the superhighway means.' The workshops are being run by SBLN's staff and undergraduates from the computer science department of Bristol University. They are sponsored by ICL in association with Avon Tec, BT, CompuServe and South Bristol College. Over the next few months, the workshops will demonstrate to 1,000 people, identified as 'community influencers', how to use the Internet, e-mail, CD-Rom and video-conferencing. In job-creation terms, the SBLN will have limited impact on Hartcliffe, at least in the short-term. But it is indicative of a realisation that there is no single or simple solution to the area's problems. A separate partnership scheme to raise the Hartcliffe skills base and improve the community is the Gatehouse Centre. This Pounds 1.5m building, to open next year, is being funded by the government with a Pounds 500,000 urban partnership grant, the city council and the private sector, which has so far donated Pounds 350,000. Initiated by Hartcliffe &amp; Withywood Ventures, it will include a training centre with a nursery, light industrial units, meeting room, cafe and shops. Another local community project, to help young people, is Hartcliffe Leisure. This is a company set up in partnership with the Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative to organise a range of after-school activities. One of the grants which helped to establish it came from the Greater Bristol Foundation. A charitable trust set up in 1987, the foundation provides a professional service for donors who want to support local causes but who need advice on identifying potential beneficiaries. The foundation now has an endowment fund of more than Pounds 2m, contributed by a wide range of companies, organisations, charitable trusts and individuals. It has distributed more than Pounds 700,000 to more than 300 schemes and groups. The priorities are projects for young and disabled people, the homeless and those disadvantaged by isolation. Penny Johnstone, the director, says that the outside view of Bristol as a prosperous city does not tally with the evidence of areas of deprivation. But within the city, she says, there have been large strides in the past few years in the willingness of people to collaborate in supporting such projects.</p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Banks meet over Ferruzzi debts: Smaller foreign banks nervous about suicide of Gardini FOREIGN banks owed L6,500bn (Pounds 2.72bn) in the collapse of the Ferruzzi-Montedison group are due to attend a creditors' meeting in Milan tomorrow under the auspices of the Bank of Italy. The meeting has been called by Mediobanca which is co-ordinating the rescue operation through five Italian and two foreign banks. By holding the session at the Milan offices of the Bank of Italy, Mediobanca has aimed to give a sense of neutrality while also demonstrating the central bank's commitment to the orderly resolution of the problems created by Ferruzzi's L31,000bn consolidated debt. But the meeting has been complicated by the extraordinary string of recent events affecting the leading players in Italy's second largest private group and the state of Ferruzzi-Montedison's finances. As a result, some of the smaller foreign banks may well be tempted to invoke proceedings for default. Until now the two foreign banks on the rescue committee, Switzerland's UBS and France's Societe Generale, have not raised the issue. The foreign banks, however, have been made nervous by the shock-waves following the suicide by Mr Raul Gardini, the former head of the Ferruzzi empire, and by arrest warrants issued for four key figures connected with the group on charges including alleged falsifying accounts and illicit financing of political parties. It is now certain, according to Milan magistrates, that Mr Gardini would have been arrested on similar charges had he not committed suicide. Mr Carlo Sama, married to one of the three sisters of the empire's founder the late Arturo Ferruzzi, and former chief executive of Montedison, the group's chemicals arm, is now in prison on charges of alleged falsifying accounts and corruption. Mr Vittorio Giuliani Ricci, married to another of Arturo Ferruzzi's daughters, and a leading group executive, has been released on bail. The late Mr Gardini's close associate, Mr Sergio Cusani, a financier close to the Socialist Party, was also arrested on corruption charges allegedly related to the creation of a L100bn slush fund resulting from Ferruzzi-Montedison's involvement in the reorganisation of the chemicals industry. Over the weekend Mr Giuseppe Berlini, the Ferruzzi family's private financier, handed himself in to Milan magistrates after an arrest warrant was issued for alleged corruption' These arrests, coupled with the continued interrogation of Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the former chief executive of Montedison, have already begun to shed light on some of the reasons behind Ferruzzi's huge debts and losses. Evidence has emerged that goes some way to explain the mysterious announcement on June 28 that Montedison had lost an extra L320bn in 1992 only days after shareholders had approved the year's accounts. According to extracts of Mr Garofano's testimony due to be published today by Il Mondo, a weekly magazine, these losses relate directly to commodity trading deals conducted by Mr Gardini. To cover commodities trading losses of Dollars 60m-Dollars 80m (Pounds 40m-Pounds 53m), Mr Gardini decided to speculate in soya in 1989. This was already public knowledge since the Chicago Board of Trade subsequently imposed a Dollars 2m fine on the Ferruzzi group. However, according to Mr Garofano's testimony, Mr Gardini lost Dollars 350m-Dollars 400m. Of this only Dollars 150m was written into the accounts of Ferruzzi Finanzaria (Ferfin) in 1990 and the remainder was temporarily covered by Montedison arranging a back-to-back financial operation with Montedison International, allegedly using the services of Mr Berlini. The Garofano testimony goes on to allege that the extra L320bn hole in Montedison's 1992 accounts was due to the Ferruzzi family seeking to cover the bulk of the commodities losses caused by the days of the Gardini chairmanship by attributing them to Montedison.</p>

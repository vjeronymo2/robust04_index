			<p>BFN     [Text] Haikou, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The employees of all  enterprises and institutions in Hainan Province, China's largest  special economic zone, are now covered by a unified social  insurance system.    In 1991, the Hainan Provincial Government issued preliminary  guidelines for retirement, job injury, unemployment and medical  insurance coverage.    The regulations have now been popularized, spreading from  state-owned enterprises and some collectively-owned enterprises  to all kinds of enterprises and institutions.    The province has standardized insurance rates as a  proportion  of total salary figures.    By the end of 1993, 9,298 enterprises, including 777  foreign-funded ones, had joined the insurance service system.    About 732,000 employees will benefit from the services.    In 1993, 189,964 retired employees in Hainan received  pensions and 681 unemployed workers received relief funds from  the service.    At the end of last year, the Hainan Provincial People's  Congress approved three sets of insurance regulations concerning  retirement, job injury and unemployment.    The regulations have extended their scope to government  organs and self-employed businesses.    Sources said that the insurance service system in Hainan has  taken the lead in the development of the service in China.</p>

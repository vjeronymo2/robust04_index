			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Vasilyev report under the "Trouble Spots" rubric: </F> "Bosnians Offered `Territorial Compromise'"]    [Text] The ministerial meeting on a settlement of the  Bosnian crisis involving Russia, the United States, and five EU  countries ended in Geneva last weekend. On returning to Moscow  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev noted that conditions  for a political settlement of the conflict in Bosnia had been  created in Geneva and that the opposing sides had regarded the  ministers' efforts with understanding.    "I must say that the response from both the Serb and Muslim  leadership was pretty good," the Foreign Ministry head stated.  "We were in contact with the prime minister of Bosnia and  Herzegovina, Haris Silajdzic, during which time considerable  scope for work on a settlement based on the adopted document  emerged. I consider that signals of a readiness to embark on  talks without preconditions are also forthcoming from the Serb  side, which is very important."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial] </F>   [Text] Jordan's voice was clear and loud while rejecting  threats made by terrorist Yitzhaq Rabin, who has a black record  in dealing with our kinsfolk and people in the areas to the west  of the river.    King Husayn's voice represented this country's position  while  he replied strongly to the enemy's allegations, lies, and  instigations concerning Jordan's relations with so-called  terrorism. Jordan and its people have been harmed the most by  the Jews' terrorism, aggression, and brutal arrogance.    The government did the same in its analysis of the enemy's  bankruptcy and failure after the painful jihad attacks launched  in retaliation for the crimes committed by the enemy's army and  settlers, who shed Arab and Palestinian blood.    The position of our country, whether voiced by King Husayn  or  the government statement, emphasized that there is no organized  Hamas Movement presence on Jordanian land. Hamas, this jihad  movement that was born, grew, and escalated its struggle in the  occupied Palestinian territories, developed as a deep  demonstration of a Palestinian jihad case that soon extended its  roots deep into the popular Palestinian conscience. This  Palestinian conscience felt that after long struggle under  various bases and ideologies, it was in need of activating  resistance against the occupation in accordance with new bases  and different plans.    This means Hamas is not a rootless plant, but the  culmination  of the results of the Palestinian people's struggle in  particular, and the fruit of an Islamic renaissance plan that  began to take shape throughout the Islamic world after the  Islamic nation reached a unique situation of humiliation, denial  of a role, and estrangement.    If Hamas' jihad operations are fully planned and executed in  the Palestinian territories, as the United States admitted when  Israel accused Washington of providing refuge to Hamas' leaders  on its land, these operations are well received by the sons of  this nation--whether on the beloved land of Jordan, or elsewhere  in free Arab and Islamic countries. These operations were  received with a good and spontaneous response that relieves the  souls of those who had suffered defeats and setbacks over the  past century, during which the Jews became more monstrous and  assumed a high status in the records of those who commit crimes,  racism, aggression, and terrorism.    Hamas, which is an indivisible and pedigreed component of  the living Palestinian people in particular, and the Islamic  nation in general, has embodied a particular form of jihad that  is cherished by both Arabs and Muslims. It is hard for any  political player in the region and the world at large to  circumvent or overlook this fact, although the PLO was  officially recognized by the Arabs, the world community, and  Jews as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian  people. Had the PLO itself been impressed about its status as  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, it  would not have opened a dialogue with Hamas and its leaders,  urging them to join the PLO. Had this been the case, foreign  and Arab governments would not have sought talks and meetings  with Hamas and Hamas leaders. Even the enemy expedited the  conclusion of the Oslo accord with the tyrannical PLO leadership  because it does not want to deal with Hamas. The enemy is well  aware of the role Hamas has begun to play on the Palestinian  scene. Likewise, it is well aware of the prestige Hamas now  enjoys within the Palestinian community.    In addition to this, nobody can deny Hamas is influencing  the  course of negotiations. It is true Hamas is not involved in  the negotiations. Nonetheless, it is influencing the  negotiations. In this regard, suffice it to note the  unprecedented statement terrorist Rabin made to the effect that  his government is ready to dismantle settlements in the West  Bank and Gaza Strip in return for a final arrangement or  solution with the Palestinians. It is no coincidence that this  statement by Rabin was made in the aftermath of the Hadera and  'Afula attacks. Consequently, Hamas operations have indirectly  and unintentionally contributed to promoting the Palestinian  negotiating position. Who knows? Had it not been for the  Palestinian opposition and their jihad operations, the  Palestinian negotiating team might not have obtained half the  gains they were promised. In the same vein, were the  Palestinian negotiators to demonstrate a measure of patience,  they would be able to force some of their conditions, something  that could help them regain more Palestinian rights--the very  rights that are being undermined at the negotiating tables in  Cairo, Oslo, and Madrid.    Given all this, we support the leadership of this beloved  country that has rejected the enemy's arrogant threats, which  are nourished by evil U.S. and European powers. We are opposed  to the constant attempts to apply economic and political  pressure on Jordan. We stand united and supportive of the  efforts to confront aggression and defend Jordanian national  soil and our sacred national unity, as well. We are willing to  sacrifice our lives to protect the homeland. Likewise, we are  ready to build a protective shield around the homeland. This is  a sacred duty we must perform. As for Palestine, and the  Palestinian revolution, fighting the occupation and the enemy's  quest for domination, they are our first line of defense. We  will be the strategic depth of this revolution when war erupts,  as we have always been.    This beloved homeland yesterday celebrated the completion of  the third Hashemite restoration of the Dome of the Rock and the  al-Aqsa Mosque, the jewel of Jerusalem, the queen among cities,  the epitome of Islamic dignity, the place to which our Prophet  Muhammad, may God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon him,  made his nocturnal journey, and the third holiest shrine.    May Jordan always remain a sanctuary for free men and  support  Palestine and the Palestinians. This Hashemite restoration work  conducted on the holiest shrine in Palestine, which was made  possible by the donation made by His Majesty King Husayn, is a  strong reflection of this constantly lofty Jordanian position.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All figures as published] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the government gave for the first time a  detailed account of how it has been using the resources obtained  from the privatization process during 1992, 1993, and 1994.    Finance Vice Minister Alfredo Jalilie, who appeared before  the CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] Budget Commission to  explain how the budget was implemented during the first quarter  of the year, said that he would "clear up the great doubts" the  people have about how the funds obtained from the privatization  process are being used.    Jalilie started off by explaining that from 1991 up to 7  June  of this year, the state has obtained approximately $1.714  billion from the privatization process, in addition to $3  million in interest earned by these funds.    The vice minister added: "In 1991, the state obtained $1.738  million; $45 million in 1992; $166 million in 1993; and $1.5  billion so far this year." "Important companies such as  Interbanc, Continental, and Lima Electric Power Enterprise will  be privatized this year. It is therefore quite likely that an  additional $1 billion will be obtained."    Jalilie then itemized the expenditures financed with  privatization funds, justifying each expenditure with the  corresponding law. He explained that to date, from the $1.717  billion (privatization resources plus interest), a total of $242  million (or the equivalent of 511.9 million Peruvian soles) has  financed social programs as stipulated in the privatization law.  There is therefore a surplus of $1.475 billion that has still  not been used.    The 511.9 million soles were spent in the following way: 6.8  million in 1992, 376.6 million in 1993, and 128.5 million in  1994.    Jalilie explained that "according to the letter of intent  signed with the IMF, the maximum amount we can use this year  from the privatization process is $865 million."    The 6.8 million soles used in 1992 were earmarked for the  public universities. The 376.6 million soles used in 1993 were  for the social projects designed to eradicate poverty executed  by Foncodes [National Compensation and Social Development Fund],  Pronaa [National Food Assistance Program], and the Education and  Agriculture Ministries, among other programs, such as those to  equip the universities, broaden the electricity supply network,  acquire the Lima thermoelectric plant, build several schools,  and repair the highway network.    In 1994, the 128.5 million soles obtained from the  privatization process were used for the Glass of Milk program  implemented by the municipalities, Foncodes, Pronaa, and Infes  [National Institute of Education and Health Infrastructure].    After this explanation, Jalilie said that social expenditure  must be interpreted, above all, as an effort to improve the  living standard, and this is why the state invests in schools,  universities, etc. The vice minister ended his explanation by  stating: "The results of this sort of social expenditure will  appear in the long term."    As he left Congress building, Jalilie said that "for the  time  being there is no need to reorganize the budget. But at the end  of the last quarter of the year we will have to make some  adjustment with a supplementary loan to be coordinated with the  Budget Commission."    In his capacity as president of the National Bank, Jalilie  also referred to this institution: "A total of 2,000 employees  have resigned, many more than we expected. As a consequence, the  National Bank will now operate with only 2,750 employees, as an  agile, modern, and competitive bank."    Regarding the implementation of the budget during the first  quarter of this year, Vice Minister Alfredo Jalilie, who was  accompanied by Budget Director Reynaldo Bringas, said that less  than expected had been spent. During this period the central  government's income amounted to 2.746 billion soles, while its  expenditures amounted to 2.686 billion soles, 542.9 million  soles less than expected.    Jalilie commented that "this is normal every year," and  added  that "during the first quarter the goals that were set were not  attained because the disbursements of multilateral organizations  were delayed until the second quarter of the year. Therefore, a  series of projects that were being financed with these funds had  to be postponed."    Lastly, Jalilie explained that the "prospects for this year  are very favorable. We are going to close the year with a 0.6  percent deficit in the GDP, which had been estimated at 1.8  percent."    In 15 days' time, the Treasury will issue BCR [Central  Reserve Bank] Capitalization Bonds amounting to 200 million  soles, which will allow the Central Bank to withdraw the excess  amount of soles resulting from the purchase of dollars to avoid  the exchange rate from dropping.    Jalilie explained that "with these bonds the BCR will have a  valid tool for eliminating these soles and thus eliminate the  fiscal deficit they were generating."    The vice minister explained that the AFP's [Pension Fund  Administration Companies] had insisted on the issuance of those  bonds for investment purposes as they are profitable, generating  a monthly interest of 1.8 percent.    These 200 million soles are part of the 618 million soles to  be issued as BCR funds, although the difference will not  generate interest.</p>

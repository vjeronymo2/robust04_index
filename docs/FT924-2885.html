			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Grainger loses Pounds 4m on provision GRAINGER TRUST, the property investor and trader, yesterday reported a swing from profits of Pounds 1.37m to losses of Pounds 4.42m pre-tax for the year to September 30. The figure was struck after taking account of an exceptional write-down of Pounds 5.57m on building land. Tax credits of Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 234,000) left the after-tax deficit at Pounds 1.92m, compared with a profit of Pounds 1.61m last time. Losses per share were 9.56p (earnings 8.03p) but a final dividend of 4.05p makes a same-again 5.25p total. Trading profits fell by 34 per cent to Pounds 8.68m (Pounds 13.2m) due to difficult conditions in the housing market. Turnover was also down, at Pounds 28.7m (Pounds 34.8m). Gross rentals improved by 8 per cent to Pounds 9.87m thanks to favourable rent reviews and re-registrations; net cash inflow from operating activities rose to Pounds 18.4m (Pounds 15.6m). Mr Stephen Dickinson, managing director, said the group was not disappointed. 'We think we've done extremely well in a very difficult period,' he said. The group has renegotiated bank borrowings, repayable over 15 years to 2007, of Pounds 92.6m out of a total as at September 30 of Pounds 107.8m. The group plans a substantial reduction in net borrowings over the next five years. Net asset value, adjusted for market value of trading properties, was Pounds 2.93 (Pounds 3.29).</p>

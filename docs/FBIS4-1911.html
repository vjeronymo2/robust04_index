			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Self-Employed Traders in Gongbei Go on Strike </F> Yesterday"]    [Text] At 1100 on 31 March, some shops on Buxing Street in  Zhuhai City's Gongbei market went on strike. This has drawn the  attention of various quarters.    There are 68 shops on Buxing Street, only a stone's throw  away from Gongbei Customs. Built by the Zhuhai City Bureau of  Industry and Commerce, the shops have been leased to  self-employed traders. As they are situated in a busy street,  business is brisk and the self-employed traders make handsome  profits.    When the lease contracts expired on 31 July last year, the  Gongbei Sub-Bureau of Industry and Commerce planned to take back  the shop space and fix the rent through public bidding. But  some self-employed traders disagreed. To carry out fair, just,  and open competition, the Gongbei Sub-Bureau decided to assign  shop spaces by drawing lots but this move was also rejected.    To show consideration for the interest of self-employed  traders and properly renew the shop leases, the Gongbei  Sub-Bureau conducted a thoroughgoing and meticulous  investigation. They discovered that the monthly rent in nearby  places ranged between 300 and 500 yuan per square meter, but it  was only 40-50 yuan on Buxing Street. Moreover, a handful of  self-employed traders were also found to have rerented or sold  their shop spaces to other people at a profit. This move  contravened the lease contracts. Consequently, the Sub-Bureau  decided in March this year to adjust the shop space rent on  Buxing Street according to the following criteria: For the two  rows on the front gate, the rent is 300 yuan per square meter a  month on the ground floor and 150 yuan in the loft; for the two  rows in the middle, the rent is 250 yuan on the ground floor and  125 yuan in the loft. As Buxing Street is located in an  excellent place where business is brisk, such terms are quite  favorable.    At 1100 on 31 March, a shopkeeper and several others decided  to go on strike. This move affected business activities around  the Gongbei market.    On learning this, the Zhuhai City Bureau of Industry and  Commerce called for strict management according to relevant  rules and regulations. The Gongbei Sub-Bureau is holding talks  with directors of the local association of self-employed workers  in an effort to gain a better understanding of the situation.  The incident is still being dealt with.    [Hong Kong TA KUNG PAO in Chinese on 1 April carries a  similiar report on page 4 stating that all 68 self-employed  traders on Buxing Street went on strike in protest yesterday]</p>

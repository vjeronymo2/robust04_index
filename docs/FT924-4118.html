			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK-China relations 'worst for years' SIR Percy Cradock, the former policy adviser to both Lady Thatcher and Mr John Major, the prime minister, warned last night that the present crisis in British-Chinese relations over Hong Kong was the worst for many years. To find such tension in relations between the two countries it would be necessary to go back to the days of the cultural revolution in China in the 1960s, he indicated on BBC television's Newsnight programme. Referring to Beijing's threat to revoke any contracts concluded in Hong Kong before sovereignty over the colony reverts to China in 1997, if they have not got China's approval, Sir Percy said the Chinese meant precisely what they said. 'To discount their seriousness would be a very great mistake.' Sir Percy, a former British ambassador to Beijing, said it was a fallacy to believe that China was bluffing and that it would change its tune because of economic considerations. 'This is a matter of national pride for them. They will not give way.' Nor did Sir Percy think that if a more liberal regime came to power in China there would be any change in its opposition to the democratic reforms proposed by Mr Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor, which are believed to be the cause of Beijing's present anti-British campaign. The Foreign Office said last night that nothing that Sir Percy had said could invalidate Mr Patten's proposals. Officials stressed that these were no more than proposals and that Hong Kong and the British government were still waiting for the Chinese to make counter-proposals if they did not like Mr Patten's reforms.</p>

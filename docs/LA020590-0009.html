			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLISEUM  </P> <P> We were shocked to read in Kenneth Reich's article ("Coliseum Rebuilding Plan  Hits Snag," Metro, Jan. 26) that the private managers of the Coliseum would  attempt an end run around existing state laws to allow them to hastily bulldoze  the historic Coliseum. Everyone knows that it is unsportsmanlike conduct to  change the rules in the middle of the game.  </P> <P> The proponents of destruction must be afraid of public scrutiny. Or, perhaps  they are afraid that an objective analysis will demonstrate that, for a  fraction of the cost of building a new stadium, the existing structure can be  reconfigured and adaptively used to achieve their specific goals.  </P> <P> State law requires the preparation of a full environmental impact report before  the Coliseum Commission can legally demolish (or allow others to demolish) the  Coliseum. The purpose of this law is simply to provide an objective analysis of  the alternatives and to provide the public the opportunity to review and  comment on the proposal and alternatives.  </P> <P> If a gravel pit in Irwindale deserves the due process of state environmental  laws, certainly the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, a national historic  landmark, is worthy of no less!  </P> <P> WILLIAM F. DELVAC  </P> <P> Member, Board of Directors  </P> <P> Los Angeles Conservancy  </P></p>

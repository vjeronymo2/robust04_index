			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN B LIST HAS SOME BIG NAMES  </P> <P> Keena Turner, Mike Wilson and Eric Wright, who played on all four San Francisco  49er Super Bowl championship teams, were left available to other teams as free  agents in the NFL's Plan B marketplace Friday.  </P> <P> The 49ers also failed to protect tight end Brent Jones, who caught a touchdown  pass in the 55-10 Super Bowl rout of Denver, and punter Barry Helton. The AFC  champion Denver Broncos left three regulars off their protected list:  linebacker Rick Dennison, tight end Clarence Kay and punter Mike Horan.  </P> <P> The list of 490 players released by the NFL includes several well-known names.  They included several prominent quarterbacks: Doug Williams of Washington, the  1988 Super Bowl most valuable player who has been bothered by injuries the past  two seasons; Tommy Kramer of Minnesota; Ron Jaworski of Kansas City and  ex-Heisman Trophy winner Doug Flutie of New England.  </P> <P> The players may sign with any other team until April 1 with no compensation due  their old teams. In addition, 274 other players had contracts that expired at  midnight Thursday and are free agents subject to first refusal by their former  clubs. Those players included Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski and Minnesota  wide receiver Anthony Carter.  </P> <P> If Turner, Wilson and Wright sign with other teams, it would leave quarterback  Joe Montana and safety Ronnie Lott as the last 49ers to have played on all the  championship teams. Turner is a linebacker, Wilson a wide receiver and Wright a  two-time Pro Bowl defensive back who lost his starting job last season.  </P> <P> Altogether, the 49ers put 20 players on their Plan B list, including nose  tackle Jim Burt, linebacker and special teams player Steve Hendrickson,  defensive end Pete Kugler, running back Harry Sydney, guard Terry Tausch and  running back Spencer Tillman.  </P> <P> Denver's list included running back-wide receiver Ken Bell, guard Keith Bishop,  linebacker Scott Curtis, defensive back Mike Haynes, linebacker Bruce  Klostermann, linebacker Tim Lucas, center Mike Ruether and running back Sammy  Winder.  </P> <P> The Dallas Cowboys left unprotected defensive end Ed (Too Tall) Jones, a  14-year veteran who started his 200th consecutive game this season. The Giants  left off running backs Joe Morris, out all last year with a broken foot, and  his replacement, Ottis Anderson.  </P></p>

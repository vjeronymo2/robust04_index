			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Cut base rates to 5% before Budget I cannot re-member which, if any, poet said: 'It is always darkest before the dawn.' As it can always get darker still, this saying, like so many others, is of no use in informing the sleepless watcher of the night how long it is before sunrise. The latest economic indicators show that it is still getting darker. It is not the headline rise in UK unemployment to 60,000 in December that is so alarming, but the fact that it is rising by more than 40,000 a month on a three-monthly and six-monthly average - much worse than in the middle of 1992. It is no use dismissing unemployment as a lagging indicator when more coincident signals, such as manufacturing output, dropped by  1/2 per cent in the quarter to November, or an annualised fall of 2 per cent. The vacancy figures have, it is true, risen slightly; but anyone who watched this indicator through the 1980s will be careful of relying on it. The Chambers of Commerce Survey shows more optimism, but that is in comparison with a nadir of pessimism reached last autumn at the time of Black Wednesday. There has been a deterioration since the recent Treasury monthly report, and it now looks more likely that non-oil GDP fell further at the end of last year rather than bottoming out as Whitehall had hoped. Even the 1 to 1 1/2 per cent growth rate predicted by the Treasury for 1993 would not have been enough to stop the rise in unemployment. For this to happen, output would have to rise in line with productive capacity. In the more optimistic late 1980s the Treasury thought the underlying growth rate of non-oil GDP was 2 3/4 per cent per annum. The fashionable estimate has now been trimmed back to 2 per cent - quite a large change when cumulated over several years. This downward revision may however be wrong, and not allow enough for the second round of workforce trimming now hitting the economy. Indeed, output may have to grow for some time by at least 3 per cent per annum before there is a real reversal of the unemployment trend. There is a danger of getting the worst of all worlds in government economic policy. Unlike the governor-designate of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, who has joined the Europhobic clan by calling last September 16 - the day when official efforts failed to save ERM membership - White Wednesday, I still support the European Exchange Rate Mechanism run in the right way. But so long as the UK is outside, it might as well enjoy its freedom of action to cut interest rates whenever necessary. To come to the point, I do not see what is to be gained either by continuing with slow and small interest rate cuts, or waiting until the Budget. The economic position justifies a reduction to 5 per cent very soon. Whether this is done in successive small stages, or in one fell swoop, I leave to the supposed experts in financial market psychology. The important thing is that it is done quickly. The prime minister, perhaps because he had only the chance to introduce one Budget in a great rush while he was chancellor, overestimates the contribution that budgetary packages can make. And there is no point in delaying until then. Is this a U-turn on my part? Tactical yes, strategic no. The same outlook should lead to different policies in different circumstances. I still think that the ultimate effect of monetary policy is on inflation, and that unemployment needs to be tackled by structural policies. Nevertheless, the wrong macro-economic policy can aggravate fluctuations; and a hysterical depression atmosphere leads to make-work policies, such as keeping open uneconomic coalmines, rather than genuine structural reform, which must tackle wage flexibility at the micro-level. My main inhibition about interest rate cuts has been the effect on sterling, and thus on prices. But the exchange rate swings which entrench inflation are the long ones, such as the fall in sterling against the D-Mark from DM11 in the 1970s to about DM2 1/2 today. The Bank of England worries too much about the speed of exchange rate movements over a few weeks or months, and not enough about the trend over longer periods. I can still remember how, after making it widely known how much it disagreed with the government over the high rate of sterling in 1980, the Bank of England panicked when the pound did begin to fall in 1981-83, and insisted several times on braking action. Indeed, the policy of waiting to make small cuts is self-defeating even in tactical terms, because sterling has already weakened in anticipation of base rate cuts to come. On the other hand, if base rates looked as if they had reached bottom or nearly so, the markets would begin to anticipate the next move being upward, as they have over the US dollar. Finally, so long as the economy is so weak, the government will be inhibited from cutting spending or raising taxes enough to correct the serious underlying Budget deficit - and rightly so. The sooner the economy shows signs of a convincing recovery, the sooner that corrective budgetary action can be taken, although even that is not likely to be before the second Budget in December.</p>

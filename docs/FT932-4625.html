			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone bought News that US investors have continued to increase their holdings in Vodafone, the cellular phones group, coincided with the shares extending last week's strong showing and moving up to their highest level since mid-1989. Only last week the company announced that US holdings of Vodafone stock had risen to 186.5m shares, or 18.5 per cent of the group's issued capital. Yesterday Vodafone said US investors now spoke for 19.13 per cent, or 192.3m shares, in the company. Vodafone is scheduled to report preliminary figures this morning, with the more optimistic analysts looking for profits in the region of Pounds 325m and a dividend total of around 7p. There are also strong hopes in the market that Vodafone will deliver an upbeat message on current prospects, including good news of 'usage' or call rates in its cellular phone business. Vodafone shares touched 471p at one point yesterday, prior to ending the day a net 11 higher at 465 1/2 p. Turnover was a heavy 7.5m shares. The profits warning issued by Jeyes Group saw the shares plunge to 315p before closing a massive 122 off at 317p. Drug shares continued to underperform the rest of the UK market, and were again restrained by a sluggish opening performance by Wall Street. Glaxo managed a minor rise at 591p, but SmithKline Beecham 'A' ended 4 1/2 lower at 449p. Wellcome, unsettled by the Aids conference being held this week in Berlin, and worries about the Retrovir patent trial scheduled to get under way in the US on June 28, dipped 7 more to 753p, extending its recent run of poor performances. Zeneca eased 3 1/2 to 617 1/2 p and the new nil-paid 4 1/2 to 19 1/2 p. ICI, on the other hand, just failed to pierce the 700p level, closing another 8 to the good at 697p. Two big block trades in British Gas, each of 3.9m shares and both transacted at 289p, catapulted Gas to second place in the list of London's most heavily traded stocks. Gas settled a shade harder at 289p after 10m shares transacted. Lasmo extended its recent bout of strength, moving up to 162p before closing a net 4 higher at 161p after turnover of 2.7m. Dealers reported further sizeable support for the shares from US sources, ahead of the current round of presentations to US institutions and the forthcoming full ADR listing. Lasmo escaped being dropped from the prestigious FT-SE 100 Index last week when the newly demerged Zeneca entered the index, and may well escape the drop into the FT-SE Mid 250 Index when the FT-SE steering committee meets to consider its quarterly review of constituents tomorrow. Shell Transport, due to deliver a presentation to institutions in London next Monday after a series of meetings with international institutions, outpaced British Petroleum, closing 7 stronger at 610p. Strauss Turnbull, the stockbroker, was an aggressive buyer of the shares and told its clients that the stock was 'massively undervalued'. Talk that business services group BET would announce a cut in the dividend when it reports figures next week led to heavy dealing in the stock. Volume rose to 5.7m as the shares gave up 4 to 111p. Speculation that British Aerospace was likely to win an order for 200 Hawk aircraft with a total value of up to Pounds 4bn brought a strong advance to make it one of the day's best performing stocks. The shares pushed through the 380p barrier, the price of the 1991 rights issue, for the first time since 1991 to end 17 ahead at 387p in trade of 3.7m. Further orders, particularly for the Tornado, are also said to be in the pipeline. A badly executed sell order caused a slide in Simon Engineering. The shares closed 9 lower at 37p. Engineering group James Wilkes was once again the subject of bid speculation, with stakeholder Suter named as the likely predator. The former closed 8 up at 88p, while the latter was unchanged at 151p. The sentiment in BAe boosted several other stocks in the aerospace sector thought to be potential beneficiaries of orders for BAe. These included Rolls-Royce, 3 firmer at 143p, and Smiths Industries, 4 up at 345p. Hartstone Group, the hosiery manufacturer hit last month by a profits warning, staged a minor rally, closing 5 1/2 up at 45p. The stores sector was buoyed by better than expected consumer credit figures for April. Trading volume increased steadily during the day. A more cautious analyst said many stores were largely rallying from disappointing performances over recent days and a particularly poor trading day on Friday. Kingfisher closed 8 up at 594p and Boots rose 5 to 440p. Marks and Spencer were 4 firmer at 341p. Property shares continued to ride the wave of market confidence triggered by Mr George Soros's move into the sector. British Land added a further 8 at 332p xd. Jacques Vert, designer, maker and retailer of women's fashions, outperformed a generally subdued textile sector. The shares moved forward 9 to 85p. Courtaulds Textiles advanced 6 to 371p in thin trading.</p>

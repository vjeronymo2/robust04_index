			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: A more effective way to fight the retail war - A restructured Sears has seen its profits grow. Neil Buckley reports on its recovery The hobby of Mr Liam Strong, the Irishman who is chief executive of the Sears retail group, is said to be military history. It is an interest that has come in useful in his two years at the UK's largest multiple specialty retailer. With close to 3,000 stores, Sears, when Mr Strong arrived, was a huge army marching forward without direction or strategy. But with the imposition of a bit of military discipline it is being turned into a more effective retail fighting machine. Like fellow clothing groups Storehouse, Next and Burton, Sears had become bloated and unmanageable in the late 1980s. Like Next and Storehouse it appears to have found the way forward. In two years, profits have increased from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 138m, while sales increased only slightly, from Pounds 1.98bn to Pounds 2.01bn. While the results in the last two years have been obscured by a mass of exceptional items, yesterday's figures showed a clear improvement and analysts upgraded their forecasts from the Pounds 145m level to Pounds 150m for the present year. Operating margins increased from 5.2 per cent to 6.2 per cent, prompting Mr Strong to claims Sears was 'no longer a recovery story but a growth story'. The reshaping and rationalisation of the group, and especially of its shoe retailing business, British Shoe Corporation, is largely completed. Now the task is to keep on improving operational efficiency, updating the formats, improving sourcing and ranging to pull more customers into the stores and cut the level of mark-downs. If its gets this right, Sears believes net margins can improve to 7 or 8 per cent and beyond. At BSC, where Mr Strong implemented a plan to close 350 stores and shed 1,800 staff, hopes are pinned on three new formats into which the majority of the group, apart from the existing Dolcis chain, will be converted. They include Shoe Express, a self-service, mass-market format; Hush Puppy, a more upmarket store, and Shoe City, an out-of-town shoe super-store. Sears has also launched an out-of-town superstore, Olympus Sportsworld, in its leisure wear division. Nine have already been built, with a target of 50. At Olympus's high street chain, work is already under way on increasing the percentage of own-label products to improve the margin. In the women's wear business, Mr Strong sees the task as introducing new formats and improving ranges to differentiate the Wallis, Warehouse and Miss Selfridge chains from their competitors on the high street. He says some success has already been had at Richards, where introducing petite and large-size ranges, and a shoe offer, has led to a significant increase in sales. Analysts believe more tricky areas to get right might be Adams, the children's wear business which is competing against a resurgent Mothercare and saw a fall in like-for-like sales last year, and Freemans, the mail order business that is number three in the UK market but where sales have been static for some years. Mr Strong counters that a new format at Adams will propel it forward, and says improvements in efficiency at Freemans led to an improvement in net margins and a 20 per cent increase in underlying profits last year. Sears spent Pounds 78m last year on implementing its programme, and plans to spend Pounds 85m to Pounds 90m this year on converting 190 shoe stores to the Shoe Express and Hush Puppy format, building five to 10 Sportsworlds, and introducing new distribution systems at Freemans. The threats to Mr Strong's carefully-laid plans come from several directions. One is that the recent tightening of restrictions on out-of-town retailing announced by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, may curtail the opening programmes of Shoe City and Sportsworld. Potentially a more serious problem may be the arrival of other low-priced, superstore formats. In sportswear, the powerful US chains Sports Authority and Sports Unlimited are said to be eyeing the UK market greedily, while in clothing TJ Maxx, the US discount retailer, is already here. There is home-grown competition in the shape of Matalan, the Preston-based private company which has quietly built up a thriving chain of 35 stores offering a wide range of mass-market clothing at very low prices. Mr Strong plays down the threat, believing Sears will have built up a significant position in out-of-town sports retailing before the competition arrives, and insisting his clothing chains will be focusing on offering the best possible value. For would-be military commander Mr Strong, the Sears retailing army has made some important territorial advances, but the war is not yet won.</p>

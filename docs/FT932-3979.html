			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Technology: Green hue on screen - Moves to recycle PCs and make them energy efficient Users of personal computers in the US may soon be able to recycle their old machines and buy new systems that use less energy. It is all part of a growing trend in PC markets to make computers more 'green' by reducing their energy consumption and finding ways of recycling them. With PC product cycles running at less than six months, there is a growing problem over what to do with large numbers of obsolescent computers. A recent study by the Carnegie-Mellon university estimates that more than 150m PCs will be dumped in US landfills by the year 2005, with disposal costs reaching Dollars 1bn (Pounds 662m). In the UK, the Industry Council for Electronic and Electrical Equipment predicts that more than 800,000 PCs will be thrown away by 1995. The American Plastics Council, which represents 23 leading plastics manufacturers, has launched a pilot project to investigate the recovery and recycling of plastic materials from computer and business equipment. Old PCs are being collected from Apple Computer, IBM, DEC, Hewlett-Packard and Xerox. Terry Mohoruk, chairman of the APC's Computer and Business Equipment Group and manager of vinyl recycling at Geon plastics, will supervise the project which will initially search for the best way to shred and hammer computer enclosures into pieces. 'Our goal is to avoid costly and inefficient manual disassembly of components,' he says. The recovered plastic will be used either in making new computers or as fill in other products. The APC is also preparing a design guide to help PC producers create products that can be more easily recycled. It is also working on a single standard for a plastic made mostly of recycled plastic. IBM already has plans to introduce PC models this summer that will contain plastics containing a blend of recycled and virgin resins. PC designers are also trying to extend the useful life of computers by adopting modular designs. These allow users to upgrade their systems to faster microprocessors or larger hard drives by simply removing one component and retaining the rest of the system. For example, Intel, the chip manufacturer, is working with PC manufacturers to provide special 'overdrive' sockets that will allow buyers of the company's Pentium-based systems to upgrade their systems by simply inserting a newer, faster microprocessor. As part of this trend, PC manufacturers are working to produce systems that use much less power. When idle, these desktop PCs will automatically shut down almost all functions but can be instantly awakened from the 'sleep' mode. President Bill Clinton's recent executive order, that the US government should buy energy-efficient computers complying with the Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star Program, will help increase demand for what are becoming known as 'green PCs'. The US government is the world's largest buyer of computer equipment and use of energy-efficient PCs could save it more than Dollars 40m a year in electricity costs. The EPA estimates that if PC users in the US adopt low-consumption systems, by 2000 they will save Dollars 2bn a year in electricity costs and prevent pollution equivalent to that produced by 5m cars. With the US government driving this nascent market, large US corporations say they may adopt a similar purchasing policy. San Francisco-based BankAmerica Systems Engineering division has more than 25,000 PCs. It says it would be interested in buying such systems if they met its specifications. Dataquest, the market research company, is soon to finish a study of green PC markets and predicts that by 1997 almost all PCs will conform to the EPA's Energy Star specifications. These permit a maximum of 30W energy consumption in 'sleep' mode for the main system, and 30W for the monitor. Most desktop PCs now use about 200W, with monitors consuming about half that. Robert Corpuz, PC industry analyst at Dataquest, says: 'We've had microprocessor wars with manufacturers claiming ever faster systems. Now we'll probably have wattage wars with Dell and Compaq fighting over (who has) the lowest power consumption. 'We see a huge market potential for companies that will produce products that can convert current PC systems to the EPA specifications - especially in the corporate market where energy savings of more than Dollars 100 per PC per year add up to huge savings. A key factor in the success of 'green' PCs will be to keep prices the same and make sure there is no reduction in performance.' So far, US manufacturers of PCs say that buyers of green PCs will not be asked to pay extra money. Acer America claims to be the first on the market with its AcerPAC 250 PC which uses only 10W in rest mode. Similar systems will be available later this year from IBM, Apple and other PC makers. Apple has set up the Sustainable Technologies Group as part of its research and development division. Apple says it is studying ways of lessening the environmental impact of computers and developing new kinds of energy-efficient technologies which could eventually give it an edge in the highly competitive PC market. Most of the technologies that will be used in building energy-efficient PCs already exist. They were developed for portable computers where the limitations of batteries have made energy conservation vital. All portables have a 'sleep' mode that conserves battery power by partially shutting the system after a few minutes of idle time. Some slow the main processor between keystrokes for fractions of a second. Another technology is the production of 3.3 volt semiconductors and built-in power management features such as those that will be found in almost all Intel microprocessors. Dataquest says the green PC trend will spread. Offices will have 'green' fax machines, copiers and laser printers. Most laser printer manufacturers already offer recycling programmes for printer cartridges. As PCs continue to replace mainframes, the recycling of old mainframes becomes a problem. Amdahl, a manufacturer of IBM plug-compatible mainframes, says its old mainframes generally get resold on the used computer market. Within the US government, agencies hand them on to other agencies. Some have even ended up in China. But old mainframes do have some salvage value. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory recently sold an old Cray 1 computer to two speculators. The supercomputer was valued at Dollars 19m when purchased in 1976, but Tony Cole and Saber Shehadeh paid a 'binary' Dollars 10,101.01 at a government auction. They hope someone might buy the old colossus for historic reasons. 'If we can't sell it we'll scrap it,' says Shehadeh. 'There's at least Dollars 20,000 of gold in it plus a lot of copper.'</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATHOLIC BISHOPS PROHIBIT MASS FOR GAY, LESBIAN ORGANIZATION  </P> <P> The decision made by Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony and the 12 other  bishops from Southern and Central California prohibiting priests from  celebrating Mass for the gay Catholic Dignity organization is just another  abomination of the church's attitude towards those who the church doesn't want  in its service ("Catholic Bishops Prohibit Masses for Gay, Lesbian Group," Part  I, June 23).  </P> <P> As a fallen Catholic I have looked towards the church for years to reinstate  itself with me, and yet it continually abandons those who need and want it the  most. Mahony and his bishops have now fallen into that category of the  far-right fundamentalists who cannot abide the behavior of others who do not  act like them. In view of this recent decision, it seems the church still  groups "whores, murderers and homosexuals" together.  </P> <P> With Christ's basic teachings of "Do unto others as you would have them do unto  you" and those of compassion and forgiveness, the church has blasphemed his  teachings with this backward decision.  </P> <P> Personal saving grace is attained by knowing that God is in each one of us, and  being comfortable with that knowledge and working with it for the betterment of  all. Remember, "My house has many rooms." Unfortunately, the Catholic Church  seems to have gotten elitist in its tenants, and one more time, there is no  room at the inn.  </P> <P> KEN DICKMANN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

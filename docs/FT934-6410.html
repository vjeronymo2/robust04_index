			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Durham coalfield's last pit to close British Coal yesterday proposed the closure of Wearmouth Colliery in Sunderland, the last pit in the Durham coalfield, because of the lack of a market for its power station coal, Chris Tighe writes. Wearmouth is one of seven pits British Coal has named for closure before Christmas. Mr Davy Guy, north-east president of the National Union of Mineworkers, said Wearmouth had more than 100m tonnes of reserves. He said British Coal wanted to shut it by December 10. It seems unlikely that miners will oppose the closure. The 720 workers at the Frickley pit near Pontefract, West Yorkshire, yesterday voted on plans to close the pit tomorrow. The result will be announced today.</p>

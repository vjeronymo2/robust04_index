			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: THE BROAD BENEFITS OF AIDS RESEARCH  </P> <P> The question may be curious or hostile, but it's increasingly being asked: Are  we spending too much money on AIDS research relative to other diseases?  </P> <P> On the surface, this question seems reasonable. In reality, it's useless. That  this question is part of the AIDS debate and the inspiration for an emerging  AIDS funding backlash is potentially tragic.  </P> <P> The responsibility -- the fault -- for this rests squarely with the biomedical  research community and AIDS activist groups. They have done a truly lousy job  of articulating the extraordinarily broad range of medical breakthroughs and  benefits that AIDS research can yield. Instead, they have consistently opted to  position AIDS in the policy arena purely as a "special interest" disease  requiring extraordinary measures and an equally extraordinary budget.  </P> <P> No one can rationally argue that combating AIDS doesn't require extraordinary  efforts. But as AIDS-related research consumes a rising portion of the federal  biomedical budget, it's increasingly clear that we need to aggressively explore  the impact of this research beyond AIDS. Although AIDS and its HIV virus is an  infuriatingly elusive and deadly disease, it is not something wholly separate  and distinct from other diseases.  </P> <P> The biomedical research establishment must start viewing AIDS research as more  of a gateway into the nature of viruses, the immune system and molecular  biology. AIDS activists must start building up coalitions with other segments  of the disease research community -- and not just building up budgets.  </P> <P> "The constituents and advocates in HIV research are just now starting to  realize the more global aspects of HIV research," says Dr. Anthony Fauci, who  runs the nation's war on AIDS as director of the National Institute for Allergy  and Infectious Diseases. "We've reached the point that we're not going to be  able to say, 'We need more for AIDS' and get more; we have to be able to show  other benefits."  </P> <P> Although Fauci has personally pointed to spinoff benefits of HIV research, he  acknowledges that the research community has been so consumed in AIDS research  itself that there have been few formal efforts to transfer AIDS-gleaned  insights to other fields. An Office of Technology Assessment survey published  earlier this year confirmed the obvious: Researchers believed that there would  be significant spinoffs from AIDS research. Unfortunately, there's consistently  been a "take it for granted" and "by the way" quality to the discussion of  spinoffs.  </P> <P> "AIDS is such a lightning rod," says Fauci. "Spinoffs get lost in the commotion  and smoke of all the controversy."  </P> <P> But it is Fauci's responsibility -- and the responsibility of the AIDS activist  community -- to see that they do not. It is in no one's interest to narrowly  define the impact of AIDS research.  </P> <P> The Nixon Administration's War on Cancer failed to generate a "cure" for  cancer; instead, it spawned the knowledge infrastructure of molecular biology  that made biotechnology possible and put us in the position to begin to deal  with diseases such as AIDS.  </P> <P> The fact is that diseases are not all tucked away in neat, discrete  compartments. Fundamental structures and interactions make medical research  more interdisciplinary today than at any other time in history. Precisely  because we are investing so much into AIDS research, we must take every step  possible to make sure that the results have as far-reaching an impact as  possible.  </P> <P> "Virus research in general has become completely dominated by HIV," says David  Baltimore, the Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist who is president of  Rockefeller University. The research "has given us a much more precise  understanding of viral interactions with cells. . . . The one area where it may  drive technology is in drug design and vaccine design."  </P> <P> What's more, Baltimore says, the research is "almost certain to tell us that  there are types of genetic controls in normal cells that we have never  imagined."  </P> <P> "We still have a lot of spadework to do in basic research," Fauci says. "We  have to understand a lot more: the expression of the viral gene and the  interaction with the cellular gene function."  </P> <P> That kind of basic research has the broadest possible implications. It's like  learning how to read: Once you can read a short story, learning to read poetry  or novels is less of a challenge. Fundamental insights into the HIV virus and  the immune system should be directly transferable to insights into other  diseases. Fauci argues that AIDS research can't help but offer insights into  degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis and auto-immune diseases like  lupus. The opportunistic infections that attack people with AIDS also attack  people who aren't infected with the HIV virus.  </P> <P> The point is simple: AIDS has become the engine for critical biomedical  research in this country. The issue isn't, "Are we spending too much on AIDS  research?" We could ask that of any budget for any serious disease, be it lung  cancer or Alzheimer's. It is, "Are we getting the maximum return for the  maximum number of people?"  </P> <P> As Dr. Leroy Hood, the Bowles Professor of Biology at Caltech and director of  the National Science Foundation's Science and Technology Center in  Biotechnology, says: "If we're going to spend this much money on AIDS research,  the mission should be a very broad one." Hood and other researchers want to see  AIDS money set aside for developing new technologies to enhance viral  diagnostics and intervention.  </P> <P> None of this should reduce the primary focus on AIDS. On the contrary, a flow  of spinoffs should consolidate this society's willingness to commit resources.  Fortunately, even the most radical segments of the AIDS activist community are  beginning to understand that it can acquire more resources to fight AIDS less  by stressing the uniqueness of the disease than the insights it offers for all.  </P> <P> "The real bottom line is that we're going to have to make common cause with  those other (disease lobbying) groups to enhance all of the biomedical budget,"  asserts Mark Harrington, a member of the treatment and data committee of the  AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT-UP).  </P> <P> "The need to institutionalize the AIDS research process and transfer it to  other efforts is clear," says Jean McGuire, who runs the AIDS Action Council in  Washington. "It is a necessary part of building support."  </P> <P> People who challenge the level of AIDS research funding should appreciate that  an investment in AIDS research isn't an investment in a special interest group  but an investment in the public health.  </P> <P> It's time for the National Institutes of Health, Congress, the Administration  and AIDS activists to aggressively encourage a wide array of research spinoffs  to reinforce that.  </P></p>

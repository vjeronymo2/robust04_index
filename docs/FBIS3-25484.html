Addressing  tens of thousands of supporters at a rally at Taylor's Halt,  about 20km from the Natal capital of Pietermaritzburg, Mr  Buthelezi came out strongly in support of peace. saying his  party did not want war.    Mr Buthelezi also accused the government and the African  National Congress [ANC] of trying to intimidate the IFP into  fighting elections. He said his party was continuing talks with  the ANC and government, but accused the two of an "appalling  style" of negotiating.    He said he favoured continued negotiations: "Even at this  late hour we have avoided belligerence and we believe in  continuing to negotiate." The IFP president said it was only  through "true negotiations" that peace would be achieved in  South Africa.    "We know that war serves only to divide the people of South  Africa. It serves only to split communities and break up  families.    "We know that in the end it will pit orother against  brother,  sister against sister, mother against daughter, father against  son. We in the IFP therefore do not want war.    "No one wants peace more than the IFP."    The IFP would not be intimidated by the ANC, he said, adding  "while we know that we will defeat the plans of the ANC  alliance, we also know that victory will come at a great cost to  all."    "That is why we want to negotiate. That is why we want  peace."    He said a spokesman in the ANC alliance had warned that army  tanks would roll against the people of kwaZulu. The inhabitants  of the homeland would be much worse off under an ANC government  than the present government, he said. The IFP's decision not to  participate in elections unless its demands were met was a  "grave one". Many would be forced into voting.    If the ANC won the elections it would try and destroy the  IFP  and kwaZulu, he said. "We must know this and brace ourselves to  this onslaught if it happens.    "It is far more noble to resist evil and die for what you  believe in, than to live in chains."    Mr Buthelezi said he was against war, but Zulus were a  "proud  and warrior" nation which could resist the ANC. Opinion polls  showing minimal support for the IFP were "lies", he said.    He urged followers not to fail in their support for Zulu  King  Goodwill Zwelithini, saying participation in the elections under  the current constitution would be going against the monarch. A  failure of support for the king on this score would divide the  Zulu nation, he said. The interim constitution was flawed  because, among other things, it did not acknowledge the  sovereignty of the monarch.    While he reiterated his strong opposition to elections under  the present interim constutution, the IFP president's speech was  not free of electioneering talk: "We are the party of  prosperity. You can lay your trust in us."    Mr Buthelezi promised supporters that if the IFP continued  to  rule kwaZulu, jobs would be created and they would be better  provided for.    The ANC, he charged, didn't have a "snowballs chance in  hell"  of delivering on its "wild" election promises. "We will have to  work extremely hard. We must continue to embrace the twin  pillars of our philosophy in the IFP, which is self-help and  self-reliance.    "We do not want to deceive our youth by promising things  that  we will not be able to deliver instantly if we become the  government," he said.    "The IFP is the only party that can bring prosperity to the  people of South Africa."</p>

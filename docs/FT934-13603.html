			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Dealers warn over distorting effect of 'phantom' motor sales NEW CLASHES erupted on the eve of the London Motor Show yesterday between carmakers and representatives of the UK's 6,000 franchised dealers. Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, claimed that 'phantom' sales reported by some leading carmakers were increasingly sending false signals to the government about the strength of the recovery in the new-car market and risked bringing increased tax burdens in next month's Budget. Mr Pulham also called for legislation to ban deeply discounted sales deals negotiated directly between manufacturers and large fleet customers, claiming new car list prices could be cut by 5 per cent if such deals were out-lawed. There was evidence that a 'significant number' of fleets were being awarded discounts of between 40 per cent and 45 per cent, far in excess of discounts available to the manufacturers' own dealers, he said. He added that the practice meant not only higher prices and but also sharply increased depreciation for privately purchased cars.</p>

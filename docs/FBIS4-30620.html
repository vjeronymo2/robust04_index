			<p>BFN     [Text] Semarang, C. [Central] Java -- The Consultative  Group on Indonesia (CGI) is expected to provide loans worth 5.1  billion U.S. dollars to Indonesia this year, Finance Minister  Mar'ie Muhammad said.    The CGI would still discuss the exact amount of loans at its  meeting to be held in Paris on July 7 and 8, he told reporters  after addressing a seminar on the Indonesian Tax System for the  Second Long-Term Development Drive here on Saturday.    But he said the amount of loans would not be so much  different from that of the previous year due to the appreciation  of Japanese yen against U.S. dollar.    The minister said CGl's loans to Indonesia were directed  towards financing the construction of physical facilities and  infrastructures, the promotion of women's role, and the  implementation of a presidential instruction-based backward  village promotion program.    The construction of public utilities would top the list of  priority in the utilization of the loans, he said adding  projects which had not been completed in the fifth Five-Year  Development Plan (Repelita V, 1989/1994) would be completed in  the Sixth Repelita.    He made it clear that some CGI-funded projects would be  exempted from income tax in accordance with a joint agreement  signed by Indonesia and CGI member countries.    Coordinating Minister for Economy and Finance/Development  Supervision Saleh Afiff will lead the Indonesian delegation to  the Paris meeting.    The finance minister himself will not attend the meeting  because he will visit several world important cities on those  days.</p>

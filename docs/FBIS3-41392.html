According to the statistics presented by  Interior Minister Frieder Birzele (Social Democratic Party of  Germany), 244 people died of drug consumption--35 fewer than in  1992. Birzele cited the declining purity of heroin as the  possible reason because it may have prevented overdosage.  [passage omitted]    However, the number of registered drug-related crimes rose  by  over 20 percent to 20,000 offenses. The main reason is more  intensive police investigations, Birzele pointed out.

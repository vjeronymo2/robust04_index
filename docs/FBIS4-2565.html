			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Janos Latorcai, Hungarian minister for industry  and trade, who is on a visit to China, has met Hungarian  journalists in Beijing including Sandor Svabi, correspondent of  the Chronicle.    [Svabi] [passage omitted] According to Janos Latorcai,  Hungarian industry still has serious opportunities in China, but  the help of the Hungarian Government is necessary for its  success. [passage omitted]    Latorcai denied allegations that the Hungarian National Bank  had sold to German firms the Chinese state's debts to Hungary.  He said that this year, Beijing would like to settle the  Chinese trade deficit of 108 million Swiss francs. It has been  mentioned that China would repay the debt through Chinese goods.    By the way, the minister described his negotiations in China  as definitely successful. Several preliminary agreements have  been concluded. Discussions are being held about the creation  of a plant that would assemble Hungarian buses in China and  about participation by Hungarian firms in the construction of  the giant hydropower station on the Chang Jiang River.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / IRA ceasefire clarification unlikely in medium term Republican sources indicated yesterday that the IRA had no intention in the medium term of being more specific about the meaning of its ceasefire for tactical and political reasons. Last week's IRA statement declaring a total cessation of military operations was the product of intense debate within the republican movement, worded to draw in hardline activists opposed to a ceasefire. It is feared that being more specific would risk creating fresh divisions within the IRA. The sources said the IRA was tactically and politically committed to ensuring that the ceasefire holds to pave the way for further political concessions from the British government. Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's governing executive, said in an interview in yesterday's Derry Journal that 'there was no doubt that the ceasefire has moved the debate surrounding demilitarisation along significantly'. He added: 'The British government should reciprocate accordingly.' Meanwhile Downing Street yesterday confirmed that Mr John Major had held a 45-minute meeting with Admiral William Crowe, the US Ambassador to Britain. The meeting came amid speculation of a visa being granted to Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, to revisit the US. Downing Street said a 'general discussion about Ireland' had taken place, adding that it was not aware that Mr Adams had applied again for a US visa, 'but we made our position clear before'. The last time Mr Adams visited the US, Britain indicated it did not want a visa to be granted. Separately, republican strongholds appeared to be stepping up their campaign to force security concessions from the government. Sinn Fein supporters yesterday picketed the main police barracks in Londonderry and organised the latest of a series of demonstrations to remove security barriers from secondary roads near the Irish border. The protest outside the police station was in response to a series of raids by the Royal Ulster Constabulary on republican homes in the Bogside area on Monday night. As a result of the raids, one man was arrested under the Prevention of Terrorist Act. The RUC said the arrest was in connection with an investigation into past terrorist incidents, although there was regret among some security sources that the raids had fuelled republican propaganda against alleged police harassment.</p>

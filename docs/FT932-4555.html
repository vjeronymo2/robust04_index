			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Moslem onslaught pushes back Croats HOSTILITIES between Bosnian Croats and Moslems reached a new peak yesterday following the fall of the city of Travnik to the Moslems and the reported destruction of some 20 surrounding villages with heavy loss of life, Agencies report. Fighting moved south towards Vitez, held by Bosnian Croat troops, as the Moslems sought to link their strongholds of Tuzla and Zenica to the north with Jablanica and Konjic, two towns they control about 30 miles south of Travnik. Croatian radio in Zagreb said more than 250 civilians and soldiers died in the Travnik region yesterday and 15,000 people had fled. A confidential United Nations report, made available to Associated Press, spoke of 'heavy civilian casualties', and 20 villages put to the torch. The battle for Travnik was over, UN sources said late yesterday. A strategic junction in central Bosnia, it was a city of 70,000 people before the war, about 45 per cent Moslem and 37 per cent Croat. The Croat exodus and an influx of Moslem refugees from other war zones in Bosnia means Moslems now outnumber Croats five to one. About 700 Croat soldiers expelled from Travnik by the Moslem assault have been interned in the notorious Manjaca prison camp by the Bosnian Serbs to whom they surrendered. The camp, near Banja Luka, headquarters of the Bosnian Serb armed forces and the main city of Serb-held north Bosnia, was previously a detention camp for Moslems. It was closed months ago following a furious outcry in the west after its squalid conditions were made public. The International Committee of the Red Cross said some 3,500 Croat civilian refugees from Travnik were yesterday huddled on Serb-held Mount Vlasic north of Moslem front lines The Bosnian Serbs' defence minister, Mr Dusan Kovacevic, said the Croat prisoners could be exchanged for Serbs held by Croatia or the self-styled Bosnian Croat republic, Herceg-Bosna, carved out of Croat-dominated territory in Bosnia's southwest. Civilian refugees could go wherever they wanted. British troops saw Moslem forces fire machine guns at fleeing Croat civilians yesterday, according to UN military sources. Two British UN soldiers witnessed the incident at Guca Gora, a village northeast of Travnik. Some 200 Croat civilians shepherded by peacekeepers into a church were still there last night awaiting evacuation. UN soldiers had ordered Moslem troops to lay down their weapons to avert a massacre. Meanwhile, in Sarajevo, Bosnia's unpopular military commander, Sefer Halilovic, was replaced yesterday in a shake-up of the republic's hard-pressed armed forces. The new commander is Rasim Delic, formerly head of the strategic planning department, it was announced on local radio. The Bosnian army will also form a sixth corps to be headquartered in the central town of Konjic, where the Moslems say they are coming under attack from both Croat and Serb forces.</p>

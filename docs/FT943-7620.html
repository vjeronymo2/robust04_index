			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Savoy denies Forte agreement Savoy Hotel yesterday firmly denied a newspaper report that a secret agreement had been reached with Forte, the rival hotel group, which has waged a 13-year struggle to acquire the Savoy group, whose hotels include the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught. The Savoy group said, 'there is no agreement between Savoy and Forte, no secret deals have been agreed, nothing has been agreed secretly or openly and if any agreement had been reached over any proposals they would be announced in the proper manner.' The company added that no proposals have been put to the board which is not due to meet again until next month. Late last month the Savoy board revealed to the Stock Exchange that it had become aware of discussions between Forte and some of the trusts which have a significant interest in the share capital of the Savoy. The trusts involved in the discussions are widely thought to be those of the Wontner family, represented by Mr John Sinclair, a Savoy director. If Forte, chaired by Mr Rocco Forte, son of the group's founder, can persuade Mr Sinclair to become its ally, it would gain effective control of Savoy. Forte acquired 68 per cent of Savoy's share capital, but only 42 per cent of its votes, following an acrimonious takeover battle in the 1980s. Support from Mr Sinclair would give Forte a clear majority of the votes. Under a 1989 peace agreement Forte agreed not increase its stake in Savoy for five years and agreed to give 12 months notice if it wanted to do so. This requirement remains even after the five-year period ends in November.</p>

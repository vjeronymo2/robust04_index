			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Cincinnati Milacron returns to black CINCINNATI Milacron, one of the world's biggest machine tool makers, returned to the black in the fourth quarter, despite declining sales, after three unprofitable quarters in 1991. Mr Daniel Mayer, chairman, predicted that 1992 would be profitable, thanks to lower costs, new products and a sizeable backlog, although he expected a slow first quarter. For the fourth quarter, ended December 28, the company had net income of Dollars 4m, or 15 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 31.1m, or Dollars 1.15 a year earlier. The 1990 figures were muddied by special charges which cost the company about Dollars 1.13 a share. Sales fell 6 per cent to Dollars 201.9m from Dollars 214.7m. For 1991, Cincinnati Milacron recorded a net loss of Dollars 100.2m, or Dollars 3.67 a share, including one-time charges of Dollars 90m, against a net loss of Dollars 24.3m, or 95 cents, in 1990. Sales in the year edged 6.4 per cent lower to Dollars 754m from Dollars 805.2m.</p>

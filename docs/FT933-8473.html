			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Adversaries square up over Bosnian maps ANY WESTERN hopes that international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg can broker a quick settlement to the bloodshed in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina are unlikely to be fulfilled, with the future of Sarajevo and the precise boundaries of future mini-states still strongly disputed. When Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic returns to the peace talks today, he will face Serb and Croat adversaries who are only willing to negotiate on the basis of their military gains during the 17-month war. However, Mr Izetbegovic, a Moslem, reiterated at the weekend that he would only endorse a settlement which gave his Bosnian republic about 40 per cent of the territory of the proposed 'union' of three ethnic republics. The new Bosnia, he said, would have to encompass land currently held by Serb forces, which until the outbreak of war was mostly Moslem. Amid seemingly irreconcilable differences, the parties will today sit down to discuss the maps. Talks on future borders were stalled for two weeks while Serb political and military leaders played cat and mouse with the international community over their pledge to hand over the strategic Mount Igman, captured during the talks. At the weekend Serb forces finally withdrew from Mount Igman, which overlooks Sarajevo, but Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, believes his military superiority will dictate the terms of a peace agreement. Mr Izetbegovic envisages that most of eastern Bosnia, which shares a frontier with Serbia and was Moslem before the war, will be part of the future Bosnian republic. Mr Karadzic says 'this is out of the question'. He claims almost all of eastern Bosnia, under Serb control except for three remaining Moslem pockets, proclaimed UN 'safe areas'. Serbs need the frontier territory in order to form a Greater Serbia. Mr Izetbegovic insists that his Bosnian republic must have access to the northern River Sava and to ports on the Adriatic Sea. Lord Owen has backed this demand. However, Mr John Zametica, Bosnian Serb spokesman, says it would be 'impossible for Moslem territory to have a physical outlet on the Sava and Adriatic'. Serb leaders also insist on Sarajevo's partition. Lord Owen seems to back the idea that the self-styled Serb state has a legitimate right to parts of the city. Mr Izetbegovic believes this would amount to the death of Bosnia. He will insist that Serb forces lift their 17-month siege around the capital when the talks get under way. 'Without fair maps, there is no deal,' Mr Izetbegovic says, stressing he had accepted ethnic partition when faced with the alternative of more war. But he lacks power to break the Serb stranglehold. The size and viability of his future state depends on the will of the international community to provide the muscle to back a settlement. Pledges from foreign powers face a crucial test. Mr Karadzic has repeatedly threatened that if Mr Izetbegovic rejects his offer of a land-locked republic comprising isolated pockets of territory, 'the Moslems will be left with nothing at all'. Bosnian Serb leaders privately boast they will make life so unpleasant in any union that the Moslems would soon seek its dissolution. The mediators must realise the survival of the Bosnian republic cannot depend solely on the goodwill of hostile Serb and Croat neighbours, but will need international enforcement.</p>

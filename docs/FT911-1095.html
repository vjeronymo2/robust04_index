			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Ulster talks fail to find venue for Dublin input PROGRESS on Northern Ireland's future ran aground yesterday when the province's political leaders again failed to agree on where talks involving the Irish government should take place. Unionist and nationalist leaders met Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, for more than six hours of bilateral meetings at the Stormont parliament buildings in Belfast. The planned 'round table' discussions have been delayed until later today at the earliest. Mr Brooke wanted 11 weeks of talks, but one week has already passed with no agreement on the venue for the second strand of talks, when the Dublin government joins in the discussions. The location is regarded as symbolic by all sides and the political leaders are anxious not to be seen by their respective grassroots supporters as giving way. The fact that there has been no agreement on compromise locations shows how deep divisions run. Mr Addie Morrow of the Alliance party delegation said: 'It has been a frustrating day.' The Irish government wants the talks to be held in Ireland, either in the Republic or Northern Ireland. Unionists insist that the talks should be held elsewhere, preferably London, because of the republic's constitutional claim on the north and perhaps because they fear protests from their supporters about the fact that negotiations with Dublin are taking place. Unionist leaders prefer London. Compromise locations in Europe - such as Strasbourg - would present travel difficulties. Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, said: 'Once you get to Strasbourg it is like house imprisonment. It is impossible to get out. There are no flights from Belfast and no flights from Dublin.' Mr Brooke and Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, thought the difficulty was small-scale when they met in London two weeks ago. The location of the third and final strand of the talks - to consider a replacement for the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement - has not been decided yet.</p>

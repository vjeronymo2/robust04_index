			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTFULLY SUITED  </P> <P> Regarding "Artfully Suited," by Mary Rourke (Aug. 27): My trusty calculator  tells me that it cost $19,436 to dress the nine women you chose to highlight  women's fall fashions: an average of $2,159.55 per outfit. There is not an  outfit in there that cannot be duplicated for less than $50 at the Salvation  Army. I guess those ladies will just have to keep the price tags on to truly  get their money's worth.  </P> <P> FREDERICK CLEVELAND, Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Safren lifts first-half net profit and payout IMPROVED cash management, a lower tax bill and a solid performance from hotel and leisure subsidiary Kersaf helped Safren, the South African diversified shipping, travel and leisure group, to lift net profit for the six months to December by 11 per cent. Turnover rose by 9.3 per cent to R2.3bn and operating profit by 6.4 per cent to R337.8m (Dollars 119m). A lower tax charge, however, boosted attributable earnings by 11.1 per cent to R133.3m. Earnings per share rose to 248.3 cents from 224.5 cents, and the dividend was lifted to 65 cents a share from 60 cents. Safren recorded a R63m extraordinary loss compared with a R30.3m profit a year earlier. This was the result of a R78.5m write-off on a 49 per cent stake in Compagnie Maritime Belge Transport (CMBT) taken by shipping arm Safmarine last year. Earnings after extraordinary items thus dropped to R70.3m from R150.3m. Mr Buddy Hawton, chief executive, said the group knew at the time of purchase that CMBT was making substantial losses which would take three to four years to correct. Staff cuts and the closure and disposal of unprofitable operations had given rise to 'material additional costs of a non-recurrent nature'. Mr Hawton said Safmarine had continued to experience reduced cargo volumes which were lower than at any time since the introduction of containerisation 15 years ago. Rennies, which is involved in travel, freight, cargo and marine services, and Kersaf, whose main investments are in hotels and casinos, had both performed satisfactorily. Mr Hawton expected satisfactory results for the year, given current economic conditions. But he was more bullish on the longer term outlook, Safren's shares are trading at R94, 110 per cent up on its price at the beginning of 1991.</p>

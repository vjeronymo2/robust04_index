			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 26 May, Zhou Wenhua, chairman of  the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC], met with the CIS veteran  soldiers visiting delegation led by (Babulin), chairman of the  Veteran Soldiers Committee of the CIS. Most of the delegation  members once visited China during war time during which they  fought side by side with the Chinese army and people and  established profound friendship with them.    On behalf of the provincial CPPCC Committee, Zhou Wenhua  extended deep respect to these veteran soldiers. He briefed the  guests on our province's situation as well as the economic  development situation since the starting of reform and opening  up, and answered their questions on trade union work, the  pension system, and placement for retired cadres.    Zhou Wenhua pointed out: Heilongjiang Province has the two  major advantages of being contiguous and complementary in  developing economic and trade cooperation with the CIS  countries. At present, the interregional economic relations  have developed from economic and trade relations in the past  into a new stage of economic and technological cooperation.  There are broad prospects for cooperation between both sides.    The 10-member CIS veteran soldiers delegation was invited by  the national CPPCC Committee and arrived in Harbin city by plane  yesterday evening. Accompanied by Dai Moan, vice chairman of  the provincial CPPCC Committee, the delegation members zealously  visited Harbin Flax Plant and (Tianhua) Garment Plant which was  jointly funded by Harbin and Russia, and laid a wreath at the  tombs of the Soviet Red Army soldiers.</p>

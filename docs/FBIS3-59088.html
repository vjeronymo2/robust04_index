			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lefkosa [Nicosia], Jan 25 (AA) -- President Rauf  Denktas of the Republic of Northern Cyprus called Greek-Cypriot  leader Glavkos Kliridhis for a meeting saying "improving a  mutual understanding could only be reached by meeting  face-to-face."    Denktas met United Nations envoy Joe Clark for a second time  in two days who came to Cyprus to hold talks on confidence  building measures.    Denktas, speaking to reporters before starting a working  lunch with Clark, urged Kliridhis to agree to meet him  face-to-face to improve mutual understanding.    "We have to come to a solution one way or another. Both  sides have to be satisfied, we are eager for that," he said.    Clark said he was not asking the two sides to declare  acceptance of U.N.-proposed confidence-building measures before  negotiations adding that "neither I nor the U.N. want to force  anything because there has to be agreement between the parties.  We have come a long way."    Clark said he will leave for Ankara and Athens on Wednesday  to hold contacts after meeting with Kliridhis.    The Mediterranean island has been divided into Turkish and  Greek Cypriot sectors since Turkey conducted a peace operation  to the north in 1974 following a short-lived coup by Greeks  wanting to annex Cyprus to Greece.    A U.N. peacekeeping force has been in Cyprus since  inter-communal fighting first broke out in 1964.    The U.N. has proposed a package of measures which include  reopening the deserted, Turkish-held resort of Maras [Varosha]  and Lefkosa International Airport under U.N. control to try to  rebuild bridges between the two sides.    Denktas said last week his government agreed to resume talks  on the confidence-building measures.</p>

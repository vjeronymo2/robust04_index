			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Fighting threatens talks on Bosnia CONTINUED fighting in Bosnia yesterday threatened to undermine the peace talks in Geneva despite the agreement between the three warring parties to hand over control of Sarajevo to the United Nations. A UN protection force official in Zagreb said fighting was continuing between Moslem and Croat forces in central Bosnia, in spite of formal agreements for a ceasefire. Meanwhile, UN officials in Sarajevo repeated warnings that the estimated 35,000 Moslem inhabitants of Mostar to the south-west, who have been cut off from humanitarian supplies by fierce fighting between Croat and Serb forces around the city, are facing critical shortages of food and water. A Red Cross worker there confirmed that the situation was deteriorating, and said the city was under sporadic shelling. Although Croat-dominated areas had some water, there was very little in Moslem areas, where food was also in shorter supply. Mr Mate Boban, Bosnia's Croat leader, claims Mostar - mostly Moslem before the war - as the capital of his ethnic mini-state. UN officials yesterday dismissed his assertion that relief workers had been allowed into the city. In an attempt to shore up the talks, international mediators summoned Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian president, and his Croat counterpart, Mr Franjo Tudjman, to Geneva. Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the conference co-chairmen, appear to believe that the Serb and Croat presidents, due to arrive today, will exert pressure on their respective proteges. Meanwhile, as the diplomatic tensions between the UN and Nato over the possible use of air strikes continued to bubble, the Belgian government yesterday announced that it fully supported Lieutenant-General Francis Briquemont, the Belgian UN commander in Sarajevo, in spite of his controversial comments attacking Washington's threatened air strikes. Gen Briquemont, and Brigadier Vere Hayes, his British chief of staff, had been quoted earlier this week as criticising the Nato plans for air strikes. Their comment prompted an angry response from the US envoy to the UN, Ms Madeleine Albright, who said it was 'unconscionable' for two senior UN officers in Bosnia to have questioned President Bill Clinton's policy. Nato officials in Brussels yesterday sought to play down the comments, insisting that their threat of air strikes remained very real. Nevertheless, there were indications in London that Gen Briquemont's fears about the implications of air strikes were shared by many other European allies. The threat of air strikes has receded in recent days with the withdrawal of Serb forces from strategic heights around Sarajevo. Commander Barry Frewer, spokesman for the UN protection force in Sarajevo, said small numbers of Serb soldiers were still in the woods on Mount Igman despite an agreement to leave last Saturday, but said they posed no threat. The UN and leaders of the Bosnian Serbs have already announced the complete withdrawal of Serb forces from Mount Igman. Commander Frewer declined to say how many Serbs remained on the mountain which commands the western approaches to the city, but a Bosnian army spokesman claimed that at least 250 remained, with more hidden in the woods.</p>

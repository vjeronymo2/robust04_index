			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH'S EDUCATION EFFORT 'TEPID'  </P> <P> President Bush is failing to back up his rhetoric about educational excellence  with federal money, and the Administration's proposed 2% spending increase for  schools is "meager" and "tepid," House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said today.  </P> <P> "While I commend the President for his desire to be known as 'the education  President,' I question whether he can achieve that goal by proposing a meager  2% increase in the federal spending on education," Foley told the nation's  governors.  </P> <P> "The simple fact is we don't have a 2% education problem in this country," he  said. "The education gap is much more daunting."  </P> <P> Foley spoke to the bipartisan National Governors' Assn. as it concluded its  annual winter meeting.  </P> <P> He said Bush's proposed education spending amounted to "tepid incrementalism."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> HYDRANT GUSHER IN N. HOLLYWOOD WASHES 10 FAMILIES OUT OF UNITS  </P> <P> Ten North Hollywood families were homeless this morning after a jet of water  from a broken fire hydrant flooded their apartment building and damaged their  units.  </P> <P> Nearly half of the apartments in the 24-unit building at in the 11700 block of  Vanowen Street were damaged after a car sheered off the fire hydrant near the  curb in front of the units Sunday afternoon, officials said.  </P> <P> No one was injured.  </P> <P> A 60-foot-high arc of water shot onto the roof and into the center courtyard of  the two-story apartment building.  </P> <P> "It was like a hurricane," said Wanda Sanchez, manager of the complex. "There  was a waterfall coming down off the roof."  </P> <P> Sanchez said a Department of Water and Power crew turned off the water in about  15 minutes, but not before water leaked through the roof and several apartment  ceilings. Water, gas and electricity were turned off in about 12 units, and  residents were evacuated to an American Red Cross shelter at nearby Madison  Junior High School.  </P> <P> This morning, Red Cross workers toured the apartments to determine whether they  are habitable. Nancy Albrecht, a disaster volunteer, said the Red Cross will  continue to provide shelter at the school or in motels for families displaced  by the accident.  </P> <P> Sanchez said at least seven apartments are badly damaged. In many of the  apartments ceilings were crumbling, water pooled on the floors and beds and  furniture were drenched.  </P> <P> Ed Freudenburg, a DWP spokesman, said a broken fire hydrant can spew up to  5,000 gallons of water per minute. He said it was unusual for a hydrant break  to result in water shooting into a nearby property. The hydrants are design to  break off completely so the water shoots straight up and then falls down on the  curb area, he said.  </P></p>

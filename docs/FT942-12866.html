			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (3): Companies pressed on discount rates - US funds are likely to increase their overseas exposure Volatile US bond markets have brought a high degree of uncertainty to the funding of the country's corporate pension schemes. Some companies saw their funding deficits balloon last year, as bond prices soared and yields tumbled, while others lurched closer to deficit. Yet just weeks later, with the yield on long-dated bonds up by more than a percentage point, the deficits have miraculously shrunk again. What are companies - and their shareholders - to make of it all? And what does it mean for the way US pension fund assets are invested? Since they reflect expectations of future inflation, bond yields act as a proxy for inflation in calculating the present value of a fund's future liabilities. With bond yields plummetting last year, US companies came under intense pressure to cut the discount rates used to calculate these - in the process, increasing the present value of their pension liabilities. The Securities and Exchange Commission, concerned that some companies were hiding the true scale of their funding deficits by keeping their discount rates high, last autumn leaned on any company that had a discount rate of over 9 per cent. It wasn't surprising: at the time, the yield on long-term bonds was headed below 6 per cent. The effect can be seen in the table. Three of the US companies with the biggest deficits slashed their discount rates at the end of last year, greatly inflating their reported liabilities. None of these companies had a rate above 9 per cent at the end of 1992; but at 8.5 per cent, each was at the top end of the range of US companies. General Motors, which has the biggest deficit in absolute terms (though, in relation to the company's cashflow, it stands out less starkly) said the discount rate change would put it squarely at the conservative end of pension fund accounting. It has set a target of the end of the decade to eliminate the deficit. The rising bond yields of recent weeks could help GM - and other companies - reach their funding targets much quicker than they had expected. By mid-April, with long-dated bond yields some 150 basis points higher than the low reached last October, most of 1993's escalation in deficits had effectively been wiped out. Market volatility, though, is likely to make companies cautious, and most will prefer to remain conservative in their accounting. While US companies, under pressure, have looked afresh at discount rates, it is notable that they have done little to scale back their expectations of future investment returns on pension fund assets. The two might have been expected to go hand-in-hand: after all, the same deflationary forces that were driving discount rates lower were at the same time reducing investment returns from fixed income and equity investments. Yet many companies seem to be clinging to investment expectations more suitable to the 1980s than the 1990s. How will US pension funds address their funding deficiencies - and how will they achieve what in some cases seem extravagant investment expectations? The two questions are closely linked. While many companies have sought to alleviate the strain by issuing shares to their pension schemes, or transferred property and other assets into them, they remain under pressure to lift actual investment returns. International diversification has promised a partial answer. With yields on US investments falling steadily lower last year, it is not surprising that US pension fund managers directed more of their cash overseas. The wave of international investment had long been predicted by the brokerage community: in the past two years, it has finally become a reality. Greenwich Associates, a consulting firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut, estimates that international stocks accounted for 6.4 per cent of US corporate pension fund assets in 1993, up from 5.4 per cent the year before and 4.4 per cent in 1991. International bonds accounted for a further 1.6 per cent, up from 1.3 per cent the year before (the first year Greenwich analysed bond holdings). By 1996, funds polled by the consultancy firm estimate their international equity holdings will rise to 9.6 per cent of total assets, while international bonds will account for 2.4 per cent. Domestic equities have remained a relatively stable asset class since the beginning of the decade, at around 29 per cent: the growth internationally has come at the expense of domestic fixed-income investments. Public pension funds, meanwhile - which account for around half of the US's Dollars 2,500bn of pension fund assets - are also beginning to dabble in international equities, though less aggressively. Such investments now account for 5.2 per cent of their assets, up from 2.9 per cent in 1991. In theory, international diversification is a route to higher returns, while at the same time spreading risk. That argument has been severely tested since early February, when the Federal Reserve began to push up short-term interest rates. The emerging-country equity markets and the vast international junk bond markets that have grown from the restructured debt of developing nations - markets where US pension funds have directed an increasing portion of their cashflow - shuddered at the move. At the same time, yields on long-dated Treasury bonds have moved up to make fixed income securities more appealing. This does not mean that the wave of US pension fund money that helped drive capital markets around the world in the early 1990s has dried up: however, the mania for international investment of 1993 is giving way to a more circumspect 1994.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Deficit           Discount          Expected                       (Dollars bn)        rate (%)         investment                                                            return (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                      1993     1992     1993     1992     1993     1992 General Motors       22.3     14.0      7.1      8.6     10.1     11.0 LTV                   2.0      0.3      7.0      8.5      8.5      8.5 Bethlehem Steel       1.6      1.2      7.5      8.5      9.5      9.5  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Companies' annual reports  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Estonian parliament on Wednesday [6 April] decided  to join five nuclear defence conventions obliging Estonia to  inform international community immediately of any accidents.    Joining Vienna and Paris conventions entitles Estonia also  to  certain international rights and enables the country to apply  for help in case of accidents, Tarand said. He also stressed  that these conventions would be a basis for negotiations if  anything should happen when Russia removes its nuclear training  reactors from Paldiski, a former submarine training base for the  Soviets.</p>

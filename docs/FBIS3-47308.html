			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Boualapha Thindoi: "The Heroics of Anti-aircraft </F> Battalion `456'"]    [Excerpts] When we think back again to the lives and  battles of the cadres and combatants of the Anti-aircraft Corps  and especially of the cadres and combatants of the 456th  Anti-aircraft Battalion and those who went through the war or  were in the unit then, one can only say that it is a frightening  image because the fighting involved one side using modern  explosives and weapons to wipe out another side which was not  willing to surrender but staked their lives for their patriotic  ideals.    The Geneva treaty for Laos of 1962 was trampled on and  destroyed completely by the special war of the imperialists,  which they steadily escalated. In addition to their mobilizing  the rightist forces and the special forces of Vang Pao to attack  and seize liberated areas, starting on 17 May 1964 they used  their air force to brazenly destroy our country. They used  various types of aircraft to drop many kinds of bombs and  brutally kill our people who had done nothing wrong. This lit  the fire of anger among the multi-ethnic Lao people more and  more, and it caused them to rise up and fight an ever broader  people's war. It also mobilized the spirit for battle of the  cadres and combatants of the Anti-aircraft Battalion.    The enemy air war grew steadily fiercer especially in Viang  Sai District, the stronghold of the revolution. This was a  special target for the air pirates who wanted to destroy the  base of the patriotic forces. They used various types of  aircraft to drop bombs every day in hundreds of sorties. Every  day the Viang Sai base was covered by a frightening amount smoke  and wreckage from explosions.    This fierce warfare forced our army to strengthen the  Anti-aircraft Corps and improve its combat capabilities. This  was the reaction to the "spreading fire" which required water to  be put out. They combined the 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th  anti-aircraft companies to create an anti-aircraft battalion on  2 May 1965. Its assignment was air defense for central Viang  Sai. This battalion was under the command of Comrade Khamchan.  Comrade Sao was responsible for political activities. Comrade  Phonkeo was chief of staff. Leadership was provided by the  artillery department of Supreme Headquarters.    After being established the unit moved into position to  defend the position of the central leadership of the Lao  Patriotic Front and worked to improve the various support bases  which were necessary. The unit mobilized the people to be  patriotic and hate the enemy and to send their sons to join the  ranks of the army amd do other things. They had to overcome  difficulties and confusion of many kinds, but the most important  task was mobilizing the fighting spirit of the cadres and  combatants within the unit to continue our army's brave  tradition that it was better to die than to surrender. Not long  after the establishment of the unit the imperialists on 4, 5 and  6 June 1965 used aircraft of various types to drop bombs in  attacking Viang Sai District again. This was a ferocious attack.  Their aircraft attacked for 3 days and nights; there was not  even a minute without the sounds of aircraft and explosions of  various kinds reverberating. They not only wanted to wipe out  the revolutionary forces but also made the mountains, which  symbolized the beauty of the area, into level ground. [passage  omitted] All levels of cadres and all combatants were united in  their resolve to fight to the death and to let their gun  emplacements be their graves. Initially the gun emplacements  were covered with branches, but after many hours of battle the  force of the explosions against the gun emplacements began to  expose them. This gave the air pirates targets so that they  could attack each emplacement fiercely. Nevertheless they were  not able to suppress the revolutionary spirit of the unit.  Against this steel we had to be brave. In this battle to defend  Viang Sai District not only were the cadres and combatants able  to maintain the security of the central command, but they were  also able to shoot down and destroy 12 aircraft. This was the  origin of the name of the 4.5.6 Anti-aircraft Battalion.    During the entire period that the unit performed its air  defense duties, it took part in 527 small and large-scale  engagements. Of these 150 were fierce battles. They shot down  more than 110 aircraft and captured 5 pilots. Because of these  accomplishments the battalion was honored by the party and upper  echelons with 12 freedom medals, two bravery medals, and one  bravery banner. One combatant was made a national hero. [passage  omitted]</p>

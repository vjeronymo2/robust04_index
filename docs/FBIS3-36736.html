[Grachev] We have signed a protocol on intent; I have in  mind the setting up of Russian military bases in Georgia. The  establishment of three bases is planned: in Tbilisi, in the  region of Vaziani, Akhalkalaki, and Batumi. The Batumi base  will have branches in Sukhumi, Poti, and Gudauta. They will be  created on the basis of troops of the Group of Russian Forces in  the Transcaucasus [GRFT] currently located in these areas.  These are primarily ground troops and air forces; helicopters,  a few Su-25 type attack aircraft, and some fighter-bomber  aircraft. The plan includes stationing Black Sea Fleet warships  in the Poti region. Where a specific base will be located and  the operational task it will fulfill will depend on geography.  They will be set up by 1 July 1994.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What will be the direct tasks of  these bases?    [Grachev] Ensuring the security of Russia and the states in  the Transcaucasus region that are part of the Treaty on  Collective Security.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Has the question of border troops  been resolved?    [Grachev] I can only say that the joint border between  Georgia and Russia that exists today will not be moved.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Pavel Sergeyevich, has the  question of bringing the Russian troops deployed in Abkhazia  under the command of GRFT commander General Reut finally been  resolved?    [Grachev] All troops located in Georgia are subordinate to  General Reut with the exception of the 345th Airborne Regiment.  This regiment is directly subordinate to me and is my strategic  reserve.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] To whom will the Russian troops  who are to fulfill the role of peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia  be subordinate, and who will finance them?    [Grachev] The peacekeeping forces will be under the command  of Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, deputy defense minister.  As for their financing, this is a painful question. We still  do not have a UN Security Council mandate enabling Russian  troops carrying out a peacekeeping mission in countries of the  former USSR to be peacekeepers under the aegis of the UN.  Therefore, they do not pay us and we have to bear the expenses  ourselves. Nevertheless, we are not abandoning our mission,  viewing Georgia as a single entity. However, this is both  Abkhazia and South Ossetia.    Dzhaba Ioseliani, member of Parliament, chairman of the  Interim Committee for the State of Emergency:    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Batono [Georgian polite form of  address] Dzhaba, how effective is the method of settling  Abkhazian problems by means of the deployment of Russian  peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone?    [Ioseliani] I do not see any other way out of the situation  that has been created. This is the most civilized way. The  peacekeeping forces will, I hope, be able to restore order and  peace on Abkhazian land.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Was the question of the return of  refugees to Abkhazia examined separately?    [Ioseliani] We presented to the Russian side a plan for the  stage-by-stage return of the refugees. Work on it will be  recorded in a document. I am certain that everything will be  fine as far as this question is concerned.    Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Federation minister of foreign  affairs:    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] It is no secret that there were  many people in Russia who were opposed to the president coming  to Tbilisi and signing a treaty with Georgia. How do you, as a  diplomat, assess this step and the significance of the visit?    [Kozyrev] Boris Nikolayevich is president and, as such, on  hearing all opinions, he adopts the only courageous decision  that immediately represents a significant step forward. The  most important thing in the signing of this treaty is that it is  a huge incentive to achieve a political settlement in Abkhazia  and South Ossetia. This is the most important thing.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] The problem of returning refugees  to Abkhazia is of great concern to us....    [Kozyrev] To us also. I hope that a decision will be  adopted on the signing of an agreement that is coordinated with  the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which will result in the  beginning of this process. This is a key issue and it is very  strange that certain difficulties have arisen precisely with the  Georgian side.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Nevertheless, as it turns out,  Russia's interests in Georgia are great.    [Kozyrev] Russia's strategic and geopolitical interests have  always been closely connected with Georgia. I do not think we  should fear such an expression as Russia's vital interests; and,  on the other side, Georgia's vis-a-vis Russia. The only problem  is that we should regard this visit by President Yeltsin to  Georgia not as a substitute for efforts to regulate the  conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia but, on the contrary, as  an incentive to achieve a settlement.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] How do you see the future of  Abkhazia?    [Kozyrev] I believe that the future of Abkhazia lies within  the sphere of the territorial integrity of Georgia; in the  acquisition by it of the corresponding political, legal, and  economic status and in the division of powers and rights  between, let us say, the center and Abkhazia. If both sides  show enough common sense and do not aim for a resolution of this  problem by force, they will be able to take advantage of this  propitious chance and the services offered by Russia, and  develop some kind of principle that will enable both Abkhazia  and Georgia to occupy themselves on the whole not with military  but peaceful matters.  General Sergey Shoygu, chairman of the Russian State  Committee for Emergency Situations:    "The Abkhazian problem will be regulated if the sides do not  hinder this."    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] General, do you think that, this  time, Russia will cope with its role as peacekeeper in Georgia?    [Shoygu] Yes, provided the Georgian and Abkhazian sides do  not hinder this.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What about the last time...?    [Shoygu] Last time: I said two weeks prior to your surrender  of Sukhumi that all this will end in a big war. I will not  participate in this bloodbath. That was why I tendered my  resignation.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What is your prediction regarding  events in Abkhazia?    [Shoygu] A most sad one. Look, we are returning to what we  should have done four months ago. I suggested bringing into  Abkhazia a regiment under the control of UN observers in order  to establish order. The same thing is now being suggested but I  think the opportunity has been missed.    Boris Pastukhov, Russian Federation first deputy  minister of foreign affairs:    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Mr. Pastukhov, you participated  directly in the resolution of questions concerning the conflict  in Abkhazia and Georgian problems in general. What, in your  view, awaits Russian-Georgian relations in the future?    [Pastukhov] Our full-fledged cooperation, including economic  cooperation, is only just beginning. The point is that we all  have had considerable success in destroying and wrecking a lot  of things. Moreover, what is now going on in our countries is  retribution.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Do you think that the  ratification of the treaty signed today will be a problem in the  Russian Duma?    [Pastukhov] No treaties are ratified without problems.  However, in this case, much depends on how we work in the sphere  of regulation and whether we prove our good intentions with  deeds: So that the treaty does not remain empty words but  becomes something of principle, something big, and something  that will guide the destiny of our peoples.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Campeau retailers unveil debt restructure FEDERATED Department Stores and Allied Stores, the two US retailing groups owned by Canada's Campeau Corporation but operating under the protection of Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code since 1990, yesterday filed their 'plan of reorganisation' with the bankruptcy court. The much-publicised bankruptcies came to symbolise the end of the leveraged bid wave which engulfed corporate America in the Eighties. Campeau's Dollars 10bn acquisitions of Allied and Federated in 1986 and 1988 respectively turned sour a few years later when the two were unable to service debt which funded the purchase. In the plan filed in Cincinnati yesterday, the retail groups - which take in the prestigious Bloomingdale's store in Manhattan - said they hoped to emerge from protection early next year. The aim is to give creditors a mixture of cash, new debt securities, and equity in a retail group formed by the merger of Federated and Allied. These shares would probably be listed. Some Dollars 8.2bn of claims - the figure at the time of the bankruptcy filing - would be 'compromised', so the business could emerge with debts of Dollars 2.8bn and equity of Dollars 2.3bn. General unsecured claims against Federated and Allied would receive shares in the merged group; general unsecured claims against subsidiaries would receive a mixture of cash and new medium-term notes. Claims against Federated Stores Inc (FSI), the immediate parent company of Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores would be satisfied by distributing stock in Ralphs, a Los Angeles-based supermarket subsidiary of FSI. Campeau, a leading FSI creditor, would receive 14.79 per cent of Ralphs. Another 8.6 per cent would go to Bank of Montreal and Banque Paribas. The companies stressed yesterday that the plan does not have approval of any creditors, although it said that some key concepts were discussed with them.</p>

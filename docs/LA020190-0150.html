The statement, issued in Washington after news reports about the shipment, did  not rule out the possibility that the helicopters may be diverted for military  use. However, Secretary of State James A. Baker III earlier said the Soviets  have given assurances that the helicopters will not be outfitted for military  purposes.  </P></p>

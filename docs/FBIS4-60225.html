			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, 20 May (SUNA) -- Deputy speaker of the  Transitional National Assembly (TNA) Angelo Beda, Bahr al-Jabal  State's Wali [Governor] Mrs. Agnes Lokudu and director of the  peace department at the Foreign Ministry Mathiang Malwal have  held here on Friday [20 May] a news conference on the  resolutions of Juba political forum for peace forces.    Beda said that over 350 of the southern leaderships, besides  representatives of international press and some ambassadors  accredited to Khartoum, had participated in the forum,  describing the forum as a "real gathering" to hear the voice of  southern citizens, who confirmed their insistence on the unity  of Sudanese soil and called for ending the war.    He added that the existing government is the only one that  sat to negotiate seriously with the rebels' movement to end the  southern Sudan war by presenting the Federal Government system  as a comprehensive solution.    Mrs. Agnes Lokudu said that the forum asserted that the  southern leaderships are aware of the Sudanese people's  interests and not toys in the hands of government, as termed by  the rebels' government and some hostile (?mass) media.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HUBBLE TROUBLES BLAMED ON SCRIMPING BY NASA  </P> <P> Sen. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) today blamed troubles with the Hubble Space  Telescope on NASA's appetite for grandiose projects, charging that the U.S.  space agency had scrimped on Hubble testing to fuel future missions to Mars and  the Moon.  </P> <P> "I think that presently NASA's eyes are bigger than its stomach," said Gore,  chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee's space subcommittee.  </P> <P> At a hearing into the problem-plagued Hubble project, Gore saluted NASA for  feeding the American peoples' dreams with project after project designed to  unlock the secrets of outer space.  </P> <P> But he criticized the agency for its seeming inability to carry out these  projects successfully.  </P> <P> "As soon as NASA starts to actually implement one of these projects . . . it  goes back and starts taking money away from the people who have been given the  unglamorous task of screwing the nuts and bolts and making the project sound,"  Gore said.  </P> <P> But NASA chief scientist Lennard Fisk denied that his agency had scrimped on  Hubble testing and told Gore that the space agency remains capable of carrying  out major new missions.  </P> <P> If anything, Fisk said, NASA had amply funded the Hubble project at the expense  of other space science projects competing for the same limited funds.  </P> <P> Two private contractors, meanwhile, refused to appear at Gore's hearings today,  the senator said.  </P> <P> These were Lockheed Corp., NASA's principal contractor for the overall  telescope project, and Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc., a subsidiary of  Hughes Aircraft Co. and the subcontractor that built the flawed mirror blamed  for the Hubble's current troubles.  </P> <P> Gore said he had asked his subcommittee staff to draw up subpoenas for the two  companies but said he hopes that it will not be necessary to use them before  the next hearing.  </P> <P> NASA said earlier this week that it had found a flaw in one of the Hubble's  mirrors that would prevent the telescope from performing at least 40% of its  planned experiments until repairs could be made by space shuttle astronauts  during a mission planned for 1993.  </P> <P> Gore noted that the flawed mirror had been made a decade ago, at about the same  time NASA was assembling the space shuttle Challenger that later blew up on  launch in January, 1986, killing its seven-member crew.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LOOK AT WHAT'S IN STORE FOR BUSINESS AND WORKERS;  </P> <P> IT WON'T BE DULL, THAT'S FOR SURE. THE NEW YEAR WILL SEE DRAMATIC CHANGES FOR  U.S. INDUSTRY AND THE AMERICAN WORKER. BUSINESS WRITERS AT THE TIMES POLLED  EXPERTS ON WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN 1989. HERE IS THEIR REPORT.;  </P> <P> MEDIA  </P> <P> The cable television industry should continue to show large profits with the  higher rates now charged for basic service. Prospects for local TV station  advertising revenues remains open, however, with some experts predicting a year  of small or flat growth. The national broadcast advertising that sustains the  TV networks is expected to rise a slight 4.5%. With as many as 30 network  affiliate stations up for sale, prices paid for stations may be sharply down,  after the go-go advances of recent years.  </P> <P> Many in the newspaper business have been candidly predicting a couple of tough  years ahead, because of the rising cost of newsprint and postage, as well as  the recession that many economists expect to begin in the second half of 1989.  In addition, the merger boom of recent years has reduced the volume of  advertising done by such key newspaper clients as supermarkets and department  stores.  </P> <P> In book publishing, a shining light may be the textbook segment, which is  expected to be helped by demand from the baby boom "echo" -- the children of  baby boomers, now entering school in growing numbers. Some analysts are looking  for the general aging of the American population to also help popular hardback  sales, since older people are the most avid readers. PAUL RICHTER  </P></p>

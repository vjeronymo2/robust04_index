			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Japan construction cartels hit JAPAN's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has saddled 66 construction companies that have admitted to rigging bids with an enormous pile of paperwork in an effort to prevent them from forming cartels again. The paperwork consists of obtaining individual signed pledges from all company employees - and there are more than 100,000 of them - that they will not take part in illegal activities. The boards of the 66 companies must also approve resolutions to refrain from violating the anti-monopoly law. The measure appears to be a mildly more severe slap on the wrist for the guilty companies, following a 'cease and desist' order issued against the companies in May, after which they were forbidden to bid on selected government contracts for one month. The action by the FTC is aimed at the practice by which Japanese companies rig bids among themselves in an effort to pass work in rotation among the companies. Although the government says the practice is rare, the US believes cartels are normal in the industry and it has objected. There was disappointment in May when the FTC decided against prosecuting the 66 companies, which had admitted to routinely rigging bids. The FTC, however, argued that obtaining convictions under Japanese law would have proved impossible, since individuals rather than companies would have to be prosecuted. It is not entirely clear how obtaining pledges signed by everyone from the chairman of the board to a crane operator will prevent bid rigging. Kajima, one of the bigger companies involved, says it will have to collect some 13,000 pledges, all validated with a personal seal. It says, however, that some companies have asked the FTC to reduce the number of signatures required.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Boris Yeltsin has  asked Sergey Kovalev, the human rights representative who was  appointed to that post by the State Duma, to observe the  implementation of the decree "On urgent measures to protect the  population from gang violence and other manifestations of  organized crime", including the examination of complaints from  citizens. "I hope that you sympathize with the considerations  which forced me to sign the decree. At the same time, I share  the apprehensions of the public, the deputies, and your own  fears that during implementation of the decree threats to  constitutional human rights could arise," reads a letter by the  president of the Russian Federation, the text of which was  circulated by his press service.    "I believe that until the relevant federal constitutional  law  has been adopted, the representative for human rights should  proceed in his activity on the basis of the principle of Article  15 of the Russian Constitution, according to which the  constitution has direct force and is applicable throughout the  territory of the Russian Federation," the document notes. "In  your work you can rely on the assistance of the heads of  constituent parts of the Federation and of the president's  authorized representatives."    Presidential aide Georgiy Satarov told an ITAR-TASS  correspondent that within the next few days Boris Yeltsin will  submit to the State Duma a bill on introducing additions and  alterations to the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedural  Code of the Russian Federation in order to bring the decree on  combatting gang violence into line with Russian legislation. He  is participating in today's meeting of the lower house of  parliament together with Aleksandr Yakovlev, the Russian  president's authorized representative at the Federal Assembly.  Deputies are expected to again express their views on the  decree which has met with a mixed reaction among politicians.    Having told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that "Boris Yeltsin  does not intend to suspend this decree," Sergey Filatov, head of  the president's administration, added that "if violations of  human rights are observed in the course of its implementation,  adjustments may be made to the document. It is not a dogma."</p>

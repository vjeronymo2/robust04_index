			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by this Newspaper's Commentator: "How Should We </F> Regard the "Labor Tide"]    [Text] Hardly had the news media stopped publishing stories  on labor migration at the beginning of the year, and the "sun"  has yet to complete its 365-day cycle, the "labor tide" --  usually a hot topic when Spring Festival comes around next year  -- has already come under heated discussion among the people.  Shanghai calls it an emergency; the pressure on Guangdong is  also considerable.    In recent years, more and more peasants have left their  villages in the interior to work and make money in the Southeast  coastal areas, and many of them would go home to visit relatives  during the Spring Festival period and return to their work areas  bringing others with them. This is called the "labor tide"  because of the timing, scope and direction of the migration and  numbers of migrating laborers involved.    Even though various sectors of society hold different views  toward this "labor migration" question and offer different  explanations for the phenomenon, there is one point which is  beyond dispute: this kind of migration is necessary in a market  economy; on the one hand, given the sluggish economic  development in the interior, the surplus of peasant farmers and  the scarcity of land, a great deal of surplus labor is available  in the rural areas. On the other hand, with the economies of  coastal areas developing rapidly, a labor shortage has  developed, which can be met by migrant laborers from other  areas. Peasants in the interior through migration can obtain  employment; they not only support economic construction in the  coastal areas, but also increase their own individual incomes,  and this is a good thing for the individuals as well as the  nation.    If this situation is inevitable and even advantageous, why  is  it that when the Spring Festival comes around each year all  sectors of society pay such close attention, with some areas and  concerned departments actually treating the situation as a  crisis? The main reason is that the migration takes place on a  large scale in a very limited time frame, and this exceeds the  capacities of cities and transportation systems to handle the  situation.    The railroads, the heart of China's transportation system,  are normally operating at peak capacity; during the Spring  Festival period in recent years, the railroads face the  staggering burden of handling seasonally higher passenger  traffic as well as the additional round-trip travels by massive  numbers of migrant laborers. Some of the heavily travelled rail  lines, such as the Beijing-Guangzhou line, the Beijing-Shanghai  line, etc. which on average operate at 80 percent over-capacity,  sometimes have to operate at 100-200 percent of capacity. The  concerned department learned from a survey last year that over  400 persons were jammed into one 116-passenger hard-seat rail  car. Some of the laborers who could not get on the train and  became stranded at intermediate stops of their journey generate  additional pressure on the smaller cities and towns which are  relatively backward in infrastructure facilities. It is said  that several years ago when the labor tide started to pour into  Guangzhou, the Governor, Mayor and other administrators of  Guangdong had to hold emergency meetings to discuss the question  of building toilets for the migrants. When large numbers of  migrant laborers are held up in any locations, they also affect  public security.    Two mutually contradictory questions therefore confront us  at  the same time: while we want to go with the trend of encouraging  agriculture in the interior to cut down on surplus farm laborers  and encouraging the latter to emigrate and to match up with  production needs of the developing coastal areas; at the same  time, we also want to maintain normal social order and to ensure  stability in the society.    Let's face reality, we cannot give up eating because of a  hiccup or two, and we can only make the following choices:  rationally control the concentrated, large-scale migration of  laborers, prevent or put a stop to unplanned migration and deal  with the "labor tide" in a timely fashion by focusing on the  positive features and minimizing the defects. At present, the  concerned departments are united in their efforts to promote the  drawing up of a labor cooperation agreement between Guangdong  Province which takes in large numbers of migrant laborers and  eight provinces (prefectures) such as Sichuan, which export  large numbers of surplus laborers, to draw on Guangdong's  experience in handling the labor tide to establish a system of  regional labor cooperation agreements for East China and North  China areas, and gradually to establish within China a basic  system for handling multi-area migration of laborers that  supports the market economy, the market information system and  service network, in order to enable those areas which have  relatively large-scale inflow and outflow migrations of farm  laborers to achieve the goal of orderly rural labor migration.  Therefore, the issues which urgently need to be addressed at  present are projecting, guiding, and managing the direction and  flow of the labor tide."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A tense psychological atmosphere is being stirred up  around the Russian Army. Attempts are being made to portray it  as a crushing force, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said  Friday addressing cultural workers.    Speaking about the developments in Moscow in October 1993,  Grachev said that the military would never forget what happened  then.    He said that the military still feels bitterness because it  was forced to help solve the problems created by political  confrontation. He said that in the autumn of 1993 the army  "came to Moscow on the second day of the civil war in Russia."    Attitudes may be different to what happened but everyone  should remember that servicemen bear a special responsibility  and no-one has the right to split the army for political  reasons, said Grachev.    He said that the well-known thesis "the army is outside  politics" should not be understood literally as some people are  trying to present. The minister said that the military, like  all citizens, cannot be indifferent to the political processes  going on in society.    The army does not serve parties or individual politicians,  the army serves society, the country, said Grachev. He said  that now some political forces are trying to take advantage of  the tense social situation: the media are spreading all sorts of  rumors aimed at discrediting the leadership of the country and  the army.    Grachev believes that the campaigners want to split the  people and make them nervous. He said that the army and navy  command is showing self-control.    "I recently held a meeting of commanders of military  districts and fleets and they said that no one will be able to  split the army," said Grachev. He said that the army wants  stability and further changes in society.</p>

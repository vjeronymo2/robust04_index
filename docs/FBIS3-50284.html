			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Scope Is Being Created for Corruption; </F> Opposition Parties on the Law on Large-Scale Privatization"]    [Text] Bratislava--At their meeting in Bratislava  yesterday, the deputy chairmen of the parliamentary opposition  parties adopted a statement on the proposed amendment to the Law  on Large-Scale Privatization. The statement was presented to  journalists by Ivan Simko, deputy chairman of the Christian  Democratic Movement [KDH].    In the statement, the opposition parties that attended the  meeting--the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], the KDH, the  Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic, Coexistence, and  the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement--note that, instead  of becoming an economic instrument of the transformation  process, privatization has become a political means to  concentrate power. Unless changes are made to eliminate the  danger of privatization being abused at the forthcoming meeting  of parliament, scope for corruption will be created. The  opposition parties will support such changes as will make  privatization more transparent and effective and prevent its  misuse. They expect deputies representing the governing  coalition to realize their responsibility toward their voters  and to endorse those changes, the statement by the parliamentary  nongovernment parties states.    Regarding the KDH's initiative to pass a vote of no  confidence in Roman Hofbauer, minister of transportation,  communications, and public works, Ivan Simko announced that  signatures are still being collected. He believes that it will  be possible to raise this issue in the course of the forthcoming  meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic. SDL  Deputy Chairwoman Alzbeta Borzova told the TA SR correspondent  that the SDL has "commissioned an analysis" on the extent to  which Roman Hofbauer's procedures correspond to "the principle  of rationality." The SDL's view on this matter has not yet  become crystallized, she said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- A subcommittee meeting of  the Korea-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting (SCM), originally  set to be held in Honolulu on June 14-15, has been postponed  indefinitely due to a situation on the part of the United  States, the Defense Ministry reported on Friday.    "The United States had repeatedly asked for the postponement  of the meeting on the grounds that they had little prepared for  it," a ministry official said. He said the two sides will  determine the time and place of the meeting later.    The postponement of the meeting draws keen attention because  it comes at a time when tension is rising over the North Korean  nuclear question. The subcommittee meeting was to discuss key  military issues pending between the two countries such as the  question of whether to hold the Team Spirit exercise and the  issue of defense cost sharing, ahead of the main SCM meeting  usually taking place in November.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary: "Radio Free Asia Constitutes Gross Interference </F> in the Internal Affairs of the Asian Countries"]    [Text] According to foreign sources, the U.S. Senate on 26  January voted in favor of a decision to establish the so-called  Radio Free Asia. This decision still needs the approval of the  House of Representatives before becoming effective. The BBC held  that this is the policy of certain rightist and extremist U.S.  circles who wish to use Radio Free Asia to propagate American  thinking and lifestyle and carry out the peaceful evolution  strategy.    This decision of the U.S. Senate has resulted in strong  protests in Asia and even in the United States. On 28 January,  when interviewed by a ITAR-TASS correspondent on this issue, the  spokesperson for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said: The news  about the U.S. Senate decision to set up Radio Free Asia has not  been welcomed in Asia. The Asian people are aware that the  purpose of this move is to impose the political views of a  foreign country on them and this amounts to interference into  the internal affairs of Asian countries. Not only will this move  harm the socioeconomic development of Asian countries, but it  will also adversely affect the relations between the United  States and these countries. This is an erroneous decision that  runs counter to the current trend of development in the  international situation.    A Chinese Government spokesman stated that by deciding to  set  up Radio Free Asia, the U.S. Senate has trampled on the  standards of international relations and interfered in the  internal affairs of China and other Asian countries. This  decision must be overturned. The DPRK's KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS  AGENCY issued a statement condemning the U.S. Senate decision to  set up Radio Free Asia. Myanmar [Burma] also expressed its  indignation at this move by the U.S. Senate. Even the American  people have protested this action. Many people believed that  the establishment of Radio Free Asia in the Cold War format is  no longer useful and suitable, especially when economic  relations between the United States and Asia are on the rise.    During the Cold War period, the United States used Radio  Free  Asia, Radio Freedom, and Jose Marti Radio and Telvision Stations  as lethal ideological weapons against East European social  countries, the (former) Soviet Union, and Cuba by disseminating  distorted propaganda and inciting antagonistic feelings, thus  grossly interfering in the internal affairs of these countries  and causing tension in the relations between the United States  and these countries. The people in these countries and in the  rest of the world have protested strongly against this U.S. act  of interference. Cuba was noted for its success in jamming the  vicious U.S. radio broadcast signals.    Since the Cold War, the situation in Asia and the rest of  the  world has experienced substantial changes. Asia has emerged as a  region of relative peace, stability, cooperation, and dynamic  development.    It is the general desire of the people in the region to  broaden their multilateral and diversified relations with the  goals of protecting peace, security and socioeconomic  development on the basis of mutual respect for independence and  sovereignty, without interference into each other's affairs, and  cooperation for equal benefit. Looking at the prospect of Asian  development, many developed, industrialized countries, including  the United States, are attaching importance to its relations  with countries in the region. Therefore, the U.S. Senate  decision to set up Radio Free Asia runs entirely against the  trend toward peace, stability, and cooperation, violates  international law, and therefore amounts to gross interference  into the internal affairs of Asian countries.</p>

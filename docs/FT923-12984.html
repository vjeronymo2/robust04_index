			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Leading Article: They must be stopped WITH WHAT must seem to the victims unpardonable slowness, the international community is beginning to recognise the nature of the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina. A state, recognised by most other states and admitted to numerous international bodies, is being dismembered. Frontiers are being redrawn by war. Large numbers of people are being forcibly driven from their homes, with widespread killing. Such actions would be 'intolerable' at any time or place, but in many times and places they have been tolerated. A particularly clear precedent was set in Cyprus in 1974. There too a neighbouring state (Turkey) intervened to protect a minority, and used military force to secure an area for that minority's exclusive use, expelling from it all members of the majority community. There too the international community - including Britain, which had guaranteed Cyprus's territorial integrity - failed to take any effective action to halt or reverse the process. There too not everyone agreed who was aggressor and who was victim; no one was sure how to solve the problem; above all, no one wanted to get hurt. Turkey at least waited 14 years after Cyprus's independence, until a moment when the Cyprus government had been overthrown by a coup stage-managed from Greece, before resorting to such extreme measures. The Serbs did not wait to find out what an independent Bosnia-Hercegovina would be like. They resorted to force straight away. Also, not having such an overwhelming military superiority as Turkey had, they are taking longer to achieve their aims. That has given the rest of the world more time to react. Sanctions have been imposed, if so far very ineffectively enforced. General disorder Turkey was a large, strategically important country in the midst of the cold war. No one wanted to alienate it. Serbia is a small country and there is no longer a cold war. Instead there is a new security order in Europe which shows every sign of degenerating into general disorder, precisely because of conflicts over frontiers and minorities. If the Serbs get away with what they are doing, there are plenty of other nations, including most ominously the Russians, who may be tempted to use the same methods to assert their claim to territory held by other states, and to 'cleanse' that territory of other ethnic groups. The instinctive aims of the international community are: to bring relief, as far as possible, to the civilian victims; to prevent the conflict from spreading; and to stop the fighting as soon as possible. Those aims are right. Something has to be done, as a matter of urgency, about the refugee problem; and western powers, notably the EC, must focus on the need to prevent the fighting spreading to Kosovo, Macedonia or Voivodina and to ensure that even if it does, neighbouring countries - Albania, Greece, Bulgaria, Hungary - stay out. Ethnic cleansing But 'stopping the fighting' is not enough if it turns out to mean, as in Cyprus, consolidating a ceasefire only after the aggressor has secured his objectives, and then being content to urge the virtue of negotiations and concessions equally on both sides. Something more is needed to drum home the message that violence and ethnic cleansing are not an acceptable way to protect minority rights. And it is getting ever harder to avoid the conclusion that this something has to be an injection of force in some form on the side of the victims. Outside powers are rightly reluctant to deploy ground troops, which could easily get bogged down. But naval force is already being deployed in the Adriatic - to 'monitor' but not to enforce the sanctions. At the very least this force should be empowered to stop and search, and Bulgaria and Romania (through whose territory most supplies are reaching Serbia) must be put under greater pressure to co-operate. It is time to consider the use of air power as well, if only to neutralise the unjust monopoly of air power currently enjoyed by the Serbs. It would be feasible for Nato, if so mandated by the UN Security Council, to forbid the use of Bosnian airspace to the former Yugoslav armed forces. These are not easy decisions to take. But if they are not taken soon there may be many even more difficult ones lying in wait.</p>

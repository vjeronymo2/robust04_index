			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Depressing growth prospect of a US-EC trade war THE WORLD ECONOMY is not suffering from a 1930s-style depression. Nonetheless, the parallels between then and now are worrying, not least the apparent willingness of US and EC governments to risk a collapse of the world trading system and a descent into tit-for-tat protectionism. A transatlantic trade war is not yet under way, but the signs are ominous. US and EC negotiators are reported to be willing to keep talking to solve the row over EC oilseed subsidies. But preparations for war are progressing. The US has announced its intention to impose 200 per cent duties on Dollars 300m (Pounds 193.5m) of EC white wines and farm goods in a month. The French trade minister, Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, plans to ask the EC to compile a list of US products for retaliation. Would a US-EC trade war threaten a slide into a 1930s-style depression? The Great Depression was undoubtedly prolonged and deepened by protectionism. The Smoot-Hawley tariff, instituted by the US in 1930, sparked a rise in tariff barriers in virtually every country, often reinforced by quantitative restrictions. Protectionism combined with falling output and prices to cause a spiralling collapse in the value of world trade. The value of world trade collapsed from Dollars 3bn a month in January 1929 to less than Dollars 1bn a month by 1933, as the chart shows. There is still widespread disagreement about the underlying cause of the Great Depression. Different explanations stress the collapse in demand caused by the 1929 US stock market crash, the effects on confidence and the availability of credit of the US banking crises of the early 1930s and the combination of widespread debts and the deflationary monetary policies which the gold standard exchange rate regime required in Europe, despite contracting output and trade. The UK left the gold standard in September 1931 and subsequently experienced a considerably smaller output decline. Yet the collapse in trade was not the root cause of the Depression. The US suffered the deepest recession of any developed country - real US output fell by a third - and its resort to protectionism was largely to blame for spreading this contraction across the world. But trade played a small role in the US decline. Exports constituted 7 per cent of gross national product in 1929 and declined by 1.5 per cent of 1929 GNP over the next two years while the real value of US GNP fell by 10 times more in the same period. Despite the current gloom, the world economy is still a long way from suffering an economic collapse on a 1930s scale. Between 1929 and 1932, the GDP of the advanced developed countries fell by 17.1 per cent, world trade in manufactures fell by 40 per cent and world prices fell by 6 per cent a year. Developing countries were also badly affected. Between 1929 and 1932, they suffered a 12 per cent fall in GDP. Output subsequently rose by 34 per cent between 1932 and 1937 but trade expansion contributed only 6.6 percentage points of this growth, according to the World Bank. Confidence today is certainly depressed in almost all developed countries, while many countries have indebted consumers and banks with shaky balance sheets. But the monetary authorities, at least in US and Japan and more recently in the UK, have eased monetary policy, while world output, trade and prices are rising. But it is the eastern European countries that are suffering falls in output and incomes on a depression scale. For these countries, and also for developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America which saw their average incomes per head fall in the 1980s, an outbreak of world protectionism would be a disaster. The Bank expects rising real incomes per head in Africa and Latin America as well as East Asia in the 1990s, but these projections assume a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. The world is not threatened by a depression to rival the 1930s'. Even so, a trade war now would deepen the world's current economic problems. For developed and developing countries alike, a descent into protectionism is a depressing prospect.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRICES AND COMPETITIVENESS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly figures are shown in index form with the common base year of 1985.

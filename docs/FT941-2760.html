			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (22): Easing the pain of reform - Labour and Social Policy South Africa's finance minister Derek Keys likes to describe himself as 'the minister of the bloody obvious'. His main job is to explain the limits and the economic costs of demands from newly-enfranchised Blacks for social and economic reforms. Mr Leszek Miller, the former communist apparatchik who now finds himself in a similar hot seat as Poland's minister for labour and social affairs, sees his role as 'the minister for keeping the pain of economic transformation within tolerable limits'. The South African has a snappier one-liner, but the two men are clearly tackling the same problem, albeit from opposing angles. The problem is how to persuade enough people to accept only minimal improvements in their immediate living standards to allow reforms and investment the time needed to deliver the higher employment, better pay and improved services voters really want now. Mr Miller is lucky on two counts. Although the reversal of political fortunes has put the 2m-strong Solidarity Union, with its tradition of militant anti-communism, back in opposition to the government, the union is weak in the fast-growing private sector where much of the new wealth and most of Poland's new jobs are being created. Its old power base in the mines, railways, shipyards and big factories has been eroded by unemployment, and faces further reduction with the onward march of privatisation. Second, Mr Miller has an ally in Mrs Ewa Spychalska, the former Solidarity unionist who switched to become the leader of the rival OPZZ union, which was built up by the communists in the 1980s to counter the power and influence of the then 10m-strong Solidarity anti-communist alliance of workers, intellectuals and the Catholic church. The OPZZ has more than 70 deputies in the new parliament, making it the second largest faction in the governing SLD party after the Social Democrats led by Alexander Kwasniewski. Mrs Spychalska is one of the most influential deputies. Her view is that 'the bulk of Polish society decided in favour of systemic change in 1989 and the unions were part of that decision. As for capitalism, it has many forms and we look at developed capitalist systems with interest and hope'. Mr Miller conveys the same sentiments, but in a different way. 'Experience has shown that the famous debate between the revolutionary Lenin and the evolutionary Kautski has been settled in favour of the latter,' he says bluntly. He is anxious to dispel any suspicion that the election led in any way to a restoration of the old system, although a fair proportion of the backbench MPs elected on the SLD ticket and many of their voters, still hanker for the good old days when security was absolute, mediocrity was a virtue and laziness came with the job. But his roots in working class Lodz, a depressed textile town making valiant efforts to revitalise itself, give Mr Miller a shrewd idea of what the voters who put the left back into power will stand. 'If Poles feel that the cost of transformation is too high, or too unfair, society will reject market reforms. So it is up to us to protect the continuation of market reforms by making sure that these costs are bearable.' As for fairness, Mr Miller backed down from his controversial proposal to fund higher social spending by imposing a small tax on share transactions in deference to the wider government objective of earning much greater revenue, by selling off state shareholdings through the stock exchange at the highest possible price. That's pragmatism. But the share tax idea is likely to return, as is another of Mr Miller's ideas - that any above budget revenue arising from faster economic growth should at least be partly allocated to higher spending on health, education and pensions and targeted on the poorest and most helpless parts of society. At the same time, however, Mr Miller also supports plans, inherited largely from the previous Solidarity governments, for structural reforms which involve the creation of self-financing, contributory national insurance and national health systems which will take the strain off future budgets. 'Great social reforms are ahead of us in the benefit system, including health and social security. Every reform will hurt somebody's interest and we certainly don't expect any standing ovations. The paradox of Poland is that it is a leftist government which now has to take on such tasks,' he sighs.</p>

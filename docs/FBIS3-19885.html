			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bruno Visentini, former Italian Republican </F> Party leader, by Massimo Riva; place and date not given:  "Visentini's Recipe for Resolving Crisis"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Riva] Are you standing  chiefly as a [progressive] candidate against something?    [Visentini] No. It is against the threat of the Right, but  first and foremost in favor of the possibility that  civilized--bourgeois, if you like--culture can make its  essential contribution to this country's emancipation...    [Riva] Actually, both [Forza Italia leader Silvio]  Berlusconi  and [Northern League Secretary Umberto] Bossi now portray  themselves as the champions of liberal-democratic culture.    [Visentini] The vision of politics that they display  conflicts with all the teachings of liberal and democratic  culture. Do you remember what [German philosopher] Max Weber  wrote? According to his vision, the politician must base his  actions on two kinds of ethics--of conviction and  responsibility. In other words, he must always be able to  adjust his means to the end. Consider the spectacle provided by  the acrobats of the so-called pole of freedoms: They promise  the moon -- a million new jobs, tax cuts, increased pensions,  prosperity for all -- but without explaining how and by what  means. They have reduced the election campaign to something  like a circus or a Brazilian soap opera. It is a distressing  and frightening spectacle that degrades politics and insults  Italian society.    [Riva] So let us come to the constructive part of your  candidacy: In whom and in what should Italian society believe?    [Visentini] First, it must start by squarely confronting the  real nature of its problems and realize that it is a sick  society, because the high level of unemployment we have now is  the symptom of a serious illness that could undermine the bases  of civilized coexistence.    [Riva] But this phenomenon is not confined to Italy.  Unfortunately, unemployment is a major problem in the rest of  Europe, too.    [Visentini] Yes, but elsewhere they are trying to approach  the problem in earnest. In our country we are witnessing a very  paradoxical process: While the Left has ceased to regard  unemployment as the effect of a historical crisis of the  capitalist system, the Right speaks and acts as though it is  capitalism that is to blame and is not suggesting suitable  treatments but confining itself to demanding more power in order  to defend itself...    [Riva] But if the blame does not lie with the capitalist  system, whose fault is it?    [Visentini] It is rather like it was in the twenties. At  that time the recession and unemployment were the result of  excesses in the deflationary policy. Do you remember Keynes'  The Economic Results of Sir Winston Churchill?  Something similar could be written now in connection with  certain restrictive strategies pursued by some Western  governments in the past decade. In Italy the crisis stems -- as  well as from other factors such as the backwardness of our  public structures, the weakness of our industrial and financial  system, and certain social rigidities -- also from the state's  excessive and disproportionate debt and from the constant  stopgap measures every six months which have acted as a curb,  instead of a comprehensive reform to open the way to development.    [Riva] If I understand you correctly, the solution is a  rather more expansive economic policy.    [Visentini] Precisely.    [Riva] But this is what the Right says -- Berlusconi, for  instance.    [Visentini] Oh, no, there is a big difference. They are  promising to eliminate public intervention in the economy,  whereas what I am saying is that the targets of this  intervention must change. For instance, they are proposing a  single income tax rate, which would ultimately give more to the  rich and take more from the poor. I believe, on the contrary,  that the path to economic growth must be taken above all in  order to improve the situation of those with the lowest wages.  The development and expansion of our economy and our GDP must  not favor the most prosperous sectors but must create or  increase the incomes of the sectors currently excluded or barely  subsisting. This necessity was stated in a very perceptive  article in THE WASHINGTON POST a few days ago.    [Riva] So are you more sensitive to the factor of social  equity?    [Visentini] It is less a matter of equity and more a matter  of considerations intrinsic to economic development. Old Ford  understood that the expansion of his business depended not so  much on purchases by wealthy people as on the opportunity for  his own workers to buy the cars that they produced. This rule  is all the more applicable today. By helping those earning the  lowest incomes, who are most numerous in society, you create a  new demand that can set in motion a circle between production  and employment, thus also reducing overall savings, which are  now invested idly in government stock.    [Riva] I understand that, but would a rather more expansive  policy not have major repercussions on inflation and public  finances, which are already in a precarious state?    [Visentini] Assuming that inflation at acceptable levels is  always better than recession, I would like to make it clear that  the public finance situation would derive substantial advantages  from a growth directed toward improving the situation of those  earning the lowest wages. Let us consider health, for instance.  As long as there are a lot of poor people, public finances will  be burdened by expenditure on health care. By the same token,  if the proportion of prosperous people is increased, so too will  the number of those able to provide for themselves without  burdening the state.    [Riva] Professor, I feel like I am talking to a combination  of Keynes and Robin Hood.    [Visentini] This is no joking matter. In fact it is a matter  of pursuing social equity as a means of achieving economic  recovery and the recovery of the public finance situation. This  country's troubles stem from the excessive rigidity of the  social scale. The concentration of wealth produces neither  growth nor development, and in fact weakens the very cohesion of  the system. If we want to avert even worse troubles, we must  increase social mobility, that is, make society as a whole more  efficient.    [Riva] Now perhaps I begin to understand why part of the  middle class felt rather afraid when they heard you were  standing as a candidate of the Left: You are outlining a  political plan that challenges many social privileges and  established positions.    [Visentini] The nice thing about capitalism, Galbraith once  wrote, is that in its evolution something always happens whereby  fools and their money are always separated. This is a rather  paradoxical joke, but it does make one essential point. In  Italy Galbraith's law has prevailed too infrequently.  Therefore, we live in a paralyzed society that has absorbed the  lack of mobility between classes and placed the burden on the  state budget. This is the exact opposite of what is required to  ensure the vitality of a capitalist system. Therefore, it is  crazy -- as well as anticapitalist -- to believe that it is  possible to resolve this impasse by stubbornly defending  established positions. This path leads only to economic  disaster, uncontrollable social tensions, and a real crisis of  the capitalist system.    [Riva] When Roosevelt became U.S. President, his adversaries  called him "that Bolshevik at the White House." If the Left is  victorious, is that what they will say about Bruno Visentini?    [Visentini] I do not know, and I do not much care. But I  would like to remind reluctant and hesitant members of the  bourgeoisie that "that Bolshevik" revived American society,  boosted its economy, consolidated democracy, and salvaged  capitalism.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Pollution challenge for Japan's car culture JAPAN'S Environment Agency has challenged the country's powerful automotive lobby by calling on citizens to review their use of cars and to place greater reliance on sea and rail transport for domestic freight haulage. The targeting of trucks and cars as a growing source of Japan's air pollution problems is a particular embarrassment for the car industry, which has recently embraced environmental themes in domestic advertising campaigns. The Japanese cabinet yesterday approved a white paper from the agency, which argued for increased use of electric and methanol cars, and concluded that carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide problems will not improve unless there is less reliance on cars. Japan's car makers have been leaders in improving fuel efficiency and reducing emission levels, but the Environment Agency suggested that a more fundamental change needs to be made to the country's car culture. Mr Toshiro Kojima, the agency's director of planning, said said the tax structure should be revised to encourage environmentally friendly forms of transport. He said that the increased use of diesel trucks had contributed to pollution problems, and haulage companies would be reluctant to trade-in their diesels while that fuel remains about 30 per cent cheaper than petrol. 'Many trucking companies are small or medium in size, and owners don't want to discard their present trucks. We have to provide some tax incentives to change this situation,' Mr Kojima said. The proposals must be approved by the more influential Ministry of International Trade and Industry and Transport Ministry before legislation can be drafted. The latter has made clear it will oppose changes that would put haulage companies at any disadvantage</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Vice-President Rong  Yiren said here today that with joint efforts, the renewed  Sino-Lesotho ties will be further consolidated and developed.    Extending a warm welcome to M.J. Qhobela, visiting foreign  minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho, Rong described the visit as  the first major contact between the two countries after they  renewed diplomatic relations early this year.    The visit shows that the Lesotho Government pays attention  to  its relations with China, Rong said, adding he believes the  visit will help enhance mutual understanding between the two  peoples and the friendly cooperation between the two countries.    Rong appreciated the "one China" stance of the new Lesotho  Government and its efforts to normalize bilateral relations. He  thanked Qhobela for his contribution to the restoration of Sino-  Lesotho ties.    China and Lesotho are both developing countries, Rong said.  China holds that all countries, small or big, poor or rich, weak  or strong, should live in equality and develop ties with one  another on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  co-existence.    Briefing Qhobela on China's domestic situation, Rong said  that in the past decade and more, China has been pursuing a  policy centered on economic construction, and its economic  growth has been rapid.    Qhobela said the renewal of diplomatic ties between Lesotho  and China is a historic event. Despite the long geographic  distance, the two countries are linked together by common  interests and the Lesotho-China ties have bright prospects, he  said.    Qhobela told Rong that this was his 4th trip to China and  that he and his party had witnessed great changes here. Lesotho  will benefit from China's experience over the past decade, he  said.    Qhobela and his party arrived here on April 10 as guests of  Vice- Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN ACTIVE ALLIANCE OF CHEFS  </P> <P> Regarding the Nov. 5 articles that appeared under the headline "Women Chefs:  Checking In on the Revolution": It was great to see such extensive pieces on  women chefs. However, I was angered by Elka Gilmore's assertion that the  Women's Culinary Alliance had "disintegrated into a catering coffee klatch."  </P> <P> As a documentary film maker currently working with the WCA, I can tell you that  the alliance is an active, committed group of professionals working in all  aspects of food service. The organization not only provides support to its  members but is active in community affairs.  </P> <P> WCA members were involved in the American Wine and Food Festival benefiting  Meals-on-Wheels. The group sponsors Dining for Dollars, which last year raised  more than $30,000 for AIDS Project Los Angeles, and it is working with Avery  Restaurant Supply to renovate the Union Rescue Mission's kitchen.  </P> <P> These are hardly the pursuits of a "catering coffee klatch."  </P> <P> WENDY LEVY  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

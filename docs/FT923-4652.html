			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Dutch sign open skies deal with US THE US and the Netherlands signed a liberal 'open skies' accord in Washington yesterday. This gives KLM Royal Dutch Airlines essentially unrestricted access to the aviation market in the US. The bilateral agreement is the first under Washington's 11-point 'open skies' initiative, which seeks to exchange freer access to the American market for similar rights for US carriers abroad. It comes only months before Europe's January initiation of a single air transport market, coincides with a fierce transatlantic fare war and is aimed at pressuring other EC governments to sign similar accords. Recently, countries such as France and Germany have been seeking to restrict US carriers' access to their markets, saying they enjoy an unfair advantage. The deal also coincides with British Airways' controversial attempt to expand its US market presence through a major equity partnership with the USAir group. Calling the deal 'a very significant event in international aviation', US transportation secretary, Mr Andrew Card, said it represented a model for market-oriented aviation agreements with other countries. The pact gives KLM and other Dutch carriers open entry and unrestricted capacity rights on flights through US international gateways and on to other US and third-country destinations, widens flexibility in fare-setting and sets liberal charter and cargo arrangements. The airlines are allowed to enter freely into open code-sharing arrangements with other carriers (ticketing connecting flights with partner-airlines using the flight number or sharing aircraft). It also includes a pledge for non-discriminatory operation of and access to computer reservation systems. Governments are allowed to interfere in fare-setting only in the case of excessively high or low fares. Under the deal, US carriers will further widen the already liberal rights they have enjoyed in Holland for several years. KLM, 38 per cent owned by the Dutch state, said it was 'extremely pleased' with the accord, which it expects to boost the importance of Amsterdam's Schiphol airport as an international air transport hub. The accord will also allow it to take fuller advantage of its co-operation with Northwest Airlines, in which it holds a 20 per cent stake. The Dutch transport minister, Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen, called it a 'dream treaty'. She said: 'We expect it will bring money to our airlines and believe it will provide an impetus for the further liberalisation of European air transport.'</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: MAI MAI's strong performance in all of its main businesses must reassure any investors concerned about the expensive acquisition of Anglia Television. Money and securities broking continues to push up profits. Meridian, the majority-owned Channel 3 franchise, is ahead of expectations. Information and market research is also doing well. Across the board, the profit increases have been underpinned by strong management and cost controls. With that record, MAI should be relied on to squeeze value from Anglia. Several of Anglia's peripheral holdings may go and the recent disposal of MAI's final holding in Havas shows how profitably it can manage such investments. Despite paying almost Pounds 300m for Anglia, the company retains a virtually ungeared balance sheet. What remains at issue is whether the market will rate MAI as a steady financial broker or a go-go media stock. Next year around 20 per cent of earnings will come from television while 60 per cent may come from broking. Yet it may be a mistake to rate the company too lowly. Broking has consistently grown faster than predicted, and television earnings are highly geared to recovery. There is scope for a pleasant surprise. It is also worth keeping a weather-eye on the pace of MAI's progress. Anglia, an increased stake in SIS racing, interest in Channel 5 and the National Lottery, and a watching brief on Intrum Justitia are plenty for even the most nimble management team to handle.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Portals benefits from cost cuts PORTALS GROUP, the world's largest supplier of banknote paper, reaped the benefits of cutting costs last year to report a 2.7 per cent advance in pre-tax profits for the 12 months to December 31. However, the group warned that any significant advance on 1991 would depend on an international economic recovery. 'We have already done an awful lot,' said Mr John Lloyd, finance director, referring to the cost-cutting, 'and a lot of that we can do only once.' Profits of Pounds 27.6m (Pounds 26.9m) were struck on sales 2.2 per cent higher at Pounds 194.3m, with the bulk of the increase in the paper-making division. Portals, which supplies some 130 countries with banknotes, reported a 21 per cent rise in paper-making profits to Pounds 20m, while margins rose by more than 2 percentage points to 20.5 per cent. In the banknote division alone, said Mr Philip Conway, executive director in charge of paper-making, staff cuts in 1990 had resulted savings of Pounds 1m in 1991. The biggest advance in the paper-making business came from JR Crompton, the tea-bag paper group purchased in 1990, and included for a full 12 months. Mr Conway said Crompton had made a significant improvement on the Pounds 4m operating profit reported in 1990. The success of the paper operations was offset by a more mixed return from the environmental protection and control businesses. Although turnover in this division rose by almost 2 per cent to Pounds 94.2m, operating profits slipped 8.4 per cent to Pounds 7.83m. Airoil-Flaregas, which makes low emission burners for the petrochemical industry, returned a loss for the full year. Houseman, which is dependent on the depressed construction industry through its air and water hygiene businesses, maintained profits, while the computer technology division improved its performance. The loss-making Kay business, which makes gas and water pipe fittings, had been closed at an extraordinary cost of Pounds 990,000. Central operating profits, comprised of property gains offset against overheads, reported a Pounds 2.2m drop to Pounds 234,000. Net debt was cut from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 5.8m, making a gearing level of 6 per cent. The final dividend is raised to 8.8p (8p), making a total of 13.8p (13p). Fully diluted earnings per share rose to 31.42p (30.58p). COMMENT If you are looking for a great recovery stock, Portals is not the one. But for a defensive play, the group cannot be faulted. Even in the deepest recession, the world's tea drinkers will continue to boil kettles, and banknotes will continue to circulate. What growth the group expects as the economy recovers should come from the lower margin environmental businesses; but, by its own admission, the next acquisition is likely to be in specialist paper. This will further strengthen the group's defensive position. Forecasts are for Pounds 29.5m pre-tax, giving a multiple of about 11.6. A stock for tortoises rather than hares.</p>

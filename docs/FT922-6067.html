			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Little sign of revival in house lending THERE IS little sign of a revival in the housing market, according to lending figures produced by the Building Societies Association, Philip Coggan writes. Although evidence from estate agents had suggested that confidence in the housing market had improved since the general election, the April lending figures, which included three post-election weeks, were lower than those for March. Mr Mark Boleat, director general of the Building Societies Association, said: 'The fall back indicates that buyer confidence has not yet been fully restored to the housing market. There is evidence that the general election had a temporary depressing effect on activity.' On the savings side, the building societies had net receipts of Pounds 212m last month, after an outflow of Pounds 172m in March. Mr Boleat said those figures were 'relatively low' for a month that was usually favourable for building societies. The April inflow last year was Pounds 1.337bn. Gross mortgage lending was Pounds 2.988bn, Pounds 133m lower than in March and down from Pounds 3.308bn in April 1991. Net new commitments were Pounds 2.764bn, compared with Pounds 3.456bn in March and Pounds 3.530bn in April 1991. Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at stockbroker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the savings figures were 'terrible', adding that 'it looks as though 1992 is going to be the year for societies to struggle to get retail receipts'. He added that he had evidence to suggest the market had picked up in May.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / China moots threat of early Hong Kong takeover CHINA yesterday raised the political temperature over Hong Kong's political future when it published Deng Xiaoping's hitherto secret instructions to the Chinese leadership on Hong Kong, including the threat to take over the colony before 1997. Publication of Deng's Hong Kong policy comes a week before the foreign ministers of Britain and China meet in New York to review the progress of bilateral talks about the colony's constitutional development. The 12th round of talks starts in Beijing tomorrow. The meeting comes as hopes are fading in Hong Kong for a Sino-British deal. China has failed to respond to a compromise offered by the UK, and Hong Kong government officials say the two may be weeks away from breaking off dialogue unless Beijing relents. Most observers saw the publication of Deng's thoughts in the context of next week's meeting rather than as China's response to losing its bid to host the Olympics in 2000, although China was angered by Britain publicly opposing the award of the Olympics to Beijing. Publication was carefully co-ordinated, suggesting that China planned it before it knew at 2.30am Beijing time that it has lost its bid. Deng's instructions were splashed across the front pages of the main Communist party newspapers throughout China. Hong Kong's two pro-Beijing newspapers also gave them front page treatment. Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, sought to play down the significance of Deng's instructions. He said they predated by two years the Sino-British Joint Declaration 'which guarantees Hong Kong's way of life for 50 years after 1997.' Yesterday was 11 years to the day when Deng met Mrs Thatcher, the former prime minister, to discuss the transfer of the colony to China. His instructions, titled 'Our basic position on the Hong Kong problem', were the record of the conversation he had with her on September 24, 1982. He told Mrs Thatcher that China was interested only in three issues: the question of sovereignty, how China was to administer Hong Kong after 1997, and ways of co-operating with Britain to prevent 'upheavals' in the colony before its return to China. Deng said that in the event of 'serious upheavals' China would make other arrangements for the early recovery of the colony.</p>

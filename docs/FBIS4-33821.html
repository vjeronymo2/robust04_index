			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 11 Jun (EFE) -- The Bolivian Senate today  found Supreme Court Chief Justice Edgar Oblitas and Supreme  Court Dean Ernesto Poppe guilty of the crimes of prevarication  and bribery. Their sentences will be disclosed within the next  few hours.    The Senate held an extraordinary session today to carry out  the legal process which began last year in the Chamber of  Deputies. Oblitas and Poppe were accused of extortion by former  Nicaraguan Deputy Presidency Minister Jose Antonio Ibarra.    The administration of Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de  Lozada supported the decision to bring the Supreme Court  justices to trial in an attempt to prove its political resolve  to fight corruption. The 16 senators in the ruling coalition  formed by the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR) and Civic  Solidarity Unity (UCS) found the two justices "guilty." The  three senators from the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR)  voted in favor of their acquittal, while the seven senators from  the Nationalist Democratic Action (ADN) and Conscience of the  Fatherland (CONDEPA) abstained from participating in the session.    Senate President Juan Carlos Duran from the ruling coalition  declared a recess of approximately two hours to agree on  sentences for Oblitas and Poppe, who were suspended from their  posts shortly after their trial began.    [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 0214 GMT on 12 June transmits a  150-word report that Juan Carlos Duran, president of the Grand  Jury of Bolivian Senators, decided today to postpone the  sentencing of Supreme Court Chief Justice Edgar Oblitas and  Supreme Court Dean Ernesto Poppe until Monday morning].</p>

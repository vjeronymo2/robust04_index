			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Concert party that led to crash IN THE winter of 1979-80, the Takeover Panel decided that St Piran, a Cornish tin mining company, was controlled by a concert party of companies run by Mr Jim Raper, chairman of the Gasco conglomerate. It ordered him to bid for the remaining 8m-plus shares at 85p each. Mr Raper could not raise the money, and the company's shares were suspended in May 1980. In April 1981, Mr Raper borrowed Pounds 3m from Savings and Investment Bank for 12 months to buy St Piran. Gasco had agreed to buy nearly 1.2m St Piran shares at 50p, conditional upon a similar offer being made to all other shareholders. Mr Raper beat off a 60p a share counter-offer from Burmah Mines, promising to match it. By October 1981, the bank gave Gasco a revised loan and overdraft facility totalling Pounds 5m, secured on St Piran's share capital. Mr Raper believed he had until September 1982 to repay the amended loan; but the bank thought that the original date of April still applied. Mr Raper did not know that the bank had been insolvent since the previous April. Like Mr Raper, Mr Victor Gray, the bank's owner, believed St Piran would be worth between Pounds 16m and Pounds 20m if its shares could be reactivated, and he had found a likely buyer. In December 1981, Gasco defaulted on interest payments and asked to reschedule the loan. The bank demanded that Gasco repay the outstanding loan and interest. Mr Raper refused, and in March 1982 the bank obtained an injunction from the English High Court preventing Gasco removing Pounds 7m of assets from the court's jurisdiction. Mr Raper failed to pay up. Early in June, Mr Gray told him he wanted the St Piran shares but Mr Raper issued a press statement that he was suing the bank for Pounds 12m for breach of the loan agree-ment. That started a run on the bank, which soon crashed, unable to repay Pounds 42m of depositors' funds.</p>

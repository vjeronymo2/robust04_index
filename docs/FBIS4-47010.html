			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Alisov, ADS (expansion not identified): </F> "Draft Budget `Clearly Not Within Russia's Powers' Institute of  Economics of Problems of the Transition Period Experts Assert  That Expenditures Require Revenues"]    [Text] While State Duma deputies are discussing the draft  of the state budget for 1994, its deficit continues its usual  threatening tendency to rise. "And we do not see a tendency  toward reduction of state expenditures, which is clearly not  within Russia's power," stated the deputy director of the  Institute of Economics of Problems of the Transition Period  [IEPTP], Sergey Sinelnikov, at an international conference  organized by the IEPTP.    Thus, while in 1993, according to the institute's estimates,  the deficit amounted to 10 percent of the GNP, during the first  quarter of this year, it was 11 percent. And the budget  continues to be in debt to a number of spheres and branches of  the economy. In turn, this debt returns like a boomerang as  nonpayments from enterprises not only to one another and the  banks but also to the budget itself. The real amount of the  value-added tax is decreasing. Taxes are devalued by inflation,  which was conditioned, in the words of IEPTP Director Yegor  Gaydar, by the 8-percent growth of the money supply in April. In  the future, because of the issuance of money, inflation is  expected to be at a monthly level of 12-15 percent. In such  conditions, the resolve of the Central Bank to normalize the  credit sphere by reducing the rate for refinancing, which in  recent weeks has decreased by 5 percent, remains only a good  intention. Rejection of the policy of monetarism, in the opinion  of IEPTP specialists promises nothing good. In the opinion of  institute experts, if the government had paid of state debts,  the budget deficit would have been twice as great at the end of  1993 and would have reached 20-22 percent of the GNP. But,  covering it with credit emission from the Central Bank would  only exacerbate inflation, which in any case is apparently  approaching the limit of social tolerance.    Viktor Chernomyrdin's government, participants in the  conference noted, during the first quarter did not refrain from  decisions that generated further expectations of inflation.  Fulfilling the commitments made by the cabinet for last year  alone would require funds in the amount of 1.5 times the GNP.  Obviously, this cannot be done merely by increasing the revenue  side of the budget. But, there has been a clear tendency toward  its reduction since last summer. Thus, while in 1992 the  revenues amounted to about 16 percent of the GNP and, during the  first half of 1993, 13 percent, in the second half it was only 7  percent. The average annual volume of budget revenues thus  amounted to 10 percent and, taking into account centralized  exports, 13-14 percent of the GNP. During the first quarter of  this year, this indicator dropped to 8.1 percent and for the  past four months, to 7.1 percent. The reduction of revenues is  exacerbated by the decline of prices on the world market for  oil, aluminum, and other exported kinds of raw material and  products. The 1994 draft budget envisions incomes of 16.5-16.7  percent of the GNP. But, in the opinion of IEPTP experts, one  can realistically count on only 9-11 percent.    At the same time, the planned budget expenditures remain at  last year's level, 25 percent of the GNP. Groups representing  the interests of the military-industrial complex, the coal  miners, the agrarians, and others are lobbying in the State Duma  for increasing budget expenditures. Under their pressure it is  possible to keep the budget deficit within reasonable limits  only by reducing other expenditure items--on the social sphere,  science, education, and public health.    In the investment policy, in the opinion of IEPTP  specialists, it is necessary to take a selective approach.  Today, when 5,000 out of 22,000 large enterprises are standing  idle, 58 percent of the capacities of industry are operating at  a loss and are not eligible for investment support. Investments  are actually needed for structural rearrangement of the economy.  But the financial resources are not adequate for that either.  Gaydar experts think that there is reason to hope for help from  abroad, in particular since during the next few days in Moscow  there will be negotiations between the Central Bank of Russia  and the Ministry of Finance and the IMF mission concerning  Russia's receiving $4 billion in credits this autumn. As was  reported at the international conference in the IEPTP, a meeting  of the government presidium regarding the creation of a  consultative council on foreign investment under the prime  minister is earmarked for the beginning of June. It is  anticipated that it will meet twice a year--alternately in  Moscow and London.</p>

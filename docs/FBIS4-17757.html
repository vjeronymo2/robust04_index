			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- During my travels  through Yakutia I was convinced many times that the main wealth  of your harsh land lay not in diamonds or gold, but in your  inhabitants. This was stated in greetings from Russian President  Boris Yeltsin to those taking part in the Assembly of Peoples of  the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The once backward, distant,  northern outpost of Russia was transformed by the persistent and  concerted hard work of the Yakuts, Russians, and other peoples  of Yakutia.    Today, under the difficult conditions of the transition  period, economic progress and political stability in the  republic depend to a great extent on prosperity in the ethnic  relations sphere. Success may be achieved only by overcoming  territorial and national egoism and by demonstrating self  possession, calm, mutual respect, and responsibility for the  fate of our united fatherland -- the Russian Federation.    Much has already been done toward creating conditions where  there is a genuine equality of rights for the development of all  of the peoples of Yakutia, the greetings state. Even more needs  to be done. The small northern peoples -- the Evens, Evenkis,  and Yukagirs demand particular concern from the republican  authorities.    The president congratulated the multi-ethnic people of  Yakutia on their Day of the Republic.</p>

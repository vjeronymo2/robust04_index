			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan by Salah </F> al-'Abd in Baghdad; date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-'Abd] We are holding this  interview amid the unjust economic embargo imposed on Iraq.  This makes it the first topic in this interview. What new  methods are there to confront the blockade against our people at  this stage, particularly if it continues for a long time? Is  there any new concept for confrontation on the local, Arab, and  international levels?    [Ramadan] Much has been said about the blockade from the day  it was imposed on Iraq before the military aggression. The way  this blockade was implemented and applied and the way it was  followed up demonstrates the intentions of the powers that  imposed it. Today it is more obvious than was the case two  years ago; more obvious than was the case on the first day that  imposing and following up the blockade had nothing to do with  what they claimed; namely, the issue of Kuwait.    When we view the details and nature of the dealing between  the American United Nations and Iraq, it becomes clear that the  imposition of the blockade was aimed at stopping the stage of  Iraq's awakening which forms the beginning of the Arab nation's  awakening. Had Iraq's stand been confined to the Iraqi region,  the proportion of dealing with it would not have been on that  level of bestiality. However, they are aware that any awakening  in Iraq will serve the Arab nation no matter how they deepen  differences and expand boundaries and parochialism. The Arabs  will certainly reject this because they believe that whatever  happens in Iraq reflects on them positively or negatively. The  Arabs have expressed this in many meetings and activities in  Iraq and the Arab world despite the pressures put on them by  certain governments and regimes. These stands have vividly  demonstrated that our Arab nation is one, that our Arab people  are one people with the same fate, that the blockade's aims are  now clear; namely, they are not linked to Kuwait.    The blockade is a struggle between the nation's awakening in  confronting its enemies on the one hand and those who have  vested interests in continuing hegemony over and exploiting its  capabilities and various resources on the other. Therefore, it  is the duty of each Iraqi and Arab to confront this condition.  The Iraqi leadership, especially President leader Saddam  Husayn, has never been under any illusion that the blockade  would be lifted when the enemy slogan, which they had claimed  was the cause of their action, disappeared.    The blockade will erode and wither away by building the  society's own resources and will be completely lifted when the  criminal enemies realize that it is impossible to achieve the  aims for which they imposed this blockade on Iraq.    Any observer of Iraq's march, particularly after the  cease-fire will clearly see that the progress achieved in Iraq  was an expression of the slogan of building self-reliance  leading to the blockade's erosion. A great deal has been  achieved in the field of returning life to normal and building  the pillars of renaissance in terms of quantity, quality, and  originality. The efforts that were exerted cannot be compared  with those exerted in various stages of building in the past,  despite the fact that we had enormous material resources then.    The result of this is that the international position toward  Iraq is not as unanimous as it was three or two years ago --  despite the fact that you still hear statements about blockade  made in different accents, you no longer hear the single voice.  Why? It is not because these parties are now feeling guilty  about their previous positions on Iraq. It is because the  Iraqis rose to the level of the battle and these parties  realized that they will definitely not gain even the minimum  amount of the benefits they thought they could gain from the  blockade.    The states that have helped, and are helping, drag out the  blockade will be sorry because they have lost a great deal of  their interests with Iraq. This is not just an interpretation,  but a fact. So many of these states have begun to speak  publicly about their material and economic losses that resulted  from the blockade imposed on Iraq. Why has this happened? If  Iraq disintegrated or collapsed or if a foreign power was  imposed on it, we would not have heard what we are hearing in  various countries of the world. This contradiction will grow  further in the future and will undoubtedly lead to the  deterioration of the blockade, leaving in disgrace every one  that contributed to it, regardless of the motives and reasons of  this or that country.    As for the confrontation on the local, Arab, and world  front,  changes are interconnected. Any development in Iraq's power,  responsibilities, and ability to stand fast will reflect on the  Arab and international levels.    We say that 1994 is an important year and not like any other  year of the blockade. The Mother of Battles has produced  several facts and exposed the reasons and objectives of the  blockade, as well as the enemy intentions. What Iraq has  offered to the United Nations and its cooperation with it have  deprived the real conspirators and those who were dragged by  them of many cards. This is especially the case following the  Iraqi position toward Resolution 715. We tell the United  Nations and any other international party that they are  responsible for the continued blockade. There is no  justification for maintaining it, even from the viewpoint of the  United Nations, now that Iraq has abided by all resolutions.    We absolutely confident that the Iraqi people will emerge  triumphant. All nations will acknowledge the Iraqi people's  contribution, strength, patience, and sacrifices. The Iraqi  people have made great sacrifices to uphold the principles of  justice, right, humanity, freedom, and independence. [passage  omitted]    [Al-'Abd] What can you tell us about Iraqi-UN talks on  resuming Iraqi oil exports?    [Ramadan] We do not view the lifting of the embargo through  the resumption of oil exports as line with the UN formula. The  UN formula is another form of the embargo against Iraq and the  psychological harm done to the citizens. Yes, we want the  embargo lifted and we want to resume oil exports, but without  this infringing on our national independence and sovereignty.  We want Iraq to sell and buy without any intervention from  other powers. As for the current formula proposed by the United  Nations for the resumption of oil exports, it is not acceptable,  in view of its flagrant interference with sovereignty. We are  confident that all the unjust formulas proposed by them under  various covers -- which have been used as an umbrella to  perpetuate the embargo and prevent Iraq from exporting its oil  -- are now over. Therefore, they should now seriously consider  lifting the Iraq embargo and allowing Iraq to export its oil.    [Al-'Abd] Are you optimistic about ending the embargo and a  return of the economic conditions in Iraq to normal?    [Ramadan] I am optimistic that the embargo will end through  the Iraqis' patience, resolve, and efforts to return life to  normal, without being beholden to anybody else. This is the  peak of pride for every Iraqi. In the year 1994, we should make  more efforts than we did in the previous years of the embargo in  the field of development, politics, spreading awareness, and  mobilization, benefiting from the experience of past years. We  will not begin from square one. We have a good background and a  good experience by virtue of three years of hard work, day and  night.    Yes, this should be our point of departure. And this will  impose the willpower of the Iraqis and the good-intentioned from  the sons of this nation on the enemies and criminals, primarily  America and Zionism.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 31 December (MTI) -- Hungarian defense  spending has dropped by almost half in real terms since 1989,  with its share in the gross domestic product [GDP] down from 2.5  percent to 1.88 percent, a recent publication entitled HONVEDSEG  '93 (Home Defence '93) reveals. The Hungarian Army consists of  exactly 100,000 people at the end of 1993. Of these, 13,700 are  officers, 8,500 other ranks, 52,340 private soldiers, and 25,660  civil employees. Three years ago the number of people employed  by the defense forces totalled 143,200. The Army currently has  1,229 tanks, 1,296 armored vehicles, 1,023 pieces of artillery,  171 fighters, and 39 attack helicopters. (The air defense units  come under Army control in Hungary.)    Tanks numbers have been reduced by over 100 in the year,  with  armored vehicles numbers down by more than 400. Currently only  the number of tanks exceeds the limit fixed at 835 by  international agreements. As the defense budget has been  decreasing in real terms for several years, there is an ever  tighter rein on money for development, which represented 19  percent of all spending in 1990, but a mere 7.6 percent this  year. The defense forces consider 30-40 percent budgeted for  development would be ideal.</p>

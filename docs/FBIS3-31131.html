			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Does Zhelev Keep Silent About Brigo's </F> Warnings?"]    [Text] President Zhelev must immediately convene the state  figures responsible for our national security.    Why are he and the deputies keeping silent when intelligence  expert Brigo Asparukhov warned that the air strikes against  Bosnia augur the greatest danger Bulgaria faced in the last 50  years? Is it really a consolation that the Defense Ministry has  a different opinion?    If the general is right our diplomats must oppose the  bombings by any means, and not merely call upon the Balkan  countries to refrain from interfering in the Yugoslav war.    We all know that Ankara is demanding a corridor through  Bulgaria in order to make its strikes more powerful. One should  not be concerned about whether, by some mistake, those doing the  bombing or those being bombed also strike Bulgaria.    Such a danger always exists when air strikes are inflicted.  However, this is the first time that one who should know about  the plans of others warns publicly about the danger that exists.    If Zhelev believes the intelligence chief, who is his  subordinate, then he must immediately assume his role as supreme  commander in chief.</p>

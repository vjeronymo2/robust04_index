			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN  </P> <P> Basket Case  </P> <P> Tom Hanks, Steve Bochco, John Candy, Don Henley and Michael Keaton are all  giving the same holiday present this year -- gift baskets. Tinseltowners are  flocking to Marmalade, the 5-week-old shop in Santa Monica that assembles  custom-tailored baskets for an average price of $100. Shoppers also can order  intricately designed tins or brocade stockings filled with everything from  chutney, jam and tea to pate, cheese, creole sauces and breads and more.  Porcelain fish, farm animals (all sizes), and carved dolls produced by cottage  industries can be added, for a price.  </P> <P> DO THEY GIFT WRAP? Last week, Heather Locklear took advantage of the promise of  delivery before Christmas at Kreiss Collection in West Hollywood. She chose  custom furniture right off the floor, to fill every room in the nest she shares  with hubby, Tommy Lee of Motley Crue fame.  </P> <P> WHAT A CARD: What's gold-colored plastic, fits in your wallet and gets flashed  a lot in Beverly Hills? The recently issued city gold card, of course. But  don't expect it to get you very far at Gucci. It's a bar-coded library card  used in the new automated book checkout system. In an amusing bit of reverse  snobbery, the children's cards are platinum.  </P> <P> HOW GOOD IS YOUR CREDIT? Looking for something sparkly to put under the  Christmas tree? Considered a tiara? There are very few available in the world,  but one is at Fred in Beverly Hills. Sure, it's pricey at $2,205,000 but it has  a 137-carat emerald centerpiece and comes with a matching necklace that boasts  50 carats of diamonds. At the more affordable end of the wish list, Listen has  also noticed the hottest rings of the season, which double as watches, sell for  a mere $23. The tiny timepieces by Digits are modeled after some famous status  watches by Cartier, Rolex and the like. Hecht's in Washington, D.C., held the  record for sales, 500 in one day, until Robinson's put them on the shelves in  their Los Angeles-area stores. Two thousand were snatched up in a day and a  half.  </P> <P> PHOTO OP: When baby Paulina, daughter of Wayne Gretzky and Janet Jones, got her  first haircut she was taken to Cowlicks, the Calabasas children's hair salon  where the management videotapes the event. Salon spokeswoman Jane Baker says  some children are so taken with their snip scenes they bring their tapes back  time and again to record their entire haircut history. The price for a shampoo,  cut, blow dry and video documentation is $19 for girls, $17 for boys.  </P> <P> COMPETITIVE EDGE: There is a new kind of golf wear on the market designed to  improve your game via sports psychology. The design of the clothing uses color  and graphic motifs to reinforce attitudes that have been identified with  improving performance. One shirt, in a soft purple with a geometric pattern, is  to remind a player to stay focused. A red and black shirt with angular graphics  stimulates aggressiveness. The psych-out shirts, called Mindset, will be  available in the spring.  </P> <P> WHEREFORE ART THOU: Romeo Gigli's New York "image director," Ellen Carey, was  at I. Magnin over the weekend for the opening of Magnin's new Gigli boutique.  She had a few choice observations about East Coast versus West Coast style.  "They wear more color here," she noted, explaining that Magnin stocked up on  marigold-color Gigli outfits while the free-standing Gigli boutique in New York  carries more subtle shades of eggplant. And, of course, "People in L.A. are  much more body-conscious. They wear all-Lycra Gigli outfits. In New York they'd  cover Lycra leggings with a long, silk top."  </P></p>

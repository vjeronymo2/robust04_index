			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS;  </P> <P> EXPERIENCING L.A. FEST  </P> <P> The L.A. Festival is an idea who time has come. And gone. As enjoyable as the  last three festivals have been, the basic formula simply has too many  shortcomings to serve a city as diverse as L.A.  </P> <P> The festival attempts to cram a seemingly infinite number of events into a  two-week period.  </P> <P> Anyone interested in attending more than one or two performances has to drop  everything else. Events generally have runs of just a few days. By the time the  reviews appear or the word of mouth gets around, the performers have packed  their bags. The festival's grand scale creates a logistic nightmare that makes  it impossible to bring the festival off more than once every few years -- not  enough to build the sort of momentum needed to develop audiences.  </P> <P> I'm not suggesting the festival be abolished. I'm questioning whether there  isn't some way to transform it into something that presents outstanding  international dance and theater for longer runs on an ongoing basis. Imagine a  theater complex in which, on any given night you might choose among three or  four theater companies from around the globe. Creating this "Los Angeles  Festival Theater" is not as far-fetched as it sounds -- at least not if the  same public and private backers of past festivals were willing to refocus their  commitments.  </P> <P> Los Angeles needs a theater district. A Festival Theater would would draw the  crowds at first; other theaters, featuring local companies would help bring  them back. Audiences would benefit, and so would local theater companies, who  charge that the festivals until now have hurt rather than helped their  business.  </P> <P> WILLIAM HACKFORD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

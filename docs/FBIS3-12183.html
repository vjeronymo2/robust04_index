			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Environment Minister Yosi Sarid by </F> Uri Paz and Ya'el Dan on 28 February; place not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Paz] Earlier this morning, we spoke with Minister  Yosi Sarid and asked for his reaction to the suspension of the  peace negotiations with the Arab delegations in Washington.    [Sarid] Clearly I was sad to learn last night of the  decision to break off the Washington talks. I regret the  decision but I cannot say that I was surprised. Already last  Friday [25 February], the day of the massacre, it was obvious  that such an event could not simply pass without leaving its  mark on the talks. It was hard to imagine that it would just  continue to be business as usual. Nevertheless, the fact that  the talks are being halted is cause for a great deal of sorrow,  frustration, and disappointment because, as has already been  noted, the desire of this evil man, this Jekyll and Hyde, was to  stop the talks and this is indeed happening. There is nothing  worse than granting murderers what they want.    [Paz] In your opinion, can we talk about long-term damage to  the peace process this morning?    [Sarid] I very much hope not. I therefore appeal to the  Palestinian leadership to consider this period merely as a short  time out, which will be followed by an immediate resumption of  the negotiations.    [Dan] What will bring them back to the negotiating table?    [Sarid] Look, I do not demand anything of the Palestinian  leadership that we have not already demanded of ourselves. The  Israeli leadership has also faced extremely difficult challenges  in recent weeks. There have been many terrorist attacks since  13 September, and we vividly remember each and every one of  them. The familiar voices calling for a halt in the  negotiations and the abandonment of the peace process were heard  in Israel. Some new voices even joined in the chorus. We  rejected these demands. It was difficult and painful. We had  to clench our fists and bite our lips, but we nevertheless  proceeded, and, I might say, even stuck to the peace process  with more conviction and resoluteness. Now it is the turn of  the Palestinian leadership to follow the example set by their  Israeli counterparts. Our Palestinian colleagues are going  through a tough period. I realize that these are difficult days  and that they are very upset. This is certainly understandable  and we will wait several days in the hope and faith that we will  all return to Washington next week to continue talking because  we have no other alternative.    [Paz] Minister Sarid, one more question. Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin said that Israel would make no additional  concessions to the PLO in order to bring them back to the  negotiating table. Is refusing to make any further concessions  indeed the correct approach? Perhaps we should make some  concessions to demonstrate our goodwill and improve the  atmosphere?    [Sarid] I have two things to say to that. One, I think that  yesterday's cabinet decisions provide a good basis for the  continuation of the negotiations. These very important and  unprecedented decisions in my opinion indicate the government's  readiness and commitment to confront the radical elements in  Israel, control and restrain their activities, and if necessary  even totally suppress them. That is one thing. Second, I would  like to issue a warning about reopening understandings. Now  they want to reopen the agreement because of what happened in  Hebron. Tomorrow, God forbid, there may be another terrorist  attack and this or that party will make additional demands to  reopen and change things. There will be no end to this and the  agreement will totally disintegrate. An agreement is not a  zipper that one opens and closes at will.    [Dan] But what will bring the Arab delegations back to the  talks?    [Sarid] A sense of responsibility and the lack of other  alternatives.    [Dan] Thank you very much, Minister Yosi Sarid.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 16 May (AFP) -- A Campaign for Democracy [CD]  official told AFP today that the organization has prepared a  three-day program to commemorate the first anniversary of the  June 12 presidential election that was annulled by the former  military regime. The CD is made up of about 40 pro-democratic  and human rights movements.    The 12 June election, which Yoruba billionaire Moshood  Abiola  claims to have won, was annulled by General Ibrahim Babangida's  regime on the grounds that there were irregularities.    The organization's secretary general, Sylvester  Odion-Akhaine, said the CD is calling on Nigerians to wear black  badges during the three days of commemoration as a sign of  mourning in memory of those who died last year "in the name of  democracy." The commemoration period will also be used to  protest the return of the military to power following the  cancellation of the election. Last year the CD said it favored  the installation of Moshood Abiola as president.    Mr. Akhaine further said his organization supported the aims  and aspirations of the National Democratic Coalition [NADECO], a  new pro-democratic organization which was established in Lagos  on 13 May. NADECO has given General Sani Abacha up until 31 May  to hand over the task of forming a broad-based government to  Moshood Abiola.</p>

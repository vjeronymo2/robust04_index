			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the prees review] </F>   [Text] SUARA KARYA says the decision of Philippine  President Fidel Ramos to bar foreigners from attending a  conference on East Timor, which is scheduled to be held at the  end of this month, has greatly appeased the Indonesian people.  The daily, however, adds that the decision has not completely  resolved the matter. If the conference does take place even  without foreign participants, this will create an impression  that the University of the Philippines as an academic  institution has allowed itself to be reduced to a forum to  conduct political campaigns, which may in turn trigger an  international problem. Not a few of the Indonesian alumni of  the University of the Philippines have contributed to efforts to  enhance the bonds of friendship between the two nations and  peoples.    KOMPAS says the decision showed the courageous leadership of  President Ramos because the Philippine president has put his  popularity at risk. Ramos is convinced that national interests  supersede the interests of a few of his fellow countrymen.  According to the daily, Ramos is well aware that the decision  was something unusual under the Philippines' democratic  political culture which accords wide freedom to such  institutions like campuses to discuss anything, including one  critical of the government. Nevertheless, President Ramos as a  leader wisely anticipated a greater controversy if he had done  nothing to downplay the planned conference on East Timor.    The daily BERITA BUANA says the Philippine Government should  be aware of Indonesia's stand on East Timor. Even if the  conference on East Timor does take place in the Philippines, the  Philippine Government will have to actively offer a clear and  detailed explanation on Indonesia's stand, the essence of which  is that East Timor has become the 27th province of the Republic  of Indonesia. The Philippines should at least dismiss the  results of the conference on East Timor and prevent them from  misleading public opinion.</p>

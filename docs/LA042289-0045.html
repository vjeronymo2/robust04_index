			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRO-CHOICE BACKERS MARCH FOR RECRUITS  </P> <P> About 40 women chanting "Pro! Choice!" threaded through Westwood Village on  Friday evening, looking to recruit supporters for a face-off with another  Operation Rescue blockade of abortion clinics set for April 29 throughout the  Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> "This is a pro-choice town," said Julie Schollenberger, a founding member of  Fired Up for Choice, which was organized in the wake of Operation Rescue  demonstrations and in anticipation of the pending U.S. Supreme Court decision  on whether to limit abortion laws.  </P> <P> Schollenberger said Friday night that diners, shoppers and movie-goers "would  wave at us, join in our chant" and drivers honked their horns as the group  walked through the village for about 90 minutes.  </P> <P> They handed out flyers asking for volunteers to join them in countering the  anti-abortion Operation Rescue at April 29 sit-ins at Southland clinics. A  three-day March campaign resulted in the misdemeanor arrests of more than 1,000  anti-abortion advocates.  </P> <P> Schollenberger said police ticketed one marcher for jaywalking Friday evening  and warned the group to keep an orderly line on the sidewalks.  </P></p>

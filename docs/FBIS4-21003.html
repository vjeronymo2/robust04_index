			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M.R. and M.A.: "Will the Cannabis War Take </F> Place?"]    [Text] One year after King Hassan II's announcement that he  wanted to eradicate cannabis growing in northern Morocco and the  decision to spend 20 billion dirhams [DH] (1 dirham = 0.6 French  franc) over five years to help the planters convert to other  crops, skepticism and caution are still the order of the day.    Even within the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, voices can  be heard denouncing a program "doomed to failure before it even  begins," according to one agronomist. He adds: "There is  currently no alternative to cannabis growing."    The EC, which is primarily where Morocco turned in February  1993 to request a financial contribution equal to the amount  being allocated by the kingdom, is still dragging its feet. The  modest sum of DH125 million that was appropriated last December  to finance jobs, modernize agriculture, and improve health in  the region in question is far less than Moroccan authorities  expected.    The Twelve [the EC], concerned in particular about the  trafficking in cannabis resin (Europeans consume 30 percent of  the some 700 metric tons of hashish produced every year), are  frightened by the size of the sums at stake. "Twelve billion  francs represents one-tenth of our annual development effort," a  Commission spokesman emphasized.    That cautious attitude exasperates the Moroccans. When he  announced his eradication plan, Hassan II denounced "those  international middlemen and traffickers who peddle cannabis  resin and oil in Europe and make 50 times more profit than the  peasants growing that crop."    The fact is that the consuming countries bear a great  responsibility for the trafficking in question. The very rapid  expansion in cannabis acreage over the past 10 years or so is  largely due to the consuming frenzy of the Europeans, who are  encouraged by more or less permissive legislation in their own  countries.    In the 1970's, many pushers rushed to the Rif mountains,  where growing and consuming Indian hemp was a centuries-old  tradition. The peasants, hard hit by drought and severe soil  erosion--2 percent of the soil washes into the Mediterranean  every year--found cannabis an easy solution to their problems.  The inevitable consequence was that the area planted in cannabis  went from 6,000 to 50,000 hectares in 15 years! The crop was  confined to the Ketama region at first, but now it stretches for  more than 150 km between Tetouan and Al Hoceima. It is a real  industry and one that pays off big: the annual turnover exceeds  DH20 billion--the same as the budget earmarked for the five-year  eradication plan. This hidden sector is as important to the  Moroccan economy as earnings from emigrants. The money, which is  often reinvested in real estate, generally in Spain, also  benefits big Moroccan traffickers. The rising power of tightly  structured gangs is a considerable hindrance to the Moroccan  Government, which is in the midst of negotiating a partnership  agreement with the European Union and cannot allow mafia-like  practices to develop in its territory on a large scale.    Combined with that desire for "honorability" abroad is the  need at home to combat a traffic that not only increases  corruption among officials but also hastens the emergence of a  new social class consisting of farmers enriched by cannabis and  increases the risk of secession by a region traditionally  jealous of its independence. As far back as the latest municipal  elections (in 1992), nearly 440 candidates linked to the drug  traffic--and more interested in a legal cover for their criminal  activity than in the affairs of their municipalities--had to be  stricken from the ballot. Others managed to get elected thanks  to blackmail, bribery, or physical violence.    It was in that context that the King banged the table with  his fist and began a wrestling match with the traffickers. Since  then, a real quarantine line has been set up around the  production area, and police checks have been stepped up.    "The roads to Tangier and Casablanca are being increasingly  guarded," says one Ketama resident.    That repressive action, undertaken largely at the behest of  the Europeans, who have made it "an indispensable condition for  the success of the program," is beginning to worry all those in  the Rif who are dependent in one way or another on drug money.    The fact is that the ambitious program to develop the North  is not very attractive to the some 200,000 cannabis growers. It  calls for replacing kif with appropriate crops such as fruit,  almonds, and figs, opening up a region where some villages are  accessible only by donkey, and providing sizable infrastructure  (roads, drinking water supply, electrification, and so on).    "It will take a long time to combat this scourge because  cannabis is very profitable," says Hamid, a stockraiser faced  with the slow disappearance of grazing land as the inevitable  consequence of deforestation linked to the illegal growing of  kif. Other farmers do not hesitate to say that "the authorities  close their eyes" to the trafficking. According to the  Geopolitical Drug Observatory (OGD), it is publicly rumored that  the highest state authorities have benefited from the traffic.    Another problem to be solved is this: a planter who grows  cannabis can hope to earn DH30,000 (18,400 French francs) per  hectare annually, or 10 times what he would earn by growing  almonds.    Among the small-time pushers who make the trip from  Casablanca to Ketama every month to buy hashish despite the  increasing risks, no one believes that cannabis growing can be  stopped. "It supports too many families, and the peasants are  often in debt to the big traffickers," says Rahal, who is one of  those pushers. Another problem in this mountainous area is that  of achieving participation by the local population, which is  historically resistant to any "interference" by the central  government. All the more, says one academic in the capital,  since "the authorities all too often confuse participation with  political control." Other development programs for these  northern provinces were launched by the FAO [UN Food and  Agriculture Organization] and the World Bank in the 1980's, and  they were a complete failure. But this eradication program is  still the first of its scope in the world. Unlike the program in  Mexico, it is not limited to the destruction of drug plantations  by napalm with no regard for the farmers' future. It is true  that keeping the inhabitants in the Rif and improving their  standard of living by licit means is essential to avoid an  inordinate increase in the rural exodus and emigration. Most of  the Moroccan immigrants in Europe are from this deprived area.    Denounced by the kingdom's media and lacking an ambitious  financial aid policy, the Twelve, "with their logic of the  lowest cost," might very well find themselves faced with the  following dilemma: more hashish available for European consumers  or more immigrants. In either case, the limits of repressive  measures have been revealed.</p>

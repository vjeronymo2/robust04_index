			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORDER CURBING ABORTION PROTEST ACTIONS EXTENDED  </P> <P> A federal judge on Monday indefinitely extended an order forbidding  anti-abortion forces to block entrances to California women's health clinics  targeted for major demonstrations, including a Los Angeles-area protest  scheduled next week.  </P> <P> But an organizer for Operation Rescue, the group behind the demonstrations,  said the order will not change his plans.  </P> <P> "What the judge just said is that it's still illegal to save a baby's life in  this country," said Joseph Foreman, the group's national field director. "I  will not proceed any differently than I have in the past when babies are going  to be murdered."  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima granted a request by the  American Civil Liberties Union for a preliminary injunction barring Operation  Rescue from bodily blocking entrances to clinics that perform abortions.  </P> <P> The injunction also prohibits demonstrating closer than 15 feet from clinic  entrances and exits.  </P> <P> The terms mirror those of a temporary restraining order granted March 3 by  another judge, which was due to expire Monday.  </P> <P> Tashima said he would not, however, direct the Los Angeles Police Department to  enforce his order.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said the department is "not empowered nor  obligated to enforce a federal order, unless we are specifically mentioned" but  added that city law provides for passage to and from private property and  unobstructed conduct of business.  </P> <P> "We intend to enforce the law," Booth said.  </P> <P> Tashima's order remains in force until the trial of a class-action lawsuit by  the ACLU. No date has been set for the proceeding.  </P> <P> Police have made more than 7,000 arrests over the last year during  anti-abortion demonstrations, in which some protesters chained themselves and  large objects, including cars, to the doors of clinics.  </P> <P> On Saturday, despite the March 2 order, nearly 200 protesters were arrested at  clinics in Chico, Fresno and Oakland. Similar demonstrations are expected in  San Diego this weekend, before a "holy week of rescue" in Los Angeles, March  22-25.  </P></p>

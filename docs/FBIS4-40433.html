			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Petro Talanchuk, </F> Ukraine's education minister, by A. Polishchuk: "The Ukrainian  People Must Wake Up"]    [Excerpt] Petro Talanchuk is a man well known in Ukraine  as the rector of the Kiev Engineering College, deputy of the  former Soviet Supreme Council, and current minister of  education. He won public recognition and popularity during the  late 1980's perestroyka. Elected to the USSR Supreme Soviet,  Talanchuk assumed a clear democratic standpoint and supported  sovereignty and independence of our then Soviet Republic. Soon  afterward, he actively espoused revival of the Ukrainian  national democratic movement. Having become the minister of  education, he has proved to be an energetic leader with a  comprehensive program for reforming the educational system. He  is 56 years old; an engineer, doctor of technical sciences and  professor, and the president of the Academy of Engineering  Sciences of Ukraine. He has three children and four  grandchildren. Professor Talanchuk is a well-educated man with  broad views and willpower. He has his own way of seeing our  country's way out of the current crisis. His earnest smile and  peasant-like sturdy figure call forth sympathy. Such people are  described "as strong as a wall." Would Ukraine survive if it  leaned on him? Consider this for yourself.    [Polishchuk] By European and world standards, Ukraine is a  large state. It is a prestigious and responsible matter to be  its president. We are going to the polls, but we do not yet  know who will be leading the state -- the president, the  parliament, or the government. Their powers are not  constitutionally defined. Petro Mykhaylovych, what do you think  is the optimum way to resolve this problem?    [Talanchuk] Today, the most precious thing for us is time,  and we must not waste it. Elections must be held, and the man  who is elected will actually encounter misunderstandings. I  would like to believe that, no matter who becomes the president,  he will manage to come to terms with the Supreme Council, and to  constructively resolve these problems, to resolve them quickly,  because we no longer stand in one place -- we have started to  fall down. Just as we need air, we need to step up reforms. I  believe that we can do it best with a presidential form of  administration.    [Polishchuk] You are talking about stepping up reforms. As  a matter of fact, all we have is an economic decline, as in a  tunnel, in which one can see no light. Why in Poland or the  Baltics the reforms are moving forward, but we seem to be  hampered? Is this our Ukrainian peculiarity -- "the inability  to build a state"?    [Talanchuk] This is a difficult question. As you know,  Dovzhenko [famous Ukrainian film director and writer] said:  "Regarding great causes, we are nasty people." As I understand  it, he had in mind our national consciousness. This is quite  objective. Why is that so?    Each society develops successfully if it has even a narrow  layer of innovative people. These are people who think  unconventionally, unusual personalities. They can be found in  the rural areas, among the workers, engineers, and the  intelligentsia.    Let us recall our history. The majority of talented people  were persecuted and exterminated. What impact did the 1933  famine and the 1941-45 war have on the Ukrainian people? I read  in LITERATURNA UKRAYINA about writers who were tortured to death  and I think: "Good Lord, how many!" Our national elite was  systematically exterminated.    While I was arguing with Americans over our difficulties,  and  I saw them swagger around, I told them: "I would like to see  how your country would have looked if someone had done to you  what was done to us." This argument baffled them.    Nevertheless, the Ukrainian people must wake up. We have  wise people, and together, we are able to develop any  socioeconomic model. If we agree, we will only have to act,  implement, and not panic. This is a paradox: God gave us good  crops last year, we harvested them, and now... we are talking  about famine. Can anybody think of anything more horrible?    [Polishchuk] Petro Mykhaylovych, how do you see the  mechanism for market reforms in line with the social, though  illusive, guarantees, to which we were accustomed to under the  Soviet authorities?    [Talanchuk] Currently, although it is impossible to draw a  complete picture of our future state, I can see its outlines.  There will be a mix of both planned and market economies,  because if someone claims that he will jump into the market  economy tomorrow, I do not believe him. This is unrealistic.  The level of our people's culture is very low, including legal  and production culture. It should be improved by  command-administrative methods as well. People have to be nudged  into doing good, because they do not know what that means.    The Supreme Council and the president should coordinate  their  actions, assuming that everything that is good for the people  must be developed and supported. When we finally create decent  conditions for work, an able-bodied society will be able to  protect itself, its children, students, and our pensioners, who  gave us wealth -- a potential to which we hold on.    I do not rule out state support for certain categories of  people. But it is nonsense to speak about welfare for all. We  have already bombarded the people with delusive promises such  that they are already choking. It is time to abandon social  demagogy.    [Polishchuk] There are currently many discussions about  Ukraine's territorial-administrative system. What is your  standpoint?    [Talanchuk] Based on our historic experience, I support a  unitarian state, until we become accustomed to each other. We  should introduce a Day of National Accord, in order to abandon  the division into followers of Melnyk or Bandera [nationalist  leaders during WWII], or communists, to raise common monuments,  and to constructively look to the future. It is inadmissible to  divide the country. Let us remember: History has given Ukraine  a last chance to establish a state. [passage omitted]</p>

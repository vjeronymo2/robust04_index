			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Metal injection breaks the mould Injection moulding, a process usually associated with plastic, is now being used to make small metal components. IMPAC Technologies, a subsidiary of the French Vallourec steel group, is developing a low-cost way of making complex metallic parts which are comparable in density to those produced though casting. It enables cost savings of 50 to 200 per cent over conventional machining techniques. The process consists of mixing metal powders with a thermo- plastic binder to achieve the necessary cohesion. The mix is then injected into the moulding machine where it sets. Afterwards, the binder particles are removed through thermal extraction. Finally, the component is heated in a controlled atmosphere.

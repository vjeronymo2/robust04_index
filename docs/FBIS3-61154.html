			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Nechayev, by Vadim Mikhnevich; place </F> and date not given: "`The State Must Work With Private  Investors'"]    [Text] Even with the extremely limited budget  resources, ways out of the crisis can be found, Andrey Nechayev,  former minister of economics in the Yegor Gaydar cabinet and now  president of the Russian Finance Corporation, working in contact  with the Russian Government, believes.    [Mikhnevich] Andrey Alekseyevich, many people are explaining  the reasons for the present crisis by the shift in priorities in  the government's activity. Some are saying that we should have  started with financial stabilization, others, with the  structural reorganization of the economy, and yet others believe  that we should generally have increased subsidies to industry  and not have embarked on dangerous experiments. What do you, a  person at the very epicenter of the struggle for reform of the  economy, think?    [Nechayev] The latter assertion I do not consider serious in  the least. By the time the Gaydar government had assumed office,  the country had long been living beyond its means and was on the  very threshold of a most severe financial crisis. As far as the  first two are concerned, these are essentially two sides of the  same coin. Gaydar understood this, but the government began with  a policy of financial stabilization and liberalization of the  economy bolstered by privatization. The release of enterprises  from strict state tutelage combined with free pricing, taking  account of real outlays, made it possible to distinguish both  the viable enterprises and sectors and those that are either not  in a position to survive at all or that could do so provided  that production is reprofiled or reorganized.    The structural reorganization of the economy was to have  been  the aim of the second stage of the reforms. At this stage it was  contemplated, on the basis of the limited possibilities of the  budget, supporting viable industries and providing for the most  painless possible winding down of the inefficient ones. But we  did not reach the second stage. Under the severest pressure of  the sectoral and regional lobbies expressing the interests of  potential insolvent enterprises, the Supreme Soviet initially  messed up the well-proportioned, interlinked program, tearing it  apart bit by bit, and then, with its support, the Central Bank  gave a boost to the inflation spiral, granting the enterprises  large-scale, unsupported loans, essentially signifying the  injection into the economy of an enormous supply of wholly  unbacked money. The start of the structural reorganization was  impeded by another step also--it was in fact blocked by the  adoption of the Bankruptcy Act.    The stream of demagogy from high platforms did the economy a  bad turn. The burst of inflation that followed immediately after  hit most strongly at both the manufacturers and the public,  inflaming the atmosphere even more and making ways out of the  crisis more difficult. The ailment, which was driven inward, has  once again come to the surface, but this time in a more serious  form. I believe that there is no other solution to the crisis  for the government today than to operate simultaneously in two  directions--undertaking strict financial regulation and active  structural reorganization.    [Mikhnevich] In other words, the present government is faced  with doing what, formerly, Gaydar did not venture, when the  situation was less explosive. A contradiction arises: strict  financial regulation with a very meager budget will deprive the  structural reorganization of the necessary investments. On what  reserves can the government count in this situation?    [Nechayev] First, we need to create conditions that  stimulate  as much as possible all potential investors (banks, enterprises,  commercial structures, the public) for the long-term investment  of resources. It would be expedient for this, in particular, to  exempt from taxes funds channeled into investment and permitting  enterprises to pursue a flexible depreciation policy, and the  commercial banks, to lower the rate of reserve holdings in the  Central Bank, provided that the resources thus released are  channeled into long-term credit. It is necessary also to devise  as quickly as possible a package of documents regulating  collateral relationships, mortgages included.    Thus, the task is to stimulate as much as possible, using  limited government resources, the attraction of nongovernment  funds. Of course, the state will always have obligations  connected with defense capability, the environment, and  development of the infrastructure and social programs. There is  no escaping nonreturnable funding here, although these resources  also could be spent more efficiently--via competitive bids,  tenders, and the use of contract relations between state clients  and contractors.    The resources, on the other hand, which are channeled into  the support of industry and other sectors of the production  sphere, which will ultimately produce direct returns, should be  allocated mainly on a returnable basis.    [Mikhnevich] Have such tactics been discussed at the  government level?    [Nechayev] Back in 1992 the Ministry of Economics of the  Russian Federation had prepared a draft that proposed the  abandonment if only of some nonreturnable budget investments,  substituting for them commercial investment credit at a  preferential rate of interest. They were to have been issued on  a competitive basis to specific enterprises on the strength of  particular projects, which had undergone comprehensive expert  appraisal, with a relatively short cost-recovery term. Following  completion of the project, the principal and interest would be  returned to the creditor, that is, the state, and could once  again be used for investments. There has in this way been an  increase in the demands made on the efficiency of the projects  and a broadening of the opportunities for future investments.    I have to say that even at that time there was no shortage  of  interesting proposals--the reforms emancipated initiative, and  people understood that in realizing efficient projects good  money could be earned in the future.    The government is now returning to this idea and developing  it. A corporation's proposals were recently discussed by  government and banking experts, and it was deemed expedient to  differentiate between the use of budget resources for  investments, initially allocating approximately 20-30 percent of  the 21 trillion rubles [R] determined by the budget for capital  investments for the granting of loans on a commercial basis, and  also for the realization of another part of our proposals--the  use of government resources for investments in share capital in  combination with private investments. These tasks, specifically,  will be tackled by the Russian Finance Corporation.    [Mikhnevich] Thus, if I have understood you correctly, we  are  talking about the appearance of fundamentally new investment and  financial institutions under our conditions essentially pursuing  government policy, but simultaneously acting the part of  transactor operating independently. Is this, after all, a state  organization or a private organization acting in the interests  of the state?    [Nechayev] The status could change in the future, but we are  at this time a state structure operating on the principles of  financial autonomy and acting as the agent of the government, to  which it entrusts the administration of a part of the budget  resources. Such institutions operate successfully, for example,  in the United States, Germany, and Italy. Budget support for the  development of the most promising directions in scientific  research and new technology and the stimulation of exports and  private investments and other areas of vital importance for  developing the economy and for maintaining high competitiveness  on the world market are being realized with their help. The task  with us is more modest as yet--attracting to the economy new  investments and accelerating capital turnover.    [Mikhnevich] Have you already devised a mechanism?    [Nechayev] Of course, although, naturally, it will probably  have to be refined with reference to the situation on the  investments market. There are entirely specific areas in which,  we believe, companies like the RFK [Russian Finance Corporation]  should operate. Their functions are portfolio investments,  allocating loans and putting together around these government  resources nongovernment capital and concluding agreements with  bankers and borrowers. It is nonsense when the Ministry of  Finance concludes direct credit agreements with enterprises!    How will such companies operate? There is, for example, a  large number of projects that their potential participants are  not in a position to finance in full. There are, then, two  options: either the government provides investment credit or  participates directly in this project and acquires its share of  the stock. If the project is realized and becomes profitable,  the price of the shares rises. The government could at any  moment sell them at a profit and allocate the money for new  investments. All Western investment banks operate according to  this format.    Acting on behalf and at the behest of the state, the RFK  will  attract primarily private investments. This format, roughly  speaking, is as follows: the state invests R1 in a specific  project and thereby declares its support for this project and  its readiness to share the risk, but on the strength of this  support commercial structures should invest, say, R3. Our  estimates show that such interaction with commercial structures  is perfectly possible, inasmuch as they have an interest even  today in the profitable investment of their capital not only in  trade or currency transactions.    There is also a number of other ideas, on which, owing to  the  lack of space, it is not worth dwelling on in detail at this  time.    [Mikhnevich] Nonetheless, as experience shows, investors are  attracted not so much by verbal as by actual guarantees, and in  terms of the degree of investment risk, Russia is today superior  only to countries that are at war. Can the government provide  such guarantees?    [Nechayev] We also consider this matter extremely serious.  Our viewpoint is such: we need an insurance or guarantee fund,  not only ruble but foreign currency also, what is more, which  would help attract foreign investors also. It is necessary,  partially, to allocate budget monies for its creation.  Management of the fund could be assumed by state structures of  the RFK type.    We are also engaged in an active dialogue with OPIC  [Overseas  Private Investment Corp.]--the agency performing similar  functions in the United States. Its guarantees are in fact  guarantees of the U.S. Government, on the strength of which any  Western bank instantly allocates credit. I hope that we will  manage to obtain from OPIC resources both in the form of  guarantees and in the form of direct credit. Without reciprocal  guarantees on the part of the Russian Government. We hope that  we can persuade American investment banks to invest their own  capital in our projects in combination with resources granted by  OPIC. If this happens, this will be a great success.    [Mikhnevich] Will your activity on the securities market be  confined merely to stock transactions?    [Nechayev] We contemplate issuing on behalf of the  corporation special ruble bonds at a relatively low rate of  interest with compensation in the form of their owners being  granted on the part of the corporation services pertaining to  expert project evaluation, the attraction of capital,  consulting, and so forth. It is also contemplated issuing  foreign currency bonds, the price of which will change in  accordance with the current price of the dollar at the  prevailing interest rate in the West. It will thus be possible  to accumulate additional resources for investments.    Further, at the behest of the Ministry of Finance, the  corporation will conduct transactions with internal currency  bonds. We are talking about bonds issued in exchange for the  "frozen" currency accounts in the Vneshekonombank [Bank for  Foreign Economic Activity]. We have enlisted a number of banks  with whose participation we intend to make these bonds  relatively liquid. We have also established contacts with  Western investment institutions, which are prepared to purchase  these bonds. Our quotations, that is, the prices that we are  offering the enterprises when purchasing the bonds, are higher  than those of our competitors.    Another direction which could be of interest to our  enterprises is the allocation of currency loans with these bonds  being used as collateral, proceeding from their market value.  And, finally, the third direction--participation in  risk-sharing. The foreign currency or part thereof paid to an  enterprise will be placed on deposit in one of banks at a good  rate of interest. In the event of an increase in the market  price of the bonds, the profit will be shared with the  enterprise.    The proposed ideas would be profitable for the holders of  the  bonds, I believe. They would not have to wait for many years for  redemption of the bonds and would immediately obtain "live"  money, which could be invested in business. The corporation and  the banks take the risk. If the price of the bonds (thanks to  the attraction of foreign purchasers included) rises, they will  be the winners also.    [Mikhnevich] How do you intend to monitor the operation of  the banks, considering their predilection for first turning over  a time or two the money they have received and only then  entering it into clients' accounts?    [Nechayev] We will, most likely, refuse to grant the banks  credit and will do business directly with the borrower, opening  a line of credit for him. The bank's function will be confined  merely to servicing the movement of the money.    [Mikhnevich] If in the future the regions manage to defend  their independence (the trend toward separatism is being  manifested even now), will this be reflected in the activity and  plans of the corporation?    [Nechayev] On the contrary, we believe that it is our  regional branches, which the RFK is actively creating, which  will bear the brunt of the burden, inasmuch as there is much  that is seen more clearly at the local level. The majority of  investment projects should be worked out and realized at the  regional level with regard for local specifics.    [Mikhnevich] How do you see the future of structures like  the  RFK?    [Nechayev] Their appearance and development ensue directly  from the logic of reform. Whether we like it or not, the  development of market relations will force us to use in the  investment space forms and methods accepted and well honed by  world practice. Our corporation is today a pioneer to a large  extent, but it is hardly destined to operate alone--others,  which will compete with one another, owing to which the  investment climate will only get better, will appear also.</p>

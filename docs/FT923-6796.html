			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TURNOVER IN stock index futures improved from the recent poor levels in a volatile session which saw an early rise evaporate on worries over the weakness of sterling, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the September contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,375, four points below Wednesday's close, and the contract went further into retreat with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reported to be the early seller. However, September soon gained upward momentum, fuelled by strong buying from Salomon Bros, and was trading at 2,399 by 9.30am, pulling the underlying cash market up. After a brief period of sideways trading, September was again in demand, boosted by favourable UK money supply figures and, later, relief at the unchanged Lombard discount rate. But the gain was surrendered in the afternoon as dealers focused on the weakness of sterling. September closed at 2,379, around 8 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover, at 10,539 lots, was an improvement on recent levels. Volume in traded options remained dull, reaching only 27,153 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option traded 7,148. Hillsdown was the busiest stock option on 2,664 contracts.</p>

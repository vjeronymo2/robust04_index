			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Observer: Mistaken identity Whatever is the significance of those two unfamiliar Asian businessmen who appear in Midland Bank's brand new national advertising campaign? 'Shekor and Anil have a good business proposition. And we have a billion pounds to lend,' boasts one of the many banks that has in the past been criticised for throwing good money after bad. 'And we're lending some of that money to Shekor and Anil. And it's not a mistake; we did say a billion,' it rounds up, less than wholly clarifying the matter. What the reader should have realised, it transpires after some considerable research around the various divisions of Midland, is that Shekor and Anil are 'real small businessmen' - owners of an Indian restaurant in London, as it happens. And the bank has recently made available an extra billion pounds to lend to just such small entrepreneurs. But Stuart White, head of small business at Midland, has some sympathy with the confusion generated. 'I'm a simple Yorkshireman; any ad I might write would never get past all those creative types,' admits White, before adding that it was a mistake that the 'mistake' bit was included in the final copy - accidentally left in from a very early draft.</p>

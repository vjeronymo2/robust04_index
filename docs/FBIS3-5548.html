			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 9 (YONHAP) -- Seoul denied reports  Wednesday that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspections were being hampered in North Korea.    "The inspections are going smoothly so far," said a Foreign  Ministry official. "IAEA activities are expected to conclude  around March 14 or 15."    The IAEA inspectors who arrived in Pyongyang on March 3 have  just about finished checking five of the seven declared  facilities, the official said. However, the remaining two  installations -- a 5-megawatt nuclear reactor and a  radiochemical laboratory used for reprocessing -- are critical  in determining whether North Korea diverted any nuclear material  for non-peaceful uses.    The vernacular daily TONG-A ILBO reported that North Korea  was restricting IAEA access to these two facilities. The story  came out on the same day South and North Korea were to meet at  the truce village of Panmunjom to arrange an exchange of  presidential envoys.</p>

Talking to newsmen on his arrival in  Nandial, Mr. Narasimha Rao said that Congress-I governments in  these states have still nine months to go for elections.    Replying to a question, he asserted that efforts by external  forces to destabilize the country will be foiled and India will  not allow anybody to meddle with its internal affairs. Mr. Rao  also said that the government is committed to deal firmly with  terrorism, especially in Jammu and Kashmir, so that normal  condition is returned to the state.    Earlier, addressing a public meeting in Atmakur in Kurnool  District, he asserted the country will never give in to any evil  designs. He said that peace is a prerequisite for development  and warned that stringent action would be taken against those  trying to disturb the law and order situation. Mr. Rao said the  Kashmir problem will be sorted out at the earliest and it is the  center's endeavor to establish a popular government in the  troubled state soon. The prime minister listed the steps taken  by the center for the welfare of women and backward classes. He  sought people's cooperation for effective implementation of  these programs. He also said that the recent assembly election  results in the northern states are clear testimony of the  people's faith in the policies and programs enunciated by the  Congress-I government at the center.

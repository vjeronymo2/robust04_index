			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Letter: Where a deflationary market is not a new experience Sir, Samuel Brittan's article (Economic Viewpoint, March 25) is the first reference I have noticed in the press to the possibility of deflation. As we are in the business of acquiring industrial land, placing building contracts and undertaking transactions on commercial properties, we have been working in a deflationary market since 1990. We regularly receive tenders for building contracts and, without exception, the prices are now generally back to 1986 levels. Even building materials have fallen back to mid-1980s prices. Coincidentally, when one of our main clients, Sheffield Insulations, announced its year-end results (UK Company News, March 25), it was interesting to see that its statement formally acknowledges material price deflation. The only inflation which my household witnesses is of staple commodities such as food and clothes, in addition to - somewhat surprisingly in the recession-hit south-east - school fees.

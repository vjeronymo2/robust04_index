			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During a news conference at the end of the NATO  summit in Brussels, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez  confirmed that, in the spring, Spain and the other countries  with troops in Bosnia will reassess their presence in the  region, taking into account the paradox that the presence of  these troops is not making a peace agreement any easier. Our  correspondent Nacho Hernandez has the story.    [Hernandez] Before spring, the Spanish prime minister will  have to reassess the presence of the blue helmets sent to  Bosnia. A decision that will not be made unilaterally. There  are even doubts about whether the UN presence is helping to  reach a peace agreement in former Yugoslavia. In Gonzalez's  opinion, the NATO decision reached today is a solemn warning to  the parties in conflict.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] There is a certain feeling of  frustration, because the purpose of having forces there is to  accomplish certain missions, and objectively the missions are  there to benefit the civilian population in all the conflict  areas. Consequently, it does not seem tolerable that these  forces should be used, hindered, or used as they have sometimes  been used, as targets of attack or in a political game in which  the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] does not take part. So there  is a clear awareness of the fact that they [the parties in  conflict] should clearly know that we are ready to defend the  UNPROFOR forces in the field. [end recording]    [Hernandez] According to Felipe Gonzalez, this summit has  clarified the North American attitude toward the conflict in  former Yugoslavia. In his opinion, uncertainties about NATO's  future have also been cleared up. He said the Partnership for  Peace for East European countries is also a message to Russia so  that it take part in the global European construction.    There is satisfaction on behalf of Spain because the final  communique includes references to the importance of stability in  the Mediterranean. According to the prime minister, it was very  important that NATO make this cooperation effort with the area.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] The obsession with trying to  consolidate a situation of peace, stability, and democratization  in the East does not take up all our energies. For the first  time a door is opened to future development of relations with  the countries of North Africa, with the Mediterranean area. I  think this is a positive development. For us it was  interesting, because there were doubts about whether some  alliance countries were going to accept this new dimension or  not. This possibility now exists, and consequently the Council  will study how to carry it out. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Letter: German rail privatisation has simplicity not seen in BR plans Sir, Re your leader, 'Privatising British Rail' (January 26), the privatisation of the rail system in Germany bears no comparison with that proposed in the UK. Herr Heinz Durr, chairman of the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) and the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR), has explained recently how the two railways will be brought together and privatised. It will be in three phases: The first would bring DB and DR together to form DB AG. The German constitution and laws are changed to permit this. The huge debt burden (currently DM60bn) is written off. Staff levels are reduced by moving civil servants back to government (130,000 of the staff fall into this category). The government invests DM100bn to modernise DR over a 10-year period. A holding company would be formed with three separate operating subsidiaries covering passenger, freight and Infrastructure. The companies would move gradually into being less controlled by government. By 2002 the holding company would disappear leaving the three operating companies in the private sector. Each rail operating company can set its own goals and hopefully compete against the other modes of transport. The privatisation of the German railways has a degree of simplicity which is not found in BR's over complex proposals. As with the deregulation and privatisation of the bus industry in the mid-1980s the likely outcome of such complex legislation is likely to be less competition, higher fares and rates, and less freight and passengers carried. The possibility that lines will be closed is very real. The lack of investment over the next few years also puts at risk the UK railway supply industry. Uncertainty over investment levels and long lead times mean that by the time new private railway operators can get established, UK railway manufacturers may have gone to the wall. Is Britain then to rely on suppliers based in the rest of Europe, the US and Japan? There is no coherent government policy or plans for the railways (or transport for that matter). No recent government has sat down and stated what the role of the railways should be in the national economy. Current plans must be 'blown off course' as they do not offer the well-run railway that the country needs. A discussion between the secretary of state for transport and his German counterpart might not go amiss. Ernest Godward, Mayland Cottage, Chapel Lane, Great Bromley, Essex CO7 7JT</p>

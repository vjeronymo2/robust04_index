			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- The ruling coalition agreed  Thursday [26 May] to opposition demands that former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's former aide be summoned to the Diet  to testify on Hosokawa's controversial financial dealings that  forced him to resign last month.    The coalition announced at an agenda-setting meeting for the  House of Representatives Budget Committee that it agrees to the  committee hearing testimony by Masatoshi Miyama after the state  budget for fiscal 1994 passes the lower house.    Meanwhile, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and other  opposition parties plan to step up pressure on the government  for testimony from Hosokawa himself, which they view as a step  to his resignation as a Diet member, opposition sources said.    Hosokawa stepped down last month because of the row over his  loan from a scandal-tainted company and alleged involvement in  the purchase of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.  (NTT).    The dispute paralyzed Diet proceedings, preventing the  budget  from being passed.    Hosokawa has said the 100 million yen loan from Sagawa  Kyubin  Co., and the purchase of shares in NTT were both handled by  Miyama. The former premier insisted the shares were bought by  his late father-in-law.    Hosokawa said the financial deals were above board. He said  he has paid back the loan from Sagawa, and denied he was  personally involved in the stock purchase. But documents he  presented to the Diet on the Sagawa loan were found to contain  apparent inaccuracies.    In addition, a financial consultant who had helped Hosokawa  said in the Diet that the former premier bought the NTT shares  himself.</p>

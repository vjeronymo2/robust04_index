			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Slav states pledge economic union BELARUS, Russia and Ukraine, the three former Soviet republics which created the Commonwealth of Independent States, have pledged themselves to a close economic union designed to knit together once more their devastated economies. The agreement was announced at the weekend as waves made by the Russian parliament's decision on Friday to declare Russian ownership of the port of Sevastopol in the Ukrainian region of Crimea subsided, at least for the moment. Ukrainian leaders appeared pacified yesterday by comments from Mr Boris Yeltsin on his return from the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo. The Russian president said he was 'ashamed' of the decision. The prime ministers of the three Slav states signed a 'declaration on economic integration' which commits them to an economic treaty by September 1. This would sweep away both formal and informal barriers to trade, permit citizens of all three countries to live, work and buy property in the others and propose new institutions for developing a 'common economic space'. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian premier, hinted that the agreement would go 'much further' than mere economic union - a possible reference to a clause in the declaration which says that 'the governments proceed from the fact that economic integration cannot be effective in isolation without a wider, multilateral mutual action in the political, defence and legislative areas'. However, the agreement faces a number of hurdles before it can be taken at face value, not least that it is one among many such declarations which have barely addressed the growing distance between the members of the CIS. It is only an agreement to agree - at the mercy of a worsening of relations between the states over the next few weeks, especially between Ukraine and Russia. The union reunites the original signatories of the CIS agreement in December 1991 but leaves out the other seven members, especially the Central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, all of which have clamoured to remain in the group. Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the Belarussian prime minister, denied that the non-Slav peoples had been left 'out in the cold' but the declaration itself specified 'certain conditions' which would be attendant on their joining the new 'union within a union'. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister, said that a condition of membership was that the participating states should not be members of any other such union. However, the Central Asian states have already formed their own 'common market'.</p>

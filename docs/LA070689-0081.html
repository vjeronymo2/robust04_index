			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIRTY WORK;  </P> <P> ARSON INVESTIGATORS PAINSTAKINGLY COMB FIRE AREA  </P> <P> Walt Scheuerell was down on his hands and knees in the ditch beside Turnbull  Canyon Road, pawing through the loose dirt. It was hot and it was dusty, and  the sweat was trickling down his face.  </P> <P> "We still haven't found anything," the burly, 49-year-old arson investigator  said. "We'll keep looking."  </P> <P> Scheuerell, a sergeant with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department; his  partner, Detective Barney Villa, 39, and Bill Franklin, 50, an investigator  with the county Fire Department, spent most of Wednesday afternoon combing  about half an acre of charred brush on a sunbaked, roadside slope half a mile  east of the Whittier city limit.  </P> <P> Their challenge is to determine -- if they can -- what started the brush fire  that blackened 1,500 acres, destroyed 13 homes and burned portions of eight  more in the Puente Hills on Monday, causing damage estimated at more than $4.3  million.  </P> <P> "From what the witnesses say, from what we see and from what we know about the  way the wind blew, this area right here is the point of origin," Scheuerell  said, pointing to the blackened hillside that marks the southwest quadrant of  the burned area.  </P> <P> "What we're looking for now is the exact point where it started," he said. "If  we find that, I think we can find the cause."  </P> <P> Scheuerell explained that what he was looking for was "what's left over" after  a fire starts -- things like fireworks fragments, match stubs, cigarette ashes  or the sort of residue left by burning gasoline and other flammable liquids.  </P> <P> "We haven't found any of those things," he said. "We haven't eliminated any of  those things either."  </P> <P> Scheuerell said he could probably rule out lightning -- "check the weather that  day." He said he could also rule out downed power lines -- "we haven't found  evidence of any."  </P> <P> But he was not yet willing to confirm fire officials' earlier assessment that  the fire was man-caused.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Don't Know'  </P> <P> "What I can say is that it was a suspicious fire," he said. "That means we  don't know yet what caused it."  </P> <P> The Puente Hills fire was just an ugly memory Wednesday, but three other  wildfires burned throughout the afternoon and into the night in Riverside  County, county fire officials said.  </P> <P> The largest of the three -- near Interstate 15 in the Temescal Canyon area  south of Corona -- was moving south toward the town of Alberhill after charring  more than 1,300 acres of brush. No evacuations were ordered, but residents in  the path of the blaze were told to be prepared to move if necessary.  </P> <P> Another fire broke out in the early afternoon near the 1984 Olympic Games  shooting venue in the Prado Dam area. Fanned by onshore winds, the flames  spread rapidly southeastward into the Prado Recreation Area northwest of  Corona, blackening about 750 acres of grasslands, brush and timber but posing  no immediate threat to homes.  </P> <P> The fire was contained by 5 p.m., with full control expected early today,  county fire officials said.  </P> <P> The third blaze, in the Box Springs area above Moreno Valley, about 10 miles  east of Riverside, had charred about 1,200 acres of brush by nightfall,  authorities said. No structures were threatened.  </P> <P> While more than 800 firefighters battled the three blazes in Riverside County  on Wednesday afternoon, the only official vehicle still parked in the Puente  Hills burn area was the pickup truck that had carried the three arson  investigators to the area where they think Monday's fire started.  </P> <P> Scheuerell, Villa and Franklin were working their way slowly up the slope,  about 10 yards above the roadway, when a motorist stopped to offer some  information.  </P> <P> The informant -- a local resident -- said he had seen a "suspicious" van in the  area several times before the fire. The officers took down the information,  which would be added later to a growing file of evidence and witness accounts.  </P> <P> "It's a lead," Scheuerell said. "How workable, we don't know yet."  </P> <P> The man drove off, and Scheuerell, Villa and Franklin resumed their painstaking  chore.  </P> <P> "The cause of this fire may never be determined positively," Scheuerell said.  ". . . But right now, we'll keep looking."  </P></p>

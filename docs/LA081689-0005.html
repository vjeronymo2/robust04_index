			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: HE'S GETTING A HANDLE ON ODD NAMES  </P> <P> The names parents give their offspring is a bottomless source of entertainment.  </P> <P> One reader has reviled me for what he calls cruelty in making fun of people's  names. On the contrary, I find that most people with unusual, inventive or even  silly names don't mind them. And of course they always have the legal right to  change them.  </P> <P> Debra Delores Trepagnier writes that she concedes that right to her daughter,  whom she named Khaleilah (Ka-lee-la) Trepagnier. Mrs. Trepagnier explains that  she considered her own name, Debra, to be "the most unoriginal name I have ever  heard.  </P> <P> "I thought I was doing her a favor. . . . Wouldn't you just know it -- she  would have much preferred to be a Valerie or a Stephanie. I assured her she can  legally change it at 18. I think she will like it by then. Don't you?"  </P> <P> Ka-lee-la? I like it already.  </P> <P> I am gratified that several readers have written to confirm that some of the  oddly named people I have mentioned indeed exist. Harry Cimring questioned the  authenticity of Bathsheba Finkelstein, saying it was too reminiscent of Dawn  Ginsbergh, one of S. J. Perelman's fictional characters.  </P> <P> Judith Haun of Pacific Palisades writes that when she was 10 years old the  Finkelsteins lived across the street from her best friend, Sheva Honigman. Moss  Henken of Bakersfield says "Bathsheba is the name her proud parents gave her."  He says Bathsheba is a Ph.D. "She teaches at an Eastern college where her  husband is president."  </P> <P> Marian S. Spencer of Santa Monica writes that the Colin B. Goodykoontz  mentioned by Bill Noble of Palm Desert was her uncle -- Colin Brummit  Goodykoontz, and she documents it with a page from her family's history.  </P> <P> The name Carbon Petroleum Dubbs, reported by Maury Green, is abundantly  verified. Maddie De Mott of Montecito says Dubbs came from Chicago in the 1930s  and built a home near the Santa Barbara Biltmore. His name, she says, was  derived from the industry that made his family rich. Warren Sherlock, a Loyola  Marymount University professor, says that Dubbs' estate gave his beach home to  the university. Harry Monahan sends an article from a 1975 SEA magazine  describing Dubbs' adventures in his 60-foot yacht Bowditch, which he sailed  from Scammon's Lagoon to the Alaskan ice fields.  </P> <P> Leon Levitan vouches for Wooloomooloo Cleaves, whom Henry Cimring described as  "a lady from Australia." Levitan says, "I sat next to her in one of my classes  at Los Angeles Junior College (now City College)."  </P> <P> I am pleased to report that at least two readers have authenticated the  existence of Cheerful Hyacinth Apple, recalled by Vada Robeson as a girl her  mother went to school with. Ida M. Hukill of Pico Rivera. "When we were kids,"  she writes, "Cheerful and I lived a block apart in Riverside. That was in the  early 1900s." (Mrs. Hukill will be 93 in September.)  </P> <P> Dr. John C. McMillan of Pomona writes: "My mother and father went to school  with Cheerful Hyacinth Apple. My mother never forgot the name."  </P> <P> Beverly Violin, mentioned by Bill Wilson of Santa Barbara, writes that she  indeed exists. "Personally, I really can't take full credit for this most  interesting, unusual and musical name. For I received it as a gift from my  husband, Efrem, nearly 37 years ago."  </P> <P> Just to keep the pot boiling, Douglas Mueller of Santa Barbara recalls an Ohio  state welfare director named Xenophon G. Hassenpflug; Sue S. Loup recalls the  daughter of an Italian bartender named Virgin Mary; a schoolteacher named  Fairly Dull, and a schoolteacher in Baton Rouge, La., named Prince O. Wales.  </P> <P> John T. Pigott recalls a partner in his former law firm named Cantwell Faulkner  Muckenfuss III. He encloses an eight-page legal-size list of remarkable names  compiled by a friend and his wife over several decades. Alas, I have room for  only a few: Intha Gotch, Rosetta Stone, C. Sharp Minor, Ecstasy Goldfarb, Candy  Barr (remember her?); and Tootsie Utz.  </P> <P> David Kolpacoff of El Cajon also offers a long list, from which I have culled  Dodie Bump, Comfort Igabon, Tina Pancake, Holly Lightfoot, Lorelei Loonie and  Neil Gesundheit.  </P> <P> A. F. Gonzales Jr. of San Diego says his all-time favorite is the name of a  hotel public relations man in Miami: Bermuda Schwartz.  </P> <P> Kenneth W. Whitaker nominates Jesse Basley Bentley Worth Pocahantas Gibson.  "The Pocahantas alludes to a slight Indian ancestry."  </P> <P> Just call me Jack.  </P></p>

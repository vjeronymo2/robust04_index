			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATWATCH: HART, OHLMAN ESTABLISH SCHOOL SCORING RECORDS  </P> <P> Hart High completed the regular season with a school-record scoring average of  80.6 points a game, breaking last year's mark of 73.4. The Indians' 18-7  regular-season mark is the team's best in six years.  </P> <P> Micah Ohlman, who has scored 466 points during the regular season, moved into  fourth place among Hart's career scoring leaders. Ohlman this season has made a  school-record 72 three-point shots.  </P> <P> Scoring: Saugus junior guard Geoff Dains made a team-high 30 of 96 three-point  shots, including 12 in the past three games. Dains, a late-season starter,  scored 171 points in 22 games (7.7 average).  </P> <P> In the second quarter of its 106-69 victory over La Salle last week, Harvard  scored a school-record 31 points. That mark did not last long -- the Saracens  scored 35 in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Although Hoover won just five games, senior John Hillman scored 440 points (20  points a game) and finished his career third on the school's all-time scoring  list with 1,125 points, a 16.3 average. John's brother, Joe, is first with  2,213 points.  </P> <P> Encore: Crescenta Valley has made the Southern Section playoffs in 20 of the  past 25 seasons and in 10 of 12 under Coach John Goffredo, who has 190 career  wins. "I was hoping to get to 200 so I could retire," he quipped.  </P> <P> Flip-flop: Crespi's Christian Fauria had his best and worst games against St.  Francis. In the teams' first meeting, Fauria scored 20 points, had 18 rebounds  and eight assists.  </P> <P> In a loss to the Golden Knights last week, he was two of 14 from the field and  finished with four points. "We seem to play as Christian plays," Celts Coach Ed  Marek said.  </P> <P> Almost there: Six of Newbury Park's 11 Marmonte League losses were by seven  points or fewer. "We get there, but can't get over the hump," Coach Greg Ropes  said.  </P> <P> Girls: North Hollywood's Jacinda Sweet broke two school records this season.  The junior guard, who attempted 394 field goals, edged 1989 graduate Michelle  Cabaldon, who attempted 370 shots. She also scored 176 field goals, breaking by  28 the previous record held by Debbie Herz.  </P></p>

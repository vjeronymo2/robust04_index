			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Lantsman report under the "Fiscal Matters" rubric: </F> "Taxes Will Not Be Cut in Russia Until Economy Becomes  Economical"]    [Text] The Russian Federation Chamber of Commerce and  Industry [CCI] will hold a series of "roundtables" this week to  discuss tax legislation and possible ways of reforming it.  Yesterday, chiefs of enterprises, unions, and associations of  entrepreneurs who assembled at the CCI congress center had a  chance to learn the government's view on this burning question.    Even earlier, the CCI information-analytical service  conducted a poll among its 4,000 members on whether the  government's taxation policy helps to boost production. A total  of 96 percent of those polled said "No." Bending to the  sentiments of the Chamber's members, CCI specialists have drawn  up draft amendments to the current taxation system. Describing  the current taxation system as unwieldy and inefficient because  it gives rise to unbearable tax pressure, the specialists have  suggested that taxation be adjusted so as to bring it in line  with world prices -- the number of taxes, duties, and payments  should be cut by merging them, and upper limits for profit tax  rates should be established at 30-35 percent and 15-20 percent  for small businesses.    Meanwhile, Aleksandr Ivaneyev, chief of the Finance Ministry  taxation reform department, who also spoke at the meeting, said  that the Finance Ministry categorically opposes any revision of  the taxation system. "Until the state cuts budget expenditures,  any reduction in the tax burden is out of the question," the  Finance Ministry's representative explained to interested  businessmen.    According to Mr. Ivaneyev, the current tax legislation is in  perfect conformity with the country's economic situation. Mr.  Ivaneyev conceded that taxes do not play as important a role in  economic regulation as they do in developed countries, and a  reduction, say, in value-added tax will not spark production  growth. The main regulator is still the tax of inflation.    "The state's grabbing reflex has not weakened yet," was how  Ivan Kivelidi, chairman of the Russian Federation Government's  Council on Entrepreneurship, summed up the Finance Ministry's  stance. In Kivelidi's view, fiscal policy will prompt the  conversion of money into cash and the across-the-board  criminalization of entrepreneurial activity.</p>

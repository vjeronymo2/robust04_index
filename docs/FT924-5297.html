			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Leading Article: France and the Gatt AFTER WEDNESDAY'S debate in the French national assembly, it is clear that the French government is set to stage a long and fierce rear-guard action against the farm trade deal negotiated between the European Community and the US as a central component of the Uruguay Round. At the end of the day, however, it seems almost inevitable that France will have to accept the terms negotiated by the European Commission, because no better terms will be available. Yet nobody should underestimate the depth of the real political difficulty which this issue is causing in France, let alone sneer that this is just a case of a weak government kow-towing to a combative peasantry. Finding a solution will certainly need political courage in France, but it will also require the other member states to recognise that a successful conclusion to the longest-running trade negotiation the world has ever known may require finding ways of helping France come to terms with the deal. The central French complaint is that the Community negotiators went beyond their brief, and have made concessions to the US which will impose uncovenanted and unacceptable sacrifices on French agriculture. France has already agreed to a sacrifice of its agricultural interests, in the reform of the Community's common agricultural policy (CAP) adopted by the 12 member states earlier this year. But the French also protest that the Commission has conceded additional restrictions, and therefore hardships for French farmers, which were not in its mandate. The European Commission has declared that the EC-US deal is consistent with the terms of the CAP reform; but Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, has announced that he could not accept these assurances, and has threatened to block the agreement with some sort of national veto. As a matter of principle, Mr Beregovoy is inevitably right. Without seeing the fine print, it is almost impossible to make any firm calculation of the detailed impact of the deal; if French claims are even roughly true, it seems probable that the agreement will impose stiffer restrictions on European agriculture. But the main French sacrifice, and it is a very real one, is the concession of the very principle of a farm agreement. The reform of the CAP is a far-reaching programme to restrain overproduction, but it does admit the possibility of Community flexibility according to circumstances; an agreement under the Uruguay Round will be an external constraint on the Community's freedom of movement, and it must therefore be less flexible and more binding. It may be argued that the French government is in trouble now because it has played its hand rather clumsily. But the bottom line is that French farmers, who are a large part of the labour force (over 6 per cent), are already enduring steady falls in their incomes, and facing a steep decline in their numbers. The British government recently backed sharply away from a plan to fire 30,000 coal miners; but French farmers know that their numbers are likely to drop from a little over 1m to around 600,000 in the next decade. The CAP reform must accelerate that process, and so will the GATT deal. In the case of the Uruguay Round, common sense and politics are at variance. Common sense suggests that the government should have declared that the EC-US deal is the best available. But if it had done so, it would almost certainly have been defeated in parliament, and after fresh elections its conservative successor would inevitably have been even more fiercely opposed to the Gatt deal. The best hope now is that the government will navigate under cover of a flag of protest, with a view to avoiding an absolute break with the Gatt negotiations, so as to accept an overall Uruguay Round package at a later date.</p>

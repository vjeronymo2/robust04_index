			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anne-Marie Rocco and Benedicte de Peretti </F> in Munich: "Siemens Versus Alcatel: The Battle of the Giants"]    [Text] On the left, Germany's Siemens, weighing in  with a turnover of 280 billion French francs [Fr] in 1993. On  the right, France's Alcatel-Alsthom at Fr156 billion. In energy,  the railroad industry, and telecommunications, the two groups  are waging a relentless war where "an eye for an eye" is the  only rule. But politicians want the two to cooperate, to  strengthen the Franco-German axis.    The meeting hall in this Defense Ministry building in Paris  is ice-cold. "It's because of the explosion in the  air-conditioning plant; have you heard about it?" the affable  Dr. Baumgartl explains. The cool atmosphere hardly disturbs  this engineer seconded by Simens to participate in one of the  most sympbolic joint ventures ever undertaken by France and  Germany: the development of the first European nuclear reactor  by the millenium.    Owned by Siemens and Framatome under a 50-50 partnership,  the  joint venture is called Nuclear Power International [preceding  three words in English] (NPI), and English will be the working  language for those involved, who share the spirit of  participating in a technological adventure. "Most of the German  engineers who came here in 1989, when the project began, have  applied to extend their contracts," says Dr. Baumgartl.    The project is a superb example of Franco-German  cooperation--but such cooperation itself seems less and less  popular. Not that there have been any serious technological  hitches so far. Quite the contrary. Launched initially to feed  the export market, the project was backed by EDF [French Power  Company] and most major German power companies. The nuclear  safety authorities of the two countries are expected to give  their blessing this June to the start-up of the second phase of  the project, "which at this point is very well defined, and  which also resembles many French reactors," notes Jean-Claude  Leny, Framatome's CEO. The objective for this new phase "is to  present, within three years, a detailed proposal setting the  stage for industrialization."  <H5>  "Give Back" Framatome </H5>   The real hang-up is elsewhere. It lies--indirectly--in the  proposed privatization of Framatome, whose "ownership" has been  in flux in the last 10 years. When he came to the Matignon  [office of the prime minister], Edouard Balladur promised to  "give back" the enterprise to Alcatel-Alsthom, which currently  owns 44 percent of its stock--the rest is owned by EDF, the  Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), and the employees--though for a  brief period in 1990 it controlled 52 percent. Preparations are  under way. CEA has designated the Rothschild Financial Company  as its counsel for the evaluation, while Framatome has picked  Goldman Sachs. Both sides are waiting now for a green light from  the Economics Ministry.    But what will become of the future Franco-German reactor, if  Alcatel-Alsthom's CEO brings to fruition the idea that so  intrigued his predecessors--taking over Framatome to strengthen  Alsthom's expertise in conventional turbines, enabling it to  offer turnkey solutions to clients around the world? The  question is of particularly keen concern to Heinrich von Pierer,  president and general manager of Siemens, since he it was--as  head of KWU, the German group's energy division--who had  negotiated the Framatome-Siemens accord.    Why? Because Pierre Suard is the man who has been working  ceaselessly since 1986 to block the path of the German  giant...and who has openly admitted as much to all and sundry.  "Siemens is my enemy," he reportedly said in an interview  several years ago. All documentation of that quote has  disappeared, but the Germans believe it is quite authentic.  Perhaps to justify their remarkable weakness in the French  market? At any rate, the pragmatic von Pierer continues to  preach greater cooperation between these two countries, "which  by the year 2010 will represent less than 2 percent of the world  population."    But French and German marketing teams on the ground are  battling tooth and nail in the railroad industry, energy, and  telecommunications. The war extends down to the working level,  where for example an Alcatel representative in China refused  even to meet with a Siemens counterpart freshly arrived in the  country. And all the way up to the level of gigantic projects,  such as the South Korean TGV [high-speed train] contract which  Alcatel-Alsthom, after many vicissitudes, finally nailed down on  18 April. Siemens, as we know, did everything in its power to  recapture the contract. Pierre Suard, in an interview with ECHOS  in January, explicitly branded its competitive practices as  "unfair." The "friendly" rejoinder from Siemens: "Suard will  have his Korean TGV, but he's going to lose his shirt." If so,  Siemens will be able to claim a lot of the credit, since it had  pared down its own bid several times.    In Italy, Alcatel and Siemens both coveted Italtel, the  telephone switching exchange builder which the government was  trying to privatize. In late March, the balance tipped in favor  of the German firm. "It has not escaped our notice that this  decision was taken on the eve of the formation of a new  government," commented Pierre Suard on 12 April, not without a  hint of irony, when presenting his company's the profit-and-loss  statement for 1993.    "Alcatel-Alsthom and Siemens are like water and fire," quips  one high-level French official halffacetiously. "They are the  two biggest European firms in their fields," notes Christian  Fayard, head of Siemens in France, so "no one should be  surprised they are always butting heads." Two colossi whose  conflicts are becoming increasingly fierce. "Today the battles  are enormous," says Fayard. "Korea was as hard-fought as  Trafalgar. The people involved are prisoners of the battles  they're waging."  <H5>  Political Blunders </H5>   The situation is not an easy one to manage for the  politicians, who see industrial cooperation as a means of  strengthening a Franco-German axis weakened by  reunification...and numerous political blunders. This was why  Gerard Longuet, France's industry minister, went to Munich for  private talks with Heinrich von Pierer at the end of March. Only  two close associates accompanied them. On the agenda for  discussion:     -  The railroad industry, where Siemens proposes  to bury the hatchet, once the dust settles from the Korean  contract, by launching a cooperative export venture for future  generations of high-speed trains;    -  Telecommunications, where  Siemens is demanding greater access to the French market;    -  The  computer industry, where Gerard Longuet is looking for new  European shareholders for Bull;    -  Components, where the French  hope someday to see Siemens join the Franco-Italian  SGS-Thomson;    -  And of course nuclear energy, the most burning  issue at the moment.     With concessions on both sides, is it possible to reach some  basis for an understanding?    The Germans say they are ready. In autumn 1993, Siemens' CEO  came to Paris in an effort to convince the industry minister to  endorse a token stock participation for his group in Framatome.  A gesture which in his eyes would have sealed the Franco-German  alliance once and for all...and guaranteed Siemens' future in  the nuclear industry at a time when the market in Germany could  freeze up, if the Social Democratic opposition, in alliance with  the Greens, were to come back to power after the October  elections. Out of the question, said Alcatel-Alsthom's head. So  the idea was just dropped. "Pierre Suard won't stand for it,"  was the somewhat rueful reaction at the Industry Ministry, where  officials are beginning to raise serious questions about how to  balance the interests of French industry against amity with its  big German neighbor.  <H5>  Snubbed by Siemens </H5>   After all, the man who oversaw the privatization of General  Electricity Company (CGE) and its transformation into today's  Alcatel-Alsthom, may be doing nothing more than taking his just  revenge. "Before the ITT-CGE accord, we were more or less  snubbed by Siemens," recalls a longtime veteran of the former  CGE. "We were not treated as one of the powerful few." The  takeover of telecommunications from the American group, which  had a very large base in Germany, turned things around. Signed  about the time Pierre Suard was made head of the group in 1986,  this accord was followed by a long list of acquisitions, some of  which are still in progress: Most recently, the takeover of the  submarine division of STC was finalized in February.    Siemens has not done nearly as well in the aftermath,  despite  several notable takeovers, including the rather unfortunate  buy-out of Nixdorf, the computer manufacturer. As for  Alcatel-Alsthom, it has more than doubled in turnover. The  French group boasts sales of close to Fr160 billion--admittedly  less than Siemens' Fr280 billion--but is able to do so without  as much diversification. And in many areas, Alcatel has surged  ahead of its rival.    In all this time, the German firm has watched helpless as  its  French competitor advanced by forced marches in most sectors. In  its own national market: In addition to the ITT deal, Alcatel  bought out Kabelmetall, while Siemens was prohibited by the  Office of Cartels from acquiring PKI, a Philips subsidiary that  also specialized in cable manufacturing. And its proposed  alliance with AEG in the railroad sector was blocked, at the  same time that Alsthom succeeded in becoming system coordinator  for the domestic industry. And in France: Alcatel took over the  telecommunications division of Thomson in 1983. Four years later  Siemens failed, for political reasons, to acquire CGCT--an ITT  subsidiary--which it had hoped would give entree to the French  telecommunications market. At the time, the German firm's top  executives were still licking their wounds over the Unidata  fiasco in the computer domain and the abortive acquisition of  FAE-Arnould in the electric equipment field. Old scars,  these...and so deeply etched that only a generational change can  efface their memory. "Siemens had a policy of external growth in  France, in telecommunications and energy, that it was unable to  actualize," Christian Fayard sums up.    The figures speak for themselves. Alcatel-Alsthom has annual  sales of Fr28 billion in Germany, mostly in telecommunications.  Siemens' sales in France, by contrast, are no more than Fr8  billion. Active in automotive electronics, lighting, electronic  components, and measuring equipment, Siemens has but token sales  in the French telecommunications market. Von Pierer says  straightforwardly: "I realize it's a delicate and difficult  issue, and I am a patient man. But the current situation is not  acceptable indefinitely."    What then is Siemens' best hope today for selling telephone  equipment in France? It is to become the third largest supplier  for the GSM [global system for mobile communications]  radiotelephone system--the operator for which will be chosen in  the coming weeks. A prospect at best uncertain, until  authorities make known their decision: Alcatel has put in its  bid against Bouygues and Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez!    So a new fracture line has appeared between the French and  German firms. Because Pierre Suard's group has set its sights on  a new "El Dorado": service, where profit margins are not yet  paper-thin. Supplying telephone line is going to become less and  less profitable, as has already been demonstrated on the German  market. "Since 1990, Deutsche Telekom has begun forcing its  suppliers to lower prices, by 23 percent last year," notes  Andre Chassagnol, financial analyst at Safe (Paribas group). A  move made necessary by plans for privatization of the German  operator, which explains why the two groups, with worrisome  synchronicity, have both announced projections of profit  downturns on the order of 10 to 20 percent for 1994.  <H5>  Grandiose Dreams </H5>   For all these reasons, Alcatel wants to graduate from  manufacturer to operator. In Hungary, it has joined forces with  US Telecom East (United States) to operate four regional  telecommunications systems. More spectacularly, it has bought a  stake in Global Star, a consortium that aspires to create an  international satellite-based mobile communications network. And  if information superhighways see the light of day--a development  which Pierre Suard seems convinced is inevitable--no doubt he  will get in on that as a supplier...and an operator. Alcatel is  already experimenting, in Great Britain as well as the United  States.    "Multimedia offers fascinating prospects," the head of  Alcatel-Alsthom loves to repeat, almost lyrically. To prepare,  it is getting more and more involved in the graphics domain, for  example by entering into partnership with a producer to launch a  tele-purchasing station. Grandiose dreams, some say. But the  Germans realize that if their enterprise was picked to install a  telephone system in Vietnam, it was because it promised it too  would be able to transmit graphics there.    The French strategy of bold integration worries its German  rival. Operating both traditional and multimedia telephone  networks, Alcatel will be even better positioned to block  Siemens' path. Will Siemens be forced to move in the same  direction? Unwillingly, to be sure. At heart a manufacturer, a  company of engineers if ever there was one, the German group  prefers to keep to its role as an equipment supplier. What it  gets enthusiastic about is "intrasectoral" diversification, on  the Japanese model: Cost what it may, it clings to its  electronic components and its data processing. Because these two  domains are in the process of converging with  telecommunications. And there it will enjoy technological  independence.    It's more than just commercial competition: In reality, the  two firms represent two strategies, two conflicting visions of  the world. Is it possible, then, for the two giants to put all  that aside and cooperate in one specific domain, nuclear energy?  In its deliberations over the Framatome issue, this is the  formidable question the government will have to address. Because  it was on this ground, implicitly, that Pierre Suard took his  stand on 12 April. "Two questions must be negotiated," he said:  "the price of the buy-out (of stock held by public-sector  shareholders), and the industrial policy that Framatome will  pursue." The heart of the issue, he said, "to put it simply, is  our cooperation with Siemens."    But "there is no question of dismantling the alliance with  the Germans," Suard protests. Except that Framatome, after  privatization, "will belong to an industrial group into whose  strategy it will have to be integrated." A top-level  Alcatel-Alsthom executive puts it this way: "The Franco-German  accord must be adapted to the new reality."    The Germans are turning somewhat of a deaf ear to such talk,  while at the same time they deny any intent to interfere in a  French internal issue. "We are already halfway there," explains  Adolph Huttl, director of KWU and member of the Siemens board of  directors. "There is nothing to be changed; either we keep  going, or we stop." He would of course prefer to continue with  the cooperative venture, "which in any case was never considered  a short-term project."    In Paris, Jean-Claude Leny is on the same wavelength. He's  looking out past the year 2000, because that is when the aging  French nuclear generating stations will have to be replaced.  "Nuclear energy is much like aviation. No one today would buy a  Caravelle." The German market itself, while not converting to  all-nuclear, might still offer some interesting prospects. But  the real growth potential is in big-ticket exports to countries  like China, India, Thailand, or Indonesia. Leny cautions,  though, that competition with the Americans and Japanese will  get more intense, even within the European Union--where "the  rules of the game are going to change," he says. Thus he already  dreams of Europeanizing NPI, "that embryonic nuclear Airbus."  Great Britain, Belgium, and Spain are reportedly interested.    The presumption underlying a consortium like Airbus is that  it rests on political will. That is certainly the case in the  nuclear energy field. But there's a problem: What happens when  one of the partners is about to fall under the control of an  owner which, though not opposed to the policy, is determined to  impose its own industrial vision and therefore takes into  account--reasonably enough, one might add--the dimension of  competition vis-a-vis the other partner? "It's up to the  authorities to resolve matters in such a way that a joint  venture of this scope and duration does not get derailed by  secondary considerations," avers Jean-Claude Leny, who is ready  to go to the mat to defend "the continuity of nuclear energy  with society." At NPI, attitudes oscillate between worry and  philosophic fatalism: "We're very curious to see how it will all  turn out."  <H5>  [Box, p 50] </H5> <H5>  Von Pierer: Negotiations </H5>   "We cannot stand idly by as the Americans invade our markets  while keeping us out of their own," warns Heinrich von Pierer,  who at the same time denies his aim is "fortress Europe." A  confirmed liberal, the Siemens CEO is nevertheless understanding  of the policy pursued by Paris, which rejects "laissez-faire,"  and constantly praises the progress French industry has already  made. "France and Germany are obligatory partners," he says with  conviction. The only thing he says he cannot understand is  France's position on the GATT [General Agreement on Trade and  Tariffs], its willingness to take such heavy risks "for the  benefit of agriculture, which represents so little."    At heart a frustrated politician, von Pierer might have made  a career for himself in the CSU, the Christian Social Union that  rules Bavaria. But in 1976 the party rejected his candidacy for  the Bundestag elections. Furious, he made Siemens the target of  his ambitions. But he is still a member of the CSU, and kept his  seat on the municipal council of his hometown, Erlangen, for 18  years.    A jurist by training, he joined Siemens, the town's largest  employer, in 1969. As marketing director at Kraftwerk Union  (KWU), the energy division, his negotiating talents propelled  him to the board of directors, and he was made its president in  1989. At the nuclear waste reprocessing center in Wackersdorf,  which the Bavarian government suddenly abandoned, he succeeded  in avoiding any labor conflict. So he had a clear path to the  top.    Named vice president of the group in 1991--to the surprise  of  almost everyone--he became its CEO a year later, at the age of  51. His dynamism galvanized the "old lady of Munich." He is  still moving rapidly, as he did back in the days when this  former junior champion from Bavaria divided his time between the  tennis courts, editing the local Erlangen sports journal, and  university. In 18 months, he has already toured more than a  hundred subsidiaries all over the world. When the Malaysian  government asked to see the presidents of the two finalists in  the competition to build an electric generating station before  making a final decision, von Pierer was on the ground in Kuala  Lumpur within 24 hours...and got the contract. The conquest of  Asian markets is, along with the building of Europe, a constant  theme with him. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has gotten the message.  Asia is now the major focus of his economic policy speeches.  <H5>  [Box, p 51] </H5> <H5>  Suard: Power </H5>   He has battled socialism, derided the Maastricht Treaty,  criticized the Commission in Brussels for the way it treats  alliances among European industrialists, and raised his voice  loudly against the recent reform of while-collar retirement  provisions. Pierre Suard does not hesitate to make waves. The  recession? It's behind us, Edouard Balladur asserted one evening  last January on television. Suard, in an interview the following  day, maintained the contrary. Coincidence?    Brought into the office of the presidency on the coattails  of  the Chirac-Balladur duo in 1986, Suard today wants to prove he  does his own thinking. Just as he demonstrated, eight years ago,  that he was not just a transition CEO. Named head of CGE with a  mandate to privatize it, he was only the 11th CEO in the  100-year history of the enterprise. Was he picked because of his  15 years of in-house experience as head of subsidiaries like  Cables de Lyon, where he had shown his mettle? Or because of his  political profile? An RPR [Rally for the Republic party]  sympathizer, his ties with Balladur go back to the era when  legendary CEO Ambroise Roux offered the current prime minister  the presidency of two subsidiaries. Four years later, he pruned,  restructured, and put his men in important positions: among  others, Pierre Bilger, former CGE treasurer, who was put in  charge of Alsthom, and Andre Wettstein, his former top aide at  Cables de Lyon. By making CGE systematically absorb its most  lucrative subsidiaries, he transformed the doddering CGE into a  formidable cash cow. Alcatel-Alsthom was born. And he was its  first president.    This former associate of Michel Debre in the Finance  Ministry, this mountaineer who prefers his house in Haute-Savoie  to the ostentation of life in Paris, has become one of the most  powerful industrial bosses in France. Does the game excite him?  His rise has had little effect on either his lifestyle or his  tastes. Admittedly it has its little rewards, such as being able  to buy the Gruault-Larose chateau, or create a press group built  around L'EXPRESS, which was part of Ambroise Roux's legacy. But  he does not spread himself too thin: His top priorities are  still to control the electric power network--including nuclear  energy--from top to bottom, and to broaden the group's  telecommunications base by going into the services side. Two  objectives whose attainment, ironically enough, is complicated  by his reputation as a friend of the government. Balladur would  be open to criticism for showing too much favoritism toward his  former colleague.</p>

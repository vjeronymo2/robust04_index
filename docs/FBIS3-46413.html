			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Year-End Report" by reporter Zhu Chengjun (4555 2110 </F> 6511): "Relations Among CIS Nations Are Still Evolving" --  XINHUA headline]    [Text] Beijing 18 Dec (XINHUA) -- It has been two years  since the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States  [CIS]. This year, various CIS nations have experienced  difficulties and frustrations to varying degrees, resulting in  changes in the relations among the members.    For quite some time, generally, the economies of the CIS  member nations have had many problems, with serious production  setbacks. While some nations have experienced prolonged war,  political instability, and fierce internal struggles, others  have been mired in nationality and territorial disputes.  Confronting all sorts of real-life, serious difficulties, CIS  nations are adjusting their own policies. If seeking their own  futures soon after the disintegration of the Soviet Union had  been the main goals of various CIS nations last year, this year  should be the one during which they gradually regain their  consciousness "from the intoxication of going their own way" and  start exploring new cooperative means among themselves in a bid  to overcome political, economic, and social crises.    The signing of the "CIS Constitution" among leaders of seven  nations, including Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, in Minsk  in January this year, that binds all member nations, signified a  temporary end to the year-long CIS "uncertainties." In May,  leaders of nine CIS nations signed in Moscow a declaration on  the establishment of an economic alliance among CIS nations.  The declaration explicitly called for the setting up of a CIS  common market where there will be a free flow of merchandise,  labor services, capital, and labor forces within the unified  economic area. Ukraine did not sign the "CIS Constitution" but  signed all documents from that meeting. In September, leaders  of nine nations further signed the CIS Economic Alliance Treaty,  under which member nations will grant each other the  most-favored-nation treatments and formulate a unified credit  policy. Although their actual implementation remains  considerably distant and the possibility of future changes is  not excluded, the declaration and the treaty they signed  reflected the urgency and wishes of the contracting nations in  seeking cooperation.    In the military field, the relatively prominent feature for  this year has been the CIS August decision to establish a  unified defense force in Tajikistan, consisting of troops from  five nations -- including Russia and Kazakhstan -- to jointly  deal with the opposition armed forces in Tajikistan and the  Afghan guerrillas along the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border.  Russia has played an important role in establishing this  unified force.    In addition, what is worth mentioning is that, with the  addition of Azerbaijan and Georgia in the latter part of this  year, the number of CIS members will reach 11.    Factors leading to the formation of the trend of cooperation  within the CIS have been many and varied. Despite CIS nations'  desire for independence, the political, economic, and defense  relations among them, developed over a long period, are  difficult to cut off. They are well aware that relying on the  Western developed countries to solve important economic,  nationality, and territorial issues will be difficult, and that  the CIS is needed to solve them. Georgia's final change of  attitude and application for CIS membership was an obvious  example, as it has to rely on other CIS nations, Russia in  particular, for the supply of natural gas, petroleum products,  materials, and merchandise. It also has to pin its hopes on CIS  military and political support in solving conflicts in Abkhazia.  Meanwhile, Russia has taken advantage of its military and  economic strength as well as its vast superiority in resources  to intensify diplomatic activities among other CIS nations.  Russian leaders have openly repeated that Russia has its own  strategic interests in certain CIS nations and have exerted  influence over the development of certain local events.    However, as the CIS itself is a product of the drastic  change and integration of the Soviet Union, relations among  member nations are bound to be complex. Currently, wars in the  Transcaucasus have not ended, with bloody conflicts reported  here and there, while Azerbaijan and Armenia still see each  other as enemies. Ukraine, a European country, and Russia  remain widely divided over the handling of nuclear weapons and  the Black Sea Fleet. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia  decided to issue their own currencies in November this year  after rejecting Russia's conditions, forcing the near  abandonment of a proposal by six CIS nations in September for  establishing a new type of ruble zone. Some foreign forces have  also taken advantage of the situation to intensify infiltration  and instigation. All of this shows that there will be  contradictions, difficulties, and struggles among CIS nations in  the process of cooperation.    Overall, CIS nations, while preserving their independence,  are looking for closer cooperation. How to handle  contradictions arising from the clash of these two tendencies  will remain an acute issue they must face. With certain major  domestic and foreign policies needing adjustment, the  development prospects for many countries have not been clear,  adding further complexities to the relations among CIS nations.</p>

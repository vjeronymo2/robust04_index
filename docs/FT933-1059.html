			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Doubts on GrandMet changes DETAILS of the awaited boardroom changes at food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan took the market by surprise and unsettled the shares as market watchers tried to rationalise the moves. Sentiment was further weakened by a profits downgrading from a UK broker. The company not only announced it was splitting the role of chief executive and chairman currently held by Sir Allen Sheppard but named Mr George Bull, now head of the food division, as the new chief executive. The market had for some time assumed that Mr Ian Martin, the managing director, would become the new chief executive. Uncertainty reflected market fears that the changes might be an indication of problems at the group. The shares gave up 15 to 393p, after heavy trading of 8.5m shares. The jitters over GrandMet came as sentiment in the drinks sector was at a low ebb following the poor results from Guinness earlier this week. NatWest Securities yesterday downgraded profit expectations at GrandMet. It reduced the current year estimate by Pounds 24m to Pounds 941m and cut the following year's figure by Pounds 38m to Pounds 1,047m.</p>

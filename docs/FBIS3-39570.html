			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Annika Savill article: "Spy Services Fear Blow to U.S. </F> Link"]    [Text] Indignation abounds in Britain's foreign  intelligence community about a spending review of MI6 and GCHQ  [Government Communications Headquarters] that they expect will  lead to permanent cuts, primarily in the latter. They say  hacking away at GCHQ, responsible for spy satellites and  listening stations, could do serious damage to Britain's  Atlantic alliance. The less Britain is able to provide in the  intelligence-sharing arrangement with the United States, the  less it can expect in return from GCHQ's American cousin, the  National Security Agency [NSA].    As one British official said: "It is one of the few  meaningful aspects left of the special relationship. It is  genuinely a relationship of equals, covering the full range of  signals intelligence."    The review of the foreign intelligence capabilities is due  to  report to the Prime Minister before the summer recess. It was  ordered by Sir Robin Butler, the Cabinet Secretary, in response  to Treasury paranoia about public spending in general, and  resentment of the diplomatic and intelligence services in  particular. Because the GCHQ budget, at around 500m pounds, is  almost two and a half times that of MI6, it can expect to be the  bigger target. Intelligence sources point out that much of the  GCHQ budget is spent on equipment for operations like satellite  surveillance and that its flexibility is therefore limited.    The indignation of GCHQ staff was manifested in the recent  leaking to a newspaper of a confidential letter by the GCHQ  director outlining the review. An inquiry is under way at  Cheltenham into those resonsible for the leak. "People are as  we speak being shot at GCHQ," said one source.    But it seems many officials at the Foreign Office itself --  which will have a strong voice in the conclusions of the review  -- are in favour of trimming the GCHQ operation. Their rivals  in the intelligence services say that this is because the FCO  [Foreign and Commonwealth Office] -- itself under the Treasury  cosh -- hopes to become the beneficiary of any cuts in the  intelligence services, by being allowed to keep more funds.  Since it is common knowledge that the Treasury is out to cut  public services across the board, it is unlikely anybody in the  FCO would be so foolish. "It is a question of savings to the  tax payer, not to anyone else," said one official.    There is another school of thought -- shared by some  officials in the Foreign Office. It is that at more than 6,000  staff, GCHQ is seriously overstaffed. It is deemed to be  peopled by "numbercrunchers" who churn out a needless wealth of  indigestible raw material, much of it never read; and that it  should be restructured entirely to employ people capable of  analysing what it finds out to establish if, and to whom, it is  of any use.    It emerges that the American cousins, of whom the British  service is so solicitous, have the same problem. A recent  Congressional hearing focused on complaints by US government  departments at the difficulty of accessing relevant information  in the dense mass of raw material. "The NSA [National Security  Agency] doesn't even bother to provide a summary of its material  to its consumers," said one intelligence analyst. "They just  tell them `This is the access code, find it yourself.'"    Since the end of the Soviet Union, all Western intelligence  services have been forced to reexamine their roles in life. It  is no secret that the reason MI6 has decided to go public is not  because of lofty government aspirations to openness but because  it is trying to defend its funds. It defines its post-Cold War  role as threefold: the fight against terrorism, nuclear  proliferation and drugs.    A further problem of what to do with the intelligence  community in the new world disorder will arise in 1997, when the  large British base in Hong Kong will have to make way for the  Chinese.    There is speculation that some of them will transfer to an  American base in Taiwan -- a sensitive move diplomatically --  and others go to Malaysia and Singapore. The cosiest scenario  is that some will join their Australian allies at a signals  intelligence base in Shoal Bay, near Darwin.</p>

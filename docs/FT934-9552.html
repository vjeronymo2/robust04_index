			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Observer: Wanted man UK-Brazilian relations have warmed considerably in almost four years since the sociable Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima arrived as Brazil's ambassador to London. Tarso - who was appointed to the London post by now disgraced President Fernando Collor - is leaving at the weekend for the US where he becomes ambassador to Washington. The outgoing ambassador is given much of the credit for persuading the British government, in the absence of a formal extradition agreement between the two countries, to start unprecedented special extradition proceedings against Paulo Cesar Farias, probably Brazil's most wanted man. Farias - who fled Brazil and was living in London - was allegedly at the centre of a big corruption ring whose discovery eventually brought down Collor. However, since a warrant was issued for Farias's arrest last Monday, Scotland Yard appears to have seen neither hide nor hair of Farias.</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Acrimony in motor industry criticised Carmakers and components suppliers in the UK plan to establish a forum to improve relations. The move follows publication of a highly critical report sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The report says the 'necessary levels of trust' are not present between vehicle makers and components suppliers. 'The mistrust which is in evidence is the result of many years of broken promises, abuse of confidence and general acrimony in the industry.' The report was prepared by Professor Richard Lamming, professor of purchasing and supply management at Bath University School of Management. It was based on a series of discussion workshops held last year with the aim of improving relationships between manufacturers and suppliers, and highlights the lack of progress in reducing the traditional animosity between them. The report says: 'In developing new working agreements with their suppliers most vehicle manufacturers still appear to deal more in rhetoric than reality.' Prof Lamming said the loss of direct ownership control of most of the vehicle-making industry in the UK had made the process of improving relationships more difficult. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, urged the two sides to work more closely together to meet the challenge presented by the 'globalisation' of markets. Mr Heseltine said the report argued that a continued legacy of mistrust remained 'a formidable barrier' to lean production and supply, and that there was 'insufficient collaboration' on product and process development.

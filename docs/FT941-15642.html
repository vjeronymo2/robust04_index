			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Tokyo, Moscow talks could be postponed due to changes in Russian government The Japanese government said talks between Tokyo and Moscow on the territorial dispute over the northern islands, originally scheduled for this month, could be postponed due to personnel changes in the Russian government, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The delay in negotiations could cause increased resentment among Japanese, who have been alarmed over reports that Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of an extreme nationalist party, had threatened to bomb Japan if it pressed for the return of the four islands, north of Hokkaido. The Japanese government is, however, due to hold talks over bilateral co-operation on environmental protection with South Korea and Russia this month following the outcry caused by Russia's dumping of nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan last year. This created tensions between Tokyo and Moscow, which has since been calling for more foreign aid for its nuclear waste management.</p>

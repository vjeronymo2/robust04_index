			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Union calls second strike at TSB BIFU, the banking union, called a second one-day strike of its 19,000 members in branches of TSB Retail Banking and Insurance yesterday, and said there might be separate lightning strikes in TSB computer centres. The one-day strike called for January 22 follows what the union claimed was a successful one-day strike in the TSB's branch network last Friday. The strike stopped cheque clearing and closed at least 366 branches. The delay until the next strike allows time for the union and the bank to resume negotiations over 840 redundancies - some of them compulsory  - caused by the merger of TSB's branch banking and insurance sales operations. Bifu said it had agreed with TSB to cancel negotiating meetings scheduled for this week to discuss issues including the annual pay round. It said it was willing to talk to the bank about the dispute at the Acas conciliation service. Mr John Townsend, Bifu assistant secretary, said the union believed it could achieve a better response from its members than last time because the delay allowed it more time to organise action in the TSB's 1,369 branches. He added that the union might call action at short notice in TSB's five computer centres and two cheque clearing centres. TSB disclosed its own estimates of the effect of action on Friday, which were disputed by the union. TSB said 1,003 of its branches had remained open, and computer operations and cash machines had operated as normal. The union said TSB's estimate of branches that remained open during the strike included those which were staffed by a single manager. The union added that about half the bank's branches had been either wholly closed, or were opened by a manager. TSB said that it was willing to negotiate with Bifu over the redundancies at any time, and it hoped the union would approach any talks 'in a constructive manner'. The bank added that it regretted that further industrial action had been called.</p>

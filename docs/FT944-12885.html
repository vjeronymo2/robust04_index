			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Mark Thatcher deal supported by Tory backers Mr Mark Thatcher, the son of former prime minister Baroness Thatcher, secured backing for one of his biggest US investment deals from some of his mother's closest business supporters. Hanson, the UK-quoted conglomerate, and Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong billionaire - both of whom have been substantial donors to the Conservative party - invested in a US business consortium put together by Mr Thatcher and his then partner, Mr Bruce Leadbetter. Hanson said it has lost Dollars 130,000 (Pounds 79,750) on its investment of Dollars 400,000 made in the late 1980s. Mr Martin Taylor, a vice-chairman of Hanson, said last week: 'We knew that Mark Thatcher was involved when we agreed to make the investment. It was the only time we invested with him.' Mr Thatcher denied that he had exploited his mother's connections. He said: 'If the whole thing was funded by the Who's Who contributors to the party, then that would have been a different game. But for them to subscribe to two-fifteenths of the investment, I do not regard that as significant.' Other investors in Emergency Networks, a Dallas-based home security company in which Mr Thatcher and his partners invested, included Mr Bruce Babbit, currently US interior secretary, and Mr Jay Pritzker, one of the owners of the Hyatt Hotel chain. Meanwhile, in the first detailed interview on his affairs for several years, Mr Thatcher poured cold water on widespread reports that he is worth tens of millions of pounds. 'It would be significantly wrong to conclude that I am worth more than Pounds 5m,' he said. 'There is just nothing to support it apart from innuendo. This whole idea that I have had tremendous success is just a myth.' Conservative party officials have pointed to his US interests as the main source of Mr Thatcher's wealth. They were rebutting allegations that he exploited his position as the only son of the then British prime minister to earn commissions from defence sales. A Financial Times analysis of his US business interests, based on company filings and court documents, has found little evidence of significant earnings from his US activities. On the other hand, these activities have been coloured by two corporate collapses, litigation and boardroom rows. In the interview, Mr Thatcher reiterated his denial that he received a commission from the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah defence contract signed in 1985 between the UK and Saudi Arabian governments. He confirmed that he is a friend of Mr Wafic Said, the millionaire businessman who acted as a go-between on the UK side of the Al Yamamah talks in the mid-1980s. However, Mr Thatcher said: 'Merely because I know this man does not mean to say that he is going to pay me Pounds 12m because I am a nice guy.' Mr Thatcher said that if he had had 'tremendous' success, 'I would be sitting on my own private island in the South Pacific, but I am not'. The Mark Thatcher Affair: special reports, Page 6</p>

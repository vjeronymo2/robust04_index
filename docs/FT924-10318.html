			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Tajikistan asks Russia for military aid LESS THAN a week after crushing an attempted coup by rebels loyal to the former communist leader, the Tajik government has conceded that it needs the security of Russian military support and has asked Moscow for additional troops to protect the capital. If the request is granted, Tajikistan would be the first of the Soviet Union's 15 former republics to return such a big security role to Moscow. Tajik Prime Minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov said he would fly to Moscow shortly to argue for troops to reinforce Russia's 201st motorised rifle division, which is stationed in the central Asian nation. The request had already been made orally, Mr Abdullajanov said. The troops would reinforce Russian soldiers already blocking roads leading into the capital, and securing the airport and railroad, television and radio stations.</p>

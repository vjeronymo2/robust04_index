			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Manchester Olympic bid in surplus Manchester's failed bid for the 2000 Olympic games made a surplus of Pounds 1,626 on income of Pounds 5.59m, according to final accounts published yesterday. Sir Robert Scott, chairman of the bid committee, said the 'huge generosity' of supporters, plus tight controls, had been responsible. The bid cost more than Pounds 8m, but about Pounds 3m was given in kind by corporate sponsors, including discounted hotel accommodation, air travel, consultancy, office furniture, equipment and printing. The private sector contributed Pounds 3.07m, with the government putting in Pounds 2.2m. Sale of merchandise such as mugs and T-shirts raised Pounds 320,000. Neither Manchester City Council nor the British Olympic Association, which made the bid jointly, had to contribute money. The biggest single costs were salaries at Pounds 640,330 and visits by 80 of the 91 members of the International Olympic Committee at Pounds 564,990. Trips by leaders of the bid cost Pounds 313,040, not including the final lobbying of the IOC in Monte Carlo last September, which cost Pounds 250,330. Public relations were costed at Pounds 295,830, but the bid attracted between 75 and 100 articles a month in British media and widespread coverage by international newspapers and broadcasters. Development of sporting venues such as the new velodrome and arena, and design of the planned Millennium Stadium, cost a total of Pounds 589,110 including Pounds 264,030 for 'master planning' and Pounds 177,510 for consultation. The bid document cost Pounds 200,140 to prepare. The accounts are for the bid itself and do not include Pounds 75m given by the government towards land acquisition, clearance, environmental improvements and the velodrome and arena. KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, has estimated the total regional economic benefit of the bid and the new facilities at about Pounds 200m and 480 jobs. The biggest single sponsor of the bid was Manchester Airport with Pounds 400,000. Other big contributors have included National Westminster bank - which gave Pounds 100,000 for Manchester's failed 1996 bid and Pounds 150,000 this time - and Boddington's, the local brewing subsidiary of Whitbread, which also gave Pounds 150,000.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Geir Salvesen report: "Referendum Likely on 28 November"] </F>   [Text] Monday, 28 November, will probably be the date of  the EU [European Union] referendum in Norway, which will  therefore vote after Sweden and Finland.    "28 November is a good tip. This is the date which looks  most likely according to the wishes of a majority in the  Storting," Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said.    Yesterday she had invited the parliamentary leaders of the  various parties and representatives of the "yes" and "no"  movements to make their views known on the date for the EU  referendum at a "summit" in the government building. At the  meeting, it emerged that the Conservative Party, the Labor  Party, and the Progress Party want the referendum to take place  after the one in Sweden -- which will be held on Sunday, 13  November. The date of 28 November was proposed.    Theoretically it is possibile that a different date could be  selected. The government will take a few weeks to decide. But  yesterday it was at least confirmed that the referendum will  take place after Sweden's.    Gro Harlem Brundtland stressed that this will give the many  people, who want to know what choice Finland and Sweden make, an  opportunity to take this into account. The Conservative Party's  Anders Talleraas said that Norwegian voters must have "maximum  information" before the reach their decision.    The "no" side wanted the referendum either on the same day  as  Sweden's -- or before. The Christian People's Party's Kjell  Magne Bondevik wanted Norway to be the first of the Nordic  countries to vote.    "We knew that the `yes' side would act ruthlessly to  manipulate the referendum," said "No to the EU" leader Kristen  Nygaard, who was also present.    "Might is right," said the Socialist Left Party's Erik  Solheim. Gro Harlem Brundtland, who was dressed in red and did  not allow herself to get in the least bit aggravated by the  allegations, said that it was most natural to take account of  the view which had the backing of a majority. The others in the  "yes" camp took the same line, and wondered what the situation  would be like if the minority were to decide.    "This news will gladden that section of voters who are  interested in knowing what choice the other Nordic countries  have made," said Inge Lonning, leader of the Europe Movement.    The exact question that will be asked in the referendum has  not been decided yet. There has been speculation about whether  it is the package of results negotiated in the membership talks  about which the people will be asked to make up their minds.    In 1972 the wording was: "Should Norway become a member of  the European Community?" A carbon copy of the formula then  would point toward: "Should Norway become a member of the  European Union?" The reason why the "no" side in particular is  concerned on this point is that there have been fears of a  "Danish solution." Norway could then begin to renegotiate if  the voters said "no" to the actual negotiated package as a  result of the wording of the question asked in the referendum.    Kristen Nygaard said that he was fairly satisfied with the  indirect assurances he has received to the effect that this will  not happen, and said that it was a useful meeting.    But it is possible that a reference to the actual negotiated  package could be included in the overall wording -- without  being the main question. This will now be discussed in  government circles.    Another question is whether there will be a majority in the  Storting for a referendum after Sweden's when the votes of those  deputies in the Labor Party's Storting group who support "Social  Democrats Against the EU" (SME) are subtracted. Assuming that  all SME supporters will vote against the 28 November date, there  will be pressure on the Progress Party's deputies. Not many  votes are needed to tip the scales. Carl I. Hagen told  AFTENPOSTEN that he is sure that the Progress Party's deputies  will back a date later than that of the Swedish referendum.  This is something that he has already raised in the Storting  group, and there were no objections, he claimed.</p>

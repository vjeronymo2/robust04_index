			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping in Washington </F> by Sabine Christiansen in Hamburg -- live]    [Text] [Christiansen] Good evening Mr. Scharping. You  have just met with U.S. President Bill Clinton. What were the  major topics that you discussed?    [Scharping] We had a quite long and very personal  conversation on German-U.S. relations, on the situation in  Europe, on the developments in the individual countries, and on  parallel developments among the U.S. Democrats and the German  Social Democrats. By the way, I would like to make one thing  clear: The election campaign does not play a role, but the  reliability and continuity of German policy does. It is good  for Germany that no basic changes are needed in Germany's  foreign policy. Yet changes are urgently required in the  domestic sphere, which the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] will ensure.    [Christiansen] Did you succeed in guaranteeing the required  reliability to the United States?    [Scharping] One thing struck me in particular. In the  German discussion, there is a great deal of talk about combat  missions and that this issue allegedly determines Germany's  reliability as a partner and cooperation with the United States.  I got the impression here that the issue is being overestimated  in Germany. One should not claim that the United States is  urging the Germans to participate in combat missions. This is  not true. There are considerations here to introduce tighter  rules, particularly in connection with UN missions.    [Christiansen] However, in view of the current mission in  Bosnia, you probably also discussed the possible future German  contribution.    [Scharping] First, the United States has no expectations.  Second, there is no difference between the position of the  Federal Government and our stance. The attack on Gorazde was  the required response to an aggression that endangered tens of  thousands of people. On the other hand, we agree with the  government and the government agrees with us that German  soldiers cannot achieve anything positive in Yugoslavia.    [Christiansen] Let us change the topic. Domestic policies  were also discussed, as you just stated. The U.S. economy seems  to have overcome the recession in numerous spheres. What can  one learn from that?    [Scharping] It is a confirmation of what the SPD has been  claiming for a long time. We need more investment and more  favorable conditions to attract them. We need economic growth  that must be environmentally compatible. We must reduce the  public deficit and create a leaner and more modern state.  Otherwise we will not be able to overcome the main problem --  the fight against unemployment. The United States has recently  created 2 million jobs, whereas another 700,000 have lost their  jobs in Germany as a result of the government's policy.    [Christiansen] Mr. Scharping, thank you very much for the  interview. Good bye.    [Scharping] Good bye.</p>

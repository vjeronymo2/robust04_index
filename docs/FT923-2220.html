			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: NZ property chief criticised THE New Zealand Stock Exchange's market surveillance panel has criticised interests associated with Sir Robert Jones, the executive chairman of Robt. Jones Investments, the New Zealand property group, for reducing their exposure to the company 'by a very substantial amount' without informing other shareholders. In an extensive report issued yesterday, the panel condemned what it said was the failure of directors, and in particular Sir Robert and Mr David Moriarty, managing director, to inform the market of share transactions and arrangements, which should have been disclosed. The report follows a protracted investigation into the placement and sale of shares, and transactions involving the company and its employee unit trust between March and September 1990. Robt. Jones Investments is one of the biggest property groups in Australia and New Zealand. Sir Robert is expected to announce his resignation from the board of the company he founded 10 years ago at today's annual meeting. The report lists a number of breaches in the exchange's listing requirements: funding through an employee unit trust of share sales by interests associated with Sir Robert Jones; sales of properties to those interests 'on a non-arms length basis'; the 'material fact that the company's employee unit trust was substantially involved in certain significant share transactions that were reported to the market incorrectly'. Mr Kevin O'Connor, panel chairman, said some of the breaches may have been connected with efforts to ensure the group's survival.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CANADIAN BORDER HAS TRAFFIC JAMS WHEN CHEAPER U.S. BARS CLOSE;  </P> <P> FOREIGN TRADE CAN'T GET MUCH FREER THAN IN TWO TOWNS CALLED 'SOO'  </P> <P> Foreign trade could not be much freer than in the Twin Saults, the two cities  with the same name separated by the 2 1/2-mile breadth of the St. Marys River  and flying different flags.  </P> <P> Americans and Canadians go back and forth across the border in droves to buy  bread, have babies or drink beer, without a worry about tariffs or quotas.  </P> <P> "We call it jumping across the big ditch," Canadian steel worker Richard  Shurtliffe said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1 Beer Draws Canadians  </P> <P> On Wednesdays after work, Shurtliffe and his buddies cross the river from Sault  Ste. Marie, Ontario, to the $1-a-beer bars in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich. Canadian  brew tastes better, but American suds are cheaper, Shurtliffe says.  </P> <P> Beer isn't the only bargain.  </P> <P> Canada's dairy prices, for instance, are jacked up by a farm support system  that is unlikely to change even under the country's free-trade agreements with  the United States. No matter, Shurtliffe says. He buys American.  </P> <P> Not only does he buy U.S. milk for his grandchildren, he fills his pickup truck  with U.S. gasoline and his refrigerator with U.S. steaks.  </P> <P> Even Canadian cigarettes are cheaper in U.S. stores.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cheaper in Michigan  </P> <P> "It's an awful savings," Shurtliffe said. "It seems everything's cheaper in  Michigan."  </P> <P> It is commerce without national loyalty. In the Sault (pronounce it soo), many  American women have their American babies in Canada and tourists buy their  Canadian souvenirs in the United States.  </P> <P> The biggest traffic jams at Canada customs are at 2:30 a.m., when the U.S. bars  close and Canadians go home.  </P> <P> Customs agent Giacomo Pastore has seen the happy drivers line up for as long as  45-minute waits at the border crossing into Canada.  </P> <P> "It's a ritual," he said.  </P> <P> "It's an awful pile of Canadians," Shurtliffe said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Towns Not Identical  </P> <P> Locals call them the Twin Saults or the Two Saults, but these cities on  opposite sides of the Soo shipping locks are anything but identical.  </P> <P> Historical markers on the U.S. side tell of the treaty taking northern Michigan  from the Chippewa Indians. A plaque on Canadian soil remembers the shameful  "Chicoro Incident" of 1870, when the United States refused to let a Canadian  military ship pass through the U.S. locks. The Canadians had to walk around the  St. Marys rapids.  </P> <P> Ontario's Sault is six times the size of Michigan's. The Ontario town of 83,000  has a steel mill, paper mill and a large shopping mall. Its downtown Queen  Street is dotted with upscale china shops.  </P> <P> Also, it has more movie theaters, a lower drinking age and two strip clubs,  Michigan teen-ager Dean Newcomb noted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tourism a Big Industry  </P> <P> Michigan's Sault is a quiet home to 14,500 people, many of whom don't lock  their doors. Summer tourism is the major industry. Winter snow is the biggest  occurence. Along a three-block drive of kitsch shops, visitors can buy blue  wind chimes from Taiwan and T-shirts that say Canada.  </P> <P> Canada?  </P> <P> "It's hard to buy a Canadian souvenir in their Sault," Bob Smith, owner of a  block of such tourist emporiums as Ships Ahoy, Captains Quarters and the Anchor  and Seven Seas motels, explained. "This is where the tourists shop."  </P> <P> Since the signing of the free-trade pact between the two countries, the easy  commerce between the Saults has become even freer and easier.  </P> <P> "It seems to have opened up the gate," said Patrick Shannon, the Chippewa  County prosecutor on the Michigan side. "Trade hasn't changed, but all of a  sudden the Canadians have realized they can go shopping on our side. Crossing  the border isn't such an issue any more."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Law Enforcement Problem  </P> <P> That's a problem. Law enforcement in Sault, Mich., used to be a personal  matter. You knew who was having a family fight and who was driving home from  the bar.  </P> <P> With so many people crossing over these days, the town is full of strangers.  "We don't know who we're dealing with anymore," Shannon said.  </P> <P> Not all of the foreign trade is faring well.  </P> <P> American insurance companies have put a crimp in the once-booming business of  delivering babies in Ontario. Ten years ago, as many as 20% of the women  patients of an Ontario obstetrician, Dr. T. Orr, were Americans drawn by the  more-specialized services available in Ontario.  </P> <P> Now, with U.S. Medicare and many insurance companies refusing to pay for health  care outside the United States, foreigners make up only 8% of Orr's practice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Border Math'  </P> <P> Because the banks and bars, tourist centers and tollgates all set their own  exchange rates, commerce between the Saults can get complicated. Those who  cross frequently must master "border math."  </P> <P> Shurtliffe's wife, Ruth, for example, can figure which is cheaper: gasoline at  54 cents Canadian per liter or $1.21 American per gallon. That is considering  also that her Canadian dollar currently buys only 80 cents American and she has  to pay $1.50 to drive across the International Bridge.  </P> <P> It can get so confusing that many businesses accept the other country's  currency, even if it isn't legal tender. A Canadian dollar will buy as much  beer at David Dear's Back Door bar as a U.S. greenback.  </P> <P> "After all, we are the Twin Saults," Dear said. More than half of his customers  are Canadians.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Double Financial Whammy  </P> <P> With the American dollar worth more at the moment, U.S. residents who forget to  exchange their money for Canadian suffer a double whammy. Not only do most  Canadian businesses take U.S. currency at the lower Canadian value, but  Canadian prices often are higher.  </P> <P> "There is an advantage of having the right money on the right side at the right  time," said Linda Sumner, a Michigan tourist from Livonia.  </P> <P> Grant Putman, a farmer from Williamston, Mich., got caught in a Canadian  restaurant with hungry kids and only U.S. cash in his wallet. He paid American  and bought his food for 15% more than true cost.  </P> <P> "Of course, the waitress gave me my change in Canadian, so I was out there,  too," Putman said.  </P> <P> "I got even. I tipped her in Canadian."  </P></p>

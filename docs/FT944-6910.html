			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Chechen rebellion defeated President Dzhokhar Dudayev, the president of Chechnya, survived a determined attempt to overthrow him over the weekend as another burst of fierce fighting erupted in the Caucasian republic. United opposition forces launched an assault on Friday evening on Grozny, the republic's capital, and at one stage even claimed to have seized the presidential palace. But Mr Dudayev's forces appeared successfully to have repulsed the attack and claimed they had knocked out 20 opposition tanks. There were no clear reports of the number of casualties. Mr Dudayev, a former Soviet air force general, has resisted several attempts by Moscow-backed rebels to depose him since the Moslem republic of 1m people declared its independence from Russia three years ago. Yesterday, he accused Moscow of direct involvement in the latest coup attempt and warned that hostilities threatened to spread the war beyond the north Caucasus and 'throughout Russia'. Chechen security officials yesterday claimed to have captured 50 Russian fighters and paraded two of them before the press. But Russian officials vehemently denied direct participation in Chechnya. General Vladimir Potapov, chief of staff of the North-Caucasian military district, said reports suggesting Russian regular servicemen had been been taken prisoner in Grozny were 'malicious slander'. However, he did not rule out the possibility that former Russian servicemen could have been hired as mercenaries.</p>

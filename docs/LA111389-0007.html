			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAMAGED DESTROYER HEADS TO PORT UNDER OWN POWER  </P> <P> The Kinkaid, a San Diego-based Navy destroyer that collided with a merchant  ship off Malaysia on Sunday, is proceeding on its own power toward Singapore,  its original destination, a Navy spokesman said.  </P> <P> The collision between the Kinkaid and the Singapore merchant vessel, Kota  Petani, left one American sailor dead and five shipmates injured, according to  Cmdr. David L. Dillon, a spokesman for the Commander Naval Surface Force, U.S.  Pacific Fleet in San Diego.  </P> <P> Lt. Sean Michael McPhee, 24, of Santa Rosa, the destroyer's navigator, was  killed in the collision. The five other Navy personnel involved in the accident  were not seriously hurt.  </P> <P> No injuries were reported aboard the merchant vessel, Dillon added.  </P> <P> It was the sixth accident involving a Navy ships and aircraft in the last two  weeks. Seven sailors have been killed or lost at sea and 16 injured in the  string of accidents.  </P> <P> The Kinkaid and the accompanying frigate Rentz were deployed from San Diego on  June 16 and were en route to Singapore for a routine port call, according to  the Navy.  </P> <P> Several fires broke out aboard the Kinkaid and the Kota Petani when they  collided in the Strait of Malacca -- about 240 miles northwest of Singapore.  The strait runs between the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian island of  Sumatra, connecting the South China Sea and the Andaman Sea.  </P> <P> The fires aboard the destroyer were quickly contained and its crew, with help  from sailors on the Rentz, helped douse the flames aboard the Kota Petani,  Dillon said.  </P> <P> Navy officials said the Kinkaid was expected to reach Singapore about 12:30  a.m. PST today where it was to be met by Navy accident investigation, explosive  ordinance disposal and damage assessment teams that were dispatched from the  Subic Bay naval base in the Philippines. They will evaluate the damaged ship.  </P> <P> "Until she gets into port we really can't assess the damage," Petty Officer  David W. Morri said in San Diego.  </P> <P> Early reports indicated that the Kinkaid did incur damage -- the collision  gouged a 15 by 56 feet hole above the waterline on the destroyer's starboard  side. No major flooding was reported, Dillon said. The merchant vessel, which  is also headed for Singapore, sustained major damage to its bow.  </P> <P> The cause of the collision is under investigation. But initial reports indicate  that the merchant ship struck the destroyer, Dillon said.  </P> <P> "If you look at the angles, it appears that the merchant ship hit the Kinkaid,"  he said.  </P> <P> The Kinkaid, under Cmdr. John M. Cochrane, is a Spruance-class destroyer  commissioned in July, 1976. The ship is 563 feet long, 55 feet wide and  displaces 8,350 tons. It is designed to provide anti-submarine warfare  capabilities and it was deployed to the U.S. 7th Fleet. The destroyer carries  20 officers and 297 enlisted personnel, Navy officials said.  </P> <P> The other accidents involving Navy ships and aircraft in the past two weeks:  </P> <P> * On Nov. 9, a Navy Reserve A-7E Corsair II attack jet crashed into an  apartment complex in Smyrna. Ga., killing two people on the ground.  </P> <P> * On Nov. 1, nine sailors suffered smoke inhalation and four of those were  treated for burns following an early morning fire in a boiler aboard the tanker  Monongahela, some 500 miles west of Gibraltar.  </P> <P> * On Oct. 31, three sailors and a reported $4 million worth of non-nuclear  missiles were swept by a wave from the aircraft carrier Eisenhower near Cape  Hatteras, N.C. One sailor was missing and presumed dead.  </P> <P> * On Oct. 30, a sailor aboard the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson fell into the  Pacific about 620 miles north of Wake Island and was presumed lost.  </P> <P> * Also on Oct. 30, an F/A-18 pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided  missile cruiser Reeves in the Indian Ocean, causing minor injuries to five  sailors and blowing a five-foot hole in the ship's bow.  </P> <P> * On Oct. 29, a training jet crashed aboard the aircraft carrier Lexington in  the Gulf of Mexico, killing the pilot and four sailors on the ship.  </P></p>

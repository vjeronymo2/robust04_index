			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kazuichi Sekiguchi] </F>   [Text] Washington, 11 Jan -- The Governments of Japan and  the United States in their economic framework talks held the  fifth working-group meeting on the insurance sector in  Washington on 11 January, but failed to make any headway with  them continuing to differ over the question of objective  criteria. They will meet in Washington once again before the  vice ministerial-level meeting set for 24 and 25 January. The  insurance sector belongs to the priorirty area in the framework  talks, and the two governments are required to come up with a  report on it before the Japan-U.S. summit on 11 February, but it  is likely that the negotiations will drag on till the last  moment.    The two countries confronted each other over three points:  1)  the substance of the objective criteria; 2) the participation of  Japanese firms in the U.S. market; and 3) the scope of areas  where the government power is supposed to reach. The three  points are all those related to the countries' basic stands in  the framework talks. Even though the United States insists it is  "not seeking to set market-share targets on the premise of  taking retaliatory actions," it demands that shares comparable  to those in the industrialized nations (G-7) be cited as one of  the accepted objective criteria, while Japan is opposed to it.    The Japanese delegation insisted that the "cited market  share  will become de facto numerical targets." Japan also insists  that the Japanese companies' access to the U.S. insurance market  should be included in the talks, but the United States is  opposed to it.</p>

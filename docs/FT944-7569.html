			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Clarke may act over executive pay Shareholders may be given increased powers to curb excessive pay increases for top company executives, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, disclosed in the Commons yesterday. He revealed that the practical issues involved were under examination as the government came under renewed pressure to condemn the 75 per cent rise awarded to Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive. It is understood that the chancellor has had preliminary discussions with Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, about the legislative implications of increasing shareholder power. Mr Clarke ruled out renewed Labour demands for the imposition of a windfall tax on the excess profits of the privatised utilities, and for executive salaries to be brought within the regulatory regimes which oversee their pricing policies. He said he disapproved of large salary increases in any company which went far beyond what could be deemed reasonable in relation to their performance. The continuing chorus of disapproval about the rewards available to the heads of the privatised utilities dominated the final stages of the six-day debate on the Queen's Speech. Sir Edward Heath updated the phrase he used when, as prime minister, he condemned the activities of Lonrho, by describing Mr Brown's increase as the 'unacceptable post-privatisation face of capitalism'. He added: 'Why do I condemn it? Because it shows he has absolutely no understanding of public relations between his corporation and the public - absolutely none.' Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, also opposed a windfall tax - but called for excess profits to be returned to consumers through rebates. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the profit levels of the privatised utilities had increased by 50 per cent during the recession when other companies had been forced to cut back. He said the people of Britain were 'increasingly disgusted' by the excessive pay rises. Mr Brown also called for action in next week's Budget to 'end short-termism' in relation to dividends, but admitted that there was little prospect of the action materialising. Mr Clarke said he had been able to prepare the Budget against the background of the 'most encouraging set of economic prospects' for many years. The 'lasting recovery' that he intended to deliver would give real hope in the future 'for prosperity and for jobs'.</p>

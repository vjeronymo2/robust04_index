			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> QUAYLE CLAIMS HE SAVED SATELLITES  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National Space Council, has found  money to save two crucial environmental satellites from being shut down March  31, his office said today.  </P> <P> The Landsat satellites beam data and images to 14 ground stations worldwide.  </P> <P> Quayle and Mark Albrecht, executive secretary of the space council, met with  the primary users of the satellites on Monday, said Liz Murphy, a spokeswoman  for the vice president. Murphy said the users will provide money while the  panel evaluates the future of the program, but she added, "We don't have a  dollar amount."  </P> <P> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which needs $9.4 million  to keep Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 operating through the end of the fiscal year in  September, ordered the satellites shut down last Wednesday.  </P></p>

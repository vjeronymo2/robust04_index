			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- South Korea rebutted  Friday North Korea's recent proposals to replace the Armistice  Agreement with a peace treaty, saying the more immediate task is  resolution of the nuclear row.    "The root of the cause to the present tension and  instability  of the Korean peninsula is in North Korea's nuclear suspicion,"  a Foreign Ministry official said in a commentary, "therefore,  resolution of the nuclear problem is the priority task."    "North Korea should not attempt to blur the core of the  problem at the present stage and fully cooperate in solving the  nuclear problem," the official said.    Pyongyang leaders have recently stepped up their campaign to  replace the armistice pact with a peace agreement, urging the  United States to sit down for negotiations.    The armistice was signed at the end of the fratricidal  1950-1953 Korean war, and the two Koreas are technically still  at war in the absence of a peace treaty. Pyongyang insistently  refused to talk to Seoul about the replacement, reasoning that  South Korea was not a signatory to the armistice.    The Ministry official reminded that South and North Korea  already agreed at their prime ministers' talks in 1992 that the  two sides will work together to transfer the armistice into a  peace pact.    Until then, the inter-Korean agreement says the two sides  shall abide by the present military Armistice Agreement.    "The issue of establishing a new mechanism guaranteeing  peace  as proposed by the North is one that should be settled by South  and North Korea as directly involved parties, based on the  aforementioned agreement," the official said.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The ERM, Taking Stock: Economists bewildered by Bundesbank rate cut THE BUNDESBANK yesterday further cut the securities repurchase (repo) rate as a prelude to mopping up excess liquidity generated by last week's unprecedented currency turbulence. As with several recent actions of the German central bank, economists expressed some bewilderment at its decision to lower the repo rate to 6.80 per cent. Last week, the Bundesbank caused chaos in the currency markets by failing to follow up a cut in the repo rate from 7.15 to 6.95 per cent with a cut in the discount rate. After its council meeting on Thursday it did announce a cut in the Lombard rate by half a point to 7.75, a move which failed to appease markets. Mr Klaus Baader, European economist at UBS Global Research in London, said the bank's move yesterday was 'a surprise'. He said he found it curious that the bank had not seen fit to lower the discount rate last Thursday - as expected in financial markets - but was now ready to cut a rate which it regarded as more important. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said on Monday the repo rate was more relevant to monetary policy than the discount rate because it affected a monthly volume of funds three times as large at DM150bn (Pounds 58bn). Banks use repos for 14-day refinancing, though the Bundesbank also requested bids on 28-day variable rate repos. At Monday's news conference in Bonn, Mr Schlesinger said the repo rate had come down by around three points since last September. The latest reduction, affecting funds allocated at today's tender, puts the repo unusually close to the discount rate level. Some DM75bn of funds comes up for renewal today. But the Bundesbank is expected to reduce its allocation of new funds sharply - perhaps by some DM25bn - in order to drain liquidity after the inflows caused by support for the French franc. Money market rates fell yesterday as funds generated by the intervention came on to the market. Call money was traded at around 6.5 per cent, down from just below 7 per cent on Monday. Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank director, said on Friday the bank would not act to stop money market rates falling below the 6.75 per cent discount rate if intervention in the European monetary system led to a flood of liquidity. The Bundesbank must neutralise this inflow to minimise the impact on money supply and thus on inflation, both of which are still growing faster than it likes. For this reason it has been reluctant to cut official interest rates faster. John Ridding in Paris adds: The signals from the French bond and money markets suggest that investors are cautious about the prospect of rapid interest rate cuts by the French government. The markets have taken their lead from statements by Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, and by Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, that the government would not rush into interest rate cuts and that the stability of the franc remains a priority. Economists in Paris said the first step towards a reduction in interest rates would be the reintroduction of 5-10 day borrowing facilities, suspended last week in an attempt to bolster the French financial authorities' defence of the franc. The 5-10 day rates were replaced by an overnight borrowing facility, the rate of which was raised from 7.75 per cent to 10 per cent. 'I think we could see 5-10 day borrowing reintroduced by the beginning of next week at a rate of 7.75 per cent' said Ms Marie-Owens Thomsen, international economist at Midland Global Markets. But most economists felt the government would not move to cut the official intervention rate - which sets the floor for money market interest rates - from its current level of 6.75 per cent until the franc shows signs that it has stabilised following the widening of exchange rate fluctuation bands on Monday. The message from the bond markets reflected this view. Four-year government bonds, for example, saw yields increase by about 14 basis points to about 5.62 per cent, reflecting a more cautious outlook on reduced borrowing costs. In the money markets, overnight borrowing rates remained relatively stable at between 11 and 13 per cent, sharply down on last week's peak of almost 40 per cent at the height of the assault on the franc. One month and three month rates were about 9 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively. The bond futures market, however, indicated expectations that French interest rates will ultimately fall. The Paris Interbank Offer Rate futures contracts show that the markets are anticipating three-month interest rates of just over 6 per cent in September and 5.2 per cent in December.</p>

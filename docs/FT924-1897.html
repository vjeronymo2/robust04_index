			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Russia - The Future of Reform: Yeltsin refuses to lose faith in reforms - But it remains to be seen if the new PM will safeguard them A PIECING together of the events of the past few days shows Russian President Boris Yeltsin made many mistakes: but one of them has not been to lose his faith in his reforms. He remains committed to it - though there are some among the foreign observers who fear he may be too sanguine in thinking Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin will safeguard them. The Russian president had, in the two weeks of the Congress, appeared lacklustre and passive. He had made a series of compromises - in sacking Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, the information minister and a close ally before the Congress and Mr Gennady Burbulis, his closest aide, last weekend; in allowing parliament to have the right of veto over the ministers of foreign affairs, defence, interior and security; and in the direction of the reform programme itself. In spite of these concessions, the deputies refused to vote for Mr Yegor Gaidar, his choice as prime minister, last Wednesday - though by only 18 votes. Mr Yeltsin's sudden announcement last Thursday that he would hold a referendum of 'trust' between himself and the Congress, should have been the beginning of a populist presidential campaign, Yeltsin against the conservatives, just as it had been before he took over the governance of Russia. It did not work out so: his appeal for his supporters in the Congress to follow him was heeded by fewer than 200: pro-Yeltsin demonstrations were small. Congress kept its quorum and the next day Mr Yeltsin agreed to negotiations and compromise with Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker. The compromise was to hold a referendum - but on the outlines of a new constitution, not on a straight choice between Congress and president. It also gave Congress a 'soft' vote on candidates for the role of prime minister. Mr Yeltsin would choose from a short list of three and the new prime minister would be in place if Congress supported his choice. If not, the president could use special powers to nominate an acting prime minister for three months. On Sunday and Monday, the word from presidential and government circles was that all had been settled - though it was admitted that accidents might happen. The Gaidar team, and Mr Gaidar himself, were prepared for a new prime minister: they had decided they could work either under the direction of Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a deputy prime minister and sturdy supporter of Mr Gaidar: or a new figure, Mr Victor Kadannikov, managing director of the AvtoVaz car plant, who is head of the new government advisory commission on industry. On Monday afternoon, the vote was taken on five candidates of whom Mr Yeltsin approved: these were Mr Gaidar, Mr Kadannikov, Mr Chernomyrdin, Mr Shumeiko - and Mr Yuri Skokov, Mr Yeltsin's tough, and conservative, chief of staff. The deputies knew all of the candidates except Mr Kadannikov - who arrived flustered and late to the Congress, having been summoned to Moscow only on Monday by Mr Yeltsin (he flew from Togliatti, on the Volga, in Mr Yeltsin's private aircraft). He was thus given the floor, and made a poor impression: on the floor of Congress, fiddling with the unfamiliar sound equipment, he said: 'We in Togliatti approve the reforms in general. There have been mistakes . . . but I am afraid I have no experience of government . . . I may not make a good prime minister.' The deputies then voted: Mr Skokov topped the poll, with 637; Mr Chernomyrdin was a close second, with 621; Mr Gaidar ran a poor third with 400; Mr Kadannikov came just after him, on 399; and Mr Shumeiko was decisively last, on 283. Mr Yeltsin asked for a 40-minute break: huddled with Mr Gaidar, he asked his prime minister to resign. Mr Gaidar refused, pushing the president to make a decision. Mr Yeltsin asked him for his preference between Mr Skokov and Mr Chernomyrdin: Mr Gaidar, certain that Mr Skokov had no interest in reform, chose his cabinet colleague. Mr Yeltsin went back to the Congress, said he was still for Mr Gaidar but that Mr Gaidar himself had agreed to Mr Chernomyrdin becoming prime minister. Mr Gaidar, walking out of the Congress hall, told waiting reporters he would resign, 'and not come back'. In the course of these events it has not seemed that Mr Yeltsin has had a strategy - rather that he played an ad hoc hand, possibly with conflicting advice. His support for Mr Gaidar appeared the consistent thread - until, at the very end, when it lay within his power to sustain him in office for a further three months, he dropped him. He was, say those close to him, weary and fractious. It seemed he could not face another bruising battle with a Congress which would have been outraged that their first and second choices had been passed over - though both his friends and his enemies expected exactly that choice to be made. In so acting, he at first seemed to have lost all: authority, support from the radicals and the symbol of his reform programme. The explanations of his aides - that 'Mr Gaidar was, after all, unpopular and Mr Chernomyrdin is well known to the president, and trusted' seemed like a post hoc rationalisation. At the same time, however, the dust was rapidly settling in Moscow. There were no further resignations from the cabinet and the impression gained by both the German ministers here with Chancellor Helmut Kohl for talks and from international finance officials who had talked to deputy ministers was that most if not all of the 'Gaidar team' would stay. Mr Chernomyrdin underlined, several times, that he had been an active member of the reform cabinet and that the reform course would remain.</p>

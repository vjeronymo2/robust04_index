			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Fashion house static after charge for Macy's LIZ CLAIBORNE, the US fashion designer and clothing manufacturer, yesterday announced static fourth-quarter profits after taking a Dollars 3.4m charge relating to R. H. Macy, the New York-based department store chain which filed for bankruptcy last month. Liz Claiborne, reckoned to be one of Macy's largest suppliers, on January 30 announced it would take a charge in the fourth quarter. Macy's problems came to a head after Christmas when it delayed payments to suppliers. In its January statement, Liz Claiborne said it planned to resume shipping to Macy's given that interim financing arrangements for the retailer had been agreed by the bankruptcy courts, and it remained a 'strong supporter' of Macy's management. After the charge, the company reported profits for the fourth quarter of Dollars 56.5m after tax, compared with Dollars 55.7m a year earlier, on sales of Dollars 530.7m (Dollars 468.2). This translated into earnings per share of 66 cents (65 cents). The Macy's-related charge lopped off 0.04 cents. For the year, Claiborne reported a net profit of Dollars 222.7m, compared with Dollars 205.8m in 1990. Sales were Dollars 2bn, against Dollars 1.73bn. The company acknowledged the retail climate had been 'difficult and unsettled', but said it was pleased with its progress in the light of that. The Limited, the fashion retailer and once one of the stars of the sector, reported an extremely modest 1.2 per cent improvement in full-year profits to February 1, of Dollars 403.3m after tax. In the previous 12 months, the company - which takes in the Victoria's Secret brands and Penhaligon's perfumes - made Dollars 398.4m. Sales rose by 17 per cent to Dollars 6.15bn. In the fourth quarter, net profits advanced from Dollars 172.2m to Dollars 200.3m, on sales of Dollars 2.05bn (Dollars 1.74m).</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEW ATTEND CHICAGO MEMORIAL SERVICE  </P> <P> A City Council session called Friday to mark the second anniversary of Mayor  Harold Washington's death was scratched when only about a dozen of the city's  50 aldermen showed up.  </P> <P> Although some attributed the low turnout to continued divisions on the council,  most called it a question of scheduling and said the city's first black mayor  would be honored Monday instead.  </P> <P> Mayor Richard M. Daley's press secretary, Avis LaVelle, said notice was too  short. The gathering was announced by Alderman Robert Shaw on Wednesday  afternoon.  </P> <P> "This is not some sinister plot," LaVelle said. "It's a reality of the holiday  season. Many people had longstanding vacation plans or arranged to take today  off."  </P></p>

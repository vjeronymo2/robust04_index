			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   `Partial Endorsement' of East Rand Peace Plan --  Johannesburg  THE STAR in English on 3 February in a page-12 editorial  contends that the peace plan announced by President de Klerk and  African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson Mandela "merits  partial endorsement only." First, the plan "has not won the  approval of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], mainly because of  the decision to withdraw policemen from the Internal Stability  Division [ISD] and replace them with Defence Force units. The  IFP has described the withdrawal of ISD men as a `treacherous  betrayal' of undertakings given by De Klerk." THE STAR believes  the IFP "is a force in the townships," and its grievances are  therefore "a cause for concern." The second "major weakness" is  the plan's "failure to deal with the question of ANC-aligned  self-defence units, whose reputation as predatory vigilantes was  underlined by the Goldstone Commission late last year. The  omission accentuates suspicion of bias in favour of the ANC."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   ANC Doubts About Relationship With Thebe Corporation -- "It  is appropriate that the announcement of the African Life deal  occurred in the same week as ANC President Nelson Mandela,  belatedly, gave the first official indication that his  organisation was developing doubts about its relationship with  the Thebe Investment Corporation," declares a page-10 editorial  in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 3 February. "Mandela  clearly identified the Thebe problem on Monday when he conceded  it would be undesirable for a company to be closely associated  with a governing party, or for that party to control a large  corporation which would be competing with other businesses."  "The African Life initiative is a conscious attempt to expand  black economic influence and control in the sphere of 'big  business'. And it occurs without the artificial buttresses,  such as quotas and government favours, which often give  affirmative action activities an initial boost but leave them  ill-equipped to deal with the real world. Thebe's prospects  will be immeasurably improved if it adopts a similar method."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   `Big Flaw' in East Rand Peace Plan -- Johannesburg SOWETAN  in  English on 3 February in a page-10 editorial sees a "big flaw"  in the East Rand peace plan unveiled by President F.W. de Klerk  and Nelson Mandela because the IFP did not participate in the  conception and implementation of the plan. SOWETAN has "always  argued" that "poverty and the abject living conditions" in areas  like Katlehong and Thokoza "are at the root of the violence."  The peace plan "obviously needs the consent and co-operation of  all those involved in the conflict to succeed. Gaining the  support of IFP members is therefore a prerequisite." The "onus  is now on the newly deployed SADF units to assuage the fears of  IFP members by acting against the perpetrators of violence in a  non-partisan and unbiased manner and affording protection to all  township residents."</p>

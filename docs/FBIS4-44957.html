			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Counselor Raja' al-'Arabi, attorney general </F> of Egypt, by Suhayr al-Husayni; place and date not given: "1994  Is the Year of the End of Troubles for Capital Investors and  Settlement of Their Claims"--first paragraph is AKHIR SA'AH  introduction]    [Text] Issue No. 1: Counselor Raja' al-'Arabi, by virtue of  his work as a prosecutor for more than 30 years, is used to  asking questions and exercising the authority of an  investigator. But in this meeting I asked his permission for us  to change roles. I brought up with him a number of important  issues that reflect the concerns and worries of Egyptian  citizens. The questions were bold and direct, and the replies  were confident and definite, and they reflected the man's candor  and clarity. It was only natural that the first matter to be  brought up in an interview with the attorney general was the  case involving the victims of the investment companies.    [Al-Husayni] The attorney Shawqi al-Sayyid received a  judgment from the courts concerned obliging the state to give  back the investors' capital. Why has this judgment not been  carried out so far, and to what extent can it be carried out?    [Al-'Arabi] A news item really has appeared to the effect  that one of the courts has issued a judgment which obliges the  state to give back the investors' capital. However, this news  item is totally devoid of the truth. What really happened is  that three investors of capital in small investment companies  filed a lawsuit against the owners of the investment companies  and the state in which they demanded that they give back the  investors' capital. The court appointed an expert to determine  the value of this capital and the deposits, who should pay them,  who was responsible for their not being paid so that a judgment  can be rendered against these persons. After that, the case was  delayed until the expert could present his fees, and the case is  still in the courts. This is why this news item was totally  false.  <H5>  Responsibility of the State </H5>   [Al-Husayni] Leaving aside this news item, what is your  comment concerning what some investors are saying to the effect  that the intervention of the state and law agencies such as the  Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the State  Prosecutor between the investment companies and the investors is  the reason for the obstruction of the process restoring the  claims of the investors against these companies?    [Al-'Arabi] There is no sound basis for saying this, because  the state did not intervene in the matter of the investment  companies until after it became a problem. In fact, it did not  do this until the investors demanded that the state intervene.  Just so I don't forget, let us go back and review what happened.  What we see is that many loud voices demanded that the state  quickly intervene. And when the state legally intervened, these  companies were exposed, because they had not been operating on  sound bases. The state intervened on the basis of the wish of  the masses of people in order to protect the Egyptian economy  and in order to protect the investors themselves. The reason is  that, since fraudalent acts were taking place, it was possible  for these companies to go bankrupt and for their owners to flee  abroad. In the case of some companies, this really happened. In  such a case, the investors will not get any of their money back.  This is why the state intervened and issued a law regulating  activity in these companies. When the law was put into effect,  these companies were exposed and they stumbled after they were  unable to reconcile their situations with the law. For this  reason, they were then attached.    Even yesterday, some of the owners of the small investment  companies, who had been jailed and whose cases were still before  the courts, demanded the authorization of the attorney general  to sell the assets of their companies so that they could pay the  investors what they owed them--in spite of the fact that this  long period of time had gone by without their even thinking of  authorizing anyone to do so.    It was possible for me, as the attorney general, not to  intervene at all in this matter, and to wait until judgments  were issued against the owners of these companies. And it was  likely that the verdict would be that the owners of these  companies would be acquitted and we would be forced to turn over  the capital to them, and after that it would not be our concern  what they would do with the investors.    But what I did as attorney general--especially since it is  well known that cases such as these drag on a long time in the  courts--was to offer to let the owners of the companies who were  the defendants return to the investors what they owed them by  means of what they would earn from the sales. This is what we  are doing right now. I believe that, if the Office of the  Attorney General had not intervened and undertaken the sales  operations itself, no one would have gotten the prices at which  we are selling, because purchasers have boundless trust in the  Office of the Attorney General. This is why we are getting  higher prices than what the market prices are. For example, a  plot of land that was owned by the al-Sharif Company was offered  for sale by means of an auction after being advertised in the  newspapers. Only one company offered to buy it, and the amount  offered was 17 million Egyptian pounds. I cancelled this auction  and did not accept the price because, in my opinion, the price  was not high enough. Then I authorized a bank to sell this land.  The bank then negotiated with the company which came to the  auction, and the result was that the price of the land rose to  22 million instead of 17 million Egyptian pounds, with the  company asking for some easy terms dealing with the payment  period. However, I even rejected this offer, and I finally sold  the plot of land for 24 million Egyptian pounds. Nevertheless,  all I hear is blame that is being cast on us now because this  activity is not within our domain. Let it be known to everyone  that it really is not my job to do buying or selling. But  sometimes I occupy myself with such a matter in order to solve a  national problem that could affect the nation's higher interest,  especially since millions of Egyptian families were victims of  these companies. After all, should the attorney general remain  silent and just look on as a big problem occurs that we might  not be able to solve later on--particularly since we fear that  there are some individuals or parties who have an interest in  seeing the problem continue to exist, without a solution? I say  that I fear this, but I am not accusing anyone in particular.    [Al-Husayni] Who are these parties that have an interest in  seeing the problem of the investment companies remain unsolved?    [Al-'Arabi] I am not accusing anybody in particular. But, as  I mentioned, I am afraid that there are those who have an  interest in having this problem remain in existence and not be  solved.  <H5>  Convicted Investor Makes Business Contacts </H5>   [Al-Husayni] The fact that Ahmad Tawfiq al-Rayyan left  prison  to administer the capital of the investors has made many people  inquire, with astonishment, whether or not a person who has been  sentenced to hard labor because he was not trustworthy  concerning investors' money and rights should be allowed to  administer this capital once again?    [Al-'Arabi] Ahmad Tawfiq [al-Rayyan] did not leave prison in  order to administer the capital of the al-Rayyan Company. What  happened is that the Office of Confiscation [idarat  al-tahaffudh] occasionally requests that he be let out of jail  in order to make contacts to get buyers for the company's  assets. Ahmad al-Rayyan does not administer the capital, because  he does not have the right to do so after being sentenced to  hard labor. This makes it illegal for him to undertake any  administration or disposal [of such capital]. A "caretaker" has  been appointed for him. In addition to this, Ahmad al-Rayyan,  after being sentenced, authorized me, as the attorney general,  to sell the company's assets. For this reason, when we bring him  to the Office of Confiscation, we do this because this man has  numerous contacts with many people who could buy the company's  assets. I utilize him, but I do not let him administer the  capital. I, in turn, should be asking: How could a man who is in  prison and has been sentenced to hard labor be allowed to  administer capital such as this? This is impossible, but we are  still being hounded by these rumors.    [Al-Husayni] Concerning the administration of the investment  companies' capital, there are those who are wondering whether or  not the Office of the Attorney General has people who are  qualified financially and business-wise to administer capital  totalling more than 1.5 billion Egyptian pounds.    [Al-'Arabi] As for administration of the capital of the  investment companies, the Office of the Attorney General does  not intervene in the manner that is imagined. However, we  entrust this work to people who did this administrative work  before--in exchange for the payment of certain fees. What we do  is supervise this work. This supervision is done by means of an  accounts monitoring agency that audits all of the transactions  undertaken by those undertaking the administration so that no  fraud takes place. So, as far as the office is concerned, the  administration [of these companies] is not considered to be a  problem. The work is done under the supervision of the Capital  Attachment Office, and experts are sent to audit the  transactions of the administrators who supervise the  administration in order to see if there are any irregularities.  If any irregularities are found, we call to account the person  who is at fault, and this is not something that is difficult to  do. In fact, we did succeed in paying back the capital to all of  the investors in some of the small investment companies when  their owner requested that the office settle his situation.  <H5>  Overlapping Spheres of Activity </H5>   [Al-Husayni] The Office of the State Prosecutor General is  also working on the administration of millions [of Egyptian  pounds] of capital deposited by investors in the investment  companies. Is this not considered to be duplication and  overlapping in spheres of activity, especially since it is a  known fact that the Office of the State Prosecutor deals with  economic issues?    [Al-'Arabi] This is no duplication or overlapping in the  spheres of activity, and each office is preceding along its path  in accordance with the system that it is governed by.    [Al-Husayni] Do you mean that there is coordination between  the Office of the State Prosecutor and the Office of the  Attorney General, in the sense that each of them deals with  particular types of cases, in accordance with the system of  operation in each of the offices?    [Al-'Arabi] No, there are no specializations involved. But  each office does its work in accordance with the complaints that  it receives. Furthermore, if the complaints involve the  occurrence of a crime, then they become the sphere of activity  of the Office of the Attorney General.    [Al-Husayni] The investment company cases, in general,  involve crimes such as swindling, committing fraud in order to  gain control of the capital of investors, and refusal to make  payments.    [Al-'Arabi] The establishment of capital investment  companies, in general, is something that is governed by law, and  any violation of this law constitutes a definite crime, and this  falls within the sphere of authority of the attorney general.  For this reason, most of the investment company cases come to  our office. However, what has happened is that some of those who  deposited capital in the investment companies took their  complaints to the Office of the State Prosecutor General either  before coming to the Office of the Attorney General or before  our office could take measures. The Office of the State  Prosecutor has been faster when it comes to taking measures  dealing with attachment. In order that the owner of a company  not be subjected to attachment in two different agencies, the  Office of the Attorney General is starting to follow the path of  dealing with criminal cases and lawsuits, and is allowing the  state prosecutor to take the other steps and measures, as long  as the perpetrator of the criminal act has been subjected to  attachment by the Office of the State Prosecutor.    [Al-Husayni] What is your response to those who say that it  would be more correct and appropriate to entrust the  administration of the investment companies to banks since they  have expertise in dealing with financial and business  transactions?    [Al-'Arabi] The answer is simple. The Office of the Attorney  General right now does not undertake the administration of the  capital of the investment companies. However, our office does  undertake the liquidation of the assets of these companies and  hands over the earnings from the liquidation to the investors,  the owners of this capital. We basically do not resort to  relying on the administrative method. The reason for this is  that, if we had decided to repay the investors by means of  administering the capital of these companies, these investors  would have to wait 20 or 30 years before receiving the full  amount of their repayments. This is why we resorted to the  method of immediate liquidation of these companies by means of  selling them off, in order that the investors be repaid faster.  Also, banks do not purchase the assets of these companies, but  it is possible for them to finance buyers. This has actually  happened in the case of some banks.  <H5>  Investors' Troubles Will End in 1994 </H5>   [Al-Husayni] The problem of the investors and the investment  companies has been in your office since 1988, that is, for six  years, but the victims of these companies still have not been  payed what they are owed, and this is in spite of the fact that  statements are continually being made to the effect that a  solution to the problem is near at hand. This has caused the  investors to become desperate and frustrated.    [Al-'Arabi] Our office has had the problem of the investment  companies since 1988. But I only took up the problem in 1991,  when I was appointed attorney general. Therefore I am not  responsible for the preceding period. Also, I am only  responsible for statements that I myself make. Concerning the  al-Rayyan case, I have fulfilled my promise to the investors and  they have actually received 10 percent of their capital back.  And now we have enough money to pay them another 10 percent.  Right now we are undertaking an urgent study, which will be  finished this week. There are businessmen and plant owners who  are prepared to offer goods and products to the investors. Thus,  instead of receiving 10 percent in the form of cash, it would be  possible for them to receive goods worth 20 or 30 percent of  what they are owed.    [Al-Husayni] Are these goods produced by the al-Rayyan and  al-Sharif companies, as was previously the case?    [Al-'Arabi] No. These goods are produced by Egyptian plants  in general.    [Al-Husayni] Will the owners of these plants furnish these  goods and products in return for their purchase of the assets of  the investment companies?    [Al-'Arabi] No. The owners of these plants will provide  these  goods immediately. Then they will give us a chance to sell the  assets of the companies and pay them what we owe them after  that. An agreement actually has been reached with them. This  will enable us to achieve more than one goal. First of all, it  will stimulate Egyptian industry, and secondly, the investors  will be paid back what is owed to them at greater rates than  would be possible if we paid them only with the money that we  have available right now.    [Al-Husayni] People have been very patient, but they are  wondering when the problem of the investors and the capital  investment companies will be solved once and for all?    [Al-'Arabi] If the rate of sales continues at its present  pace, I am hoping that the troubles of the investors will end in  1994. I am trying extremely hard to have the problem of the  capital investment companies be solved by the end of this year.  If some loose ends concerning this problem remain, they will be  very simple matters and will be beyond my control. I should  remark that this matter is one that requires a great deal of  effort. For example, if the al-Rayyan investors are paid back 10  percent of what they are owed, this means that we have to pay  them more than 150 million Egyptian pounds. The same situation  applies to the al-Sharif investors. So let the investors be  lenient with me and give me a chance to be able to finish this  task as it should be done and as I hope to do it.    [Al-Husayni] What about the investors with the al-Sa'd  Company? Will their troubles also come to an end, and will they  get paid back in 1994?    [Al-'Arabi] The al-Sa'd case is being taken up by the Office  of the Attorney General as a criminal case. But the capital of  the al-Sa'd Company has been attached by the Office of the State  Prosecutor General. Therefore you should ask the state  prosecutor general about what is owed to the al-Sa'd investors.  <H5>  Emergency Law Powers </H5>   [Issue No. 2: In its interview with the attorney general,  AKHIR SA'AH then took up the matter of the Emergency Law, which  has been put into effect for an additional three years.]    [Al-Husayni] The renewal of the Emergency Law for three more  years has led us to wonder what the effect of this law has been  on the work and investigations conducted by the Office of the  Attorney General. We are wondering, in particular, whether or  not it is true--as some members of the opposition have been  saying--that it is difficult for accused persons to receive  complete justice when this law is being applied.    [Al-'Arabi] The Emergency Law is like any other law. It does  not affect the rules of conducting investigations according to  which we proceed. There is no dispute about the fact that the  Office of the Attorney General does its job, whether according  to the Emergency Law, the Criminal Procedure Law, or any other  law. In our agency, work is being conducted according to one  system and one set of guarantees.    [Al-Husayni] However, it is being said that the Emergency  Law  gives the Office of the Attorney General additional powers that  might diminish the rights of citizens when they are subject to  investigations.    [Al-'Arabi] All of the guarantees provided to accused  persons  by the Criminal Procedure Law apply to them completely under the  Emergency Law. Perhaps what is meant by this talk is the fact  that the Emergency Law grants to the Office of the Attorney  General the authority to use pre-trial detention in connection  with crimes subject to this law. An example of this is the  powers of the investigative judge. This is not considered to be  an additional prerogative of the Office of the Attorney General.  Many laws already give our office this authority. The most  recent is Law No. 105 dealing with the establishment of State  Security Courts which gives the Office of the Attorney General,  in connection with crimes such as bribery and embezzlement as  well as crimes which violate the internal and external security  of the state, the powers of an investigative judge when  investigating crimes such as these, and they include pre-trial  detention. Thus the Emergency Law does not at all affect the  work done by the Office of the Attorney General. Perhaps the  effect of this law is to be found in the name of the type of  trial in accordance with which the accused is tried, as well as  the procedure of certification of judgments which differs from  that of appeals against judgments. This is a matter which does  not affect or directly apply to the work done by the Office of  the Attorney General.    [Al-Husayni] Since we are talking about pre-trial detention,  [I should mention that] it is a known fact that pre-trial  detention of the accused before conviction is a matter which  infringes upon his freedom. It is supposed to be used only to a  very limited extent, such as if one fears that the accused will  flee or if the accused has no known address. However, it should  be remarked that the Office of the Attorney General has started  utilizing this authority in a way which transforms it into a  type of penal authority.    [Al-'Arabi] That does not happen at all. Pre-trial detention  is a preventive measure done in order to guarantee that justice  be carried out. It generally is done when one fears that the  accused will obtain access to witnesses, will influence them, or  will tamper with the evidence of a case. Pre-trial detention is  not a punishment, as you have said it is. The Office of the  Attorney General does not inflict any punishment on any  individual. However, in big cases such as cases of terrorism, it  is possible that the accused persons will have known addresses,  but should one release them? The same applies to bribery and  embezzlement cases. Should we release the accused persons so  that they would tamper with the evidence of the case or gain  access to the witnesses before they come to trial? In cases such  as these, the accused is detained before trial, and when the  investigation is over, he is either charged with the crime and  brought to trial as a prisoner or he is released.    But as for what is being said about the Office of the  Attorney General expanding its use of pre-trial detention, this  has not happened--unless you have already done a statistical  survey [and found this to be true]. Even if this has happened,  we could undertake a statistical survey which would show that  the number of crimes has increased. Consequently, there has not  been any expansion in the use of this right on the part of the  Office of the Attorney General.    [Issue No. 3: The interview then switched over to the issue  dealing with journalists.]    [Al-Husayni] Permit me at this point to speak as a  journalist  and a member of the Journalists' Union. We have come to feel a  sense of alarm concerning the steps being taken against  journalists when they are being investigated in cases dealing  with the publication of news. These steps conflict with the  guarantees provided to them by the Union Law, the Press  Authority Law, and other laws.    [Al-'Arabi] First of all, there is no problem between the  attorney general's apparatus and the journalists. Secondly, what  are the reasons for the alarm and the fear? When has the Office  of the Attorney General ever dealt with a journalist in a way  that violates his freedom or conflicts with the Press Authority  Law?    [Al-Husayni] This actually did happen with some of my  colleagues who were being investigated recently in connection  with cases concerning the publication of news. They were  arrested, detained, and then released on bail in a manner that  violates the text of the Press Authority Law in Article No. 135  of the Criminal Procedure Law.    [Al-'Arabi] It is very unfortunate that the newspapers are  publishing and circulating talk like this that has no basis in  fact. I mentioned this in a response to the head of the  Journalists' Union. Also, we should differentiate between the  measures taken by the Office of the Attorney General and those  taken by others. The question is: Has the Office of the Attorney  General ever ordered the arrest of a journalist? This has never  happened. Has the Office of the Attorney General ever put a  journalist in jail for the purpose of pre- trial detention? This  has never happened.    [Al-Husayni] Who are these others, and do they have the  authority to commit these deeds that are in violation of the law?    [Al-'Arabi] Don't ask me about others, for the simple reason  that I do not know the facts concerning the problem. Any  journalist who says that there is a problem between him and the  Office of the Attorney General, and does not submit a written  complaint so that I can take investigative measures such as I do  with any case, is indisputably mistaken. Often citizens come to  me with complaints about the behavior of members of the Office  of the Attorney General. These complaints are submitted in  writing, and then the Judicial Inspection Agency begins looking  into them. And if a mistake has been committed, the person who  made the mistake is immediately called to account. But as far as  journalists are concerned, so far I have not received a single  complaint. The problem has only been brought up on the pages of  the newspapers. I am not responsible for dealing with what has  been brought up on the pages of newspapers. We always say that  any citizen who has a complaint against a member of the Office  of the Attorney General, a member of the judicial authority, or  anyone else has to submit the complaint to us in order that we  conduct the investigation concerning it so that we can verify  the truth and seriousness of the complaint. I often receive  complaints in which citizens complain against each other. It is  more appropriate for me to receive complaints against the agency  that works with me. But, in this case, a matter is being brought  up in the newspapers or at Journalists' Union meetings in order  to have me make decisions based on only one point of view--that  of the journalists. Have you even listened to the other point of  view?    [Al-Husayni] What is the other point of view it would be  possible for us to listen to now?    [Al-'Arabi] I am not the person with an opinion concerning  the case you are talking about. I am an investigative party. For  this reason, the journalist who is the aggrieved party should  have submitted a complaint in order that it be investigated.  Then we would have announced which party was in the  wrong--whether it was the journalist, the prosecuting attorney,  or the advocate general. I have received a letter from the  Journalists' Union, which made its demands as a result of what  happened. But I ask--on what basis does the Journalists' Union  reach this verdict? Would it not be sounder if the journalist  who is the aggrieved party were to submit a complaint in order  that it be investigated? When one of the members of the Office  of the Attorney General is found guilty, then we will determine  the claims.    [Al-Husayni] As the person responsible for the Office of the  Attorney General, [do you know whether or not] there is a  dispute concerning providing the guarantees that are guaranteed  by the Journalists' Law?    [Al-'Arabi] Do the Press Authority and the Press Law forbid  questioning and investigating a journalist if we have received a  particular complaint [about him]? What happens is, whenever  someone submits a complaint to us about a particular person or  party, the law determines for us the bases on which we may  investigate these complaints. I deny that anyone in the Office  of the Attorney General has violated the guarantees provided for  in the law in the case of any person in our society, whether a  journalist or not. If any journalist, in his opinion, feels that  an investigator has resorted to procedures outside the law in  his investigation with him, then he must submit a complaint to  us in order that we investigate it. When such a journalist does  not receive what he feels is owed to him, then the attacks in  the newspapers begin. Casting suspicion on the Office of the  Attorney General, which is a fundamental branch of the  judiciary, is not in anyone's interest, especially if the other  point of view is not listened to. This is why I was hoping that  someone would contact us or submit a written complaint  concerning what occurred to him that was outside the law, so  that we could then investigate the matter.    It is being said that we did not notify the Journalists'  Union before an investigation. First of all, the law has not  determined the manner in which we are supposed to notify the  Journalists' Union. When a representative from the union is  present with the journalist during the investigation, does this  not constitute notification of the union? What was said would be  true if the investigation had been carried out without the  presence of a representative. And if the journalist were present  without a representative from the union, the prosecuting  attorney would not be able to ask him any questions. A  journalist has the right to tell the prosecuting attorney that  he will not talk to him unless a representative from the union  is present.    [Al-Husayni] Did you conduct an investigation into  complaints  by journalists?    [Al-'Arabi] Certainly I asked questions and investigated,  but  I will not talk about the results of this investigation, because  so far I have not received a [written] complaint from anyone.  <H5>  The Law and Economic Crimes </H5>   [Al-Husayni] Issue No. 4: Let us now switch over to another  issue, which is that of the spread of economic crimes recently  to a degree which threatens the processes of development and  national security in Egypt. In your personal estimation, and by  virtue of your position as attorney general, do you feel that  crimes of this type have increased to the point that they  require the issuance of new laws and new legislation to  decisively deal with them?    [Al-'Arabi] I don't believe that we need more laws. The laws  that we have on the books are enough. But we do need more  decisiveness and experience when dealing with cases of this  type. So in spite of the fact that we abolished the prosecuting  offices that specialized in some types of crimes, we have not  changed anything as far as the economic crimes are concerned.  Thus we have the Public Property Prosecution Office, the  Financial and Administrative Affairs Prosecution Office, and the  Tax Prosecution Office. All of these prosecution offices  specialize in economic crimes. In addition to this, we are  constantly endeavoring to provide support for these prosecution  offices by means of providing new expertise and specializations  and holding high-level training courses for men from the  Attorney General's Office at the National Criminal Investigation  Center as support for our practical training.    [Al-Husayni] What is your opinion concerning the proposal  made by some specialists concerning issuing new legislation to  regulate the use of checks?    [Al-'Arabi] My opinion is that, as far as the current  economic situation and those persons dealing in the financial  market are concerned, if we put controls on the use of checks  that would be stricter than they are now, this would have some  negative consequences. For example, it is possible that trade  and commerce would suffer some degree of stagnation.    Also, this might cause some difficulties for employees who  purchase their basic necessities on the installment plan. Why  not leave things as they are until economic conditions improve?  If we slap restrictions on checks, we will find merchants then  becoming afraid to deal with checks. For this reason, I feel  that we should wait a while so that we do not affect the  situation that currently exists between buyers and sellers.  <H5>  Terrorism Issues </H5>   [Al-Husayni] Issue No. 5: Egypt has experienced many waves  of  terrorism during the last 40 years, and [most of the time] such  terrorism has been dealt with and ended in the space of just a  few months, as was the case with the Muslim Brotherhood in 1948,  1965, and 1970. What are the reasons for the continuation of the  current wave of terrorism that began in 1990? Is it because of  the expertise the terrorists have acquired as a result of their  previous experience, or is it because they are taking advantage  of the climate of freedom and democracy which prevails in Egypt  nowadays?    [Al-'Arabi] No one can say that a climate of freedom and  democracy can be exploited for the purposes of terrorist  operations. But the fact is that the problem of terrorism in  Egypt is a problem with many ramifications, and no individual  can express his opinion on it without being versed in all the  aspects of the problem. For this reason, allow me to apologize  for not answering this question, even though I have been living  with this problem for a long time. A discussion of this problem  requires specialists in numerous fields. What I mean is that I  am able to talk about the problem only from the point of view of  the judiciary.    [Al-Husayni] But what we want is your opinion as a member of  the judiciary.    [Al-'Arabi] I cannot answer this question merely from the  point of view of the judiciary. The reason is that it would be a  fragmentary and incomplete answer. This problem has to be  discussed on all levels--the social, economic, human, and  psychological levels. Regarding the reasons for the continuation  of the wave of terrorism for such a long time, I believe that  these terrorists have, without a doubt, acquired experience from  the former terrorist movements. Also, these terrorist groups  have individuals abroad working for them, and the hand of  justice has not been able to get to them. This is also one of  the reasons why they are continuing their terrorism.    [Al-Husayni] Concerning the decision by the president to  refer cases of terrorism to the military justice system because  it decides cases quickly, why is the Military Prosecution Office  not handling the investigation of these cases instead of the  Office of the Attorney General?    [Al-'Arabi] When the president issues a decree to refer a  particular case to the military justice system, the Office of  the Attorney General forgoes the completion of its procedure and  the case is referred to the military justice system, that is,  the investigation is conducted by the Military Prosecution  Office and then the case is tried by the military justice  system. Also, not all terrorism cases are referred to the  military justice system. The president feels that there are  terrorism cases that do not need to be referred to the military  justice system because they are not so important. So not all  cases of terrorism are referred to the military courts. But this  does happen with major cases that could involve bad consequences  for the nation, such as the cases involving shooting tourists.  This is a matter that requires quick steps and a quick  deterrent. For this reason, there are terrorism cases that are  investigated by the Office of the Attorney General and then  referred to the regular courts.  <H5>  Attorney General's Office and the Inspection Control </H5>   [Al-Husayni] Issue No. 6: There are cases that have stirred  up public opinion and received a great deal of attention in the  media when investigations concerning them were being conducted,  but then these cases ended with no convictions being made. They  include the cases of Lucy Artin and al-Mahjub. Did this happen  because of mistakes made during the process of arrest or  investigation, or were there other reasons for this?    [Al-'Arabi] All the fuss raised concerning certain cases, as  I have said, is the work of the media. I am not responsible for  that. The attorney general's apparatus conducts its  investigations and then assesses what has been done. That is, it  decides whether or not the case should be sent to court and  whether or not there is enough evidence for a conviction. But  unfortunately, when an incident happens, the media quickly jumps  in and utilizes it as a story to be published, with a lot of  hype, even though they do not know what has been going on in the  investigations. Furthermore, as I always say, a judge looks at a  case in a way that is different from the point of view of a  person who is far away from the judge's podium. In fact, it is  possible for one judge's view to be different from another's.  Criminal justice is based on the judge being convinced of the  facts of a case. If the judge is convinced that a person is  guilty, then that person is convicted, but if the judge is not  convinced that he is guilty, then he is acquitted--and there is  no argument about the matter. The judge's view of the matter is  more all-inclusive and broader because he makes judgments  concerning a situation on the basis of the intuition and  conscience of a judge. In addition to this, he takes into  consideration the results of the investigation that he  undertakes in the court session.    [Al-Husayni] It is also a known fact that the Office of the  Attorney General has the authority of inspection. But the  practice has been to authorize police officers, in their  capacity as persons commissioned by the judiciary authorities,  to undertake this work. For this reason, we often see criminals  being acquitted, especially in narcotics cases, because the  inspection procedure was carried out in a way that violates the  law, both in form as well as in content. Why do members of the  Office of the Attorney General not exercise the power of  inspection themselves so that things are carried out in a sound  manner?    [Al-'Arabi] Fundamentally, the members of the Office of the  Attorney General carry out the investigation procedure as a  whole, and not merely the inspection, because the inspection is  just one of the procedures of the investigation. But the law  entitles a member of the Office of the Attorney General to  authorize any policeman commissioned by the authority of the  judiciary to conduct this procedure in his place. The members of  the Office of the Attorney General actually conduct the  inspections in important cases, particularly since we do not  have enough men in the Office of the Attorney General to conduct  the inspections in all the cases. Furthermore, in cases  involving narcotics or theft, if a member of the Office of the  Attorney General goes out to conduct an inspection, he may end  up endangering his life. This is particularly true because  members of the Office of the Attorney General are not allowed to  carry weapons--so that accused persons cannot claim that they  used a weapon against them. So if members of the Office of the  Attorney General go out and hunt down drug smugglers and armed  criminals, they are endangering their lives. But the matter is  different in the case of a policeman, because he carries a  weapon and works within the framework of an integrated plan to  pursue individuals who are in violation of the law.    It might happen that the procedure undertaken by a policeman  commissioned by the authority of the judiciary is unsound and  thus results in an acquittal, as you mentioned. But such persons  who are commissioned by the authority of the judiciary, and who  are police officers, have studied the law and are perfectly  aware of what sound arrest procedures are. So such acquittals do  not happen merely because a member of the Office of the Attorney  General has authorized a police officer to undertake an  inspection. If this does happen, it is because the officer did  not follow the procedures stipulated by the law.</p>

It may even  reach 9 percent in January. This is the highest unemployment  rate since January 1959. The all-time low of 0.8 percent was  registered in August 1974.    The decisive factor was the extraordinarily high seasonal  unemployment in the construction industry. A similar  development was also observed last year, but unemployment was .5  percent lower at the time. Experts believe that the  unemployment rate is currently higher than in January 1993, when  8.4 percent was registered.    Erhard Fuerst, head of the Industrialists' Association  Economic Department, dashed hopes that an upward economic trend  might substantively improve the situation in the labor market.  Austria needs an economic growth of at least 2.5 percent to  prevent another rise in the unemployment rate. The forecasts,  however, predict 1.5 percent for 1994.    According to a method of calculation applied in other  industrialized countries, the unemployment rate in Austria  stands at 4.3 percent. This method bases its calculations on  the whole working population plus the unemployed, not just on  employed persons.</p>

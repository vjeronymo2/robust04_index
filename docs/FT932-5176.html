			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Volvo takes over food group THE Swedish government and Volvo, the car and truck maker, yesterday resolved an 18-month dispute over the future of Procordia, the food and drugs group, by agreeing to split the company in two with Volvo taking over the food and consumer products side of the business. In a share swap deal, to be completed in the autumn, the government will become the majority shareholder in Procordia's pharmaceutical and biotechnology businesses, including 51 per cent of Erbamont, an Italian drugs company acquired in May from Italy's Montedison. Volvo, Sweden's biggest industrial group, will take a 74 per cent share in the demerged non-drug Procordia units, and seek to buy the remaining 26 per cent held publicly. It will retain a 25 per cent stake in Procordia's pharmaceutical operation, with the option to increase its holding to a maximum of 35 per cent as the government carries out its plan to privatise its stake over the next 18 months. Volvo holds 39.5 per cent of Procordia's equity and 42.8 per cent of its voting rights, while the state holds 34.2 per cent of the capital and 42.7 per cent of the votes. The deal ends a prolonged tussle between Volvo and the conservative-led government, which last year blocked a move by Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chief, to merge with Procordia to bolster the loss-making carmaker. It valued the new streamlined Procordia, with sales last year of SKr15.4bn, at SKr31.5bn and the hived-off food section - with sales of Skr26bn - at SKr14.4bn, a combined value of SKr4bn more than Procordia's market value on Wednesday of SKr42bn. The Stockholm stock market reacted positively, with Procordia's most-traded B shares closing up SKr29 at SKr193 at its suspension prior to the announcement. Volvo's B shares also moved up SKr16 to close at SKr406. Mr Gyllenhammar said the deal gave Volvo a profitable new operation with enhanced cash flow. He said Renault, the French vehicle maker with which Volvo is developing a deepening strategic alliance, had welcomed the agreement as a strengthening of its partner.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy prime minister of </F> the Russian Federation Government, by Yelena Dikun, under the  rubric "From the Horse's Mouth"; place and date not given:  "Aleksandr Shokhin: Russia Has Accomplished a Breakthrough in  the European Sector"]    [Text] The deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation  Government commented on the outcome of negotiations in Brussels.    [Dikun] For the time being the Political Declaration of  Partnership and Cooperation Between Russia and the European  Union is not an agreement but merely a protocol of intent. Why  did you not succeed in Brussels in signing right away the treaty  that has been worked on for more than a year now?    [Shokhin] It was clear that only the declaration would be  signed in Brussels even before the visit began. The point is  that the agreement itself is huge, consisting of more than 100  pages, and time is needed in order to bring about its signing in  a purely technical sense. Individual issues were resolved during  the negotiations--this is about trade in the products of the  nuclear fuel cycle, the establishment and operation of  companies, including banking companies, in the territories of  Russia and the countries of the European Community. Experts will  now have to work on these aspects, and then it will be possible  to sign the agreement. The Brussels Declaration has removed all  obstacles on the path toward it.    [Dikun] What specifically does this declaration accomplish  for Russia?    [Shokhin] Russia is no longer considered a country with a  centralized planned economy which is capable of setting prices  and conditions for trade at its discretion, without reference to  market arrangements. All measures are possible with regard to  such a state in order to restrict its exports. As is laid down  in the declaration, Russia has now been recognized as a country  with an economy of a transitional type. That is to say that  antidumping measures cannot be used against it for purely  political motives; we will now be treated in keeping with canons  and yardsticks commonly accepted in the world. If the issue of  introducing a restrictive measure with regard to Russia arises,  it should be consulted first as to whether the country is indeed  deliberately engaging in some dumping practices, or whether  there is another reason.    Besides, it is officially codified in the declaration that  the European Community and Russia are partners from now on and  will strive for further economic rapprochement. Moreover, in the  immediate future negotiations should begin on establishing a  free zone and trade between the European Union and Russia.    Simultaneously, the Council for Cooperation between the  European Union and Russia is being established within the  framework of which it is planned to hold summits twice a year,  that is, meetings between the president of Russia, on one side,  and the chairman of the Council of the European Union, the  chairman of the European Commission, on the other side. It is  also laid down in the declaration that intensive contacts will  be organized at the parliamentary level. In a word, a continuous  dialogue, a system of regular consultations will be established  between the European Union and Russia. It is important that the  parties stated this officially: They will build mutual economic  relations on the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade, to which an overwhelming majority of the countries of  the world adhere.    [Dikun] Can the real economic effect of this agreement be  assessed?    [Shokhin] It is impossible to quantify. In the greater  scheme  of things, establishing broad-scale political and economic  cooperation with the European Union is primarily in Russia's  interest. This will simplify and facilitate market  transformations for us, and will relieve social difficulties in  the course of reforms. One way or the other, this will give a  great impetus to the participation of European companies in the  operation of Russian institutions and companies. This will  influence the progress of privatization favorably, ensuring in  the process not only an influx of capital that we badly need but  also the advent of new technologies and management expertise  which we need so much.    This is very important: The European space market is being  opened up to us. Everybody knows well to what degree the Western  market for space launches and space services as a whole is  closed, how difficult it is to break into, and what obstacles  are being thrown in our path in this case. The number of  commercial launches we will be able to carry out before the end  of this century has now been determined. Subsequently, our quota  in the space sphere is expected to be increased in keeping with  our own potential, as well as so that prices for these services  will gradually pull closer to world prices. This is completely  in our interest because our prices for such services are  somewhat below those in the world. Our entry onto the space  market is also valuable to us in that it will promote the  development of domestic industry and science, quite a number of  sectors associated with rocket building and support for space  launches.    [Dikun] As is known, U.S. Vice President Albert Gore also  came here with a program for extensive joint participation by  Russia and America in space projects. Therefore, Russia has now  got an opportunity to choose. Will the emerging rapprochement  between our country and the European Union prompt the United  States to cooperate with Russia more closely?    [Shokhin] Undoubtedly, negotiations with the European Union  concerning space which had been underway for more than a year  urged the Americans on in this area. In turn, similar contacts  between Russia and the United States caused more activity among  the Europeans. That such a breakthrough has been accomplished in  the European sector cannot fail to influence the American side  now. The United States is developing cooperation with us in the  space area gradually, but further and further; from just space  launches, it is proceeding toward cooperation in the creation  and construction of orbiting stations. As recently as half a  year ago the Americans had very serious doubts about the latter  project because this meant automatically that a proportion of  the market and a proportion of the orders would be transferred  to Russia. This meant that American producers of the requisite  equipment would fail to receive the same share. However, by all  signs the issue has been resolved in our favor.    [Dikun] Which problems did you fail to resolve in Brussels?    [Shokhin] First of all, regarding aluminum exports.  Restrictions on imports from Russia to the countries of the  European Union are still in force. In this case, the interests  of primarily France, the main producer of aluminum in the  European Union, were affected. Incidentally, coordination on  space proceeded in a quite complicated manner because of France  once again. Let us say it straightforwardly: On quite a number  of issues France hindered the reaching of agreements which could  be satisfactory to the Russian Federation. It is common  knowledge that at one time the French came out as opponents of  the agreement on partnership and cooperation with Russia, saying  that it is not all that necessary for the European Union at this  stage. However, this extreme point of view did not prevail.    [Dikun] To what degree did the edict of President Yeltsin  concerning access to Russia for Western banks hinder the signing  of the declaration?    [Shokhin] This edict changed our negotiating position. It  was  very necessary for us and extremely inconvenient for them.  However, we understand full well that if one of the parties gets  a greater advantage than the other, the latter will be left  dissatisfied and will possibly try to modify the agreement,  which, naturally, no one needs. Therefore it was very important  to strike a balance on all issues during the negotiations,  including those concerning banks. I will not dwell on the  details of how the Russian Federation intends to restrict the  operations of European financiers on the Russian market during  the period of transition; I will only say that the restrictions  we are introducing are not an insurmountable barrier to banks  from the European Union countries coming to the Russian market.  Although there is no complete agreement as of this moment, let  us hope that one will be reached within a few weeks.    [Dikun] Did the release of a report on relations between  Russia and NATO by the chief of the Foreign Intelligence  Service, Yevgeniy Primakov, affect the progress of negotiations?    [Shokhin] Actually, Primakov's report aroused the interest  of  the Russian public to these problems. What had previously  proceeded within the confines of big-time politics became  available to the general public. In Brussels the position of  Russia was clearly affirmed to the effect that it is not  prepared to see NATO as an organization expanded into Central  and Eastern Europe but without the participation of Russia.  Moreover, the idea was voiced that the parallel admission of  Russia and these countries to NATO preserves the balance of  forces in Europe. Apparently this issue will be discussed in  January during the summit of the North Atlantic Union.    [Dikun] Do you project the emergence of domestic policy  obstacles which may frustrate the signing of an agreement  between Russia and the European Union, for example, in  conjunction with the election of a new parliament?    [Shokhin] I believe that not only the firm position of the  Russian delegation but also the events that occurred in  September and October were some of the main reasons for the  acceleration of the treaty process in Brussels. European  Community countries understand that it is unwise to wait until  reforms in Russia are crowned with complete success and to begin  cranking up the cooperation mechanism only after that. The  situation here is quite fluid all the time, and for this reason  everything should be done in order to speed up the reforms. In  particular, the issue is to give Russia an opportunity to make  money by way of its exports rather than count on external  financial infusions. I believe that very shortly G-7 and other  international organizations should take certain steps in this  direction. Therefore, I do not think that the situation will  somehow deteriorate because of our domestic events.    [Dikun] However, is it ruled out that another Cabinet of  Ministers will complete this endeavor on the side of Russia?    [Shokhin] The reassignment of cadres in the government could  have occurred without the election; the issue is how this  government will work with this parliament. There are two  possible scenarios. The first is to form a government which has  a parliamentary majority. However, given this array, this may be  Zhirinovskiy's government. This is why a second scenario is not  ruled out--to take advantage of the transitional provisions of  the Constitution whereby the current government will continue to  discharge its responsibilities without relinquishing its powers  before the newly elected Duma or raising the issue of a vote of  confidence in itself. Although I personally advocated the latter  before, I thought at that time that democratic blocs would be in  a majority in the parliament.    Of course, some adjustments in the government are  possible--not on the principle proposed by Zhirinovskiy, who  demands that four, five, or 10 key figures be replaced, but  proceeding rather from the need to win over for our side people  from politically adjacent parties and movements. Their  representatives will have to be included in the government to  this end.</p>

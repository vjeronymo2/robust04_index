			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Observer: Counter-attack Disturbing news from Norway. A 50-tonne sperm whale attacked a 30 foot whale 'safari' boat off Norway's west coast last weekend. A group of German, Swiss and Italian whale-watchers escaped unharmed but the boat was badly dented. Following the failure of the International Whaling Commission to get Norway to scrap its minke whale-killing policy, is this the first sign that local whales are taking industrial action?</p>

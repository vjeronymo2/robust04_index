			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev hopes that  next week the foreign policy chiefs of the United States and the  countries of the European Union and himself, as well as  representatives of the United Nations, will meet to coordinate  plans for a Bosnian settlement.    Upon arrival in Moscow from Bonn, Thursday [28 April],  Kozyrev told an INTERFAX reporter that a foreign ministers  conference on Bosnia stood a good chance and he would work to  have it take place even though problems remained. What counted  most, he said, was the decision to go beyond NATO's plan for  military action. Kozyrev suggested that NATO's moves be seen as  a link in the chain that started with the United Nations' call  for action and would lead to a Security Council discussion of  the Bosnian problem.    Thursday evening, according to Kozyrev, U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher said he intended to hold a telephone  conversation with his Russian counterpart. Let us wait and see  what Secretary Christopher has to say, said Kozyrev.    Whether a foreign ministers conference on Bosnia would  approve a provisional formula for a settlement depended, in  Kozyrev's view, on moves by the ministers' contact group.  Moscow refused to rely exclusively on the contact group, he  said.    Kozyrev's deputy and President Yeltsin's special emissary  for  Bosnia Vitaliy Churkin has left Moscow for Oslo where he is to  meet Friday with international mediators David Owen and Thurwald  Stoltenberg. Kozyrev said Churkin's meeting with the  international mediators opened an additional channel for work on  a Bosnian conference.    The ministers were also working on the conference, so  efforts  were being made, Kozyrev pointed out, in three directions and  although he could not be 100-percent sure, he was reasonably  confident the conference would take place next week. The  ministers could meet, as usual, Kozyrev said, in Geneva.    In the meantime, a Western source told INTERFAX the  ministers  would most likely meet in Finland or some other country of  northern Europe and that they had already agreed to meet on next  Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>

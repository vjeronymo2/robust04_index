			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wieslaw S. Debski from Moscow: "The </F> Oleksy-Yeltsin Meeting"]    [Text] On Friday [1 April] at the Kremlin in Moscow, Jozef  Oleksy and Boris Yeltsin discussed Polish-Russian cooperation  and European security.    The Sejm speaker pointed to the need to prepare new  agreements and treaties that would be more specific than the  interstate treaty already in place because the state of our  cooperation, especially economic cooperation, is poor.    Yeltsin agreed with these arguments and promised that he  would personally see to it that Minister Andrey Kozyrev responds  quickly and specifically to the proposals of cooperation  presented in Krakow by Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej  Olechowski.    It seems that most important for the Polish members of  parliament [MP's] were talks on European security for Poland and  Russia. Even though no breakthrough was achieved in this area,  the two parties discussed many controversial issues related to  this subject. It is worth mentioning that Oleksy met with the  Russian president, prime minister, and minister of foreign  affairs. He also spoke with the members of three important  committees (defense, international affairs, and budget) as well  as four factions (on Friday--Yegor Gaydar's "Russia's Choice").  The Russians tried to win the deputies over to the concept of  collective European security, based on the CSCE. All forces,  including representatives of the reform camp (such as Sergey  Stankiewich and Oleg Bogomolov) were rather unenthusiastic about  the "Partnership for Peace" initiative. There is still  controversy in Moscow over the Partnership plan: Yeltsin's  spokesman said on Thursday that the Kremlin still needs six or  seven months to hold consultations on this issue; as early as  the following day, Minister Kozyrev declared that his country  would join Partnership for Peace in April.    However, the Russians' reluctance to accept the present  concept of Partnership was clearly noticeable. They claim that  the West is not treating them as an equal partner, "another  architect of the new Europe," as Stankiewich put it.    Jozef Oleksy kept saying, politely but firmly, that Poland  sees guarantees for its security in NATO membership, and it will  strive to achieve this goal, no matter how dissatisfied Moscow  may be with such a solution.    Summing up the entire visit, the speaker said the following  at a press conference: "This is not the Sejm's foreign policy.  This is merely the implementation of the main points of the  state's foreign policy. The parliamentary platform helps to  promote dialogue between various parties and political forces in  both states." This exchange of views will be continued, perhaps  also at the meetings of MP's from the Weimar triangle (Poland,  Germany, and France), with members of the Russian State Duma.</p>

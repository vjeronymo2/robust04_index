			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN BITES TOWN: CIRCULAR LOGIC;  </P> <P> IF WE REPEAT OURSELVES OFTEN ENOUGH, WILL WE FINALLY WISE UP?  </P> <P> ONE OF THE best arguments in favor of apathy, or at least keeping your old  clothes, is that everything ends up coming around again.  </P> <P> I don't mean things that are always with us, things that the news weeklies  declare about every five years to be returning from the dead ("Jazz Is Back!"  is my personal favorite). But look at the '60s cycle currently delighting the  fashion industry, which, after 10 years of struggling to revive short skirts,  is once again selling less garment for more money. (What's not to like?)  </P> <P> Or consider what's happened to the office of the mayor of Los Angeles. Not the  position, the actual office. Frequently these days, it's empty. Tom Bradley is  the target of increasing criticism for touring the world, slogging through  hazardous-duty areas like Paris, London and Tokyo.  </P> <P> The mayor's defenders say such travels are necessary to keep cargo moving  through the Port of Los Angeles and international visitors pouring through  Terminal Four at LAX. Bradley is not junketeering, we are advised; he is  engaged in the hard if subtle work of economic development.  </P> <P> Well, it may be nearing wintertime, but this show is definitely a rerun.  Precisely the same debate surrounded Bradley's predecessor, Sam Yorty, known to  some detractors as "Travelin' Sam." I made my first serious money poking fun at  Yorty's travels, in addition to his syntax and his presidential aspirations,  and I recall clearly that he defended his skedaddling with the same lofty  invocation of regional macroeconomics. Apparently, in the high-level world of  deciding which port to ship stuff through, brochures and videos just aren't  enough; you need that personal touch.  </P> <P> Travel is nice, especially if you're not paying, but other mayors confine more  of their mischief to the home precincts. Tom Bradley won his office campaigning  against such compulsive tourism. Why did he succumb to the old syndrome? The  office of mayor of Los Angeles -- not the actual office, the position -- is,  ultimately, no place for a real man.  </P> <P> Consider this: As soon as Bradley got back from one of his most recent rounds  of harbor-touting, one of his employees -- the chief of police -- publicly  slammed His Honor for daring to suggest that the police commissioners, mayor's  appointees all, just might want to exercise their legal duty to supervise a  department, some of whose narcotics cops are under suspicion of stealing money  and framing suspects while its chief tells Congress that casual marijuana  smokers -- not addicts like his own son, whom he considers already dead --  should be shot to death.  </P> <P> A mayor with any real power would have suspended that chief faster than you  could say Adam 12. But because of an earlier era of political reform, our chief  executive is barely empowered to decide what color drapes to hang in his  office. Afraid of bosses and machines, California progressives tilted in favor  of city councilmen, none of whom has the clout or independence to stand up to  rogue elephants, like L.A.'s splendid string of loose-lipped police chiefs.  Anybody who stays in the mayor's office long enough to get a healthy dose of  such humiliation will naturally start dreaming of February in Prague.  </P> <P> Coming around again, as well, is rail transit for L.A. The thin Blue Line has  already opened to generally good notices, and Southern Pacific has sold three  routes to the County Transportation Commission. Local rail buffs haven't been  this happy since before the Domeliner ran out of Windex. And Metro Rail  continues to tunnel along, blasting past clumsy accidents and methane pockets  toward a rendezvous with the Valley.  </P> <P> We are promised clean rapid transit that will span the yawning spaces between  the beaches and the Inland Empire; a system to rival, it is said, Toronto or  Paris. Or, to be utterly precise, to rival the system we had in the '20s. We  are re-creating that system as faithfully as a paleontologist rebuilds a  dinosaur skeleton.  </P> <P> Don't get me wrong. I like rail transit. I'd even use it, assuming that the car  interiors have the oiled metallic fragrance of the old Red Cars, not the ureic  reek of New York City's IND trains. Southern California had a great transit  system. We lost it (the lore blames a conspiracy of auto and gasoline  companies, but we're beyond finger-pointing); we voted down its revival all  during the Mustang and Camaro years, and now -- now that the replacement cost  has hit eight figures, now that car traffic is so bad it makes nice ladies give  you the finger -- now we're bringing it back.  </P> <P> In a way, it makes sense. Somebody made money, and created jobs, by building  our transit system in the first place. Keeping the setup didn't allow new money  to be made, new jobs to be created. Think of all the car stereos and car phones  and car windshield shades that have been sold in the meantime. And now,  somebody makes money, and creates jobs, rebuilding what we used to have.  </P> <P> So we'll take the train to San Berdoo, if we like. And the mayor, whoever he  is, will know how well it compares with the trains in France because he'll be  in Paris. And the Newsweek we buy at the train station will scream from its  cover, "Jazz Is Back!"  </P></p>

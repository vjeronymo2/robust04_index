			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Packing for the future Tired of hanging on to your old television packaging? Harassed by all that expanded polystyrene encasing your new hi-fi? Perhaps the answer lies in recycling. That is the conclusion of a study* by the Expanded Polystyrene Packaging Group, part of the British Plastics Federation. According to the report, prepared by Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, half of all used expanded polystyrene (EPS) packaging will be reclaimed and about 30 per cent recycled by 2000. EPS recycling is already increasing. Around 3,700 tonnes, representing 17 per cent of total UK consumption, will be recycled this year - a 50 per cent rise on 1993. The report is bullish about the future. Used packaging, such as the EPS encasing many new consumer durables, can be easily and cost-effectively recycled. Provided the packaging is retrieved before being mixed with household rubbish, its potential ranges from recycling into new packaging to plastic stationery and coat-hangers or compact disc cases. Even 'contaminated' EPS packaging such as the vast quantities consumed annually by the fishing and nursery industries, can be harnessed as a fuel for generating electricity in incinerators. Although incineration is still in its infancy, EPS is attractive as its calorific value is higher than coal's. However, there have been doubts recently over the material's environmental impact. Critics have claimed EPS is not biodegradable, is bleached using chlorines and even contains CFCs. Producers hotly deny such 'misperceptions'. EPS is an increasingly popular packaging material. The UK alone produces almost 21,000 tonnes a year. *The Prospects for Recycling EPS Packaging. British Plastics Federation, Pounds 25.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / International Company News: Atlanta group tops Western Union bids First Financial Management, an Atlanta-based information services company, has offered Dollars 800m in cash to acquire Western Union Financial Services, the big US money-transfer business. First Financial has also offered to assume about Dollars 265m of Western Union unfinanced pension liabilities. This lifts the total value of the bid to above Dollars 1bn. The offer tops two previous bids for Western Union: Dollars 970m offered last week by Forstman Little, the New York buy-out firm, and Dollars 660m offered by First Data Corporation. First Data, however, has also agreed to assume the Dollars 265m in pension liabilities. Western Union is currently owned by New Valley, a New Jersey-based financial services company which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection for the past year and a half. New Valley hopes eventually to sell the unit for enough to pay off its creditors. The deadline for the auction ends on September 16, but analysts believe that it is unlikely First Financial's bid will be topped. Founded in 1851, Western Union controls 90 per cent of the US domestic money transfer market. Last year it completed 40m transfers of funds worth more than Dollars 7.8bn. Revenues this year are expected to top Dollars 550m. Western Union last changed hands in 1987 in a junk bond-financed leveraged buy-out. However, the company, subsequently renamed New Valley, struggled to meet the high interest on its debt, and eventually filed for bankruptcy in March 1993.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Private pension fund system for Argentines ARGENTINA'S Senate has approved the introduction of a private pension fund system in an important victory for the economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, in his battle to modernise the economy. The new system, partially modeled on Chile's private pension scheme, offers contributors a choice between opening individual retirement savings accounts managed by private companies or remaining in the state-run system. It is expected to be an important step in the development of Argentina's financial markets which should allow companies access to long-term domestic capital. Under the system, employees will pay 11 per cent of wages either to a privately-managed fund or to a government-run fund. Barings Securities, the London-based brokers, estimates that the private system will hold assets of Dollars 30bn by the end of the century.</p>

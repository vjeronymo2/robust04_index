			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Brazil warms to overseas mediums FOREIGN-issued medium-term notes have become one of the hottest corporate finance tools in Brazil this year, as tight credit and high inflation at home force companies to look abroad for funds. Brazilian companies have so far issued Dollars 620m of medium-term notes overseas in 1991. The product is officially known as 'commercial paper'. But because it must be placed at maturities of at least two years, bears more resemblance to medium-term notes. Brazilian banks have been quick to take advantage of the change in rules. Banco Frances e Brasileiro (BFB), an associate of Credit Lyonnais, has issued Dollars 100m during the past few months, and is currently negotiating another Dollars 100m issue. Credibanco has made a Dollars 100m placement and Banco Real Dollars 20m. 'The product has given us an important new option in obtaining medium-term financing,' said Mr Ruy Raya, head of commercial-paper issues at BFB. 'Inflation is still so high here that it is extremely difficult to obtain funds with maturation more than a few months out.' One of the main attractions of medium-term notes is their tax-exempt status. This allows multi-national companies to use the product to replace inter-company loans, which are fully taxed. The success of this product contrasts sharply with domestic commercial paper issues which have failed to catch investors' imaginations. Since the product came on the market in November last year, not a single issue has been made. According to a spokesman for the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios (CVM), Brazil's stock market watchdog, this is because a flat tax of 0.64 per cent of the total value of the issue has proved prohibitively expensive. The issuing group must be registered with the CVM, itself a costly process. Domestically issued commercial paper also carries a maximum maturity of six months, a term unappealing to companies in dire need of longer-term funds.</p>

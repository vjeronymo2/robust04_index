			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Devolution may cloud Lib Dems' message CHANGE in Britain's political system and economic revival were set at the centre of Liberal Democrat aspirations for the general election yesterday by Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader. But he risked clouding his party's message with a complex stance on the issue of 'home rule' for Scotland. 'Never before has the ground for political change been so well prepared,' he said at his party's spring conference in Glasgow. On the economy, he warned that 'the Tories offer paralysis and Labour offer timidity'. He called for more public investment and an independent central bank, and hinted that he would reverse any tax cuts in tomorrow's Budget. He welcomed the possibility that steps towards proportional representation might appear in the Labour manifesto. But he urged the party to go farther, 'bite the bullet' and come out unequivocally in favour of reform. In spite of the obvious passion of Liberal Democrats at Glasgow for Scottish 'home rule', the party's MPs have agreed it must be subordinate to Mr Ashdown's top priority - electoral reform at Westminster. Some MPs have had to be persuaded to toe the line, notably Sir David Steel, the former Liberal party leader who made only a brief appearance at the conference. With devolution bounding up the Scottish political agenda, the strength of the deal to subordinate Scottish aspirations has been tested to the limit. Mr Malcolm Bruce, Scottish spokesman, admitted the party was only 'half way' towards persuading voters to accept why Scotland would not have a guarantee of its rights under a devolved system until Britain had a fair and representative democracy. Mr Ashdown knows the Liberal Democrats' appeal has to be broadly based if he is to make an impact in the constituencies in southern England from which the Liberal Democrats were forged - came second to the Tories in 1987. Scottish 'home rule' is far down the list of voters' priorities in Liberal Democrat target seats such as Bath, Falmouth and Camborne, Richmond and Barnes, or Cheltenham. Mr Ashdown's tactics for capturing such seats are based on simple messages about changing the Westminster political system and on disenchantment with 'negative' Labour and Tory campaigning. The Liberal Democrats' slogan My Vote, splashed across a giant orange sun above the conference platform, is aimed at encouraging voters to make every ballot paper count. Party political broadcasts will list all the 259 constituencies where the Liberal Democrat is the main challenger to the MP. 'Ours will be the vote which breaks the logjam holding back change in our country . . . My vote is for an election which is positive,' read the introduction to Mr Ashdown's speech. That message will be emphasised at grassroots level with Liberal Democrat policy papers crammed with neat ideas or 'common sense' solutions to contemporary issues - such as the housing shortage or animal rights - that can be niche-marketed according to local concerns. Party headquarters in Westminster is lean and professional - a remarkable turnround compared with the near-bankrupt state of the organisation a few years ago. But the lesson of past elections is that Liberal Democrat victories are born largely of local effort. Party strategists believe a coalition government is a long way down the scale of probabilities. They fully expect Labour or the Tories to attempt to run a minority government before calling Mr Ashdown. Liberal Democrat MPs in Scotland feel joy at the way in which the 'home rule' dream that drove many of them into politics could soon start to become reality. Their delight could threaten the party's cohesion if Mr Ashdown sought to vote down a minority government offering devolution, but not full constitutional reform. A substantial minority of Scottish companies expect constitutional change in Scotland after the general election, even though a majority expect the election will be won by the Conservative party, which opposes constitutional change, James Buxton writes. Two thirds of Scottish companies expect the Tories to win the election, according to a survey by BBC Scotland and Pannell Kerr Forster, the accountancy firm.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Republic of Finland taps Austrian schilling sector THE REPUBLIC of Finland yesterday tapped the Austrian schilling sector of the Eurobond market with a Sch2bn, five-year deal - the biggest seen in that sector. Creditanstalt Bankverein of Austria, lead manager for the deal, claimed that Finland was able to borrow on more aggressive terms in Austrian schillings than in the D-Mark sector. The bonds, which have a coupon of 6 7/8 per cent, were issued at 100.75 and reoffered at 99.325 to yield 7.04 per cent. This represents a yield spread of 39 basis points over the interpolated government bond. The lead manager said that the deal would have some 'scarcity value', given the absence of any government bonds in the five-year area. Finland borrowed in Austrian schillings last year, launching an issue of 10-year bonds with a 8 1/4 per cent coupon which are now trading at a yield spread of about 40 basis points over the relevant government bond. Other dealers who follow the Republic of Finland's borrowings in the international capital markets said that it was well ahead with its borrowing programme for 1993, having chosen a wide variety of currencies and maturities so far this year. Finland has an AA2/AA- credit rating. 'The feeling is that the worst is over for Finland - there's a greater measure of confidence from investors,' said Mr Tim Skeet, senior vice-president of Kidder Peabody's syndication desk. The Eurobond market was unusually quiet yesterday, with the only other substantial deal of the day a re-opening of an existing French franc issue. The European Investment Bank has doubled the size of its recent 6 3/4 per cent, five-year deal with a further FFr2bn of the bonds. The deal is being lead-managed by CCF. The bonds were re-offered at the issue price of 99.54 to yield 10 basis points over the five-year government bond. Some dealers suggested that the recent flood of Eurofranc deals may have run out of steam. Rumours are circulating in the market that Sweden may be planning to tap the Euroyen sector with a fairly large five-year deal. Meanwhile, in the Eurosterling sector some market experts have suggested that there might be good swap opportunities for borrowers, who would be able to borrow in fixed-rate sterling and then swap into floating-rate sterling to give attractive sub-Libor levels of funding. However, investor demand for Eurosterling paper is seen as being weak at the moment. Credit Suisse, the large Swiss bank, had its triple A long-term debt rating and A1+ short-term rating reaffirmed yesterday by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency. S&amp;P placed the ratings on creditwatch with negative implications in January. In April, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the rating on the long-term deposits and guaranteed senior Eurodebt of Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse Financial Products to Aa2 from Aa1.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / EC split over defence industry: Ministers fail to agree on scope for Community assistance EUROPEAN Community industry ministers failed at the weekend to agree on an EC policy towards the defence industry, which is suffering from over-capacity in the aftermath of the Cold War. Mr Luis Mira Amaral, Portugal's industry minister, said there were clear differences at the informal meeting in Lisbon on whether the Community should develop an EC-wide approach to the industry. Unlike industries such as textiles, many defence companies were concentrated in relatively prosperous regions in Britain, France and Germany. This made it difficult for the Community to help, as most of its industrial aid was focused on depressed regions. Mr Martin Bangemann, vice-president of the EC's executive Commission, presented a paper seeking member states' views on whether a special initiative on the arms industry was needed. Lord Reay, Britain's under-secretary of state for industry, said the paper on defence industries raised more questions than answered. 'I don't believe there is scope for Community action in this field.' Others were more prepared to consider Community action. 'France is not opposed to using EC funds to facilitate reconversion,' said Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French industry minister. However, both Britain and France believed the Western European Union and Nato's Independent European Programme Group which deals with arms procurement, were more appropriate forums for discussing the issues. There was broader agreement over co-operation with eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union. In its first comprehensive report on industrial prospects of the region, the Commission said there was an urgent need to encourage investment and industrial restructuring. Foreign investment in 1990 at Ecu2.1bn (Pounds 1.49bn) in central and eastern Europe and Ecu2.3bn in the former Soviet Union remained well below the potential. 'The scale of the task is without precedents . . . The transition (to market economies) will probably take a very long time, and a substantial part of industry will remain for some time yet under state tutelage,' the report said. Recent upheavals in the region had created serious economic distortions, but co-operation depended on pursuing the path of reform. Creating the right economic and business environment with better information was crucial to attract more investors.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Profits surge at Bank Leumi Bank Leumi, Israel's second-largest bank, has reported 1993 profits of Shk370m (Dollars 125m), a 58 per cent increase on 1992. Shareholders are to be paid dividends totalling Shk114m. Fourth-quarter profit for 1993 was Shk141m - a massive 88 per cent increase on the same quarter in 1992, and 52 per cent up on the July-September 1993 period. The bank attributed the rise in profits to a lower allocation for bad debts, reduced activity in loss-making branches overseas, and the implementation of a new domestic business strategy. The bank also sold off part of its holdings in its Union Bank subsidiary during the year. Ten per cent of shares in Bank Leumi were sold off on the Tel Aviv stock exchange in May 1993, the bank said. There were plans to sell another 20 to 40 per cent during 1994. Bidders were invited to submit applications by April 18. Israel's third-largest bank, the Israel Discount Bank, also released figures showing a jump in net earnings for 1993 - up 26.5 per cent to Shk205m. Fourth-quarter profits stood at Shk78m compared to Shk69m in the same quarter of 1992. Israel Discount Bank's managing director Mr Avraham Asheri attributed the improved performance in part to lower taxes, and also to the fact that, for 1993, all profits from the bank's Mercantile Discount Bank subsidiary had been included in the consolidated statement. In 1992, only 50 per cent of the profits had been included.</p>

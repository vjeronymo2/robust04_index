			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Observer: Forked tongue A letter in yesterday's Guardian alleging that supporters of John Smith had plotted to manoeuvre him into the Labour leadership if Neil Kinnock lost the election has set the cat among the pigeons. The letter was from Colin Byrne, the former Labour party press officer who left Walworth Road after a spat with John Underwood, Peter Mandelson's successor as campaign supremo. What makes the allegations more pertinent to the leadership campaign is that Byrne is still - as the phrase goes - close to the Kinnock camp. He lives with Kinnock's press secretary Julie Hall; they are soon to be married. Can we assume, therefore, that the bile in Byrne's comments on Smith's shortcomings is shared by Kinnock himself? After all, wasn't it Smith's plan for taxing Essex men that lost Kinnock their votes?</p>

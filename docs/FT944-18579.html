			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Company News (This Week): Concerns cloud healthy sector - SHK Properties Sun Hung Kai Properties, one of Hong Kong's leading property developers, will post its final results on Friday, effectively winding up the colony's reporting season. SHK Properties boasts one of the biggest land banks in Hong Kong and the market is looking for an annual increase in earnings of around 30 per cent to HKDollars 8.7bn (Pounds 705m). Earnings per share are forecast to improve 23 per cent to HKDollars 3.88. This marks a deceleration on the past three years, partially reflecting the mix of bank and government measures taken to cool Hong Kong's overheating property market. Results from the big property developers for last year range from a virtually flat performance at Cheung Kong through to the 64 per cent surge reported by Sino Land. Despite the stagnant performance, investors were cheered by Cheung Kong's results which beat the expected 20 per cent decline. But the developers go into their new financial year with a number of concerns which could dent this year's healthy rises. Although the government has called off - temporarily - its war on rocketing home prices, bank mortgage limits remain in place while interest rates are rising. Property prices have dropped around 10-15 per cent since April, just after the government revealed its intention to act on rocketing home prices.</p>

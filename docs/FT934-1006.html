			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / German miners take pay cut in bid to save jobs West Germany's 87,000 coal miners have agreed to take a pay cut and work fewer hours in a last ditch attempt to stave off tens of thousands of redundancies. IG Bergbau und Energie (IGBE), the miners' trade union, and the Association of German coal producers have agreed a pay cut of 9 per cent for two years starting on January 1. In return, each miner will work 120 fewer hours per year - equivalent to a four-day working week. The new model follows an agreement in November between the IG Metall engineering union and Volkswagen which will introduce a 28.8 hour week and lower wages and save up to 30,000 jobs. IGBE hopes the new deal will save 10,000 jobs in the Ruhr valley mines. But coal industry officials say the measures will only 'temporarily delay inevitable lay-offs'. German mining companies plan to axe 22,000 jobs by the end of 1995. Of these, 10,000 go next February when Ruhrkohle, the largest company and producer of 80 per cent of west German coal, partially closes three pits in order to reduce output by 3m tonnes of coking coal. The new wage agreement will allow the 10,000 miners to continue working in the pits or be transferred to other pits where working time has been reduced. Meanwhile engineering workers in south-west Germany have been offered a pay and conditions deal which will reduce their income by 15 per cent, IG Metall union officials claimed yesterday. They said earnings would be cut by employers' proposals to limit overtime entitlements, reduce holidays and scrap holiday bonuses.</p>

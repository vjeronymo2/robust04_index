			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Lib Dems play down fresh race row Embarrassed Liberal Democrat leaders were yesterday playing down the second race-relations controversy involving the party's controversial Tower Hamlets branch in three months. Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said attempts by Tower Hamlets activists to achieve an 'ethnically balanced' election ticket were 'well-intentioned, but misguided'. Mr Ashdown was responding to disclosures that a ballot of members in two wards in the Liberal-Democrat controlled east London borough had been used to produce a mix of white, Asian and Afro-Caribbean candidates for the local elections in May. The disclosures were doubly embarrassing for Mr Ashdown, who warned last month that the politics of race must not be allowed to get a grip in London's east end. The issue is sensitive for the Liberal Democrats after the internal party inquiry last year, which ruled that some of the party's activists in Tower Hamlets had pandered to racist sentiment during the Isle of Dogs by-election campaign. The poll was won by the extremist British National Party (BNP), which could win further east London seats in May. Mr Graham Tope, president of the Liberal Democrat's London region, said the Tower Hamlets party was trying to fight racism by fielding a slate of candidates reflecting the borough's complex ethnic mix. 'There was no attempt to be racist by anyone,' he said. 'Their view was that a balanced ticket reflecting the makeup of the area was the best way of defeating the BNP.' Tower Hamlets party leaders are expected to meet tomorrow to recount the ballot results without regard to ethnic background.</p>

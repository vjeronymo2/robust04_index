			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / The Week Ahead: Results due FULL-YEAR figures tomorrow from P&amp;O, the shipping, construction and property group, are expected to show a drop in pre-tax profits to around Pounds 200m-Pounds 210m from Pounds 261.3m in 1990. This will be the second year of sharply falling profits, though the forecast assumes a more stable second half after interim figures showed a plunge to Pounds 73.1m (Pounds 132.1m). P&amp;O's balance sheet was bolstered by a Pounds 604m rights issue announced with the interims, when a maintained final dividend was promised. On Wednesday Reckitt &amp; Colman, the consumer products group, should report a rise in annual pre-tax profits to around Pounds 255m-Pounds 260m, up from Pounds 235.2m in 1990. The main feature will be the performance of Boyle Midway, the US business bought in 1990, in its first full year when some significant savings have been made. Also, the benefits of the restructuring of the European business over the last couple of years should be visible. Interim profits were up 13 per cent to Pounds 127.6m. Cookson, the chemicals group, also reports its full-year profits on Wednesday. Analysts' expect pre-tax profits to well below last year's figure of Pounds 97.5m. Estimates at the top end are about about Pounds 45m, and the market is likely to be disappointed with anything below Pounds 40m. The main concern will be the dividend which was cut last year to 6p for the year. There is nervousness it could be cut again which analysts would take as a signal the new management team has lost confidence in its policies. They will also be looking for any sign of an upturn, particularly in the US. Wellcome, the healthcare company, which reports its preliminary results on Thursday, gave a profits forecast of not less than Pounds 235m (Pounds 181.2m) when the Wellcome Trust, the largest shareholder, said it would be selling a substantial part of its 73.6 per cent stake. Underlying sales growth should be about 20 per cent, with Zovirax, the herpes treatment, and Retrovir, the Aids drug, performing well. Analysts will also be looking at the performance of new products such as Exosurf, a respiratory drug, and Wellbutrin, an anti-depressant. Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company, will report its results on Wednesday when analysts believe it will show a drop in net income of some Pounds 10m to Pounds 71m as a result of low oil prices. But the company is also planning to change its accounting practices. Burmah Castrol, the refining and lubricants company, reports on Thursday and although more insulated from the low oil price than exploration companies, is expected to show a fall in net income to Pounds 72m from Pounds 97m the previous year.

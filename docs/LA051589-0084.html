			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> BODY DISCOVERED NEAR CRYSTAL COVE STATE PARK  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department detectives Sunday were investigating the death of an  unidentified woman whose body was discovered alongside Coast Highway near  Crystal Cove State Park.  </P> <P> The cause of death will note be known until an autopsy this morning, but  Sheriff's Lt. Harold Schaffroth said the clothed body showed signs of "some  trauma."  </P> <P> An employee of the state park said it appeared that the woman might have been  thrown from a passing car. Her body was off the shoulder of the road on the  coast side of the highway, near a barbed wire fence.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Lt. Larry Abbott described the woman Sunday as white, about 25 to 40  years old, 5 feet 2 inches tall, weighing 158 pounds, and with shoulder-length,  bleached-blonde hair with dark roots. She had hazel eyes and was wearing a  white tank top, a short red skirt and white tennis shoes, Abbott said.  </P> <P> The lieutenant said a clue to her identity is that four of her top front teeth  were missing "and those teeth were not missing from the trauma she suffered."  Abbott said it is not known if the woman had worn a denture to cover the  missing front teeth.  </P> <P> A park employee said a maintenance worker discovered the body on morning  rounds, but according to Lt. Schaffroth it was seen about 6 a.m. by people  driving past. Newport Beach police initially were called to the scene, but when  they determined that the body was south of Corona del Mar, in unincorporated  territory, sheriff's investigators were summoned, Schaffroth said.  </P> <P> The woman was declared dead at the scene.  </P></p>

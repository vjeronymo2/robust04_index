			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Net profit at Maple Leaf Foods edges ahead MAPLE Leaf Foods, the Toronto-based food processor controlled by the UK's Hillsdown Holdings, reported a small rise in third-quarter earnings, with improved agri-business and baking results offsetting slimmer margins from processed foods. Net earnings climbed to CDollars 20.8m (USDollars 15.8m), or 26 cents a share, from CDollars 19.4m, or 24 cent. Sales rose to CDollars 778.5m from CDollars 695m. Mr Brent Ballantyne, named yesterday as president and CEO, predicted that fourth-quarter earnings would also exceed a year earlier. Maple Leaf said the cost-cutting and rationalisation in its feed, poultry and rendering operations have paid off in sharply higher earnings. But earnings from processed foods were hit by higher raw material costs and a move by consumers to cheaper products. The company said it aims to improve performance by launching new products and cutting costs, giving greater attention to private labels, and by further inroads into the US market.</p>

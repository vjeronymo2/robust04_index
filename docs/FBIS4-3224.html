			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanning, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's  Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has built various kinds of  markets in the past few years, which have stimulated regional  economic development.    As a commodity economy is taking the place of the planned  economy, the construction of markets becomes inevitable and  urgent.    By the end of 1993, the region had set up 2,593 consumer  goods markets and 37 production material markets.    As to the financial reform, 50 bonds, stock, foreign  currencies and insurance markets, and 198 securities  organizations had been created by 1993.    Since trading in land and housing has become profitable, the  real estate markets have grown fast.    Many labor and talents exchange and introduction markets,  technology markets and information markets were also established  in the region.    These markets have not only stimulated the economy but also  brought convenience to local people.</p>

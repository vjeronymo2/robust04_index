			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's new tax plan received a mixed reaction from Japan's  major dailies Friday [4 February].    The ASAHI SHIMBUN and MAINICHI SHIMBUN criticized Hosokawa  over the plan, announced at a news conference in the early hours  of Thursday. A leading business daily, the NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN, was also critical, saying the net tax increase from the  proposal will not help the sluggish economy to recover.    But the YOMIURI SHIMBUN threw firm support behind the prime  minister, and the SANKEI SHIMBUN offered qualified support.    In an editorial titled "An Absurd `Decision' by the Prime  Minister," the opinion-leading ASAHI said, "What on earth is the  matter?" alluding to "unprecedented turmoil" among the  government and ruling coalition parties over Hosokawa's tax  reform plan.    The ASAHI asked, "what was the point of Wednesday's talks  among the coalition and the prime minister's early Thursday news  conference?"    "We cannot understand why the new tax plan was launched so  abruptly," the ASAHI said, adding that there are too many  unclear points about the plan.    "It cannot be overlooked that not only the Social Democratic  Party [SDP] but even Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  did not know about the new tax plan until just before the  announcement," it said.    The MAINICHI SHIMBUN said Hosokawa failed to respond to  questions on why the consumption tax must be changed to a  national welfare tax or why the new indirect tax must be imposed  in April 1997.    "Is it a wise choice to impose the new tax in three years'  time and set the tax rate at 7 percent," the MAINICHI asked in  an editorial titled "The Premier's Decision Is Too Abrupt."    The largest national daily, the YOMIURI, said it was  "basically in support" of Hosokawa's tax plan, which it called a  sweeping tax reform that follows the imposition of the 3 percent  consumption tax five years ago.    The YOMIURI said, "a large income tax cut is necessary to  escape from the present prolonged recession. But a tax cut  without a revenue source is nothing more than political  irresponsibility."    It urged the SDP and the main opposition party, the Liberal  Democratic Party, to help the government enact legislation on  the tax reform plan based on Hosokawa's announcement.    The YOMIURI's editorial said the planned issuance of  deficit-financing bonds without the backing of revenue sources  for redemption is very dangerous, noting that the cumulative  balance of national bond issues at the end of March 1995 will  reach 200 trillion yen.    The NIHON KEIZAI said tax reform must be neutral, but  Hosokawa's tax plan will produce as much as 3.5 trillion yen of  net tax increases.    It said, "Needless to say, this will sharply offset effects  from income tax reductions...an advance tax cut will be  meaningless. Of course, people will not support it."    The SANKEI SHIMBUN urged Hosokawa to "conduct tax reform in  a  fair manner."    Hosokawa's decision basically complies with the direction of  tax reform that calls for imposing taxes appropriately on  income, consumption and assets and for taxpayers to share the  burden fairly.    But questions remain, the SANKEI said. "Why could the prime  minister not propose an increase in the consumption tax rate?"    It also questioned why a 9.5 trillion yen tax increase is  necessary to offset a 6 trillion yen tax cut.</p>

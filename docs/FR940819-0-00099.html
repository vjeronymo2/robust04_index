The FAA received comments from associations, labor organizations, and part 121 operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA, which primarily represents part 121 scheduled operators, stated that the proposal would cost its members at least $8 million annually to revise current computer crew scheduling programs, hire additional personnel, extend layovers, and schedule reserves. ATA believes that the costs were understated in the NPRM and noted that they did not include an inflation factor. ATA indicated that the 15-year cost of the proposed rule would be $88,947,099 using a 7-percent discount rate and a 3-percent inflation rate. RAA stated that the costs associated with the proposed rule are significantly understated. In addition, RAA believes that the economic effect of the proposed rule should reflect the cost burden of other recent rulemakings. NACA stated that the proposal would cost one of its members an estimated $372,000 annually for additional staffing and $50,000 annually to meet recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions stated that the median flight attendant salary, based on the average salary for supplemental air carrier flight attendants represented by the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), is $18,461. According to the Coalition, if 6,000 flight attendants are hired by supplemental operators, the cost in salaries will be $1,107,660 [sic]. The Coalition noted that this is one tenth the cost of random drug testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delta Airlines, a scheduled part 121 operator, indicated that the initial cost to comply with the proposed rule would be $2,863,416. This cost includes the cost of hiring 36 additional flight attendants, estimated at $1,348,000; paying flight attendants during deplaning, estimated at $749,000; providing additional meals, estimated at $400,000; and modifying computer software, estimated to be a one-time cost of $367,000. Delta estimates that the annual cost to comply with the proposed rule would be $2.5 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sun Country Airlines, an unscheduled part 121 operator, stated that it would be required to augment cabin crews on domestic flights more often than it now does. Sun Country Airlines also stated that, if the NPRM had been effective in 1992, the carrier would have hired an additional 34 flight attendants and the cost to domestic operations would have been $2.6 million in salaries, benefits, training, hotels, meals, deadhead travel, and administrative burden. Sun Country Airlines pointed out that the NPRM estimated that supplemental operators would absorb 60 percent of the proposal's costs while supplemental operators employ only 1 percent of all flight attendants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Great American Airways, an unscheduled part 121 operator, stated that the proposed rule would impose substantially greater costs on supplemental air carriers. Positioning flight attendants would become a major expense for supplemental operators. Unanticipated schedule and routing changes could severely curtail current flexibility. However, Great American Airways stated that the disruptions mentioned above would be minimized if supplemental air carriers had the option to apply the same work rules to both flight attendants and pilots. Great American Airways estimates that the total cost savings that would be derived from implementing a single set of duty limitations for its cabin and flight crewmembers, as opposed to adopting the requirements proposed in the NPRM, would be more than $100,000 annually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comments that address the costs associated with this final rule are addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation Summary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information collection requirements for parts 121, 125, and 135 have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) and have been assigned OMB Control Numbers as follows: For part 121, OMB Control Number 2120&hyph;0008; for part 125, OMB Control Number 2120&hyph;0085; and for part 135, OMB Control Number 2120&hyph;0039. The FAA has prepared changes to these control numbers to reflect the additional paperwork requirements of this final rule and has submitted these changes to OMB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In completing this rulemaking, the FAA has been mindful that it is the policy of the agency and the Administration to avoid imposing unnecessary paperwork burdens on industry. To that end, the FAA has carefully considered all comments on recordkeeping and has made every attempt to minimize the paperwork burden for carriers. For example, allowing carriers to employ a single scheduling system for entire crews_pilots and flight attendants_will enable them to avoid maintaining two separate duty schedules. Indeed, for many carriers, the FAA believes the final rule will create little or no net additional paperwork. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has determined that this rule: (1) Is a significant regulatory action as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is significant as defined in Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) would not constitute a barrier to international trade. These analyses, summarized below, are available in the docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Cost-Benefit Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

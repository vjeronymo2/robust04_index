			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> ORANGE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SAVANNA SURVIVES LONG-RANGE RALLY FROM BREA-OLINDA  </P> <P> Defending Orange League champion Savanna High School defeated visiting  Brea-Olinda, 61-55, but the Rebels had to survive a 3-point blitz by Brea in  the fourth quarter Friday night.  </P> <P> Savanna dominated the first three quarters. In the first quarter, the Rebels  connected on 5 of 12 shots, held Brea to just 2 of 9 shots, and limited 3-point  specialist Keith Walker, to 2 points to end the quarter leading, 13-4.  </P> <P> Savanna, ranked sixth in the Orange County Sportswriters' Assn. poll, continued  to play pressure man-to-man defense and patiently execute its half-court  offense, taking a 24-17 halftime lead.  </P> <P> With less than 2 minutes to play in the third quarter, Savanna's fast break  picked apart Brea's press. The Rebels went on an 8-point run to end the quarter  with a comfortable 44-27 lead.  </P> <P> But with 5 minutes remaining and Savanna leading, 55-37, something happened.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda dropped the bombs.  </P> <P> Brea began hustling away from its basket to get in 3-point range.  </P> <P> Brea attempted 16 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, hitting 5 en route to  outscoring Savanna, 28-17, in the quarter.  </P> <P> It was enough to make the game exciting, but not enough for the victory.  </P> <P> David Dittman's 3-pointer with about 4 minutes to play cut the lead to 15  points.  </P> <P> Walker, who made 3 3-pointers in the quarter, hit 1 with just less than 3  minutes to play to cut the lead to 55-43.  </P> <P> Matt Chamberlain hit another with 1:20 to play and Marc Shaw's 2 free throws 7  seconds later reduced the lead to 59-50.  </P> <P> Mustapha Abdi scored on a fast-break layup, but Walker connected from beyond  the top of the key to make the score, 61-53, with 55 seconds to play.  </P> <P> But Brea ran out of ammunition, missing its next 3 3-pointers.  </P> <P> Savanna's Jimmy Priest, who hit 4 3-point shots in the game, led his team with  19 points. Abdi added 17.  </P> <P> Walker hit 7 of 21 shots to finish as the game's leading scorer with 24 points.  Teammate Matt Chamberlain added 12.  </P> <P> "That 3-point shot can bring you back in a hurry and Walker got hot," Savanna  Coach Tom Gregory said.  </P> <P> "They changed the tempo of the ballgame at the end of third quarter, they upped  the tempo and I don't think we were mentally prepared. We were in a lull."  </P> <P> Magnolia 70, Valencia 55 -- Magnolia outscored Valencia, 22-9, in the fourth  quarter to improve its record to 8-6, 2-0. Jerry Jones scored 19 points to lead  the Sentinels. Richard McKee scored 17 and Jason Nester 11. Rudy Lopez led  Valencia with 19 points.  </P> <P> Western 80, Anaheim 72 (OT) -- Sam Sabbara scored 18 points to lead visiting  Western. Jude Barbito made a 3-point play with 22 seconds left in regulation to  send the game into overtime but Western (11-4, 1-1) outscored Anaheim, 9-1 in  overtime.  </P></p>

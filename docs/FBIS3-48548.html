Japanese officials who took part in the day's meeting said  the Japanese side has proposed another round of meetings early  next month in Tokyo.    U.S. officials declined to make any comments as they emerged  from a two-hour session held at the White House conference  center.    U.S. and Japanese officials have scheduled separate  briefings  on the framework trade talks at 6 P.M. (8 A.M. Wednesday Japan  time).    The two sides are supposed to draw up a progress report by  the time Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meets with  President Bill Clinton on February 11 in Washington.    But both U.S. and Japanese officials have admitted they are  still divided on how to interpret the meaning of "objective  criteria," the most contentious provision incorporated in the  framework accord which the two countries concluded last July.  "There is no movement at all from the Japanese side," said  Marcus Noland, a senior economist at the White House Council of  Economic Advisers and a member of the U.S. negotiating team.    While saying there are problems "in all areas" of trade  issues identified in the framework agreement, Noland singled out  Japan's macroeconomic policy and access to the Japanese auto  market as the "most difficult" confronting U.S. negotiators.    Members of the Japanese negotiating team, headed by Deputy  Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura, "are just repeating over and  over" their positions, Noland said. [passage omitted]    Japanese officials say Japan will oppose the use of any  indicators, arguing that governments in market economies have no  power to dictate the level of imports for specific industries.    Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, Japan's Ambassador to  the U.S. Takakazu Kuriyama called the U.S. expectations of  predetermined market shares "unrealistic" in market economies.  "The United States should understand that putting up a certain  quantitative goal and trying to achieve it -- isn't something  that can happen in the real business world," he said.    Kuriyama, who is due to fly back to Tokyo this Sunday for  consultations ahead of the Clinton-Hosokawa summit, urged  Washington not to "lose sight" of the principal purpose of the  framework agreement, how to make the Japanese market more open  to foreign goods and services.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTHUR MILLER'S 'ENEMY' HAS FOUND A FRIEND;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: HIS ADAPTATION OF THE IBSEN CLASSIC AIRS ON 'AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE'  WEDNESDAY. IT HAS BEEN ONE OF HIS HAPPIER COLLABORATIONS.  </P> <P> "Excuse me," the young actor said nervously. "Could you please autograph this?"  </P> <P> The balding, bespectacled man looked up from his lunch and smiled. "Sure," he  told the actor, a boy not more than 12 whom he had met earlier that day. "Put  it here."  </P> <P> The boy put a script on the man's lap and gave him a felt pen. The man quickly  scribbled Arthur Miller on a page and handed it back to him. The young fan  beamed. "Thank you," he said and walked away.  </P> <P> The 74-year-old playwright began to chuckle ever so slightly: "That kid told  me, 'I read your book, 'The Crucible.' "  </P> <P> Miller had flown in from his Connecticut home to observe a read-through of the  "American Playhouse" production of "An Enemy of the People," starring John  Glover and George Grizzard, which airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. on KCET Channel 28  and KPBS Channel 15.  </P> <P> Forty years ago, Miller adapted 19th-Century Norwegian playwright Henrik  Ibsen's all-too-relevant tale of a doctor who discovers industrial pollution in  his community and is condemned by its citizens when he demands the truth be  told. For the "American Playhouse" production, the locale has been switched  from Norway to Maine.  </P> <P> Miller sat silently at the head of a large table in a rehearsal hall at  Fox/KTTV studios and listened intently to the actors reciting their lines. When  the play was finished, Miller shut the script and sat back in his chair. He  smiled at the cast. He told them he was happy with what he heard.  </P> <P> Director Jack O'Brien interrupted the proceedings to call lunch, and the man  who wrote such classics as "All My Sons," "Death of a Salesman" and "The  Crucible" retreated to the porch outside the rehearsal hall. He made himself  comfortable in a straight-back chair and took a bite of his roast beef  sandwich.  </P> <P> "They were very good," Miller said of the cast. "They had never done that last  part before. The rest of the play they have been working on, but this is their  first go at it."  </P> <P> "An Enemy of the People" marks the second time that Miller and O'Brien have  collaborated on an "American Playhouse" production. Three years ago, O'Brien  directed "All My Sons" to great acclaim.  </P> <P> "He's very good," Miller said over the din of cars roaring by on the Hollywood  Freeway. "He's real interpretive and knows how to read. His 'All My Sons' was a  beautiful production -- better than the film version."  </P> <P> Beautiful is not the word Miller would use to describe the film versions of his  work -- especially "All My Sons" (1948) and "Death of a Salesman" (1951).  </P> <P> "In those days when there were big studios, they wanted the playwright as far  away as possible," Miller said. "Clifford Odets wrote screenplays but he worked  out here. I never did that. If you weren't going to do that, they didn't want  the original writer around. Finally, they would send me a shooting script a  couple of weeks before they were going to start and I would object."  </P> <P> But the studios never listened to his objections. "I think a certain amount of  adaptation is required, but (what) happens in general is that the gigantic  effect of scenes gets undermined because they pull the scenes apart like a  sweater."  </P> <P> He gives high marks to the 1985 Dustin Hoffman TV version of "Salesman," which  was directed by Volker Schlondorff. "That was the play purely and simply," he  said.  </P> <P> Lee J. Cobb, who originated the Willy Loman role on Broadway when he was only  in his 30s, also did a TV version of "Salesman" in 1966 that Miller admired.  "Lee was a great actor," he said with a twinkle in his eyes. "Lee was old when  he was 2."  </P> <P> Miller is working on a new play but won't divulge any details. "Broadway is not  a very happy place," he said. "At Lincoln Center, though, people are trying to  do some interesting work. They are doing a play of mine next October, 'The  Archbishop's Ceiling.' That was done at the Royal Shakespeare Company. They do  a lot of my plays in England. They have theater instilled in them. It's been  cultivated by those great theater companies.  </P> <P> "Actually," he said, "I can't complain. My work is done more now in and out of  this country than ever."  </P> <P> But don't expect Miller to write another screenplay. His first, "The Misfits,"  starred his second wife, Marilyn Monroe, and Clark Gable. The moody drama  failed at the box office in 1961, but has gained in reputation over the years.  His second, "Everybody Wins," opened this year and was a critical and  commercial disaster.  </P> <P> "I never liked to write screenplays," Miller said. " 'Everybody Wins' seemed  like a good idea at the time. You can't control them unless you are going to  direct it. It could have been something, but there were too many variations,  which I don't like. Why waste my time?"  </P></p>

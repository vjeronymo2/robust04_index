			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Receivers called in at Yugo importer THE UK importer of Serbian-built Yugo cars has gone into administrative receivership, leaving 60,000 owners and the dealer network with fading hopes of securing adequate supplies of replacement parts. Zastava (GB)  - based at Reading in Berkshire  - which was controlled by the Serbian export/import agent BSE Genex and traded as Yugo Cars, has seen its supply of cars and replacement parts dry up since the UN imposed sanctions on Serbia in May. Only 2,000 cars were sold last year, compared with nearly 10,000 sales a year in the late 1980s. Just a handful of employees were left at the Reading headquarters when the receiver was called in, compared with a peak of 125 during the height of Yugo's sales success. The receiver, Mr Keith Selley of Robson Taylor, the Bristol and Bath based accountants, said yesterday he expected to complete a sale, possibly today, of Zastava's assets  - mainly spare parts and a few vehicles. Many of the Yugo dealers are trying to stay viable through second-hand car sales and servicing, but the network has begun to break up, with some switching to other makes. The Yugo factory, at Kragujevac near Belgrade, has laid off most of its workforce, with some reports indicating that it has switched part of the facility to making armaments.</p>

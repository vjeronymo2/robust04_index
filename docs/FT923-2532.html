			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / People: Reuters' director adds to exam standards Philip Wood, group financial controller and director of treasury at Reuters since 1990, has been appointed to the School Examinations and Assessment Council (SEAC) by education secretary John Patten. Wood joins a little-known quango, but one moving to the centre of the education debate with the growing controversy over exam standards and content. SEAC's chairman, Lord Griffiths, is the former head of Lady Thatcher's policy unit at No 10, and an out-and-out revisionist. A solid core of the other members are Tories and enthusiastic members of the 'back to basics' school, including four well-known academics: Lord Skidelsky (Keynes's biographer), John Marks, John Barnes and Gillian Peele. No doubt Wood's background as an audit partner at Price Waterhouse for 14 years is intended to take the counter-revolution on from Shakespeare to times tables. But alas, not that many accountants can do the sums themselves these days. ***** Bob Barton, the new chief executive of BOUSTEAD, the manufacturing, technical services and distribution group acquired last month by Singaporean businessman Jack Chia, has brought in a former colleague, Philip Smith, as group financial controller. Smith, who had worked with Barton at Cold Storage Holdings in Singapore, will take over from Michael Thesiger, 56, who has been at Boustead since 1975, and group finance director since 1979. Thesiger, who had also been made company secretary in 1987, now steps down from the board, remaining company secretary but giving up his financial responsibilities. Smith, however, is not joining the board. Barton says he has plenty of good financial brains on the board already, including Geoffrey Hall, chief executive of the Jack Chia Group in the UK, and two non-executive directors, Robin Baillie, who is also a non-executive director of Standard Chartered, and Colin Endacott, who was previously a general manager with Standard Chartered. ***** Stephen Russell, until recently md of Caparo Steel Stockholders, has been appointed md of Serco-Ryan, a subsidiary of LILLESHALL, on the retirement of Paul Lower who is to pursue other interests outside the fastener industry.</p>

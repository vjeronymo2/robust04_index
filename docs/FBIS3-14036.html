			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by A.B.S. Jafri] </F>   [Text] Pakistan's latest note on Indian annexed Kashmir  covers all the major issues and calls for the most urgent  attention with the utmost earnestness. This communication  handed over to New Delhi yesterday is a model of clarity, logic  and reason. Inevitably, the core issue of Kashmir tops the  agenda presented by Pakistan. If there is a sincere desire to  restore peace and tranquillity to [words indistinct] state under  Indian military occupation, Pakistan recommends four steps to be  taken by India. First, face and accept the fact that the people  of Kashmir under Indian control just would not accept it  anymore. Second, the active and operational presence of over  half a million crack Indian Army troops militates against the  remotest possibility of peace. Third, the massive repression of  civilian population is unacceptable not only to its direct  victims, but also to world conscience. And fourth, reckless  violation of the Line of Control keeps tension at an intolerable  level.    It is for India and India alone to act to remove the clearly  defined problems. These problems have their origins in New  Delhi and New Delhi has to act to retrieve the situation, which  is getting more and more complicated by the minute. Those who  would expect to effectively divert world attention from Indian  military action and [word indistinct] rise in abuse of human  rights ought to realize now that that (?trick) just did not  work. India must change its direction and abandon the line  which would only lead it into a sea of trouble.    Pakistan has taken up India's favorite theme of  confidence-building measures. The six non-papers which the  Indian Foreign Office had presented to Pakistan have been dealt  with in detail in Islamabad note. About confidence-building,  Pakistan points out the first and also the most convincing step  in that direction would be a fair balance of forces in the  subcontinent. It has recalled that this is what the United  Nations defined as a prerequisite in its resolutions dating back  to 1947. It made the best confidence-building strategy then; it  does so now.    Pakistan and India should move toward hammering out a fair  formula for balance of conventional forces and nonproliferation  of the same. The Pakistan Foreign Office fails to understand  what exactly is the connotation of India's suggestion for an  agreement of nonuse of nuclear capability against each other.  This doesn't make a great deal of sense because Pakistan cannot  promise not to use nuclear capability because it doesn't have  it. And it has not proposed to acquire it. So, that is that  about nonuse of nuclear capability in the subcontinent.  [sentence as heard] What Pakistan and the world community  cannot forget however is that India is a nuclear power and if  there is to be any promise about nonuse of nuclear capability in  the subcontinent, it is for India to volunteer a categorical  renunciation in this context.    On the Siachen flash point, Pakistan points out that India  has made an incursion in the frozen [word indistinct] in  disregard of the Shimla Agreement. The issue can be solved  tomorrow if India traces its steps back to the appropriate  point. The Sir Creek issue should cause no headache if only  India would agree to refer it in an impartial international  arbitration. As for the Wular Barrage issue, Islamabad has made  note of the disappointing fact that India's non-paper does not  address the real issue. But Pakistan is ever-willing to join  talks with India on the subject as indeed on any subject of  mutual interests and concern.    Pakistan emphasizes the fact that it agreed to wait for the  non-papers which the Indian foreign secretary promised to  provide during the secretary-level talks earlier this year. It  was felt then in Islamabad that the non-paper's promise was to  circumvent substantial talks on the core issue which is the  future of Kashmiris under Indian control and military action.  And it turns out to be exactly that the non-papers registered  no progress on any issue. Waiting for them has put talks on the  real issue back by so many weeks. Pakistan would like India to  persuade itself that the facts of the situation in occupied  Kashmir have now reached a point where they are unalterable no  matter how much of military power and its deployment is resorted  to.  *</p>

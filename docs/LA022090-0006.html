			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARLETA GARDEN  </P> <P> I find it frustrating and contradictory that while you report of the  self-indulgences of the Department of Water and Power at the expense of its  utility customers (Part B, "Only in L.A.," Feb. 9), a manager in the DWP's  property division is trying to persuade us that because of necessary cutbacks,  the DWP would like to give the boot to Metro Farms' Arleta Community Gardens  retired senior citizens so the DWP can lease the club's garden area to a  commercial nursery.  </P> <P> For the past 15 years we have maintained gardens under the transmission lines  and have been an asset to the community.  </P> <P> We pay for the water that we use, share the vegetables that we grow and  practice conservation of our resources through composting, mulching and organic  gardening. The department needs to more closely scrutinize and reassess its  sense of values and be more sensitive to its own energy conservation and to the  needs of its community.  </P> <P> DAVID E. WINSEMAN  </P> <P> Arleta  </P></p>

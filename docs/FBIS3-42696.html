			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Materials of the "Round Table" prepared by Lyudmila Telen: </F> "Assessing Gaydar -- Contemplating Chernomyrdin"]    [Text] Will the policy of reforms change after the  resignation of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov? And if it does,  then how? These and other questions are examined by MN's [MOSCOW  NEWS] guests -- Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Parliamentary  Committee on the Budget and Finances; Vasily Selyunin,  economist, deputy of the State Duma; and Mark Massarsky,  entrepreneur.  <H5>  Diagnosis </H5>   Vasily Selyunin:    "A change of course is not on the horizon for us -- it  already occurred this January."    Mark Massarsky:    "Liberal democracy has suffered a historical defeat in  Russia."    Mikhail Zadornov:    "The change of course took place a long time ago. Today  it has simply become clear and obvious to everyone. When secrets  are unveiled, I believe, it is a blessing."    Selyunin: The policy of reform was associated with  the names of Gaydar and Fedorov. With their departure  Chernomyrdin will be able to pursue a pro-inflationary policy  which was resisted by the two reformists. Several economic  decisions are enough to unwind inflation. The government has  declared some of its intentions. One of them is the unification  of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. It has been  estimated that it will increase the inflation rate in Russia by  10 percent. Another decision is to allot 500 million dollars for  the construction of a new parliament building. I have dealt with  the economics of construction all my life, and I do not remember  a single case of a construction project being consistent with  the original estimate. A normal increase in the cost is between  three and four times. This means that we are ready to invest in  the construction of the parliament building as much as we spent  last year on all the programs of conversion.    But the point is not in this alone. Beginning February 1,  there is a plan to raise the wages and salaries of those  employed in the budgetary sphere by 90 percent. As well as the  expenditures on the newly-elected Federal Assembly. The experts  of the Russia's Choice bloc have estimated that this amounts to  15 million rubles per deputy a month.    What is the threat here? Already in the first quarter of  January inflation was as high as 10 percent, meaning that it  will reach 33 percent by the end of the month. If it keeps up  this pace throughout the year, prices will grow 31-fold!    Massarsky: It looks as if this government will  intervene even more strongly in the economy, and the end result  will be the destruction of reforms. A healthy dislike of any  government is an indicator of my liberalism. But I dislike the  new government even more strongly than the old one.    Zadornov: If we speak about the economy, the  attempt at classical macrostabilization lasted through the first  three months of 1992. At that time Gaydar came to understand  that their attempts had miserably failed. Gaydar was faced with  an option: either to admit that his idea had proved untenable  and step aside or to use his name as a screen for a totally  different kind of policy. He opted for the second road. From  that moment on, the Gaydar team busied itself not with economic  problems but with an entirely different one; how to preserve  themselves at the helm of power.  <H5>  Case History </H5>   Vasily Selyunin:    "After the Supreme Soviet had been dismissed, the  government began pursuing an austere financial policy, with the  result that the budget deficit rose to 7 percent and inflation  to 12 percent a month."    Mark Massarsky:    "The government of reformers has dealt a crushing blow  at the non-state economy."    Mikhail Zadornov:    "Since May 1992 Gaydar and his government have been  pursuing a pro-inflationary policy."    Selyunin: Let us remember what turn of development  has taken place in the last months of 1993. The Supreme Soviet  drafted a budget with a large deficit. In defiance of  everything, even the law, Minister of Finance Fedorov refused to  fulfil it. The handing out of preferential credits was  practically discontinued at the same time. Subsidies for import  (they absorbed up to 12 percent of the GNP), i.e., the  possibility to buy dollars not at the exchange, but for a song,  were sharply limited, and they were left merely to purchase  medicines and medical equipment. Measures were taken to  liberalize foreign trade. Though not the best, a  non-inflationary solution was found even in the situation with  miners. Part of the diamonds were sold and a fund for the  development of the fuel-and-energy complex was created on  account of increasing the value-added tax. The reckless  subsidizing of the CIS countries was brought to an end. As a  result, we received 12 percent of inflation in December against  26 percent in August.    Massarsky: I would not overdramatize Gaydar's  departure and key up Shakespearean passions. The government of  reformers has not coped with the task of macroeconomic  regulation. As it has turned out, the Russian economy is  inadequate in its responses to classical ploys. A simple  example: to the compression of the money mass it reacts with a  reduction of the volumes of output, not with a lowering of  prices as is written in manuals. the result was the destruction  of production -- a fact which Gaydar and Fedorov, according to  their own words, are not inclined to dramatize. I, for my part,  will permit myself to make the following analogy. The Western  economy may be likened to a tropical forest: you chop down a  tree in the morning and there are already green sprouts in the  same place in the evening. But our Russian economy looks more  like the tundra: nothing will grow for 50 years on a trail left  by a cross-country vehicle.    But the point is not even in the economic results as such.  The reformers have lost because the social basis of reforms has  shrunk as a result of their actions. A crushing blow has been  dealt to the non-state sector of the economy. Between 1989 and  1990 the cooperative sector of the economy grew to seven million  persons and became the only dynamic sector where current assets  amounted to main capital. The so-called liberalization of prices  has practically wiped out these assets. Conversely, in the state  sector there has been an indexation of fixed and current assets,  attended by the mutual account of nonpayments. All this has  sharply strengthened the noncompetitive state sector.    Not to mention the taxation policy with which the reformers  have been destroying us. With such taxes -- and in some cases  their sum-total comes to 85 percent today -- it is impossible to  have reproduction not only on a simple but even on an enlarged  scale.    Why are the reformers being thanked so much by the  commercial  banks, street traders evading taxes and the comprador  bourgeoisie taking unreplenishable raw materials out of Russia?  Objectively, irrespective of its good liberal-democratic  intentions, the government of reformers has expressed the  interests of the comprador bourgeoisie, speculative capital and  officials who, like hotel prostitutes, take bribes solely in  foreign currency. The world has not known and, I hope, will not  know bribe-takers like the ones who have been spawned by the  government of reformers.    Zadornov: This "absence of policy" was continued  throughout the whole of 1993. It had no clearly expressed  guideposts and was internally contradictory, whereas the  government was divided into groups which lobbied the interests  of definite strata. The only person who expressed opposition to  this policy was Boris Fedorov, who alone consistently resisted  pro-inflationary solutions. Let us put it bluntly that he did  that not quite correctly and quite often did not fulfil even  presidential decrees. But let us cherish no illusions, for it is  not Fedorov who shaped up policy. As a result, both Fedorov and  Gaydar acted as a screen for by no means a liberal economic  policy.  <H5>  Forecast </H5>   Vasily Selyunin:    "By spring Chernomyrdin will have been fired -- this  will be a result of his own policy."    Mark Massarsky:    "I expect nothing good of the new government -- things  will grow even worse."    Mikhail Zadornov:    "It is pointless, I believe, to speak about the  economic reform in the immediate future."    Selyunin: The more Chernomyrdin vows fidelity to  reforms, the more doubts this arouses. The Persians have a  saying: "You said -- I believed, you repeated -- I doubted, you  started insisting -- I came to understand that you were lying."  The premier and, it seems, the president have drawn the  following conclusion from the election returns: the pace of  reforms must be slowed down, weak enterprises must be kept  afloat, and unemployment must be resisted. However, they tend to  forget that this entire "softening" will bring about a splash of  inflation. But what people fear most of all is the growth of  prices.    Gaydar's opponents say: "We must stimulate production." But  the floating of money stimulates production growth only to a  certain extent. Very quickly inflation acquires such a scale  that money discontinues working in general. We have witnessed  this situation in Ukraine where inflation is already comparable  with that of war-torn Serbia. God forbid that we take the  Ukrainian road. I believe that already by spring things may  reach the point of an all-Russia strike. The government will  resign.    Massarsky: On an even larger scale the government  will begin feeding noncompetitive production units -- collective  and state farms, the military-industrial complex, loss-making  mines, and so on. By destroying competition it will destroy the  rudiments of the market.    Zadornov: Large centralized credits will be  allotted in the immediate future, for decisions to this effect  have already been drafted. A steep spiral of inflation is  assured. And it is important to note the following: the new  government will be able to draw on the left-wing parliamentary  majority. But the situation is even more dramatic. Upon the  constitution's implementation, real power will be concentrated  in the president's hands. Will the president find the strength  and desire to be a more radical reformer than the government and  the parliamentary majority? This question remains unanswered.    Massarsky: If the president joins hands with the  Left on the principle of the state being the be-all and end-all  (and, judging by his followers' statements, this is possible),  the priorities of civic society will be consigned to oblivion.  Pride of place will again be given not to man, but to the state.  This will have its imprint not only on policy, but on the  economy, too. I am still an optimist though. I believe that we  will be saved by polycentrism. After all, there still exists the  parliamentary democratic opposition. There is the fracturing of  interests in the structure of the executive branch itself: the  government is already turning into a definite counterbalance to  presidential structures. And, last but not least, there exists  the fourth branch as well.    <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-012C-43A>           Figure </FIG></p>

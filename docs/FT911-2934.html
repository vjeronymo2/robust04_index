			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Rentals and service side bolsters Xerox A STEADY stream of rental and service fees has sheltered Xerox from the recession's impact on sales of its more expensive copying and duplicating products. The Connecticut-based company yesterday reported virtually unchanged first-quarter earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 106m, orDollars 1.01 a share, against Dollars 113m, or 97 cents, a year earlier. The 1990 figures exclude a Dollars 367m loss on discontinued financing and real estate businesses. Total revenues were virtually unchanged at Dollars 4.2bn, but masked significant differences among individual businesses. Lower sales of electronic typewriters and large copiers were offset by a modest rise in demand for less expensive duplicators and copiers, and fax machines. Profits from document processing matched last year's levels, thanks mainly to growth in income from services, rentals, supplies and financing of equipment. Xerox said it has a good response to its new DocuTech product line, launched last October. Xerox's financial services business, which includes the insurance group Crum and Forster, lifted first-quarter earnings to Dollars 6m from Dollars 3m, despite a 9 per cent fall in revenues to just over Dollars 1bn. The company said improved insurance underwriting income, helped by an 'aggressive' effort to withdraw from unprofitable business, offset lower pre-tax capital gains.</p>

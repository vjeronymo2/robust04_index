			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Italian telecoms groups ahead ITALY'S leading state-controlled telecommunications groups, which are due to be rationalised and sold to the public under a greatly simplified structure, reported strong profits growth in the first half of 1993. Stet, the overall holding company, said consolidated gross profits rose to L1,788bn (Dollars 1.1bn) in the first half from L1,566bn, while pre-tax earnings at parent company level rose to L428.1bn from L400.9bn. The group forecast earnings for the year would be in line with those for 1992, when group net profits amounted to L1,425bn. Sales are expected to rise by about 10 per cent over the 1992 level of L27,167bn. Group turnover in the first half increased by 7.4 per cent to L14,242bn, excluding sales by Finsiel, the software and information technology company bought by Stet in the second half of last year. Analysts, who have been strongly recommending Italian telecommunications stocks this year on privatisation prospects and expectations of higher earnings, were relieved to see investment spending falling to L3,445bn in the first half, against L4,632bn in the same period last year. Italy's state telecoms groups have spent heavily in recent years to modernise the network, leading to a string of rights issues. Stet gave no details of the rationalisation of the country's telecoms utilities, due to start at the end of this year with the merger of Sip, the main domestic operating subsidiary, and Italcable, the leading international phone carrier. However, it indicated that progress towards rationalisation was also being made on the manufacturing and network services side, where functions are currently divided between four subsidiaries. Separately, Sip said gross operating profits in the first half soared by 44 per cent to L991.6bn. The company forecast that this year's net earnings would be higher than the L461bn made in 1992. The group, which this week announced it had reached 1m subscribers for its mobile telephone service - the third biggest in Europe after the UK and Germany - rose by 7.6 per cent to L11,409bn. Meanwhile Italcable, which is also quoted, reported a small increase in pre-tax first-half profits to L147.7bn from L143.3bn last year. Turnover increased by 7.5 per cent to L388.6bn.</p>

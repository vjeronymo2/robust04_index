			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the present time, the designation of F/FAs encompasses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both leaded and unleaded gasoline F/FAs and diesel <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> F/FAs produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and commercially distributed for use in motor vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  F/FAs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended only for off-road use (e.g., farm and construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, aircraft, boats, railroad engines) are not currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated to be registered, and thus are not subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of today's rule. However, if off-road F/FAs become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated in the future (according to provisions under CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 213), this rule will be modified, as needed, to cover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the designated F/FAs include leaded gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulations, CAA section 211(n) provides that ``after December  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31, 1995 it shall be unlawful for any person to sell, offer for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sale, supply, offer for supply, dispense, transport, or introduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into commerce, for use as fuel in any motor vehicle (as defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 7554(a) of this title) any gasoline which contains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead or lead additives.'' Because of the upcoming ban of leaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FAs, compliance with the requirements in today's rule will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> superfluous for manufacturers of leaded products. Thus, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leaded fuel family has been deleted from this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While alternative fuels and their additives are currently on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the market, they are not yet designated and thus not yet required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be registered. However, because they are currently used and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA contemplates their future designation, this final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes provisions for their registration and testing. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fuels for which provisions are included are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methanol, ethanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural gas (LNG), and liquified petroleum gas (LPG). EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently developing the proposal for the designation of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fuels and their additives. In that proposal, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently intends to propose to set an effective date for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final designation rule far enough in the future so that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FAs could complete whatever pre-registration testing would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required prior to the time they would be required to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered. EPA currently believes the delay of the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of the designation rule would be justified by the need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize disruptions in an existing market for alternative F/FAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule contains a number of special provisions which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce or modify the program's requirements for certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers or certain classes of products. Such special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions apply to small businesses (as defined in this rule)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and manufacturers of experimental F/FAs, relabeled products, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aerosols. These provisions are described in Section X of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Health Evaluation Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The testing program established in this rule focuses on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification and evaluation of potential adverse health effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with inhalation exposure to F/FA emissions. The Tier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 testing program of this rule addresses, in addition to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas of inquiry mandated by the statute (carcinogenicity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> teratogenicity, and mutagenicity), specific assessments designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to detect potential pulmonary, neurotoxic, and general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reproductive effects of F/FA emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, short-term (42-day) tests were proposed under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 2 to address each of the health effect endpoints described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above. However, in response to public commentary and EPA's own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, the Tier 2 testing requirements have been modified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this final rule to enhance the efficiency and feasibility of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Today's rule uses a comprehensive 90-day subchronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhalation protocol and ancillary tests to examine general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systemic and organ toxicity (including pulmonary toxicity), as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as the specific areas of concern described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These evaluations require the exposure of laboratory animals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the whole emissions of F/FAs. Tier 2 tests are to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted for both combustion and (when applicable) evaporative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. The subchronic inhalation protocol allows the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination of specific endpoints within the 90-day testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> framework. For example, pulmonary and neurotoxic effects are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined in conjunction with the subchronic study standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> histopathological requirements. The neurotoxicity assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also includes a biochemical assay to measure the level of glial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Coordinated with the 90-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study is a battery of three assays used in the evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carcinogenicity and mutagenicity: the in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vitro  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Salmonella assay,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vivo  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> micronucleus assay, and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vivo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  sister chromatid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchange assay. A fertility assessment that looks at both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reproductive and teratogenic effects is also coordinated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general toxicity study. The assessment for reproductive effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involves the mating of exposed animals, the measurement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reproductive cycles, and the histopathology of male and female  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reproductive organs. The teratogenic assessment requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure of pregnant females to F/FA emissions and the subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination of the uterus and its contents just prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal time of parturition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the evaluation of the health effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above, EPA retains the authority under Tier 3 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require additional testing on a case-by-case basis on those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endpoints evaluated under Tier 2 and/or on other endpoints of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern. Further discussion about the specific requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tiers 1, 2, and 3 is provided in Sections VII&hyph;IX.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

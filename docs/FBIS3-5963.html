The dear leader has raised it as the main point to  strengthen  the party and enhance its leadership role in the whole course of  leading the cause of socialism, put forward a policy of party  building for modelling the whole party on the chuche idea and  directed the efforts for its thorough implementation.    He has set forth outstanding strategies and tactics and  proper slogans in each period of our developing revolution and  vigorously encouraged our people to carry out the party's line  and policies and bring about world-startling miracles and  innovations one after another in socialist economic and cultural  construction.    Under his energetic guidance, our country has become a  powerful socialist country with political independence and a  mighty independent national economy and self-defence military  power.    The dear leader has shaped magnanimous politics embracing  all  our people to achieve singlehearted unity of the society in  which the entire people are united closely around the leader in  the same thought and purpose and on the basis of morality and  faithfulness.

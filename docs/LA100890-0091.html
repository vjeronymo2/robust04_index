			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHWEST TIGHTENS RULES ON ACADEMICS  </P> <P> Southwest Conference presidents Sunday enacted the stiffest academic  requirements for athletes in the league's 76-year history.  </P> <P> The policy, set to take effect next fall pending review by conference lawyers,  goes beyond the NCAA's standards. It requires recruits and walk-ons to score at  least 700 on the SAT or 18 on the ACT college entrance exams and to have at  least a 2.0 high school grade-point average in core classes. Failure to meet  those requirements upon enrollment would disqualify athletes from competing  during any remaining years at the school.  </P> <P> Current policy requires student-athletes who do not meet both benchmarks to sit  out for the first year, but allows students three years of athletic eligibility  if grades improve.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview With Faysal al-Husayni, member of the </F> Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho, by Kamal Tarabayh on  17 May; place not given; from the "Today's Guest" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Tarabayh] In Jericho, which is now under the  Palestinian Authority, you have received U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher. How do you evaluate the visit by a foreign  minister of a superpower to the Palestinian autonomous area?    [Al-Husayni] In fact this visit has been allocated to the  Palestinians within the agenda of the Syrian-Israeli track.  Perhaps it is symbolic more than anything else. One meeting  has already been held in Jericho and the other will be held  tomorrow morning in East Jerusalem.    Concerning Jericho, it is obvious that the Americans want to  be the first from outside the region to start official visits to  Jericho. During the meeting, several questions were raised on  the reality in which we are living after the Israeli withdrawal,  in terms of needs and preparedness of the Palestinian forces.  They informed us that certain assistance will be extended,  either to the self-government in the future or to certain areas,  such as Gaza in particular.    [Tarabayh] On the political level, what were the topics you  discussed with Christopher?    [Al-Husayni] In fact the talks centered mainly on the issue  of Jerusalem, the settlement activities, the Israeli practices.  We also stressed the importance of starting negotiations on the  final status [of the occupied territories] as soon as possible.    [Tarabayh] It was observed that when the self-rule agreement  was signed in Cairo, you openly expressed your  apprehensions--and this is not the first time--on the fate of  Jerusalem. Do these apprehensions still exist?    [Al-Husayni] Yes, we voiced apprehensions but we did not do  anything and we did not take the appropriate measures. Perhaps  we will lose Jerusalem. We must wage the battle for Jerusalem  in order to present a new Palestinian fait accompli in the face  of the Israeli fait accompli. The Israelis are trying to decide  the issue of Jerusalem in their favor.    [Tarabayh] Does this mean that you consider that the  self-rule agreement signed in Cairo ignored the issue of  Jerusalem or failed to provide a solution for Jerusalem?    [Al-Husayni] We wished that the agreement had been preceded  by an Israeli commitment to lifting the isolation of the city of  Jerusalem.    [Tarabayh] In your opinion, why did the Palestinian side not  insist on this issue?    [Al-Husayni] Let me say that at certain times the Israelis  warned that there were certain demands which, if openly  demanded, they could not meet, but if they were left to them,  they might meet them in a calm manner. Perhaps there was a sort  of understanding. I hope that it will happen in this way and  Israel will lift the isolation of Jerusalem gradually and  without great clamor in the media. However, up until now, we  have not seen anything in this direction.    [Tarabayh] It was circulated that the name of Faysal  al-Husayni was included in the list of members who would form  the Palestinian National Authority [PNA] in Gaza and the Strip  [as heard]. Will you participate in this authority?    [Al-Husayni] Yes. Despite all reservations, this agreement  was signed, and became an accomplished fact. We should deal  with this fact, not only in the sense of precisely working to  implement its articles literally, but also in the sense of  dealing with it in order to promote it and fill the gaps in the  text. We believe that through continued and collective work we  can circumvent these obstacles.    [Tarabayh] It was said that you insisted on having the  portfolio of Jerusalem affairs. Is this true?    [Al-Husayni] Yes. My condition was that I would accept any  post given to me provided it would not keep me away from  Jerusalem in terms of time or geography.    [Tarabayh] When will the membership of the PNA be completed?    [Al-Husayni] I believe that a few days after the 'Id holiday  [approximately 21-24 May], the picture would be clear.    [Tarabayh] Will this authority be regarded as a government?    [Al-Husayni] Yes, it is a government.    [Tarabayh] In other words, can we address you by: Mr.  Minister?    [Al-Husayni, laughing] This is premature.    [Tarabayh] How do you assess the current situation in the  occupied Arab territories, particularly in light of the renewed  clashes in Nabulus, Hebron, and other areas?    [Al-Husayni] The fact is that the Israelis began a partial  withdrawal from specific areas in Gaza and Jericho. The Israeli  Army, however, has not withdrawn from other areas, and the  settlements have not been removed. Consequently, occupation has  not ended. Thus, in the presence of occupation, such clashes  and events will continue until the Israelis behave otherwise and  until they actually show, as part of a very clear plan, that  they really wish to withdraw completely from the occupied  Palestinian territories and remove their settlements.    [Tarabayh] Are you reassured about the deployment of the  Palestinian police in the self-rule area and about the citizens'  welcome of this police force?    [Al-Husayni] The citizens' welcome has exceeded imagination,  and, perhaps, went beyond the conceivable limit. The backing,  love, support, and rallying around the Palestinian national  security forces may even impede the work of these forces.  However, this rejoicing may last for a few days, but,  ultimately, matters should be organized, and this love should  facilitate not only the policemen's needs, as is the case now,  but also their field work on the street.    [Tarabayh] How do you view the future coexistence between  the Palestinian factions opposed to the self-rule agreement and  the Palestinian factions represented in the national authority?    [Al-Husayni] I believe that if we follow a democratic  approach as well as the freedom of opinion and the rational  dealing with matters, and if we also refrain from using physical  or verbal violence, we can achieve much. We need this  opposition. An opposition is important in any country. There  is opposition in Israel, and it affects the government in  certain domains. Thus, why should we not have similar  opposition?    [Tarabayh] Are there contacts designed to coordinate  positions among these factions on the ground in the territories?    [Al-Husayni] Yes, there are contacts. However, these  contacts vary from one group to another.    [Tarabayh] Thank you, Faysal al-Husayni.    [Al-Husayni] You are welcome. Thank you.</p>

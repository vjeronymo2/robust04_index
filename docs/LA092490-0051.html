			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> PARKING STANDARDS SET FOR DEVELOPERS  </P> <P> Developers who want to build housing in Santa Ana must now provide more parking  space for residents and their visitors under requirements adopted by the City  Council.  </P> <P> "It's extremely disheartening to see the kind of compaction that has occurred  as a result of parking standards that weren't tough enough," Councilman Daniel  E. Griset said.  </P> <P> Developers now must provide four parking spaces and a guest space for every  three-bedroom dwelling.  </P> <P> Although the council was presented with a set of new parking standards for both  the city's residential and commercial properties, the council only acted on the  residential plan.  </P> <P> They delayed action on the commercial portion at the request of Councilman  Miguel A. Pulido Jr., who said he needed time to speak with oil company  representatives who are concerned about what the new rules will mean to gas  stations.  </P> <P> The commercial aspect of the proposed parking standards has been controversial  from the start. In August, Councilman John Acosta charged that the new  requirements unfairly targeted Mr. J's, a restaurant at 2101 E. Edinger Ave.  </P> <P> The business, which has been cited by the city for operating illegally as a  nightclub, would be the only existing business affected by the change. GREG  HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Ukranians abroad plan bond aid to homeland AMERICANS and Canadians of Ukrainian descent are hoping to emulate the success of State of Israel bonds by raising money for their homeland through a series of interest-bearing Ukraine bonds. Mr Dan Bilak, a Ukrainian-Canadian lawyer in Toronto, said the central bank in Kiev had approved three annual Ukraine bond issues totalling USDollars 100m (Pounds 52.3m). The first Dollars 30m issue, due in December, will carry a 7 per cent coupon. 'We want to have a coupon so that Ukraine is seen to be making interest payments,' Mr Bilak said. Mr Bilak and Mudge Rose, a New York law firm specialising in the securities market, are setting up a distribution network for the bonds. The plan is to sell the bonds in Canada through the half-dozen or so credit unions catering to the Ukrainian community, and in the US through a retail-oriented securities dealer. About 3m people of Ukrainian descent live in Canada and the US. Mr Bilak said the bonds were primarily designed as 'a confidence builder for the Ukrainians.' No decision has been made on how proceeds of the bond issue will be used. Mr Bilak said the community 'is wary of throwing money into a consolidated revenue fund. We'd like to have a special purpose'. Money raised will probably be held in bank accounts in north America and Europe to be drawn on as needed by the Ukrainian authorities.</p>

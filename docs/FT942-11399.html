			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (22): Germans stand a good chance Payment is a sore point everywhere in Europe but one country where small companies still have a good chance of collecting their money on time is Germany. Social pressures and strict legal procedures combine to ensure speedy bill settlement, inspiring envy among businessmen in the rest of Europe. Even so, according to a recent survey by accountancy group Grant Thornton, two thirds of small companies in Germany say that over the past year their customers have been slower in paying up. Nevertheless, most German businesses reported shorter delays than their counterparts across the rest of the EU. The average waiting time in early 1994 was 43 days - less than in any other member state except Denmark (36 days). Cultural factors help to explain this enviable situation. In Germany, names of firms that have received a third request for payment - effectively a warning of potential legal action - are published in local company registers, which are open to public scrutiny. 'It is,' says one credit analyst, 'a question of mentality. The German mentality is, for the most part, concerned with what the neighbours think. And if a name appears on the debtors register that is really embarrassing.' Cashflow also comes into play: because shorter payment delays are the norm, businesses receive income earlier than in many other countries and thus have funds available at an earlier stage to pay their own suppliers. Tight regulatory controls on bank credit help indirectly, limiting the borrowing commitments that banks allow firms to take. The structure of the economy - where medium sized companies play an important role - also means big conglomerates treat smaller companies with more consideration than in a market where supply is dominated by big enterprises. Court procedures are also a factor as it is relatively easy to enforce payment. If money is overdue, the seller can go to a court, which orders payment within two weeks. Unless the buyer raises a formal objection - which would then be adjudged in a normal court hearing - it is regarded as having accepted the legal obligation to pay. The system does not cut the number of genuine trade disputes, but it acts as a strong discouragement to those who routinely pay late as a means of cashflow management. Even so, there is clear evidence that payment delays in Germany are getting longer, reflecting economic strains imposed by relatively high interest rates, and national reunification. Recession is a novelty for many German managers and and many firms have found themselves short of the cash needed to maintain their normal payment timetables. By most countries' standards, this year's 43-day average payment period may seem good. But it is poor news for Germany, where the average was a mere 34 days in 1993.</p>

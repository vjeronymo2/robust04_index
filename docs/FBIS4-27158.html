			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean has  defected to South Korea aboard a vessel from a third country,  the Agency for National Security Planning (NSP) announced Monday.    The agency said that Ho Chol, 23, arrived in Inchon last  Saturday via a ship he boarded in North Korea and asked for  asylum, which was accepted from a humanitarian standpoint.    The NSP is currently questioning Ho on his reasons for  defecting.    A resident of Paekun-tong, Sinuiju, North Pyongan Province,  Ho graduated from the city's Paekun Middle School and Pyongbuk  Agricultural Mechanical High School. He then worked at an  transportation office in Sinuiju before entering the Pyongyang  light industry college, where he studied for six months until  leaving in March 1992.    Ho left behind his parents and four brothers and sisters in  North Korea, NSP sources said.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver stocks reported to be insensitive to higher prices WORLDWIDE silver stocks are huge but only 1 per cent or 146m troy ounces would be attracted into the market by prices up to Dollars 5 a troy ounce, according to a study* by the Charles River Associates consultancy group. At Dollars 10 a ounce, 541m ounces, or 2.8 per cent of total stocks, could potentially enter the market, it suggests. Even prices up to Dollars 20 an ounce would draw only 2.2bn ounces or 12 per cent out of stocks. It is also unlikely that stock would immediately make its way to market but instead would be drawn out over some years if higher silver prices prevailed, said Mr Firoze Katrak, Charles River vice president. This is believed to be the first assessment of worldwide silver stocks. It was produced for the Washington-based Silver Institute, an international association of silver miners, refiners, fabricators and manufacturers. Mr Katrak strongly defended the independence of the study. While the institute had set the terms of reference - the study was to estimate silver stocks by type and geographical region and to estimate the liquidity of those stocks in terms of the prices and conditions under which they would flow into the market - the institute had no right to change the report in any way. The Charles Rivers organisation's reputation was at stake and, said Mr Katrak: 'To use a vulgar analogy, a reputation is like virginity, you only lose it once and we are not in this business to lose our virginity.' The institute pointed out that fabrication demand for silver had exceeded total supply for the past two years and a 50m ounce deficit was forecast for 1992. 'This demonstrates that, if nothing else changes, stocks available at dollars five an ounce or less would be exhausted in about three years,' said Mr Dennis Wheeler, president. Analysts' immediate reaction to the long-awaited study was to suggest that it would have a relatively neutral impact on the silver market. Mr George Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers, said: 'It is bullish, but not especially bullish.' He said he wanted to examine the report to check the assumptions made about silver stocks not available to the market. 'I am always worried when I am told 84 per cent of stocks of anything are not available.' However, Mr Milling-Stanley said the study was 'a very useful addition to the literature of silver.' The study suggests that the principal reasons stocks would not be drawn into the market are: Those held by investors, at 524m ounces, are less than 40 per cent of total worldwide bullion stocks. Most bullion stocks are held largely as business stocks which companies need for their normal operations. These business stocks have generally been stable relative to consumption and not available to the market except at very high silver prices and even then on a transient basis; Most coins and medallions are held either for their numismatic or collectible value or as family holdings. Only a small portion is price responsive and available to the market; Most silverware and art forms of silver is not available under normal market conditions largely because small holdings are spread among a vast number of individuals who have a possessive or emotional attachment to them. Large holdings are owned by churches or other religious groups or are held for the high relative value of their art form, not for their silver content. * Stocks of Silver Around The World, Dollars 450, from the Silver Institute, Suite 240, 1112 Sixteenth Street NW, Washington DC 20036, US.</p>

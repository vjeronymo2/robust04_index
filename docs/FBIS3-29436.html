The book contains travel notes written by the members of a  delegation of the Aomori Prefecture Solidarity Committee of  Japan for supporting Korea's reunification who visited Korea  last year and photographs taken by them.    Reitaburo Sagawa, who led the delegation, in his travelogue  says the DPRK has registered phenomenal achievements under the  wise guidance of the great leader President Kim Il-song. The  policy of believing in the masses and relying upon them is the  driving force of socialist construction in the DPRK, he notes.    He states that the policy centred on the masses in Korea  proves the superiority of socialism.    "The demand of the International Atomic Energy Agency for a  'special inspection' of the military sites of the DPRK, is, no  doubt, based on the manoeuvres of the United States, Japan, etc.  The United States seeks in this to keep its forces in South  Korea for a long period and disarm the DPRK," he says.</p>

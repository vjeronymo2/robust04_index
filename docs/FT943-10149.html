			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Markets: Ancient pyramids found in Britain - Serious Money Collapsed Russian finance group MMM has been besieged by anguished depositors in Moscow this week. The group's success had been based on selling shares in itself to millions of people. The share price rocketed from Rbs1,600 in February to over Rbs100,000 and back down to Rbs950 before the shares were suspended last week. MMM did not have anything so prosaic as an underlying business: it was a share pusher, pure and simple. Caritas, the Transylvanian pyramid scheme, which made millions of Romanians rich before it collapsed late last year was a bit similar. It had promised investors a sevenfold return on their money in 100 days, and had no trouble meeting those promises - until the new money stopped flowing in. Some pundits argue that former eastern bloc countries are particularly vulnerable to double your money schemes, because they are only beginning to develop financial markets. As the South Sea bubble was to Britain in the 18th century, and the Ponzi scheme to Boston in the 1920s, so Caritas and MMM are to Romania and Russia. And of course the proletariat in developing countries lacks the financial nous to distinguish between sound investments and scams. The inference is that all the deeply sophisticated citizens of the Western world can tell a pyramid selling scheme from 1,000 metres. Well maybe. But only this week the department of trade and industry shut down a clutch of UK pyramid selling schemes operating under the apposite name of 'Alchemy'. Members' profits did not come from anything so humdrum as selling a product. One of Alchemy's irresistible offers was that it would turn Pounds 140 into Pounds 600 - though it could not tell you how. The DTI describes it as 'redistributing' members' subs. Very Ponzi. Alchemy was shut because it was 'not in the public interest' for it to continue to recruit members. As the judge said: 'Schemes of this nature are bound to fail because the pool of those willing to join is not inexhaustible'. Pyramid selling as such is not illegal in the UK. The DTI even has a handy consumer booklet telling would-be salesmen how to spot the dud ones. Some pyramid schemes, such as Amway, have been operating in Britain for more than 20 years. Am-Who? The first thing any of its distributors (salesmen) tell you about Amway is that it is not, repeat not, a pyramid selling scheme. It operates a multi-level marketing strategy, which is entirely different. Indeed, the head honchos at Amway are exceedingly cross with the DTI for tagging it with the 'pernicious label - legal pyramids'. One important difference between schemes such as Alchemy and those like Amway is that Amway has a product to sell. Much of the money flowing into the group is sales revenue, rather than subs from new members. Based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Amway has global sales of over Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn). It is big business in Japan. And it has floated its Asia-Pacific subsidiary in order to make the push into China. It sells mainly basic products, such as detergents. It has around 50,000 UK distributors. But a successful distributor's main money comes not from selling goods to the public but from recruiting new salesmen, and sharing their commission. Each salesman pays Pounds 70 to join, with an annual renewal fee of Pounds 15. New recruits are shown charts with scores of interdependent, ever-widening, circles. (The term pyramid is tempting.) They are told to make lists both of all the people they know and of all the people they might meet, and work out how to approach them. Some of the people high up in the - er pyramid - do make a lot of money. And successful distributors come from all over the world to seminars packed with wannabees. The average amount earned by each distributor is around Pounds 1,300. But the top 1 or 2 per cent of the sales force mop up more than half total earnings of perhaps Pounds 38m. The hierarchy of distributors and bonus systems is mind-blowing. In the US, Amway has sometimes seemed akin to a religious movement. A few years ago, for instance, rival soap giant Procter &amp; Gamble successfully sued Amway distributors for spreading rumours that P &amp; G and its products were instruments of Satan. In Britain the seminars are described as very tasteful - none of this coarse American hard-sell. And a local network can often be traced back to some local dignitary, which is a great consolation for anyone who feels squeamish about peddling soap to his friends - or his friends to Amway. All so much more sophisticated than Russian peasants buying shares in MMM. And quite different of course.                           *       *       * A real stockmarket rally - or just dead cat bounce? Robin Griffiths, technical guru at James Capel, is his normal passionately equivocal self. If the FT-SE 100 index can stay above 3,050 you can relax. (The dreaded head and shoulders pattern was a false omen.) But even if the rally survives, it will run out of steam at 3,200 and dither until the autumn. Then you can expect a surge continuing into the start of next year. Now you know.</p>

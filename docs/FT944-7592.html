			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Lottery jackpot set to reach Pounds 4m Camelot, the National Lottery operator, expects this week's jackpot to reach Pounds 4m - a figures which implies ticket sales of around 28m. Everyone involved in the National Lottery expects sales this week to be considerably down after the enormous publicity surrounding last week's launch and the novelty of the first draw. The consortium is now looking to see how the 'normal' pattern of sales settles down. Around 50 per cent of total sales can usually be expected on the Friday and Saturday - just before a draw. Ticket sales in the first week of the lottery far exceeded expectations and totalled 49m. The Pounds 5.9m jackpot was shared between seven winners and a total of 1.15m people won part of the Pounds 22m prize fund. On Tuesday a cheque for Pounds 12.6m was handed over to the National Lottery Distribution Fund for eventual use by the five good causes that will benefit  -the arts, charities, national heritage, a millennium fund and sport. Already the lottery is showing signs of changing shopping habits. Spar, the convenience store group which has about 400 outlets selling tickets, believes the extra business generated could add Pounds 100m to its Pounds 1.2bn annual turnover.</p>

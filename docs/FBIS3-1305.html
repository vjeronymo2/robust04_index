			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   `Selective Morality' of Foreign Community -- "There has been  a strange silence from church leaders over the execution of two  Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement, AWB] members  who, no matter that their organisation is neo-Fascist, were  still human beings who did not deserve to be killed in Mmabatho  in this horrendous fashion," declares the page-6 editorial in  Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 22 March. "We have heard  no word from the dozens of foreign peace observers and monitors  about the shocking events in Bophuthatswana or from their  governments for that matter." THE CITIZEN believes that if  kwaZulu Chief Minister Buthelezi "doesn't give the undertakings  sought and is Bophuthatswana-ed, the observers and monitors will  remain silent and the OAU and other foreign groupings will say  `Serves him right,' no matter how many people are killed. It  does suggest a kind of selective morality, but then we have  always accused the foreign community of being biased -- and this  election will not make them take a more objective view." THE  CITIZEN also urges the African National Congress (ANC) not to  "drive matters to extremes as happened in Bophuthatswana. The  Zulus who support Chief Buthelezi are of warrior stock and they  will not easily succumb -- as they have shown up till now -- to  imported violence."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Pressure on Buthelezi To Participate in Election -- As a  result of the ousting of Lucas Mangope in Bophuthatswana and the  resignation of Oupa Gqozo in Ciskei, "the pressure on Mangosuthu  Buthelezi is now bound to increase," notes a page-20 editorial  in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 24 March. "The Freedom  Alliance which may have bolstered his Ulundi laager is virtually  defunct. There are signs of disunity in the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party], and the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] is not  going to allow kwaZulu to become a no-go area in the election."  "The kwaZulu Chief Minister must know that his anti-election  platform and machinations around a Zulu kingdom are profoundly  misguided tactics. And his chances of emerging from the  transition phase with honour are rapidly diminishing."  Buthelezi is encouraged to "participate in the election before  events overtake him."    Prisoners' Vote `Blackmail' -- A second editorial on the  same  page notes that the TEC has reversed its decision to exclude  certain prisoners from voting in the forthcoming election and  says this "has set a disturbing precedent for the manner in  which this country will be governed." The impression left by  the TEC is that "if people cause sufficient mayhem, those in  authority will rather not make a stand. Apologists claim that  the country is in transition; that this is our first  all-inclusive election and so on, but they miss the point.  Giving in to blackmail merely evades problems; it never settles  them."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Homelands Falling at `Behest of the ANC' -- Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 24 March in a page-12 editorial finds  it is "not necessarily a bad thing" that the homelands should be  incorporated into South Africa before their scheduled demise.  "What is a cause for concern is that it seems to be happening  at the behest of the ANC and that the fall of each dictator  serves to remind others where political homage is due." "It is  hardly a coincidence that the targets are either ANC opponents  or not slavish devotees, and that the ANC faithful such as  Transkei military strongman Bantu Holomisa are not threatened by  riots, pension demands or other `spontaneous' outburts of public  concern. Worse, as the ultimate objective is Mangosuthu  Buthelezi's kwaZulu, the falling dominoes are more likely to  harm the cause of free political activity than help it. The  implied threat, if not to sweep away all opponents before the  election, is `do as we say, or else'. This may increase  obduracy in Ulundi rather than lead to negotiated or mediated  solutions."    Criticism of IMF-ANC Agreement Secrecy -- A second editorial  on the same page notes that the IMF and the ANC "may well have  agreed" that "state deficit spending targets should not be set  in concrete. But that felicitous development is unlikely to  impress cautious businessmen and foreign bankers demanding more  than just ordinary guarantees of fiscal and monetary rectitude  of South Africa in this time of abrupt political change.  Secrecy over the agreement between government, the ANC and the  IMF on the IMF's special $850m [million] drought relief loan to  this country added to the insecurities of financiers looking to  South Africa."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Momentum Toward Dissolution of kwaZulu -- Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 24 March in a page-14 editorial says the  "domino effect" started by the collapse of Lucas Mangope in  Bophuthatswana and Oupa Gqozo in Ciskei is likely to raise the  "political temperature" in kwaZulu/Natal as the elections draw  nearer. "This is both good and bad news. It is good because  the re-unification of South Africa is finally about to be  realised." The bad news is that "the leaders of kwaZulu are not  going to fall as easily as Bophuthatswana and now Ciskei. There  is likely to be a fight to the finish, unless the political  leaders put their country before political ambitions. It is not  too late for some type of deal to be made with kwaZulu. The  current events, which seem to have very little to do with the  so-called ANC-SACP document plotting the overthrow of that  territory, are gathering momentum towards the dissolution of  kwaZulu."  <H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>   De Klerk `Unable or Unwilling' To Act on Goldstone Report --  Referring to the interim report of Judge Richard Goldstone on  the involvement of senior police officers in gun running and  "stirring up violence" in the country, Cape Town CAPE TIMES in  English on 21 March in its page-10 editorial says this issue  "needs to be assessed by impartial international investigators  as a matter of urgency and placed before the courts." President  de Klerk "cannot duck his responsibility" on this matter. "He  has been obliged to agree to an international presence in the  investigating team and there is scant chance of yet another  high-level SAP [South African Police] or MI [Military  Intelligence] cover-up." "The sad truth is that President de  Klerk has been unable or unwilling -- and perhaps afraid -- to  do what has been manifestly necessary to clean up a deadly  malaise. His position is now unenviable. Of course his  Minister of Law and Order, Mr Hernus Kriel, must go. It is  plain that Mr Kriel does not enjoy De Klerk's confidence anyway,  as he was among the last to be told of the Goldstone  investigation."</p>

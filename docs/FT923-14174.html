			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: DTI and Alan Lewis settle Yorkshire wool dispute A DISPUTE which has rumbled around the Yorkshire Dales almost as relentlessly as Emmerdale Farm looks finally to have been settled following agreement between Mr Alan Lewis, the wool scouring supremo, and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. The DTI has toned down earlier demands that three wool scouring lines, which clean and de-grease wool, should be sold following Mr Lewis' 1990 purchase of Jarmain &amp; Son in Huddersfield. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruled last year that the takeover was anti-competitive since it gave companies controlled by Mr Lewis more than 50 per cent of the scouring market. Mr Heseltine has now relented and agreed one of the lines should be mothballed for a year while the other two should be sold or closed down in 18 months. The DTI said the measures would reduce Mr Lewis' capacity and allow other scourers into the market. Mr Lewis seemed reflective. 'A sensible compromise has been reached, although you're never totally happy with these things' he said. But there will be 'a number' of redundancies from the mothballed line, which is in Huddersfield, he said. Finding a buyer for the other two could also prove difficult, since they are not in operation and one is in poor condition.</p>

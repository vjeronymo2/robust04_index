			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Letter: Uruguay Round, third of a loaf is better than no bread Sir, Martin Wolf attacks yet once again the European Community as the evil empire of world trade ('The perils of tunnel vision', February 18). The Uruguay Round has suffered from a number of difficulties. Over the years the scope of these periodic set piece negotiations has steadily widened. And recession and elections do not now help to put together a final deal. But the biggest difficulty of all lay in the vastly over-ambitious American bid on agriculture - initially that all subsidies distorting trade should be abolished. This was a mistake for several reasons. The GATT has learnt to work on the basis that progress can best be achieved incrementally. No one demanded at the outset of the Kennedy Round (1960s) or the Tokyo Round (1970s) that industrial tariffs should be abolished. But a third was lopped off each time; tariffs are now a fraction of what they were when the GATT started in 1947. The proposal was a piece of American bluff. It was not a proposal by the US government. It was a proposal by the executive branch. This can suggest anything which comes into its head. What matters is what congress decides. Anyone who thinks that congress would be willing to cut substantially the massive federal subsidies to dairy farmers, to give only one example, is either wrong in the head or has never been to Wisconsin. The result of this grandstanding has been that for years no sensible discussion of agriculture was possible. Not only is it now dangerously late in the day to reach agreement, but the gap between the American proposals - even if now modified - and reality is still big enough for a humiliating climb back from a far out limb to be difficult to accomplish. That the Community needs to cut its agricultural subsidies is not in question. The question is how much how soon. A cut of about a third is all that is politically possible in 1992 - more will come later. Its partners need to recognise that this is the most that can be got now, just as their partners need to recognise that the Americans will do little or nothing to cut their barriers to agricultural imports and nothing to liberalise air and maritime transport, that the Japanese will do little to liberalise imports of rice, and the Australians little to cut their monstrously high industrial tariffs. But a respectable deal can still be picked up off the table. It is worth reflecting that a third of the loaf, with more to come, is better than no bread and a wolf eating your rear end.

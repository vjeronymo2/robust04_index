			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q &amp; A: REMOVING STAINS FROM CONCRETE  </P> <P> QUESTION: What's the best way to clean oil and grease from a concrete floor?  </P> <P> ANSWER: If oil has been freshly spilled onto a concrete surface, blot up as  much as you can, then cover the spot with one of the following: powdered  calcium carbonate, hydrated lime, talc or fuller's earth. Portland cement can  also be used. Let powder stand for 24 hours and then scrape it off.  </P> <P> If oil has penetrated into the concrete, scrape off whatever remains on the  surface with a putty knife and then cover the stain with a stiff poultice made  from one of the powdered substances above, combined with a solution of one part  trisodium phosphate and six parts water. Let the poultice stand 24 hours, then  scrape it off. Scrub the surface with clean water.  </P> <P> Grease is easier to remove than oil. If scraping and scrubbing doesn't work,  use a poultice made from benzene, naphtha or trichloroethane and an inert  powder. Allow it to stand 24 hours, then scrape the surface clean.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Right Fire Extinguisher Needed for Household  </P> <P> Q: I want to buy a fire extinguisher for my home but I don't know which type to  get. What do you recommend?  </P> <P> A: The wrong type of fire extinguisher could do more harm than good. It must  suit the type of fire that's burning.  </P> <P> There are three types of fires. Class A fires are those that involve ordinary  combustibles such as wood, paper, cloth, rubber. Home fires of this type often  start in the living room or bedroom.  </P> <P> Class B fires involve cooking oils, grease, gasoline, paint thinners and other  flammable liquids. These fires generally break out in kitchens and garages.  Class C fires are electrical fires and are usually the result of faulty wiring,  overloaded circuits or faulty electrical appliances.  </P> <P> On fire extinguishers, these categories are designated by the letters A, B and  C within a triangle, square and circle, respectively. Class B-, or BC-rated  extinguishers are not effective on Class A fires.  </P> <P> Also, water, which is effective in putting out a Class A fire will cause a  Class B fire to spread and can cause a severe shock in a Class C fire. Once a  fire in the home spreads, it can quickly include all three categories.  Therefore, your best choice is a fire extinguisher rated for all three classes  of fire.  </P> <P> Fire extinguishers are available at hardware stores and home centers. When you  buy one, check to if it's listed by Underwriters Laboratories Inc., and  displays the A, B and C designations. Also, note the numbers in front of the A  and B designations. These refer to the size of fire that the extinguisher can  generally handle.  </P> <P> The numbers are not absolute figures, but are relative terms for comparing  different units. For example, an extinguisher with a rating of 2A:40B:C will  handle a Class A fire twice as large, and a Class B fire four times as large,  as a unit rated 1A:10B:C.  </P> <P> Note that there are no size ratings for Class C fires. The C designation only  means that the chemical inside will not conduct electricity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plumbing Relief Valves Discharging  </P> <P> Q: I have two relief valves in my plumbing system that discharge 1 to 2 pints  of water a day. Both are set to discharge at 150 psi or 210 degrees F. One  valve is on my water heater. The other is attached to the hose bib at the rear  of the house. The water pressure entering my house is 160 psi, and a pressure  reducer by the water inlet reduces it to 58 psi. The thermostat on my water  heater is set for 140 degrees F. Do you have any suggestions?  </P> <P> A: There are three conditions that cause relief valves to discharge. The  pressure is too high, the temperature is too high or the valve is faulty.  </P> <P> Assuming the temperature and pressure measurements you indicated are correct, I  suspect the relief valve on your water heater is faulty and should be replaced.  </P> <P> Normally, a hose bib doesn't need a relief valve, although it should have a  vacuum breaker to prevent water from the hose from back-siphoning into the  house's water system in the event of a pressure drop. The fact there is a  relief valve indicates the piping to the hose bib probably bypasses the  reducing valve.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> TICKET 'EXTORTION' CASE MOVING ALONG  </P> <P> An unusual federal suit charging that Huntington Beach is guilty of "extortion"  because it operates a "speed trap" has had its first airing before a federal  judge in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Deputy City Atty.  </P> <P> Robert Sangster said he appeared before U.S. Judge Stephen Wilson on Monday and  argued for dismissal of the suit, saying the city does not operate a speed trap  or commit extortion.  </P> <P> At issue is a suit filed March 20 by Ernest J. Franceschi Jr., a Seal Beach  lawyer. Franceschi, who has been arrested on speeding charges three times in  the past 18 months in Huntington Beach, charged in the suit that the city is  operating a speed trap.  </P> <P> His suit seeks millions of dollars from the city as restitution to motorists,  including himself, who allegedly have been illegally trapped while driving on  Pacific Coast Highway in the city.  </P> <P> The suit charges that the alleged speed trap is a violation of the federal  anti-racketeering, or RICO, law because people stopped for speeding must post  bail or else face the "threat of arrest, imprisonment or other official action  . . . " That is tantamount to "extortion," Franceschi said.  </P> <P> Sangster, in his appearance before Wilson, argued that people arrested for  speeding are not always required to post bail. Wilson asked for more  information on bail procedures, saying he would then decide whether or not to  dismiss the case. BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Letter: Advantages of BBC licence fee must not be ignored Sir, David Sawers ignores some telling advantages for retaining the licence fee in his Personal View (January 6). He claims the license fee will be harder to sustain as a fair method of funding the BBC as new broadcasting services proliferate. Certainly, audiences will fragment and BBC audience share will therefore reduce, as John Birt, the director-general, has stated, by the end of the decade. However, best estimates suggest that rather more than 90 per cent of households will still be watching or listening to an average of 24 hours of BBC programmes each week and the BBC is determined that its 24 hours of enjoyment will include distinctive programmes not matched elsewhere for range and quality. At present the full range of BBC services for a week - television, radio, regional, local and Ceefax - costs less than one video hire, satellite and cable subscriptions or the single ITV channel. In fact, research shows the public may be willing to pay a higher licence fee than at present. Mr Sawers also misses an important advantage of the licence fee system - as a direct link between the BBC and its audiences, by-passing politicians. A retail prices index-linked licence fee minimises political pressure which can never be entirely removed from the electronic media, as the recent ITV franchises round has demonstrated.

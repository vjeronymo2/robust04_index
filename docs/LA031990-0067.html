			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CLEVER COUPLING OF ALBEE, BECKETT AT THE MARK TAPER  </P> <P> At first glance it may seem like a curious pairing: Edward Albee's "The  Sandbox" and Samuel Beckett's "Happy Days." But wait a minute.  </P> <P> Don't both plays deal with survival? The snappy old lady in "The Sandbox" may  be simply the butt of an impatient progenitor's bad joke, and "Happy Days' "  Winnie may be struggling against much more cataclysmic odds, but in the end  they're both after the same thing: warding off death. Death is death. What's  the difference if it comes as a result of global catastrophe or sly family  imperatives?  </P> <P> The difference is in how we, the audience, perceive the battle. At the Mark  Taper Forum where "Sandbox" and "Happy Days" constitute Round 2 of the "50/60  Vision" festival of "plays and playwrights that changed the theater" (there are  6 rounds, totaling 13 plays), it strikes this theatergoer as a cleverly ironic  coupling.  </P> <P> "Sandbox" is an inspired curtain-raiser for the longer (though not long) "Happy  Days." Albee's 15-minute wonder waltzes across the fourth wall on a whim and  makes confetti of sanctimonious attitudinizing. It is Albee at his best:  winking as he plays God and teases us with the summary dispatching of a tough  old lady.  </P> <P> Grandma (Mary Carver, re-creating a role -- are you ready for this? -- that she  played in the West Coast premiere 29 years ago) is gingerly "put away" by her  piously solicitous daughter, known to us only as Mommy (Angela Paton, quaint as  a middle-aged baby with a whim of steel), and her deadpan husband Daddy (Bill  Moor, milquetoast extraordinaire).  </P> <P> The human repository where they dump Grandma is a sandbox, watched over by an  athletic Angel of Death (John Robert Lafleur), while a fifth character, a  musician, performs at the unceremonious event.  </P> <P> Paton, a natural comic, can't resist milking a few of her laughs (or is this  director Michael Arabian's idea?), but otherwise the production sizzles with  preposterousness, made particularly amusing by Carver's sniffing irreverence.  </P> <P> This perfectly sets the stage for the sand heap that has poor Winnie by the  waist (later the throat) in Beckett's "Happy Days."  </P> <P> The landscape is apocalyptic this time. Nothing there. Especially no life. And  Winnie (Charlotte Rae) is already waist-deep in encroaching sand. When the  relentless bell wakes her at the start of day, she makes the best of it.  "Another heavenly day," she says, with feeling. Later: "Begin, Winnie . . .  Begin your day, Winnie," is more uncertain as she checks out the landmarks: her  black handbag, her parasol. And we're off on one of Beckett's most majestic,  most enticing, most mysterious and anguishing plays.  </P> <P> Winnie is not quite alone. There is Willie (Moor). Willie, husband or lover,  more dead than alive, but there, behind Winnie's sand heap and still breathing.  At least. Someone to talk to. Willie doesn't always talk back, but he's good  for a grunt now and then and, on especially happy days, good for a word or even  a complete sentence. Once even a song. Oh, happy, happy day.  </P> <P> Winnie is clinging to sanity by going through life's daily rituals, what's left  of them, under the broiling sun. Squeeze out a speck of toothpaste. Brush the  teeth. Read the "label" on the toothbrush.  </P> <P> It's something to do.  </P> <P> Check out the contents of the handbag. Bring out the revolver -- that ultimate  reassurance. All must be ordered, parceled out, spooned carefully hour by hour,  each thing in its time, on schedule, on cue, so no gap is left in which to die  of sheer terror. Or silence. Above all, one must fill the dead air with sound;  articulate words; gratitude, often; recite the enduring mercies like a rosary;  like a diamond necklace; the little miracles that fill and force the time.  </P> <P> At the beginning, when Winnie is cheerful and breezy, we laugh.  </P> <P> When Charlotte Rae as Winnie is cheerful and breezy, it is impossible not to  laugh. Is this woman for real? Is this meant to be funny? Oh, yes. Gradually we  listen and learn. Gradually we begin to really hear the play. Winnie, even when  performed by Rae -- especially when performed by Rae? -- is the defiance of the  species. Grace under pressure. Quiet resistance. Winnie against the dying  world.  </P> <P> Because of her association with TV sitcom, casting Rae in the role was risky,  but it was a brilliant stroke. Yes, there were isolated pockets of people at  Friday's performance who still thought that anything that came out of Rae's  mouth had to be just plain hilarious, but fewer and fewer as the play  progressed.  </P> <P> Her cracking voice, her almost foolish matronly squeal occasionally slicing the  air, the very ordinariness of this Winnie -- nobody grand at all here, nobody  messianic -- endow the performance a creeping and ultimately gripping stature.  </P> <P> Director Carey Perloff wisely lets Rae be Rae, and by the time this play is  over, you know this Winnie is as frail and conquerable as the rest of us. But  much, much braver. The hush that fell on the house in the second half, when all  that is left of Winnie is her head, above the sand -- her frightened eyes, her  endless concatenation of words, her unfathomable dignity -- was no accident.  </P> <P> Rae had earned it. Bravely.  </P> <P>  At the Music Center, 135 N. Grand Ave., March 30, April 6, 12, 18, 24, May 5  at 8 p.m.; April 22 at 7:30 p.m.; matinees April 29 and May, 12 at 2:30 p.m.  Ends May 12.

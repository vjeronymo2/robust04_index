			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: IBM's UK subsidiary tumbles Pounds 544m into losses of Pounds 124m INTERNATIONAL Business Machines' UK subsidiary, last year produced results which, although broadly anticipated, bear grim witness to the recession in the UK, the effects of fiercely increasing competition and the slowdown in the computer business worldwide. IBM United Kingdom Holdings made an operating profit of only Pounds 60m in the year to December 31 1991 compared with Pounds 420m in 1990. Restructuring costs of Pounds 184m, moreover, resulted in a group loss before tax of Pounds 124m. The UK company is following the pattern set by its parent which last month announced its first annual loss and first fall in revenues since the Second World War. IBM UK's overall revenues fell 8 per cent from Pounds 4.32bn to Pounds 3.98bn. Its UK sales were 14 per cent down, from Pounds 1.98bn to Pounds 1.7bn while revenues from the export of goods and services declined by 3 per cent from Pounds 2.35bn to Pounds 2.28bn. The restructuring costs of Pounds 184m were largely accounted for in the loss of more than 2,600 jobs during the year through a mixture of natural wastage and voluntary redundancy. IBM is not alone in producing poor results. Major computer manufacturers have been hit hard by a combination of factors which have depressed revenues and profits including recession, a shift to industry standard products which command lower profit margins and market saturation. Sir Anthony Cleaver, IBM UK chairman, said the company's performance in the fourth quarter of 1991 showed some improvement over the same period in 1990, indicating that business was beginning to pick up. Pay had been frozen for part of the year and expenses cut by 10 per cent. The results underscore the rapid change in fortunes at IBM. Long the leader in the UK's two horse computer race, IBM is losing market share. ICL, the straggler, is, since its takeover by Fujitsu of Japan, looking increasingly impressive. Mr John Gardner, ICL UK managing director said yesterday that the company sales grew during 1991 and it maintained profitability. IBM must be envying ICL's competence in standard systems, its early move into software and services and its lean operations. All of these are now part of IBM's plan for a return to profitability.</p>

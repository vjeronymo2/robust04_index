			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / South African miracle stops at barracks: The problems of uniting one-time military foes President Nelson Mandela is set to intervene in a dispute between the 27,000 predominantly black, former guerrillas from the liberation movements and the white training officers of the South African National Defence Force who have been charged with integrating them into the national army. In recent months, many of the former members of the armed wings of the African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress who had been admitted to military training camps have gone absent without leave, citing dissatisfaction with the integration process. In the past week nearly 7,000 of the new recruits have refused to go back into training until their grievances, including better food and a more rapid processing of recruits, are met. Mr Mandela held talks on Tuesday night with Mr Joe Modise, defence minister and former commander of the ANC's military wing, and General Georg Meiring, SANDF chief of staff to discuss the problem and is planning to broach the subject with army commanders today to try to resolve the crisis. The former South African Defence Force comprised highly trained, professional soldiers. By contrast, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) and Apla, the ANC and PAC's guerrilla armies, tended to be relatively unstructured operations, with few formal operating procedures or disciplinary codes. The most common complaints appear to be boredom, dislike of military discipline, and dissatisfaction with the cumbersome bureaucratic process which requires them to undertake a complex set of military, medical and educational tests to assess training and rank. So far the dispute appears to be confined to the lower ranks and the integration of officers is proceeding without serious difficulty. Lt-Gen Siphiwe Nyanda, former MK chief of staff, is now chief of staff of the SANDF and has been chairing regular meetings on the broader integration process. But when the general tried to mediate directly on the issue last week his car was attacked by protesters. Mr Modise's deputy, Mr Ronnie Kasrils, also a former MK commander, admitted that there were serious problems with the integration process but warned that a lack of discipline could not be tolerated. Mr Mandela defused a similar protest last month when he remonstrated with 500 protesters who had marched to the Union Buildings, the headquarters of the administration in Pretoria, to air their grievances directly to the president. The problem is likely to be exacerbated in coming months by the need to incorporate a further 10,000 soldiers from the former homeland defence forces, as well as several thousand members from a failed National Peace Keeping Force that was formed before April's first all-race election, into the SANDF. Because many of these troops have already been through some formal South African army training, they are largely exempted from the enrolment and assessment procedures, but will become part of the next stage of bridging programmes leading to full integration. Further difficulties are also likely to appear over jobs and salaries. The government has warned that its decision this year to raise the defence budget as well as earmarking an extra R2bn (Pounds 350m) for transitional costs incurred during the military integration process will not be repeated and that funds will instead be diverted into its reconstruction and development programme. As a result, Gen Meiring has already warned that from next year the army will begin rationalising its personnel. The SANDF's goal is to bring the total size of the army down to 91,000 by 1998 from about 130,000.</p>

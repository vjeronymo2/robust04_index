			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Pierre Kerlouegan: "ATR In Good Health"] </F>   [Text] Toulouse -- While most aircraft manufacturers are  still rather gloomy, the French-Italian Economic Interest  Grouping [GIE] ATR is looking remarkably satisfied. According  to Managing Director Henri-Paul Puel, 1993 "was a good year."    With 61 firm orders recorded last year, against 20 for the  previous year, ATR has performed even better than in 1990, which  had been the best year for orders since the group's creation in  1981. "Our group alone sold more aircraft last year than all our  competitors put together," stated Henri-Paul Puel. The total  including options comes to 138, against 135 in 1990. 27 orders  were cancelled, 21 of which by the Irish leasing company GPA.    The consortium welcomed 14 new purchasers last year,  bringing  its number of customers to 60. To date 42 percent of the  aircraft produced have been sold to Europe, 38 percent to North  America, but only 10 percent in Asia, 6 percent in Africa and  the Middle-East, and 4 percent in South America. Since its  creation, the group has taken 53 percent of the world regional  transport plane market in the 40 to 70-seat turboprop category.    Revenues for 1993, which depend solely on deliveries,  totaled  3.7 billion French francs [Fr], the same as in 1992. The net  result, however, should be "well up" with a gain in the order of  Fr50 million. For the third year running, ATR should see a  profit. According to Henri-Paul Puel, the balance sheet for 1994  should be similar to that for 1993, i.e. around 50 deliveries  with some 60 firm orders.  <H5>  ATR 82 </H5>   This year, or by the start of 1995 at the latest, the group  should announce the launch of a new aircraft which will be the  third in the ATR family. In the wake of the ATR 42 and the ATR  72 that can carry 48 and 66 passengers respectively, the  consortium proposes building the 80-seater ATR 82. Henri-Paul  Puel still considers the launch cost, today estimated at Fr3  billion, to be too high and he wants to lower it to Fr2.4  billion.    Although it does not appear to be essential, it is very  probable that a third industrial partner might enter the group  at this time to join forces with Aerospatiale and Aeritalia,  which have stood alone for 13 years. The question is who will  it be, and will they have to be European. According to  Henri-Paul Puel, "anything is possible," although he adds that  at the current time, as the saying goes, "everybody is talking  to everybody else."    Lastly, the group's limited foothold in Asia could soon be  improved if there is a successful conclusion to negotiations  being held with China. However, everyone knows that the Chinese  are in no hurry, and Henri-Paul Puel is still very cautious when  he mentions the conclusion of the current negotiations for the  sale of ATR 72's to three airlines and the creation of an  assembly line at Xian, with the possibility of a license being  granted.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Major calls meeting on policy plans MR JOHN MAJOR has called a new year meeting of Downing Street policymakers to relaunch the government's domestic agenda after the crisis management of the past few months. Members of the prime minister's policy unit have been asked to prepare a series of broad-ranging policy papers covering plans for every Whitehall department for a two-day 'seminar' at Chequers starting on January 10. The talks will be attended by Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, as well as by all Mr Major's principal advisers. They reflect an acknowledgement that the September sterling crisis and the government's subsequent preoccupation with Europe derailed its domestic agenda. The aim will be to develop a range of new policies to give substance to Mr Major's manifesto commitment to promote ownership, choice and opportunity. The seminar will follow the prime minister's signal this week that he wants the March Budget to focus on increased aid for industry, particularly to encourage investment and exports. Senior Whitehall officials acknowledge that there will be no scope in the Budget to reduce personal taxes and that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, may be forced to raise the tax burden by extending the scope of value added tax. That realisation has given added urgency to the search for popular but inexpensive policy initiatives to demonstrate that the government has not lost its way. Downing Street advisers have so far been focusing on plans for new education and training initiatives for young people aged 16 to 19; for greater co-operation with manufacturing industry; for another burst of deregulation; and for new Citizen's Charter initiatives. The seminar will range across every Whitehall department, reviewing short-term and medium-term plans for housing, social security, health and transport as well as proposals for a radical overhaul of the police and prison services. The Chequers meeting will be followed in subsequent weeks with a series of cabinet-level meetings to set out the programme. Mr Major has already announced plans for a cabinet seminar to pave the way for a new drive towards deregulation. Every senior minister has been asked also to produce new proposals to give momentum to the Citizen's Charter.</p>

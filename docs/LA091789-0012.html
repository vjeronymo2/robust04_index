			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> Schubert: Sonatas, D. 821, 384, &amp; 408; Rondo, D. 895.Joseph Swensen,  violin; Jeffrey Kahane, piano. RCA 7962-2-RC (compact disc). These performances  are emotionally direct and remarkably sweet, yet without any hint of cloying  sentimentality. The feeling is unaffected, the techniques sure and evenly  yoked, and the results easily hold the ear. JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

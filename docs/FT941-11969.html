			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kazakhstan aims to boost gold output by at least 200 per cent Kazakhstan, formerly part of the Soviet Union, expects a substantial increase in gold output over the next three or four years, according to Mr Abdrakhman Begalinov, president of Altynalmas, the organisation responsible for the republic's precious metals and precious stones production. Last year the republic produced about 14 tonnes of gold, he says, and the government wants this lifted to between 42 and 56 tonnes very quickly to build reserves to back the country's new currency. Mr Begalinov admits that Kazakhstan will have difficulty raising funds for such a fast expansion but he has high hopes of attracting more foreign investors. At present Altynalmas, which encompasses 21 enterprises employing 5,000 people. is discussing specific projects with more than 10 foreign mining companies, he says. Kazakhstan's need to build gold reserves means that, during its transition to a market economy, all gold must be sold to the government - which also insists on keeping majority control of each joint venture. However, Mr Begalinov says the central bank will pay in US dollars for the gold at the world market price. He says Kazakhstan faces a huge task of reconstruction and its mining industry, which has a long tradition and is well-developed, will play a very important role. The country is very rich in minerals - more than 60 different minerals are produced - and the republic accounted for more than half of all the lead, zinc and copper produced by the Soviet Union. Mr Begalinov is in London for discussions with Bakyrchik Gold, the London-quoted company involved in one of Kazakhstan's biggest gold projects. The UK company has 40 per cent of a joint venture with Altynalmas to develop the Bakyrchik mine, located in an arid region of the north-eastern steppes of Kazakhstan. The mine is on one of the world's biggest gold deposits, containing about 8m troy ounces, but the ore is very complex and difficult to process. Mr Bill Hussey, Bakyrchik's operations director, says that the partnership is on schedule to lift gold production to an annual rate of 36,000 troy ounces by June. It has yet to be decided when Bakyrchik will approach its 300 shareholders - many of them blue-chip institutions - for part of the Pounds 75m needed for a second phase to lift output to 250,000 ounces. Meanwhile, 'our relationship with the local people is getting stronger every day'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Galina Grigorenko: "There Were No Surprises"] </F>   [Text] The 20th Special Session of the Tatarstan  Supreme Soviet, which ended Wednesday, did not bring any  surprises.    This time our parliament demonstrated unprecedented  efficiency -- only three days were required to consider a broad  range of questions and to adopt a number of very important draft  laws.    This, of course, does not mean that all documents were  passed  with a "hurrah." As before, differences were observed in the  positions of the people's representatives, although this time  they spoke, in the main, not for parliamentary factions, but for  themselves personally.    The most eloquent discussion revolved around two draft laws:  The question in the first concerned giving the president of our  republic additional powers in connection with the socioeconomic  situation that has developed, and in the second -- extending the  law of the Tatarstan Republic "On Extraordinary Measures in the  Fight Against Crime" to 1 January 1995.    As could be expected, not all of the deputies perceived with  optimism the new formulation that was heard the day before in  the speech of the president of the Tatarstan Republic. But he,  in particular, noted that it was necessary for the government to  develop a state program of economic and social progress for the  Tatarstan Republic by October of this year. Some of the  representatives of the deputy corps were troubled by the fact  that the title of the future document makes no mention about the  crisis. But the "additional powers" for leaders of the republic  were at times classified as an encroachment on the age-old  rights of parliamentarians. However, Chairman of the Tatarstan  Republic Supreme Soviet Farid Mukhametshin gave the following  explanation: Legislative guarantees of reforms are needed  quickly, but the Supreme Soviet, not working on a professional  basis, is not yet in a condition to react quickly to changes in  the socioeconomic situation.    Debates regarding "the additional powers" were continued  almost for the entire next day of the 20th Special Session of  the Tatarstan Republic Supreme Soviet. Two drafts of the future  law were brought to the attention of the deputies: One was from  the Cabinet of Ministers, and the other -- from a group of  members of the Supreme Soviet. The first document stated that  "before the adoption of appropriate laws that regulate  budget-financial economic, social, and administrative spheres of  the Tatarstan Republic, grant the president of the Tatarstan  Republic the right to publish edicts on the enumerated  questions." And the second -- "grant the president of the  Tatarstan Republic the right to publish edicts that regulate the  legal relations in the social and economic spheres of the  Tatarstan Republic." But here the period of validity of the law  was established at up to 1 January 1995.    The views of the speakers on this question differed. Even  the members of the "Sovereignty of the People" faction did not  display their customary unanimity. Thus, Ildus Sultanov  declared that this document in any wording will violate the  principles of the constitutional system. But Zinnur Latypov, in  his turn, thinks that, under the conditions that have developed,  it is necessary to adopt edicts, but that it is desirable at the  same time to have the active participation of expert advice. In  the opinion of Yuriy Reshetov, the Treaty Between Russia and  Tatarstan changed the political situation in many ways, but it  is hardly likely that the Supreme Soviet in its present  composition is capable of publishing appropriate laws.    After weighing all of the pros and cons, the people's  deputies, nevertheless, adopted a variant with additions that  was proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.    In order to make changes to the law of the Tatarstan  Republic  "On Extraordinary Measures in the Fight Against Crime," whose  period of validity expires within three weeks, a roll call vote  was necessary. But the people's deputies first familiarized  themselves with an exhibit of special means purchased for hard  currency for militia employees (incidentally, the armored  personnel carriers in photos in yesterday's IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA  are part of this exhibit) and listened to information of Deputy  Prime Minister Sergey Kirilov and Minister of Internal Affairs  Iskander Galimov. It is now known from competent sources that  crime has been reduced since the beginning of this year in the  republic as a whole, the number of grave crimes has dropped, and  the number of violent attacks, robberies, and thefts of state  and personal property has fallen.... The cited figures,  perhaps, are the most substantial argument in favor of extending  the action of the law "On Extraordinary Measures in the Fight  Against Crime." What is more, new "varieties" of crimes have  appeared -- "showdowns" among groups, the apartment racket, and  contract murders.... The authors of 400 telegrams that were  addressed to the Supreme Soviet reminded the parliamentarians of  the need to extend the action of the law.    Of course, it is good when "our militia protects us,"  displaying a higher degree of vigilance than before. And,  nevertheless, it was impossible not to lend an ear to the  alternative speeches of a number of deputies who spoke  convincingly about the fact that the constitutional rights of  citizens have been violated more than once. For example, more  than 2,500 persons were detained for 30 days, but criminal  charges were brought against barely half of them. But the rest  "learned" from their bitter experience with what "extraordinary  measures" are fraught. In addition, the law enforcement organs  will have to be content with a small "catch": Until the law "On  Corruption" is passed, the big "fish" feels safe. Despite these  and other costs, the majority of the deputies came to the  conclusion that the law "On Extraordinary Measures in the Fight  Against Crime" is still necessary; and, therefore, the term of  its validity was extended to next year.    The three days of work by the parliamentarians did not  present any kinds of surprises. All stayed with their interests  and in their positions -- both the Supreme Soviet and the  government. Rumors about impending replacements in the  government were not confirmed. The matter was restricted only to  unimportant caustic deputy remarks aimed at the executive  branch. Prime Minister Mukhamat Sabirov responded to one of  these "attacks" with the repartee: "If we had a professional  parliament, it would not be necessary to undertake any kind of  extraordinary measures."</p>

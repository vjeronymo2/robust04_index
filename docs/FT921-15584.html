			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Bush In Japan: Mulford seeks support for growth strategy Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, was yesterday seeking support among European members of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries for the US-Japanese growth strategy unveiled in Tokyo by US President George Bush and the Japanese prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa. After visiting Paris on Tuesday and Bonn yesterday morning, Mr Mulford arrived in London for a meeting with Mr Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer. Mr Mulford will visit Rome tomorrow before returning to Germany at the weekend for the first in a series of meetings of senior officials to prepare this year's world economic summit in Munich in July. Speaking just after arriving in London, Mr Mulford said his tour of European capitals was to seek the four governments' views about the state of the world economy and to establish whether and how they would be prepared to take part in a global growth strategy. However, there was little sign yesterday that European countries would be inclined to change existing policies in response to US pressure. Mr Mulford underlined that he was consulting America's European G7 partners rather than asking them to join an already prepared plan. The statement issued yesterday in Tokyo was a joint US-Japanese initiative to strengthen the world's two biggest economies. He said his trip to Europe was 'beginning a process' which he hoped would lead to new commitments similar to those announced in Japan. The US Treasury tried last year to encourage European countries to adopt more expansionary economic policies but met resistance from treasuries and central banks that preferred to give priority to combating inflation. Mr Mulford said yesterday he believed there was now greater concern in Europe about the sustainability of global growth that was not apparent six or nine months ago. However, in Britain, France and Germany there was little to suggest that governments were prepared to rethink existing policies. Yesterday, at a meeting of the National Economic Development Council, Mr Lamont indicated that he opposed short-term fiscal action to stimulate the economy. He recently underlined his acceptance of high UK interest rates by repeatedly ruling out any devaluation of sterling in the European Monetary System. Similarly, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, French finance minister, yesterday rejected suggestions that France relax its anti-inflation policy or weaken its commitment to a hard franc. 'As long as I shall be finance minister, there will be neither devaluation of the franc nor a return to inflation,' he said in the Figaro newspaper. Officials in Bonn also reacted cautiously to the US-Japanese move. They disclosed that the US had given several weeks' notice of Mr Bush's economic initiative to the German government in a series of meetings. Ministers had been briefed, and welcomed 'any global actions' which might aid recovery. But possibly mindful of strong criticism of German policies by Washington last year, they said it was important that no single country should be singled out for special treatment.

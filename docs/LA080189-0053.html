			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 TONS OF FOOD FOR POOR LOST TO THEFTS  </P> <P> The Second Harvest Food Bank of the Greater South Bay disclosed Monday that its  Long Beach facility has been the target of four break-ins in the past 10 days,  resulting in the loss of two tons of food awaiting distribution to the needy.  </P> <P> In addition to food, burglars stole office typewriters, personal computers, a  printer, calculators, a tape recorder, FAX machine and various tools, such as a  circular saw and drilling equipment. Also taken were two hand trucks, a small  refrigerator and a microwave oven.  </P> <P> Executive Director John Knapp said officials were in the process of upgrading  security at the San Francisco Avenue building when the break-ins occurred.  Originally serving only Long Beach, the food bank now helps feed the hungry  from as far away as South Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The facility collects food surpluses from manufacturers and wholesalers and  then distributes these to 120 agencies serving the poor. Knapp said the  break-ins have left the food bank down but not out. He hopes donations will  enable him to replace the stolen equipment.  </P></p>

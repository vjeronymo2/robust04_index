			<p>BFN     [Text] The latest events are deplorable, Vice President  Arturo Herbruger has said when referring to the U.S.  Government's warning to its citizens urging them not to visit  our country.    He added: This is a deplorable situation, but,  unfortunately,  the events which occurred in San Cristobal, Alta Verapaz, are  too terrible. This has caused shock in the United States.    Nevertheless, he has stated his optimism that the suspension  will not last too long and that that country will lift it.    He has recognized this has had a negative effect on the  arrival of foreign exchange. He has reasserted his belief the  U.S. Government will soon suspend its recommendation.    He has said, however, this will be done provided Guatemala  restores peace, which he believes is already being done, so that  the United States will realize it involved isolated incidents.</p>

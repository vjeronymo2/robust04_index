Denying the participation of former Salvadoran guerrillas in  the Mexican guerrilla movement, Juan Ramon Medrano, one of the  former FMLN commanders, said "it is extremely speculative" to  make charges when there is no "concrete proof" about an alleged  Central American participation in the uprising.    A senior Mexican Government official said on 3 January that  Central American guerrillas might be involved in the armed  actions of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), which  publicly appeared on 1 January and has been involved in clashes  with the Mexican Army. According to the latest official  figures, the fighting has left 86 people dead.    "There is much speculation. Our only responsibility has been  to serve as an example," Medrano said, adding that the FMLN  waged a civil war in El Salvador for more than 10 years.    Medrano, current FMLN propaganda chief, said that the armed  actions that broke out in the last few days in southern Chiapas  State, on the border with Guatemala, "sound a warning bell that  the Mexican Government should hear." The leader of the former  guerrilla movement said that Mexican President Carlos Salinas,  who firmly supported the peace process in El Salvador, "has  shown that he has a modern outlook, so we trust he will hear the  demands" of the rebels.    Medrano added that the causes of the outbreak of violence in  Chiapas are deeply rooted in the economic and social problems of  the people of the region.</p>

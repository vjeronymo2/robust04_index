			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> BURBANK CASHES IN ON A TIP, 12-7  </P> <P> In a game that will not be remembered for its style, it was fitting that the  winning touchdown was scored on a deflected pass.  </P> <P> Fortunately for Burbank High, senior Patrick Blazon was able to pull in the  pass in question -- a 17-yarder from Jeremy Sparks -- with 5:11 left to provide  the Bulldogs with a 12-7 win over Hoover.  </P> <P> Thursday's game at Burroughs was the season opener for both schools.  </P> <P> "It sure wasn't pretty," Burbank Coach Randy Stage said. "But you know what? I  kinda like having more points on the board at the end of the game."  </P> <P> That nearly wasn't the case. Burbank fumbled three times in the second half,  one of which led to Hoover's only touchdown.  </P> <P> After Alvaro Cubillas recovered a Burbank fumble at the Bulldog 11-yard line,  tailback Curtis Kang threw a four-yard option pass to Andre Clarizio for a  touchdown with four seconds left in the third quarter. David Bronner's  point-after conversion gave Hoover a 7-6 lead.  </P> <P> Burbank had scored the first touchdown on a two-yard Nelson Randin run in the  second quarter.  </P> <P> There were bright spots for Burbank, including Sparks. The senior completed 11  of 17 passes for 141 yards and one touchdown.  </P> <P> Senior Bryan Miclette had six receptions for 85 yards. BRIAN MURPHY  </P></p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Court rules on AMD dispute with Intel The US Supreme Court has denied an appeal by Advanced Micro Devices, the Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturer, clearing the way for Intel to proceed with a microprocessor copyright infringement suit against AMD. The two Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturers said, however, that the Supreme Court decision would have little practical effect, because this aspect of their long-running intellectual property rights disputes has been overtaken by other court decisions. Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductors and dominates the market for microprocessor chips used in personal computers. AMD claims to have rights to Intel intellectual property through agreements between the companies and as a result of decisions made by an arbitrator and the courts. Intel's federal court appeal relates to a copyright infringement case that it filed against AMD in 1991. While that appeal may now go forward, most aspects of the case have already been decided in AMD's favour. 'For all practical purposes, the Supreme Court decision is of no meaning,' said AMD. The decision 'doesn't change anything, but reaffirms our rights to move forward on outstanding issues,' said Intel. The companies are meanwhile awaiting decisions in another case, before a federal court in San Jose, which could decide the time limits on AMD's rights to use Intel intellectual property.</p>

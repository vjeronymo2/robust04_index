			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE WORLD UP CLOSE A CYCLIST'S ADVENTURES ON FIVE  CONTINENTS BY KAMEEL B. NASR (MILLS &amp; SANDERSON: $9.95)  </P> <P> In recent years, the bicycle travelogue has developed into a genre of its own,  a genre to which Kameel Nasr contributes remarkably little.  </P> <P> The wonders of Africa, Asia, North and South America fail to elicit anything  more from him than banalities. In his formula adventures, he rides into the  countryside to meet the real people, which suggests that cities are inhabited  by automatons and doppelgangers. Nasr offers a few complaints about the roads  and weather but loves every country and its people, and they always treat him  as an honored guest rather than a stranger. It's probably more fun to ride some  of these trails than to read about them in "World Up Close."  </P></p>

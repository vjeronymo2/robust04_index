			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunayskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 5 Apr -- A group of Ukrainian military  leaders, including Minister of Defense Vitaliy Radetskyy, will  arrive in the Crimea today. The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned  this from informed sources at the headquarters of the Black Sea  Fleet. The purpose of the Ukrainian generals' coming to the  peninsula is not known either to the administration of the  Crimea or to the command of the Black Sea Fleet.    This same source reports that the group also includes Chief  of the Intelligence Administration of the Ukrainian Armed Forces  Major-General Vehunnikov, commander of the Air Force,  Major-General Antonets, chief of staff of the National Guard  Mokhov, and Chief of the Second Counterintelligence  Administration Major-General Kravchenko. All of the said  generals are coming to the peninsula in the course of today  separately, by different means of transport, without preliminary  agreement with the local authorities, and this has provoked a  protest from the leadership of the peninsula.    President of the Crimea Yuriy Meshkov is to return to  Simferopol after a business visit to Cyprus at 1800 today.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Jian (2621 0256) of the International Trade </F> Research Institute, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation: "Problems in Building China's Infrastructure, Using  Foreign Funds"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]  <H5>  I. Plans to develop China's infrastructure and basic </H5> industries    Infrastructure chiefly refers to transportation and  telecommunications facilities. Basic industries generally refers  to the energy and vital raw materials industries. In the past  few years, the Chinese Government has given much attention to  adjusting the industrial mix and speeding up construction of the  infrastructure and basic industries. With the exception of the  steel and nonferrous metals industries, where the pace has  lagged behind a bit, the growth rate for infrastructure and  investment in renewal of the transportation, posts and  telecommunications, and energy industries has been as high as or  higher than the growth rate of fixed capital investment  throughout society for the same period. A group of large scale  infrastructure and basic industry key projects has been  established and put into production. The posts and  telecommunications industry has developed the most rapidly. Over  the past five years the growth rate for infrastructure  construction and investment in technological transformation has  averaged over 40 percent annually, and reached as high as 83  percent in 1992.    Despite the great achievements attained in building the  infrastructure and basic industries, it is far from what is  required for national economic development. The elasticity  coefficients (which is their growth rate compared to the growth  rate of the domestic economy) of railway transportation, energy  resources, and steel production have been quite low in recent  years, and moreover are in a declining trend.    Since 1992, with accelerated economic growth, the  restrictive  "bottle necks" of the infrastructure and basic industries have  become increasingly prominent. At present, the transportation  capabilities of principal railway lines are saturated, their  goods transport volume capable of fulfilling only 60-70 percent  of demand. Among these, such as the Beijing-Guangzhou and  Beijing-Shanghai lines can fulfill only about 40 percent. Most  of the highways are of a low level and in poor condition, with  frequent traffic jams. In the major coastal ports, the ratio of  ships in operation to ships awaiting operation is more than  1:1.2. Energy tends to be in short supply, and in some areas,  limits on electrical supplies and the occurrence of power  outages are increasing. There is a strong demand for major  production materials such as steel, with declining reserves and  sharp price rises. Inadequate transport capacity and shortages  of energy sources and raw materials has in some areas directly  affected agricultural and industrial production and foreign  trade and exports. It has also affected in differing degrees the  confidence of potential foreign investors.    In order to improve the investment environment, and  guarantee  the lasting, stable, and coordinated development of the national  economy, the state's long term focus is accelerating building of  the infrastructure in areas such as transportation, energy, and  basic industries. According to documents provided by state  industrial planning departments, during the period of the Eighth  Five-year Plan, the developmental plans for transportation,  telecommunications, energy, and important raw materials  industries and projects arranged by the central government are,  in outline:    Railways: Build up the important trunk lines: the  Beijing to Jiujiang line, the Baozhong line, the  Lanzhou-Xinjiang multiple track line, the Houyue line, the  Zhejiang to Jiangxi multiple track line, and the Nanning to  Baise segment of the Nanning to Kunming line. Complete the  project of expanding the capacity of the Wuchang to Guangzhou  segment of the Beijing to Guangzhou line and the Daqing line  supporting project. Speed up the second coal transportation  channel from Shensuo to Huangye port, aiming for overall  completion during the Ninth Five-year Plan. Plans call for  construction of 6,600 km of new lines, 4,100 km of multiple  lines, and 5,600 km of electrification replacement.    Ports, highways: Accelerate building the first  phase of the Huangye port coal wharf project, the fourth phase  of the Qinhuangdao port coal wharf project, the eastern China  and southern China coal transfer bases, and a group of container  wharfs in Dalian, Tianjin, Beilun and Yantian. Accelerate  construction of the Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Hangzhou,  Jinan-Qingdao, Chengdu-Chongqing and Beijing-Shenzhen freeways  and roads especially motor vehicles. The State plans to  construct 5,400 km of new freeways and first and second class  roads especially for motor vehicles, and build 90,000 km of new  roads.    Telecommunications: Construct inter-provincial and  regional optical fiber communications cables between  Xian-Chengdu, Beijing-Shenyang-Haerbin, and  Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou. Plans are to increase the nation's  telephone switchboard capacity to 18 million.    Coal: Stress construction of large scale coal  mines in Shenfu, Zhungeer, Yimin, Yunji, Lianhuai, etc. Make a  major effort to remake old mines in eastern China, and continue  to encourage development of local mines. Plans call for raw coal  output to increase to 1.25 billion tons in 1995.    Electric power: Stress construction of such power  plants as Shanxi Baoji, Henan Qinbei and Sanxi Yangcheng, etc.,  speed up progress of building hydropower station in Ertan,  Yantan, Tianshenqiao, Shuikou, Manwan, Lijiaxia and Wuqiangxi,  etc. Complete preparations for the primary stages of the Three  Gorges Project. Meanwhile, vigorously develop nuclear power.  The state plans to add 64 million KW of power generators  throughout China. Electric energy production by 1995 will be  increased to 920 billion KW hour.    Petroleum: Continue prospecting and exploiting oil  fields in eastern China, and stabilize current output. Try to  increase prospecting for oil reserves in western China, and  vigorously exploit natural gas and oil and gas fields offshore.  Study, develop, and apply energy saving technology. It is  planned that in 1995, crude oil output will reach about 150  million tons.    Steel: Stress improving quality of products, and  increasing products which are in shortage. Try to increase  substantially the proportion of continuous casting and sheet and  tube materials. Plans call for an output of steel to increase to  88 million tons in 1995.    The fixed asset investment scale for the whole of society  during the Eighth Five-year Plan is 3,400 billion yuan  (calculated according to the fixed price for 1990, the same  below). Of this, the plan for state-owned units calls for 1,870  billion yuan in infrastructure construction and renewal  investment. According to the state plan and current  developmental trends, investment in infrastructure, basic  industries and renewal will be about 900 to 1000 billion yuan  during the period of the Eighth Five-Year Plan. It has already  achieved 335 billion yuan in 1991 and 1992, so the investment in  1993 and 1994 would be about 200 billion yuan per year.  <H5>  II. Huge potential for foreign investment in infrastructure </H5>   Investment in construction of the infrastructure and basic  industries is on a large scale, and has long term returns. It  used to be state investment for the most part, but since the  implementation of opening and reform, localities, departments,  and enterprises are increasingly gaining the right to control  their own economic activities, while the market system's role in  economic growth and resource allocation is becoming increasingly  obvious. In recent years, society's fixed asset investment has  tended to be multi-channel, and so has investment in  infrastructure and basic industries. At present, the major  investment sources are:    1. State budgeted domestic capital and capital for  construction of special projects. By this is meant the state  budget, local finances, allocations from departments in charge  and from the national specialized investment corporations or  basic construction loans extended to construction units by  entrusted banks, funds allocated to enterprise units for  replacement, and special construction funds collected by  railway, highway, and energy departments at a certain rate. In  1990, state budgeted investment dropped to 40 percent in railway  and coal departments, while it was about 10 percent in  transport, post and telecommunications, petroleum, and electric  power departments, and in steel industry departments, it dropped  below 7 percent.    2. Domestic loans. These are loans allocated from banks' own  capital or deposits taken in from enterprises and institutes,  loans arranged as capital for localities' special projects, key  enterprise bonds and construction bonds, etc., that a bank  issues when acting as the agent of the State specialized  investment corporation. In 1990, bank loan investment in the  posts and telecommunications, civil aviation, and steel sectors  constituted only 40 to 50 percent of their infrastructure and  renewal investment, while in other sectors, bank loans for the  infrastructure was about 20 percent.    3. Self-collected capital. With the relaxing of prices, some  infrastructure sectors such as highways, railways, posts and  telecommunications, civil aviation, electricity, steel, etc.,  have improved their economic efficiency and strengthened  self-renewal and self-development abilities. Their  self-collected capital has been increasingly rising. In such  sectors as railways and electric power, self-collected capital  has constituted more than 30 percent of the investment in  infrastructure and renewal.    4. Exploitation of foreign capital. This includes foreign  loans, invested capital from foreign investment enterprises,  donations from overseas, etc. At the outset of reform and  opening, foreign capital imported for construction of  infrastructure and basic industries consisted chiefly of loans  from foreign governments and international financial  organizations. Direct foreign investment was very cautious,  limited only to cooperative prospecting and exploitation of  offshore oil and gas fields. In the middle and late eighties,  the government began to encourage foreign investments in some  energy projects and in freeway, port and wharf construction.  Some coastline provinces and cities made a series of agreements  on a group of joint venture projects for constructing electric  power mill, highways and railways. Guangdong's Pingnan Railway  was the first joint venture joint stock railway enterprise.  Shenzhen's airport and port were both built with foreign  capital. The key national mainland-Hong Kong joint venture  construction project, the Guangdong Dayawan Power Station has  gone into connection and started production. By the end of 1992,  there were 28 electrical power stations with foreign investment,  with a total capacity of 7.87 million KW. Six coastline oil  fields have gone into production, with a yearly output of more  than 3 million tons. Hainan is also leasing 30 square km of land  in Yanggugao to the Japanese Xiongguzu [phonetic] (Hong Kong)  Company, Ltd., for 70 years, for developments which will  encompass wharf, road, and power station construction through  the province.    Statistics from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Co-operation show that since 1989, all figures and amount of  money involved in agreements on use of foreign capital increases  in differing degrees in the petroleum, coal, and transportation  sectors.    The rapid rise in the use of foreign capital in the  infrastructure and basic industry demonstrates that foreign  businesspersons have complete confidence in China's economic  development and the future of value addition in the  infrastructure sector. However, infrastructure and basic  industry do not constitute a large share of total amount of  foreign capital utilized to date. The major existing problems on  China's part are: insufficient experience; we still have not  followed up with some relevant laws, regulations, and supporting  management measures; and foreign business persons still have  misgivings about committing long term investment on the Chinese  mainland.    In recent years, the major developed nations in the West  have  suffered from a continuously slumping economy, their industrial  mix is facing readjustment, and must find a market for their  massive capital and investment-type goods. China's  infrastructure construction is no doubt a potential market, so  has a definite attraction for foreign capital. We should  maintain stability in our economy, politics, and society,  enlarge our measures for opening to the outside, readjust our  relevant policies, attract more investment, and speed up  development of the infrastructure.  <H5>  III. Relevant encouraging policies and measures </H5>   The Chinese Government will in the future adopt the  following  policies and measures to speed up construction of the  infrastructure:    First, while controlling the scale of fixed asset investment  in society, increase the rate of investment in infrastructure  construction. In the last three years of the Eighth Five-year  Plan, the state will strictly control general projects of the  processing industries and will possibly increase investment in  key construction projects in transportation, telecommunications,  and energy. In the central government's investment in 1993, 70.6  percent went into construction in transportation,  telecommunications, energy and the raw materials industry, an  increase of 5.9 percent over the year before.    Second, speed up price reforms in energy and transportation,  to strengthen the ability of the infrastructure and basic  industry sectors to raise their own funds. The State will  gradually raise the level of shipping fees collected by railways  and ports, bringing them near or up to the level of cost plus  average profits. As soon as possible, merge the plan prices and  market prices in the crude oil and electric power sectors.  Change the state's unified price fixed in basic industry sectors  to differing levels of price-setting control, giving localities  a certain amount of leeway in their price setting rights. Let  localities set prices for transport and shipping facilities  which they operate.    Third, using the market operations system, encourage  localities, departments, and enterprises to invest in  infrastructure construction. With a uniform national plan and  uniform technical standards for highway construction, localities  will be permitted to build their individual sections. In joint  venture infrastructure projects, the central government,  localities, and enterprises will operate on the principle of  "sharing profits and risk" and "the investors will take the  profits."    Fourth, appropriately enhance the level of collections in  special construction funds or attached fees in railways,  highways, shipping, and civil aviation, etc., and add special  construction funds for coal, electricity, and oil, etc., as well  as implementing intensive management of construction funds  collected, charging by use, with rolling development.    Fifth, expand the scale of medium and long term bank loans  for construction in transportation and energy. Authorize fiscal  rights for some large-scale transportation enterprises and  enterprise groups. As appropriate, issue more construction  bonds. With the establishment of a system of social insurance,  bank deposits of all types will grow steadily. The state should  attempt to apply these sums of capital to profitable key  construction projects.    Sixth, enthusiastically absorb and exploit foreign capital.  In April 1991, the National Congress passed the "Tax Laws for  Profits of Foreign Capital Enterprises and Foreign Enterprises."  In June 1991 the State Council issued detailed implementation  regulations and other state laws and legal regulations. These  stipulate that foreign commercial interests can obtain favorable  treatment if they invest in the infrastructure and basic  industries, as follows:    Foreign commercial investment in urban energy,  transportation, and port construction in older cities in coastal  economic development zones, special economic zones, or economic  and technological development zones. Foreign commercial  investors in the airport, port, railway, highway, and electrical  power stations in the Shanghai Pudong New District will be  charged at a 15 percent tax rate on their enterprises' profits.    Joint venture enterprises engaged in port and wharf  construction, and foreign enterprises investing in such  infrastructure facilities as airports, ports, wharves, railways,  highways, electric stations, coal mines, and hydropower, etc.,  in the Hainan Special Zone, and which have been in operation for  more than 15 years', can receive tax relief after making  application and with the approval by local tax organs. This will  be relief from the first five years' taxes starting with the  first year in which the enterprise earns a profit; then, the  enterprises will pay only one-half of the taxes on their profits  for the sixth to tenth years.    Give relief to customs duty and united industrial and  commercial tax for importing machines, equipments and raw  materials used for developing energy, railway, highway, port,  etc. of fundamental construction by means of using foreign  capital.    The fourth session of inviting tenders for oil drilling off  the East China coast lasted one year, and was very successful.  The areas contracted for and agreed to occupy 55 percent of the  total area for which tenders were invited. The initial risk  investment in the prospecting stage for foreign partners is  estimated at more than US$240 million. The biggest joint venture  project in the Shenzhen SEZ is the Hong Kong Heji Huangpu Ltd.  Corporation's construction and operation of the Yantian  International container wharf. The contract was signed during a  ceremony on 5 October 1992 in Beijing. This project has a term  of cooperation of 50 years, with registered capital of HK$1.2  billion. The estimated total investment on the project will be  over RMB5 billion yuan.    Based on what is needed to speed up development of the  national economy and perfect the industrial mix, during the  Eighth and Ninth Five-year Plans, China will continue to expand  the scale of its importation and use of foreign capital in  construction of the infrastructure and basic industries. Major  measures currently pending or in operation are:    First, foreign business will be allowed to contract for  construction of railways, highways, ports, airport lounges,  electric power stations, etc. In keeping with international  practice, after a project is completed, it will be managed and  operated by foreign businesses for about 15 years, while the  Chinese side collects taxes from it. When the tern of a  contract has expired, the entire project will revert to the  Chinese side.    Second, in order to encourage foreign business investment in  building the infrastructure, other investment areas related to  projects will be opened up for foreign business investors. For  example, those who invest in highway and railway construction  may operate highway and railway lines, and engage in retailing,  real estate, and advertising along railways or highways. Foreign  business persons who invest in port construction will be  permitted to operate as transport and shipping agents, commodity  agents, etc.    Third, 12 open regions, including the Talimu basin, will  invite prospecting and exploitation by foreign oil companies. It  is reported that there is as much as 8.2 billion tons in oil  reserves in these 12 regions, and as much as 250 million cubic  meters in natural gas reserves. So far, 68 enterprises from 17  countries, including 24 U.S. enterprises, have shown interest in  investing in exploitation of the Talimu basin oil field.    Fourth, the steel industry plans to implement a joint stock  system in some key enterprises through the issuance of B-type  stocks overseas, or improve the level of incentives to attract  even more foreign capital in the form of foreign governmental  loans, export loans, etc., to launch enterprise technology  renewal. Some joint venture projects that fall in the category  of important raw materials, and that import advanced technology  will be permitted to market their products chiefly in the  domestic market.    Accelerated construction of the infrastructure and basic  industries will definitely result in greatly increased imports  of related technology, equipment, and materials. China's market  will open with further reform of the foreign trade and commerce  system, as we try to get closer to the international regulations  for managing import and export trade and importing foreign  capital. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation  has made public a list of 210 large and important technical  projects that China will import between 1993 and 2000, with a  gross value of close to US$30 billion. Of these, 102 projects  are in energy, transportation, civil aviation, or posts and  telecommunications. The forecast is that, in the future,  overseas investors will have more cooperation and trade  opportunities in these areas.</p>

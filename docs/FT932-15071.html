			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / TSB to withdraw from estate agents through N&amp;P deal THE BANKING group TSB is to withdraw from the estate agency business. The controlled withdrawal will be made by the establishment of a joint venture company with National &amp; Provincial building society that will manage TSB's estate agency business and provide a range of financial services. Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS estimates that the deal will cost National &amp; Provincial between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m, although neither the society nor TSB confirmed the figures. TSB's chain of 133 residential estate agents has been making losses and in January the group said it would concentrate on its core businesses of banking and insurance. The group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 43m in 1992 compared with a loss of Pounds 47m in 1991. However, there has been little recovery in its property services division which lost Pounds 6m in 1992 and Pounds 7m in 1991. TSB is expected initially to retain a 50 per cent share of the estate agency business, viewing the joint venture as 'an interim step that will lead eventually to our withdrawal from estate agency business, whilst allowing us to take advantage of the improving market'. One analyst estimated that TSB may have invested up to Pounds 50m in its estate agency chain. National &amp; Provincial, the UK's eighth largest society, said that it would be inviting equity participation in the local estate agency groups and is expected to buy up the business at the end of the joint venture period. N&amp;P will be able to use the estate agencies as an outlet for the sale of its financial services products. The society's branch network is limited and it is keen to expand its presence in the community. 'The deal suits the complementarity of each side's strategy,' said Mr Wriglesworth. A large number of building societies acquired estate agency chains in the 1980s as a defensive measure. They believed that their share of mortgage lending was threatened by new lenders. Abbey National last month disclosed that it had lost a total of Pounds 226m on its Cornerstone residential estate agency. Woolwich building society disclosed in February that its Woolwich Property Services estate agency business, which has 257 offices and is the UK's seventh largest corporate estate agent, incurred a trading loss of Pounds 11m during 1992.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Investors sell on outcome of Maastricht vote BOURSES returned to basics, writes Our Markets Staff. Having risen last week on the prospect of a French Yes vote on the Maastricht treaty, they sold yesterday on the outcome and the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index fell by 1.75 per cent. The French franc came under pressure again, shaking the Paris bourse as French and Spanish ministers pushed for another cut in German interest rates and the Bundesbank continued to stall Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at BZW, saw a difficult choice in prospect for the Franco-German alliance at the hard core of the ERM: 'If the future of the Franc against the D-Mark becomes a matter of exploiting tensions within the ERM rather than a rational valuation of one currency against another,' he said, 'it could become a choice between theFranc parity, and a DM easing.' In the meantime, he said, dollar stocks and interest rate-sensitive situations continued to appeal, but prospects were looking difficult for cyclicals yet again. PARIS retreated 3 per cent on the view that the wafer-thin majority in the Maastricht vote was the worst possible outcome. Some analysts commented that with the franc coming under intense pressure during the day there may well have to be an increase in interest rates as the government acts to support the currency. The CAC-40 index lost 56.88 to 1,826.06 in turnover of FFr2.4bn. Activity was further depressed by disappointing corporate results. Canal Plus was one of the day's biggest losers, shedding 16.4 per cent following a profits warning. The shares were briefly suspended after opening limit down, and closed down FFr214 at FFr1090.00. Havas, which holds a 25 per cent stake in the subscription television group, declined FFr37.80 or 7.6 per cent to FFr454.80. A profits warning from Club Mediterranee left the shares down FFr30.80, or 7.3 per cent at FFr392.20. Financials weakened with Societe Generale down FFr21 to FFr521 and Paribas off FFr12.50 at FFr346.00. FRANKFURT lost less than 1 per cent during the session, the DAX index closing 14.47 lower at 1,573.86, but it followed late closing markets further down in the afternoon. Volume more than halved, from DM9.7bn to DM4.6bn. Banks, obviously interest rate-sensitive, held their ground but carmakers, engineers and steels all fell as dealers said that the D-Mark's rise in Europe had become a severe threat to corporate earnings. BMW, recently favoured against Volkswagen, dropped DM14.50 to DM537; the tyremaker, Continental, whose margins may be under threat as the carmakers squeeze their suppliers, ended DM8 lower at DM241. In engineering, Linde dropped DM19 to DM755 and in steels, which face a new 7.5 per cent annual wage demand from IG Metall, Hoesch dropped DM13.50 to DM200. MILAN rose by nearly 3 per cent in an early rally, closed the official session with the Comit index 4.77, or 1.3 per cent higher at 380.28, and ended in the London post-bourse with the Italian component of the Eurotrack 100 down by 2.7 per cent in lira terms. The French vote did nothing for the lira, or prospects for Italy's interest rates. Profit-taking during the session hit Credito Italiano and Nuovo Pignone, the two privatisation candidates, which fell by 2.8 per cent, and 4.7 per cent respectively. AMSTERDAM remained resilient against other European markets as the CBS Tendency index lost just 0.6 to 113.0. Mr Philip van den Berg, Dutch analyst at Goldman Sachs, said that the stronger dollar and hopes of lower German interest helped the market resist a steeper fall. Elsevier came back after suffering from last week's merger announcement with Reed of the UK and the shares picked up Fl 2.30 to Fl 105.00. Philips and Royal Dutch also went against the trend, gaining Fl 70 cents and 60 cents respectively to Fl 23.50 and Fl 148.60. MADRID was disappointed in theMaastricht vote and the general index slipped 4.19 to 210.78 while the Ibex index was down 2.3 per cent. Turnover swelled to Pta16bn. Utilities were weak on concerns over the effect of devaluation on earnings, as they have a lot of foreign currency debt in issue. Iberdrola I lost Pta35 to Pta685 in volume of 4.5m shares. Repsol fell Pta20 to Pta2,325 with 1.4m shares traded as US investors switched into the convertible bond issue. BRUSSELS followed neighbouring bourses lower as the Bel-20 index lost 6.36 to 1,123.88. Clabecq was the day's main feature, losing BFr230 or 30 per cent at BFr550 but in low volume. The steel group said last week that it was in partnership talks. ZURICH saw rising Swiss franc money market rates and profit-taking in banks; the SMI index, which peaked at 1,904.5 in early trading, closed 9.0 lower at 1,887.3. OSLO fell in nervous trade, shipping shares leading the way down as investors held back amid renewed concern over the European currencies and higher Norwegian short-term money market rates. The all-share index fell 2.73 to 333.42 in thin trading with the shipping index down 5.96 to 284.04. STOCKHOLM fell in late trading in spite of the central bank's lowering of its marginal lending rate from 500 per cent to 50 per cent. The Affarsvarlden index shed 13.6 to 745.1 in turnover of SKr380m. Handelsbanken's B shares fell by SKr4 to SKr25 while Electrolux B shares dropped SKr5 to SKr215 in turnover of SKr44bn. VIENNA reversed direction towards the end of the day as the ATX index finished up 4.03 at 839.73.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 21                          Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Open   10.30am   11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1058.72  1058.33  1057.41  1055.10  1052.61  1052.15  1051.77  1050.43                   Day's High  1059.27    Day's Low  1050.31          Sep 18      Sep 17     Sep 16      Sep 15      Sep 14         1070.95     1058.13     1053.63    1051.69     1073.79  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Heseltine delays coal white paper: Decision heightens concern over government policy to reprieve threatened pits THE GOVERNMENT'S coal review approached stalemate yesterday as Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told MPs he would not publish the promised white paper until after new contracts between British Coal and electricity companies in England and Wales had been signed. Mr Heseltine's remarks astonished senior electricity industry executives who have indicated previously they would not sign agreements until they had assessed the white paper. The chief executive of one regional company said Mr Heseltine's remarks were 'a bolt from the blue. I am very surprised he has taken this line'. Another said he found Mr Heseltine's comments extraordinary. 'We have every confidence the deals can be signed - and soon - but the trade secretary's comments make us suspicious about what is in the white paper,' he said. Separately, British Coal said that redundancy terms which allow miners up to Pounds 37,000 are to be extended for a further nine months from March 31. Some 8,094 miners have left the industry since October, 400 in the past week alone. Yesterday's developments heighten fears of further delay before the government decides on a policy to save some of the 31 threatened pits. British Coal's existing contracts with electricity generators expire at the end of the month, raising the possibility that it will be mining coal for its own stockpiles without receiving money from the electricity industry. The contracts are worth Pounds 120m a month to British Coal. In addition, talks with the government and the generators on tonnages above the contracts referred to yesterday by Mr Heseltine are making only limited progress. What discussion there is envisages additional tonnages of between 40m and 50m tonnes over five years, less than the government originally wanted and enough to save just a handful of the threatened pits. However, there was more encouraging news for the coal industry when DTI officials said that France might, after all, agree to import small quantities of British electricity through the cross-channel interconnector, potentially increasing the market for deep-mined British coal. Mr Heseltine has consistently stressed that seeking to increase the market for domestic coal by raising British electricity sales to France or cutting French exports to the UK was fraught with legal difficulties. In his comments to MPs yesterday, he spoke of a 'small but positive' step since he had last addressed the matter in the Commons. Fears of delay were reinforced last night when Downing Street said the coal review, originally promised as soon as possible in February, would not be discussed in cabinet today and may not be next week either. However, DTI officials said the white paper could be published quite quickly after British Coal's deals with the generators and regional companies were signed.

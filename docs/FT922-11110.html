			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Japan's banks braced for a capital storm: The effect of capital adequacy standards For Japanese bankers and their borrowers, at home and abroad, March 31, 1993, looms ever larger. It is the day that tough capital adequacy standards set by the Bank for International Settlements come into effect. Until the end of last month, Japanese banks hoped to make the grade with a combination of boosting their capital, cutting growth in assets, including loans, and luck. But this month's 15 per cent plunge in the Tokyo stock market has thrown the bankers' calculations into confusion. Mr Tsuneo Wakai, chairman of the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan, warned this week that if stock prices remained at current depressed levels until next March, Japanese banks would fail to meet BIS requirements. He warned this would dampen international confidence in Japan's banking system and economy. Mr Wakai's fears may already have been realised. In the past month foreign bankers in Tokyo have reported a sharp increase in inquiries from overseas clients about the creditworthiness of Japanese financial institutions. Nevertheless, in spite of Mr Wakai's concerns, there is little evidence of panic among Japanese bankers. Instead, they plan to postpone drastic steps until later in the financial year in the hope the stock market might recover. One senior banker says: 'We will not take any difficult decisions until after September.' For borrowers that means the stock market plunge will probably not bring further tightening of the credit supply from Japanese banks. But companies seeking funds next year could face an anxious time. Banks can improve capital adequacy ratios by raising capital or by cutting asset growth. Japanese banks have done both: they raised equity until the stock market plunged in 1990, then took out subordinated loans, which for BIS purposes count as capital. Meanwhile, they cut asset growth from a peak above 15 per cent in the late 1980s, to an estimated 4 per cent in the year to the end of March 1992. As a result, most banks met the BIS final standard of 8 per cent for the ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets. But the plunge in the stock market, led by a sharp fall in bank shares, has pushed most leading banks below 8 per cent. Japanese banks count as capital a portion of unrealised gains on share portfolios - gains eroded by the stock price fall. The decline in confidence has been so serious that the Ministry of Finance last week announced preliminary figures for the banks' financial results and reassured investors that Japanese banks were sound. Fortunately for Japanese banks, BIS rules contain no sanctions. The Japanese finance ministry will decide on penalties - and it is unlikely to do anything to undermine the banks' interests at such a delicate time. US and European regulators are also unlikely to pressure Japan for fear of the impact on international confidence in Japanese banks. Banks with ratios below 8 per cent may see credit ratings cut by the rating agencies - but most agencies have already marked Japanese banks down heavily in the past two years in response to the world economic slowdown and mounting bad loans in property markets. Similarly, poor BIS ratios could affect investors' opinions of bank shares - but this may have been discounted in the recent sharp price plunge. One answer might be to change BIS rules. But Bank of Japan officials have ruled out a unilateral appeal from Japan to BIS, as this could appear an admission of weakness. As a last resort, the Bank of Japan might try persuading the US and European central banks to revise the rules jointly. But this could still look like a cry for help from Japan. So it will be for Japanese banks to work out their own salvation. For the current year, leading banks plan to raise more subordinated debt. But BIS limits the subordinated debt which can be counted as capital - and some banks are near the ceiling. The capital base will also be reinforced by profits. However, banks' successes in increasing revenues from current businesses - mainly by widening interest rate spreads - is being offset by losses suffered through writing off past bad loans. According to the finance ministry, banks' operating profits in the year to last March rose 26.8 per cent but net profits (after write-offs) fell 24 per cent. So, barring a sharp stock market recovery, banks will be forced to cut asset growth or, probably, reduce assets. So far, they have done this mainly by cutting money market exposure and other financial market investments. They will press ahead with securitisation - parcelling loans into small lots and selling them to institutional investors. The banks have been helped by decline in demand for loans in Japan because of the economic slowdown. So, as Bank of Japan officials point out, there has been no general credit crunch in Japan. Nor have there been any conspicuous cases of Japanese banks denying credit to overseas borrowers. Certainly, borrowers in some sectors, notably property, are squealing for credit. But their problems do not stem from BIS-imposed constraints but from the plunge in property prices in Tokyo, London and New York. However, there is a real concern that general credit shortages could emerge if the Japanese economy begins to recover, as expected by the authorities, at the end of 1992, as companies will want funds for restocking. Mr Reese Harasawa, a planning department manager at Mitsubishi Bank, says: 'When the economy picks up there could be a problem if borrowers are denied loans. That's a delicate issue.' At the same time, increasing numbers of companies will seek to refinance equity-linked bonds they issued in the boom of the late 1980s. The peak in bonds falling due comes next year. The president of a leading Japanese software company, seeking to refinance Dollars 100m (Pounds 56m) of bonds falling due next year, says he has already begun talking to his main bank but does not know if he can raise a loan to repay the bonds. 'This is now my biggest headache,' he says. Japanese bankers try to reassure borrowers saying they are sticking to their original lending plans (set before this month's stock market fall) which call for keeping the growth in foreign assets to around zero, and to between 2 per cent and 3 per cent for assets overall. Top priority will go to servicing a bank's best customers, which will usually mean old-established Japanese borrowers. But a Bank of Tokyo official says banks will pay attention to quality - seeking to maintain credit quality and boost lending margins. So even blue-chip borrowers may have to pay more for funds. Banks dislike admitting that some would-be borrowers will be turned away. But they almost certainly will. As one banker says: 'If a new borrower comes to us with a new proposal we would have to think very seriously. I believe we may well say 'no'.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Japanese         Risk weignted capital      Nikkei index level at which Banks            ratio (end Sep 1991)       capital ratio falls below 8%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dai-Ichi Kangyo            8.38%                      15,624 Sakura                     7.57%                      18,611 Sumitomo                   8.94%                      11,711 Fuji                       8.72%                      15,974 Mitsubishi                 8.71%                      16,194 Sanwa                      8.50%                      15,151 Tokai                      8.34%                      17,051 Kyowa-Saitama              8.90%                      12,478 Bank of Tokyo              8.50%                      19,024 Daiwa Bank                 9.01%                      14,007 Hokkaido Takushoku         8.80%                      16,258 Industrial Bank of Japan   8.39%                      15,369 Long Term Credit Bank      8.56%                      15,118 Nippon Credit Bank         8.03%                      17,668  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IBCA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

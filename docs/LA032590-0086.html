			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MOSCOW STEPS UP PRESSURE ON LITHUANIA;  </P> <P> SECESSION: SOVIET OFFICIALS SAID THE SITUATION WAS APPROACHING 'ANARCHY IN ALL  ITS MANIFESTATIONS.' TWO U.S. ENVOYS WERE ORDERED TO LEAVE THE AREA.  </P> <P> Lithuania's president accused Moscow on Friday of waging psychological warfare  against his small republic with an escalating series of military maneuvers and  demands.  </P> <P> Soviet officials turned up the pressure against the Baltic republic that  declared independence on March 11, with the Tass news agency's saying the  situation was approaching "anarchy in all its manifestations."  </P> <P> Such tough language in the past has been used to prepare Soviets for major  steps by the Kremlin.  </P> <P> In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday afternoon:  "The situation appears to progressively get worse."  </P> <P> President Bush said Friday that any attempt by the Soviets to intimidate  Lithuania or to use force "is bound to backfire. That is inevitable."  </P> <P> Bush said the United States stands with "the brave men and women of Lithuania"  in their struggle for self-determination.  </P> <P> "We know that the Soviet Union has a longstanding interest in Lithuania, but  those interests can only be addressed through dialogue and negotiation," Bush  told a luncheon.  </P> <P> By dark in Lithuania, the republic appeared calm, keeping the demeanor of its  determined drive to restore the independence lost to Stalin's army in 1940.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said the Soviet Union had ordered two American consular officers  out of Lithuania, giving them 12 hours to leave. U.S. officials said other  foreign diplomats and some journalists also had been told to leave the  Lithuanian capital.  </P> <P> The diplomats, Leningrad-based consuls Douglas Wake and Jon Purnell, said  Friday night in Vilnius that they had heard nothing about the order for them to  leave.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said the diplomats will comply, but added that Moscow did not give  the United States a reason for the expulsion. He said the Soviet chief of  protocol relayed the expulsion notice to officials at the U.S. Embassy in  Moscow.  </P> <P> He said the two officials were in Vilnius "on routine reporting and analysis,  as they do for the embassy."  </P> <P> "They are staff people in our consulate in Leningrad," he said. "They're not  spies."  </P> <P> Wake, the U.S. diplomat, said U.S. officials regularly traveled to Lithuania in  the course of their consular work, but declined to comment any further on his  mission there.  </P> <P> Soviet officials on Friday continued to increase their pressure on Lithuania to  renounce its declaration of independence from the Soviet Union:  </P> <P> * The Soviet Union informed Poland it was suspending visa-free travel for Poles  and Lithuanians across the border, the official Tass news agency said.  </P> <P> * A military helicopter with a Soviet red star emblazoned on its side dumped  leaflets on downtown Vilnius containing a copy of Gorbachev's directive that  the republic of 3.8 million respect Soviet law.  </P> <P> * Foreign Ministry officials said Soviet embassies would review foreigners'  visa applications to travel to Lithuania to keep out people "inclined to engage  in illegal activities," Tass said. It did not elaborate.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union forcibly annexed Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia half a century  ago as part of an agreement between Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler.  </P> <P> More than a dozen armored personnel carriers and military trucks moved into  Vilnius on Thursday in what was regarded as a show of strength by the Soviet  military.  </P> <P> "New troops and maneuvers suggest that this is a psychological war," Lithuanian  President Vytautus Landsbergis told a session of the Legislative Council  parliament.  </P> <P> But Landsbergis told legislators he still trusted Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev.  </P> <P> "Maybe his choices are limited, maybe there are obstacles around him," he said.  "But we have faith in the common sense and the goodwill of Gorbachev and the  leadership of the Soviet Union," despite the escalating war of nerves.  </P> <P> Soviet officials reiterated that Gorbachev wants to solve the dispute  peacefully. Soviet officials have said that they ruled out using force to bring  Lithuania back into the Soviet fold.  </P> <P> "We will do everything possible to avoid complications," said Valentin Falin,  head of the Communist Party Central Committee's international department.  </P> <P> "There is a great amount of goodwill in Mr. Gorbachev," he told West European  parliamentarians in Luxembourg.  </P> <P> Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the former Soviet military chief of staff who is  a military adviser to Gorbachev, told reporters the army would act according to  Soviet laws in dealing with Lithuanian deserters.  </P> <P> Asked if arrests might not cause disruption in Lithuania and make Moscow look  bad, Akhromeyev said: "Whether it looks good or looks bad, there's an  established order, even if some people don't like it." He said military law  calls for deserters to be detained and sent back to their units.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian government said Thursday that plainclothes officers detained one  soldier on a Vilnius street. Landsbergis said military officials had refused to  release the man.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has also ordered Lithuanians to surrender all their firearms. He told  Landsbergis he expects the republic to stop its sign-up for a volunteer defense  force.  </P> <P> Lithuanians turned in only 39 firearms on Thursday and 34 on Friday, Soviet TV  said.  </P> <P> Lithuania issued an appeal to the world for support late Thursday.  </P> <P> Landsbergis also appealed directly to the Soviet legislature for negotiations  to solve all of the issues that Gorbachev has raised. A three-page letter was  sent to the Supreme Soviet on Friday.  </P> <P> "Any attempt by the government or military organizations of the U.S.S.R. to  interfere in enforcement of Lithuanian law in Lithuania will be viewed as a  violation of generally recognized principles of international law," the letter  said.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the letter said that in a 1920 treaty, the Soviet Union recognized  "for all time" the sovereign rights and independence of Lithuania.  </P> <P> Friday afternoon, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger summoned  Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin to his office at the State Department,  apparently to receive a U.S. protest note.  </P></p>

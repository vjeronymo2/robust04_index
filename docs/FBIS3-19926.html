			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed column: "Rehearsal for Frenzied Action"] </F>   [Text] Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis  has visited south Cyprus to hold talks and participate in  various activities. The objective of his visit was to step up  work for the realization of the Greek-Greek Cypriot joint  defense doctrine through concrete measures.    The timing of Arsenis' visit was important. It coincided  with the final stage of the result-oriented work on the package  of confidence-building measures. The international community  believes that the matter has been resolved. Many people and  officials are convinced that a historic and peaceful step is  about to be taken in Cyprus.    However, the frenzied activities planned with Arsenis in  south Cyprus indicate that maintaining hope and optimism for the  future is impossible. The fact that Arsenis is well-aware of  the Greek-Greek Cypriot side's intentions and objectives and the  frenzied activities the Greek Cypriots embarked on in the past  clarify the meaning of the Greek-Greek Cypriot side's  irresponsible behavior. Obviously, they wish to outline the  fact that they "do not intend to participate in the search for  peace."    How long will the Greek Cypriots, who have joined hands with  Greece, be able to maintain the ugly manifestations of their  sick and crooked communal approach? When will they abandon  their stubborn behavior, which may lead to tragic developments?  When will the Greek Cypriots act with reason?    Those questions are closely related to the agenda on Cyprus,  questions that have caused a significant state of uneasiness.    The Greek Cypriots have deceived the world into believing  that they are trying to find a durable solution to establish  peace in Cyprus. Meanwhile, they have added a new dimension to  their armament campaign and offensive preparations. Obviously,  they are rehearsing for their final onslaught, which will be a  frenzied action on their part.    How long will they continue to mock the world?    The fact that has become obvious is as follows:    While we mark the 30th anniversary of our resistance in  Ghaziveran and Camlikoy [Kalokhorio], our sacred values, which  our noble martyrs shed their blood to safeguard during our  national resistance, still need to be protected with our life  and blood.    That is the only conclusion we have drawn from developments  in the Greek-Greek Cypriot front.</p>

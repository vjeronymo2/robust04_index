			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: LTV back in the black despite effects of winter LTV, the third-largest US steelmaker, yesterday said it managed to return to profit in the first quarter despite the impact of harsh winter weather on its operations. The group posted net income of Dollars 15.3m, or 16 cents a share, reversing a loss of Dollars 47.7m in the same period of 1993. The result, which exceeded the forecasts of most analysts, extended a record of steady improvement by LTV since it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last June. LTV, along with the rest of the US steel industry, continued to benefit from rising production, greater operating efficiencies and improved prices. Sales in the car industry showed no signs of flagging during the quarter. Revenues from core steel operations, which accounted for 93 per cent of the total sales of Dollars 1.07bn, showed an 8 per cent gain. Shipments were up just 3 per cent, at 1.93m tons. But with steel facilities working at 99 per cent of capacity, LTV was able to realise higher average selling prices. However, conditions during the winter led to power cuts, disrupted deliveries and complicated handling of raw materials which pulled operating profits down by Dollars 13m. The negative effect on the bottom line was offset by Dollars 14.4m in favourable state and local tax settlements during the quarter.</p>

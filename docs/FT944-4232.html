			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: 'My objective remains to reduce spending'  -The full text of the Chancellor's announcement to the House of Commons / Smokers, drinkers and motorists feel the brunt of indirect tax increases as the chancellor refuses to change spending settlements and income tax 'With permission, Madam Speaker, I should like to make a statement. Following the vote on Tuesday night, I told the House that the government remained committed to taking all the necessary measures to put the public finances on a sound footing. The reductions in the public sector borrowing requirement I announced in my Budget were welcomed at the time by the business community, the financial markets and this House. During the course of the Budget debate few Rt Hon and Hon Members questioned that judgment. To keep these borrowing plans intact, I said I would be bringing forward measures to make good the gap in the public finances from holding the rate of VAT on domestic fuel and power at 8 per cent. I can now tell the House what those measures will be. A press note filling out the details of my proposals will be available from the Vote Office as soon as I have sat down. Holding the rate of VAT at 8 per cent will reduce revenue by about Pounds 1bn in 1995-96 and, reflecting the quarterly profile of payments, Pounds 1.5bn in subsequent years. These are the amounts that I have sought to recover. Since VAT on fuel will remain at 8 per cent, it would be quite wrong to increase social security expenditure by providing the full compensation package previously announced to help people with VAT at 17.5 per cent. We will adjust the amount that would have been paid if VAT on fuel had been increased, saving around Pounds 200m in 1995-96 and subsequent years. We will of course keep in place the help already given for 8 per cent VAT on domestic fuel and power. We will increase benefits fully in line with the relevant cost of living index including the component reflecting the impact of last year's VAT increase. After these adjustments pensioner couples will receive help of at least Pounds 1.05 a week from next April. This will be more than the average weekly cost to pensioners of paying 8 per cent VAT on fuel. I am also keeping unchanged the increases in cold weather payments and spending on the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme which I announced in the Budget and in last Tuesday's debate. This small change in the previously announced pension rates has a knock-on effect to the national insurance system, since the lower earnings limit is automatically linked to the single pension. National Insurance contributions will therefore start at Pounds 58 rather than Pounds 59 a week from April 1995. The upper earnings limit will be unchanged. This will have the effect of raising receipts from National Insurance contributions by some Pounds 50m next year. The remaining gap for 1995-96 amounts to some Pounds 800m. My first step was to look at public spending. In my last two Budgets I have been able to find savings of Pounds 43bn in public spending over the four survey years. This is much larger than the increases in taxation that we have found it necessary to make to restore healthy public finances after the recession. We have managed to find these savings while increasing spending in real terms on key public services such as the NHS and the police. My objective remains to reduce government spending to below 40 per cent of total national output. Both of my Budgets have made that objective much more achievable. The details of this year's extremely tight public spending settlement have already been announced by the relevant secretaries of state. I do not consider it practicable or sensible to reopen those settlements today. At the time of my Budget I struck a balance between spending and revenue designed to ensure that the economy remains on track for steady and sustainable growth. Nothing that has happened since then has led me to change that judgment for this year's settlement. The next area I considered to recover the shortfall in revenue was direct taxation. Since 1979 this government has reduced the basic rate of taxation from 33p in the pound to 25p. And we also introduced the new lower rate of 20p. One-fifth of all taxpayers now pay tax only at this lower rate. When seeking to raise revenue in the 1993 Budgets, my Rt Hon Friend and I considered it necessary to freeze personal allowances, reduce the married couple's allowance and the mortgage income relief allowance. I considered then that these increases in direct taxation were a sufficient and reasonable contribution to our revenue needs. That remains my view today. I do not intend to reverse my decisions to index the personal allowances and to over-index above inflation the elderly persons allowance and the 20p band. I also considered raising additional revenue from business taxation. In my Budget I provided as much help as I could for the business community. The reason was simple. Strong and thriving businesses are essential for a strong and thriving economy. I have also listened during last week's debate to the Labour Party's proposals for closing loopholes and introducing a windfall tax on utilities and I have done some work on studying them. They are not serious options for revenue raising. This government has never been a friend to the tax-avoidance industry and Conservative chancellors have changed loopholes year after year. The last two Budgets speak for themselves. I raised nearly Pounds 3.5bn between 1994-95 and 1997-98 by closing loopholes. The Hon Gentleman's proposals on loopholes are undesirable changes in taxation on legitimate business. I have looked many times at his proposal on executive share options. The policy behind tax relief for executive share options is geared to encouraging companies to motivate key employees and benefit all shareholders. Executives are liable to capital gains tax once they sell their shares. The Rt Hon Gentleman exaggerates the cost of the scheme. The Rt Hon Gentleman has claimed that I could raise Pounds 200m by 'reforming' it. The actual total cost of the relief is estimated at around Pounds 50m. The suggestion of a windfall tax is by definition a one-off tax. It could not replace permanent annual loss of a flow of revenue. In any event, it appears to be based on the suggestion of taxing profits on gains which, as the Rt Hon Gentleman appears to have discovered in this mornings press, are already liable to taxation. A windfall tax would simply be another tax on a particular sector of industry. Like other taxes on business it would inevitably have adverse effects on that business sector's investment and prices. My third, and remaining option for 1995-96, therefore, has been to look to indirect taxation. As the House has rejected an increase in indirect taxation to which it had previously agreed it is wholly consistent with my Budget strategy and it preserves the shape of the Budget to fill the hole with increases in indirect taxation. I have decided to bring forward certain increases in taxation in addition to those announced in my Budget, to take effect from midnight, 31 December 1994. I propose that the duty on tobacco products, with the exception of hand-rolling tobacco, will increase by just under 4 per cent, equivalent to 6p on a packet of 20 cigarettes. This further increase in tobacco duty is consistent with our policy of increasing prices to discourage smoking. I also propose that the duties on road fuels will rise by a further 1p a litre. I have kept these increases to the minimum to limit the burden on business users and the rural motorist. Even after the increases, petrol will still be cheaper in real terms than a decade ago and cheaper than in our main European competitors. The increase will also play a part in our strategy for curbing emission of CO2. We remain fully committed to the target of reducing CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Finally, I propose that duties on alcohol will rise by around 4 per cent. This is equivalent to 1p on a pint of beer, 5p on a bottle of wine, and 26p on a bottle of whisky. For the reasons set out in my Budget statement I had hoped to spare these industries any increase in duty this year. But in present circumstances, as a result of my need to raise revenue from sources other than VAT on fuel, I have reluctantly judged it necessary to raise some additional revenue from them. Taken together these increases will raise Pounds 180m in the current year and nearly Pounds 800m in 1995-96. In total this is sufficient to meet the shortfall next year. I expect the public sector borrowing requirement next year to be the same as I announced in my Budget statement. Let me turn now to the following year, 1996-97. For that year I need to raise Pounds 1.5bn. The tax measures that I have announced today will raise an additional Pounds 850m. The impact of the higher duties that I have announced today on the RPI will not be as great as the impact would have been from the second stage of VAT on fuel. Inflation will therefore be very slightly lower than expected, leading to further public spending savings on benefits of around Pounds 160m in 1996-97 and later years. And there will be savings of around Pounds 200m from the withdrawal of help to compensate for the second stage of VAT. There will, however, remain a further gap of around Pounds 300m to be filled in 1996-97. I propose to finance this gap by reducing the public expenditure control totals for those years. For the time being I will score that reduction through a reduction in the provision that I had made for the reserve. The eventual consequence for Departmental programmes will be addressed in next year's spending round. I expect the public sector borrowing requirement to be as I announced in my Budget statement in 1996-97 and in subsequent years. Resolutions under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act to hold VAT on fuel at 8 per cent with effect from 1 January 1995 will be tabled very shortly. My Rt Hon Friend the Leader of the House will then be arranging a debate before the House rises for the Christmas recess. Madam Speaker, I said in my Budget speech that the British economy is currently facing the most favourable set of economic circumstances it has seen for many years. Trade figures published only this morning show that exports are up 14 per cent in the last year and once again at record levels. The trade deficit is the lowest it has been for almost 10 years. The outlook for jobs and future prosperity for men and women in this country is improving day by day. This House has an obligation to keep this healthy recovery on track. We have an obligation to act responsibly, and not be tempted by short-term populist measures, which would undermine confidence in the government's commitment to sound public finances. The measures I have announced today ensure that that commitment is fulfilled.</p>

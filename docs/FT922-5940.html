			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Tightening up governance THE REPORT of Sir Adrian Cadbury's committee on corporate governance has more to offer than might have been expected from a group so obviously composed of the great and the good. With the support of the London Stock Exchange, the investment institutions and the accountancy profession, there is every chance that a range of pragmatic and mainly constructive proposals will contribute to higher standards of boardroom behaviour and financial reporting across the country. If there is a problem with the report's recommendations, it is simply that expectations have been running high, in the wake of a succession of corporate scandals. It seems questionable whether those expectations will be fully satisfied by the incremental approach to reform that Sir Adrian and his colleagues have adopted. This is not wholly the fault of the committee itself, whose terms of reference were narrow. When it was set up a year ago, the committee was asked to address only the financial aspects of corporate governance, with a view to restoring confidence in financial reporting and auditing practice. Within that framework the important question is whether the committee has been prepared to confront directly the conflicts of interest that go most of the way towards explaining manifest weaknesses in the chain of accountability from management to shareholders. Selection process Earlier attempts to address the problems that stem from the divorce between ownership and control in quoted companies have placed emphasis on the role of outside directors. Cadbury seeks to build on this by calling for a more formal selection process for non-executive directors, who are free from business or financial connections with the company. A key recommendation is that the outside directors should be able to take independent professional advice at the company's expense, which would significantly strengthen their position. This is sensible as far as it goes, but in the controversial area of executive pay, the report falls conspicuously short. The suggestion that companies should provide more detailed information and explain any performance-related elements in the pay package is undeniably welcome; but putting the names of a mainly non-executive remuneration committee in the directors' report and requiring its chairman to answer to the annual general meeting is no substitute for a shareholders' vote on directors' remuneration. Curious argument This was rejected on the ground that it would be hard to persuade executives to change jobs if their pay was subject to approval at an AGM - a curious argument that assumes that shareholders including the big institutions will not see the case for sensible remuneration packages. Where the audit is concerned, the committee recognises that it is, in practice, the management that retains the right to hire and fire the auditor. It therefore seeks to buttress the auditor's independence by establishing audit committees for all companies, the rotation of audit partners within firms and direct access for the auditor to non-executives on the board. One of the shortcomings of the report is its failure fully to recognise that the non-executive directors are part of the problem rather than the solution. As long as the outside director's responsibilities are legally the same as those of the executive directors it is hard to believe that the relationship between the two animals will be other than cosy. Outside directors will continue to identify with the leadership of the company at the expense of the control function that they are expected to exercise. Similarly, auditors will always have too cosy a relationship with management if shareholders have no real say in the appointment and audit business becomes a loss-leader for other financial services. Yet Cadbury sees no way in which shareholders could be brought into the procedures for appointing and remunerating the auditor. Nor does the committee accept the case for a ban on consultancy. By providing a clearer definition of responsibilities, the committee may well succeed in mitigating some of the damage arising from these fundamental conflicts. But it will not, inevitably, be the last word.</p>

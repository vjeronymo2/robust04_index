However, the Social Democratic Party [SDP] is unable  to understand the party's major losses in this months Gallup  opinion poll.    It is understandable that the Center Democrats should be  losing voters after the infamous affair involving Bente Juncker,  the former social affairs minister who accused the head of an  institution of the sexual abuse of the mentally subnormal.    Such are the comments from several Social Democrats after  BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's new Gallup poll today. On the other hand  they are unable to understand why the Social Democrats have lost  more than 4.2 percent of voter support since the February poll.    However, Interior Minister Birte Weiss (Social Democratic  Party) is well able to understand why the Liberal Party is  "slowly but surely" continuing its downturn -- this time from  26.9 percent to 25.8 percent of votes. "The closer we come to  the elections, the greater will be the nervousness of those  drifting voters who have sought refuge with the Liberal Party,"  Interior Minister Birte Weiss said. She also said that Liberal  Party chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen's "unsavory manner" is  gradually causing voters to beg off.    Conservative People's Party leader Hans Engell is extremely  satisfied with his party's continued success. He stressed that  "people must now count on a Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party  majority as a real possibility." And he believes that Prime  Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is facing a reverse "prime  minister effect" [the effect of increased support in opinion  polls for the party providing the prime minister in a coalition  government]:    "There is much to indicate that Nyrup Rasmussen is pulling  everything down for the Social Democrats," Engell said.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jagodina, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the  speaker of the parliament of the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS),  said on Wednesday that the Serb side is the most interested that  an agreement on the normalization of the situation in Sarajevo  is reached in Geneva on Thursday, because the Moslems are  holding 60,000 Serbs as hostages there.    "Sarajevo is the biggest detention camp in which the Serbs  have been held since the start of the war. This is why it is  illogical to claim that the Serbs have encircled Sarajevo, and  even more illogical that they do not want a negotiated solution  for this Serb city," Krajisnik told local Radio Jagodina  (central Serbia).    He reiterrated that in Geneva RS is willing to discuss the  demilitarization of Sarajevo and the putting of this  multi-ethnic capital of the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina under U.N. control.    "Tomorrow in Geneva the Serb side will clearly state its  conditions for pulling out its heavy weapons," Krajisnik said  and explained that this is necessary because the Moslems also  have the same type of arms.    "If the Moslem weapons remain at the line of fire, and ours  are put out of action, then it is clear that the international  community's demand is to enable the Moslems to take the Serb  territories in this part of the front," Krajisnik said. The  Serbs will never allow this, he concluded.</p>

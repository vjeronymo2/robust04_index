			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Accountancy Column: Six items all financial reports should have FINANCIAL reporting in the UK is in the process of much-needed reform. The first tangible evidence came last week when the Accounting Standards Board issued its draft proposals on the restructuring of profit-and-loss accounts. While welcoming the fact that the ASB is taking a long and intelligent look at the many difficulties of financial reporting, I have some reservations about the package of draft measures issued last week. At the risk of being controversial, I would like to remind the standard-setters that the essence of good financial reporting is simplicity. In my opinion, complexity should be confined to the notes to accounts. I believe that, while improved in many respects, the new profit-and-loss format proposed by the Accounting Standards Board is still too complicated. Accountancy is the science (or more probably the art) of communicating financial information. Whatever information is reported, it is necessarily heavily summarised. Earnings per share is but one measure of summarised performance. It is a useful indicator of corporate profitability, but no more. Company directors and City analysts place too much emphasis on this one number, giving rise to the many well-chronicled distortions in company report-ing. In my opinion, companies should be obliged to present a series of simple measures that reflect the different aspects of the full financial report, not just the profit-and-loss account, but also the balance sheet and cash-flow statement. In my view, six ratios or measures would be about the right number. A key aspect of corporate performance will continue to be profitability. Here there is no reason to depart from the established measure of earnings per share. Users of accounts need to know the return shareholders will receive from the company, and how safe that return is. That could be given either in terms of dividends per share or dividend cover. A second profit-and-loss disclosure is that of the return to those other providers of finance, the lenders. Again it is interest cover which is probably of greatest significance, as it also gives a measure of the security of the investors' own ratios. Turning to balance-sheet items, we need to know the level of capital employed and the adequacy of the way the business is financed. The first of those could be measured in terms of net tangible assets, or possibly net tangible assets per share. Finance is most appropriately summed up by disclosure of the level of gearing. That gives five measures and I have suggested there should be six. So far, I have concentrated on the profit-and-loss account and balance sheet. But I would suggest that recently the accountants have rediscovered at last one of the most important areas of a company's performance: cash flow. Most company failures occur because a company runs out of cash. That can happen to profitable companies as well as loss-makers. Of course, a company that makes losses will, unless it is supported by others, eventually run out of cash and fail. It is essential that we accountants develop a suitable measure of cash flow, equivalent to earnings per share. Something along the lines of the ratio of gross cash flows to profit, or gross cash flows to net assets, would probably be suitable. That should be the sixth disclosed measure. The main statements in the accounts should support those statistics. They should not be over-complex. That is why I have reservations about the ASB's new profit-and-loss format. In most businesses, acquired companies and disposed companies become integrated, or were at least partly integrated, with continuing businesses. Determining their profit separately can only be arbitrary. In most businesses in every year there are circumstances that affect profit which will not recur. Whether those effects are ordinary, or exceptional, or extraordinary, no one can reasonably know. There must be circumstances where disclosure of the total of profit or loss alone would be misleading, but the present proposal is too complex. On the other hand, I strongly support the proposal for a new statement of reserves reflecting changes in the net worth of the company other than from new capital contributed. I would like to see that information on the profit-and-loss page in the accounts. So far as the balance sheet is concerned, I am worried about some suggestions that it should become a statement of value. That could lead the profession back into the quagmire of current-cost accounting. I would keep the balance sheet on a straightforward historic cost basis. Other information - relevant on such matters as the value of properties, or brands or infrastructure assets - should be provided separately.

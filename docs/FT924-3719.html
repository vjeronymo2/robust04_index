			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Computing: An honest job at a reasonable price - Two programs that compromise intelligently between professional and private needs FOR THE small investor who wants to keep an orderly record of stock market dealings and to get, in return, a comprehensive view of how his affairs stand, Meridian Software's Stockmarket 2 and Chart Analyst programs could scarcely be bettered. They are brisk, straightforward and trustworthy. They do an honest job for a reasonable price - on yesterday's equipment, if need be. Stockmarket 2 is a portfolio management program. Chart Analyst draws a variety of graphs from share price data. It can use the data files created by Stockmarket 2 if you have both programs. Stockmarket 2 by itself can plot a simple linear or logarithmic graph for a single share or index. Between them, these programs represent an intelligent compromise between the size and complication of the sort of program a professional might use, and the needs of a private investor. Shares are recorded in portfolios of up to 50 companies. It is better, I think, to keep the portfolios smaller than that. While I was testing the program, I kept ordinary shares in one portfolio, updated weekly; gilts, unit trusts and investment trusts in another, updated more rarely. I also kept a prices-only 'portfolio' of the FT indices and the retail price index. Stockmarket 2 can record not only share purchases and subsequent price movements but also dividends received and the state of up to five cash accounts, if you want to include them. If you also store yields and P/E ratios, the program will adjust them automatically in accordance with price changes, so you will need to update them only occasionally. The program will produce lists of shares held, of transactions, of dividends received, on the computer screen or a printer. It will also produce a summary of the portfolio and gives you three choices - 'General', 'Current' and 'Gains' - which, in fact, differ little from each other. Graphs are a great feature of the Meridian programs. Each can store prices at 260 different dates for each share in a portfolio - a year's worth of daily updates, or five years of once-a-week. When you add the 261st price, the earliest one disappears. The programs will draw informative graphs on any equipment. (It seems safe to assume so, anyway, since they give excellent results on my seven-year-old computer). They understand dates so that, if you fail to update the prices for a couple of weeks, the graphs will retain the right proportions. Prices are adjusted automatically so that share splits and part payments (as for privatisation shares) do not distort the graphs. The programs come with sample data on some widely-owned shares, and Meridian can supply other historic data on disk. The real fun, though, is watching the graphs of your own shares become progressively more revealing. Stockmarket 2 will plot simple graphs. Chart Analyst is more sophisticated. I had thought graphs were only for faddists and speculators. I was wrong. I especially liked Chart Analyst's 'automatic plot': it produces the graphs for a whole portfolio, four at a time. I took to running that show every week after I had updated the prices. It sorts sheep from goats rather effectively. Chart Analyst has even fancier tricks than that. It can plot several graphs on one grid. It can 'rebase' share prices, drawing the graph as if the first price entered had been 1 or 100, as you choose, with the rest in proportion (just like graphs in the newspapers). It will plot the graph of one price divided by another: if the line tends upwards, the first share is doing the better of the two; if downwards, the second. This facility can be used to compare a share price to an FT index as easily as one share to another. The shares, or indices, compared do not have to be in the same portfolio. Chart Analyst will put a 'stop loss' line on a graph, at a chosen, fixed percentage below the highest price. It will draw a 'point and figure' diagram. An oscillator can show either 'rate of change' or 'momentum.' These prospects will no doubt seem more attractive to investors who understand what they mean. The manual is, however, remarkably simple and clear. I suspect the best way to learn about oscillators is to let your computer draw you a few. The manual concludes with a good chapter on how to use graphs. These programs have limitations, inevitable at the price. Share prices cannot be updated by modem down a telephone line - you must do it by hand. If you divide your holdings among several portfolios, as I suggest, there is no quick and easy way to find out how much you are worth altogether, or what your annual income from shares is - two rather interesting questions. A generous, but finite, number of transactions, dividends, and cash entries can be stored with each portfolio. Eventually, though, you will run out of space, and if you keep the full, permitted 50 shares in a portfolio, you will run out of space for more transactions long before you have entered five years' worth of weekly prices. But these are mere quibbles. Stockmarket 2 (Pounds 49.95) and Chart Analyst (Pounds 79.95) are available from Meridian Software, Amberley House, The Park, Sidcup, Kent, DA14 6AL; telephone 081-309-5960. +/-</p>

He did not make an appearance for the recent grass-roots  people's congress elections in Beijing. Deng did not appear in  the television footage of some big shots casting votes.  However, the official news reports said Deng cast his vote.    This was rather mysterious and confusing. So it was rumored  that Deng had fallen ill, and he did not come to the polling  booth. His vote was cast by other people on his behalf. It was  also said that Deng had not contracted any special disease, but  was simply getting senile, so his health remained normal. It  was even said that Deng left Beijing in the last month of 1993,  and the rumor came from some senior officials.    In December 1991, Deng Xiaoping began his inspection tour to  the south, and uttered a series of remarks that shocked all  quarters.    In December 1993, Deng travelled to the south again, and was  said to have spoken many times. The main subject of his talk  remained economic reform and he still called for promoting  production through reforms. In addition, Deng also emphatically  opposed localism and their local assertions for "independence."    There were some detailed reports about Deng's travel to the  south:    On the evening of 9 December, accompanied by Yang Dezhong of  the CPC Central Committee's General Office, Wu Xiuquan, and Li  Desheng, Deng Xiaoping set off on a special train from Beijing's  South Railway Station. Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, Ding Guangen,  and Wen Jiabao saw him off at the railway station. It was said  that strict security measures were taken for the special train,  which had eight carriages. One was for Deng Xiaoping, one was  used as a conference room, one was a dining place, one for the  security personnel, one for the entourage, and two for Yang  Dezhong, Wu Xiuquan, and Li Desheng. Another carriage was a  spare one. Before Deng Xiaoping boarded the train, Liu Huaqing,  Wen Jiabao, Tao Siju, and Yang Dezhong personally inspected the  special train, stopping on a special railway line. One year  ago, at a meeting of the Central Security Guard Bureau, Liu  Huaqing said: "We must guarantee Comrade Xiaoping's health and  safety with a responsible attitude toward the party and the  people, and this is your noble duty."    On the early morning of 10 December, Deng Xiaoping arrived  at  Baimashan Station in Jinan, Shandong, and the train moved to a  special line. Deng met with Shandong Province's party and  government leaders and the Jinan Military Region's leaders on  the train. He mainly talked about several issues.    Deng Xiaoping said: "Reform should be deepened. This is a  battle of assaulting heavily fortifications, and is also a  revolution. Certain costs will have to be paid for a  revolution. I agree that action should be taken as long as a  correct judgment is made, and we cannot just wait and see. The  conditions will not fall from the heaven, and the God will not  endow us with such favorable conditions."    "There is a valuable conclusion in these years. That is,  there is no debate inside the party, and our work should not be  bothered by theoretical controversy. Thus, we can concentrate  our time and energy on fulfilling the central task and properly  handle new questions in reform and opening. Some people inside  the party were not happy to see that no debate was launched.  They are keen to launch debates and polemics. The attitude of  the central leadership is firm. That is, no debate is to be  started. I think that it is difficult for those who want to  start a debate to actually do so."    Deng Xiaoping added: "Now, we should overcome localism and  individualism, and should punish those involved in serious  cases. The central leadership has repeatedly stressed the need  to reinforce the party spirit and the sense of organization and  discipline in the course of reform. People must keep the  overall interests of the nation in mind and should take the  interests of the whole into account."    "I should commend Shanghai, Guangdong, and also Shandong,  Sichuan, Beijing, and Liaoning. They have all done a good job."    "Party cadres should have a self-sacrificial spirit, and  should give more consideration to the benefit of ordinary people  and actually seek more real benefit for them. This is an  important point. Whether the reform principles and policies  will achieve the expected results will first be tested by  practice and will also depend on where the work performances and  behavior of our party and government leading cadres are decent  and proper."    In his talk, Deng stressed the point of fighting against  localism. From the above-quoted remarks, one may see that the  main current obstacles to reform and opening first come from the  intention of some people to start a debate and secondly from  localism. Some local party and government leaders ignored or  even defied the central instructions and orders. Deng warned  that those involved in serious cases should be "punished" [yao  fan yi fan 6008 0646 0001 0646], and this remark was rather  important.    However, Deng also had to appease the local authorities,  and required that the Armed Forces give support to local  construction. He told the responsible people of the Jinan  Military Region: "The Army should fulfill its own central task.  In the period of peaceful construction, some troops are rather  lazy, weak, and loose. Serious attention must be paid to this  problem. The troops are often affected by the environment and  the local conditions. So the political and ideological work  must not be relaxed. When there are conditions, the Armed  Forces should support and help local construction. In recent  years, relations between local party organizations and  governments on the one side and the military units on the other  were rather harmonious, and this is the mainstream. It is still  necessary to improve relations between the troops and the  civilian people. The local party organizations and governments  are also responsible for this, and must not neglect the work in  this regard."    From Jinan to Nanjing, Deng Xiaoping once again sternly  criticized localism, and blamed some local party and government  cadres for disregarding the superior authorities and the central  leadership.    On the late evening of 10 December, Deng's special train  arrived in Nanjing. On the morning of 11 December, Deng  Xiaoping met with party and government leaders of Jiangsu  Province and principal party and government leaders of Suzhou,  Wuxi, Xuzhou, Lianyungang, Changzhou, Nantong, and Zhenjiang  Cities. After listening to the work reports by the provincial  and city leaders, Deng said: "Jiangsu Province has good  conditions, and should make greater contributions to the state,  to other provinces and regions, and to the general public.  Greater efforts should be made to advance reform. Now, a  favorable factor we have is that the local authorities and the  central authorities are striving for the same objective, and the  party, the government, and the people are striving for the same  objective. However, when achievements have been made, you  should guard against complacency, and should not unwittingly  pursue localism and individualism. This is not good. The  subordinate should obey the superior, individuals should obey  the organization, and the whole party should obey the central  leadership. Now, in some party and government departments, some  cadres disregard the superior authorities and disregard the  central leadership. How can they be allowed to behave in this  way? If this problem is not rectified, they will commit major  mistakes."    Reportedly, after Deng Xiaoping and his entourage stopped  over in Nanjing, they went to Nanfang Fountains of the Tai Hu in  Wuxi the same afternoon, where there is a holiday resort of the  Central Military Commission. Deng Xiaoping stayed in Villa No  2. There are a total of 12 villas in the holiday resort, and  there are also two four-story buildings for holiday-makers.  They were built in the spring of 1992. There are doctors and  medical experts from the military medical schools in this  sanatorium, which serves military cadres at and above the army  level or retired cadres at and above the ministerial level.  Some central leaders call it the August 1 Sanatorium.    This reporter visited an informed old cadre, and asked him  to  talk about his feelings about Deng's remarks in his recent  travel to the south.    -- Deng basically told the truth.    -- Deng still insisted on the idea of "pursuing quick  development" and "no simply waiting." This showed that he felt  that his days were numbered, and this was the mentality of an  old man.    -- Deng mentioned that "some people are unhappy to see that  no debate is launched and they are still keen to start a  debate." This referred to the conservatives. These people have  become an obstacle to reform. In a briefing circular, the  General Office of the State Council recently made public Zhu  Rongji's speech at a meeting, and he more clearly mentioned such  obstacles. Zhu Rongji said: At present, the whole party is  advancing reform, opening, and economic construction under the  guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory about building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. This has become an irreversible trend.  However, we should note and should be courageous enough to  admit that there remains certain resistance. The resistance  mainly comes from inside the party, including the outdated and  backward idea of sticking to the rigid dogmas that are no longer  suited to the development of our society. Practice has proved  that this is an erroneous and even harmful idea. The thinking  and behavior of some leading comrades also constitute an  obstructive force at some times and in some events. This has  had a substantial harmful impact on the situation. Obviously,  Zhu's remarks were directed at the conservatives.    -- Of course, differences not only exist between reformists  and conservatives but also between reformists and "radical  reformists." For example, on the issue of the central  authorities' macrocontrol, Zhu Rongji admitted that there were  "different ideas." He said: The central leadership holds that  macrocontrol is not only an instant need but also a long-term  task. However, another opinion holds that the central  authorities' macrocontrol can only be a temporary measure or an  urgent means, which is short-term and temporary, in the  transition to the market economic structure. People holding the  latter opinion fear that permanent macrocontrol may lead to  retrogression, that is, the guideline of "taking the planned  economy as the mainstay" may be effected in the name of  macrocontrol, and the market economy will thus be confined to a  limited scope and cannot extend and grow freely.    -- On the one hand, Deng admitted the existence of localism  to a serious degree. On the other hand, he said that the local  authorities and the central authorities shared the same  objective. This was obviously self-contradictory. In fact,  there are sharp interest conflicts between the localities and  the central government. Deng's talk in fact admitted the  existence of localism to a serious degree, so it was necessary  to overcome it or even "punish" some people. Reportedly, local  officials aired resentment at a recent national economic  conference, and complained about a series of wrong actions taken  by the central authorities. The contradictions between the  central authorities and the localities not only find expression  in policies and measures, but also in the distribution of tax  revenue. Differences also exist over the current anticorruption  work. Zhu Rongji himself said: The central leadership holds  that the anticorruption work is a long-term task. The current  condition of corruption is rather serious. Corruption has  seriously harmed economic construction, reform, and opening, and  may even directly ruin the people's political power and ruin our  party and our cause. Corruption has laid bare the problems and  errors in the work of the central authorities. The other  opinion holds that corruption is unavoidable in the course of  economic development, reform, and opening. Such problems emerge  in an endless stream in the high level of the political and  business circles of such capitalist countries as Japan and the  ROK. The "different opinion" mentioned by Zhu mainly came from  local officials. In addition, a third opinion holds that the  problem exists in the incorrect line taken by the central  leadership, which gave up the inner-party ideological struggle,  denied the objective existence of class struggle, and ignored  the corrosive influence of Western ideology. This resulted in  corruption. This is the opinion of the conservatives.    -- Deng said: "The party, the government, and the people are  striving for the same objective." This was not completely in  keeping with facts. In fact, the party only pursues a limited  degree of reform in the economic field and does not pursue any  political reform at all. The people are opposed to the policy  of not carrying out political reform. To a certain degree, they  welcome economic reform, but they are not completely satisfied  with it. Zhu Rongji also frankly mentioned this without mincing  words. When talking about the reform orientation of the  state-owned enterprises, he said: The central leadership holds  that the key lies in how to give play to the initiative of the  large and medium- sized enterprises. The state-owned  enterprises must carry out reforms, and must adapt their  management and operation mechanisms to the requirements of the  market economy. In the next 10 years or so, the state-owned  enterprises will still play a main role. The different opinion  holds that reform must proceed from the large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises, competition should be openly supported,  enterprises which do not achieve good business results, do not  sell their products well, run in the red, and fail to repay  debts should be merged, auctioned openly, or transferred to the  hands of overseas investors or private entrepreneurs, and the  joint- stock system be adopted among state-owned enterprises.  One more opinion holds that now is the time to totally adopt  the joint-stock system among all state-owned enterprises and  even effect privatization. They say that the joint-stock system  and privatization represent the orientation of enterprise  reforms. These are different opinions on deepening reform and on  the orientation of the reform. People holding the first opinion  are mainly scholars and experts. People holding the second  opinion include scholars, experts, intellectuals, and many  ordinary people, who also hold similar ideas. If there is a  referendum, it is believed that the option of "privatization"  will win.    -- It is not certainly correct to stop all debates. The  conservatives may be defeated in a polemic. Why isn't this a  good thing? On the other hand, through debates, the voice of  the people will produce positive effects on reform, and the  truth will become clearer in the course of debates.    It was said that Deng Xiaoping stayed some time in Wuxi  after  traveling from Beijing to Jinan and Nanjing. Because the  whereabouts of the CPC leaders and policymakers are extremely  secret, it is believed that the enigma about Deng Xiaoping's  admonition to local officials during his southern tour will not  be made clear for a certain period of time.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Sid starts to worry about getting burnt Is Sid, the proverbial small investor, about to be burnt by the very company he helped to found - British Gas? When the company was privatised in 1986 several million small investors responded to the call 'Tell Sid' and bought shares. The prospectus said that British Gas's authorisation would last 25 years, suggesting a long and secure future. This week Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, decided to abolish the British Gas monopoly, suddenly transforming the prospects for the more than 2m small shareholders who held on to their British Gas shares. Mr Geoffrey Maddrell, chief executive of Proshare, the organisation set up to promote wider share ownership, said yesterday that he had received several dozen letters from small shareholders asking him what they should do. He, in turn, has written to Mr Heseltine. He said: 'That licence has been ripped up. The investors' interests have not been taken into account. These are not seasoned investors. They are loyal people. A lot of them are retired.' All is not lost, however. The profit prospects of British Gas now depend on the complex pricing formula which has still to be agreed by Mr Heseltine and Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator. Mr Maddrell said the government would have to remove uncertainty for the small shareholder. He added: 'When the next privatisation comes along, no one is going to believe what the government says.' The industry department denies that the prospectus has been ripped up. It points out that the offer document said the 25-year authorisation could be revoked on various grounds including 'certain provisions of general competition law'. Also, it is not clear how worried Sid really is. Mr Paul Killik, a stockbroker who specialises in popular shares, said yesterday that he had heard nothing at all from Sid. 'He's utterly oblivious,' he said. 'Most people have simply tucked their shares away.' Mr Killik points out that British Gas shares still offer an attractive 5.5 per cent yield, but anyone seeking capital gains would do better to sell and go to another sector. Sid paid 135p for his shares in 1986. This year they hit a high of 361p, but the monopoly decision knocked them hard, pushing them down to 333p this week. Yesterday they recovered 3p to close at 336p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- China's judges launched  their own forums here today with the establishment of the China  Association of Judges (CAJ) and the China Association of Women  Judges (CAWJ).    President of the Supreme People's Court Ren Jianxin was  elected the CAJ chairman and the court's Vice-President Ma Yuan  heads the CAWJ.    China now has over 156,000 judges, including 23,000 women  judges.    The two associations will carry out theoretical research,  and  facilitate exchanges and co-operation among judges from all  parts of the country and at various levels.    They will also act as a bridge between judges on the Chinese  mainland and their counterparts in foreign countries as well as  in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao.</p>

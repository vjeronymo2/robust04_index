			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] According to a report dated 30 May from the  front line, the combined forces of the Royal Government have  already reached the Chi Neang point on Route 10, 18 km east of  Pailin. No clashes have been reported, and the government  troops, which seem to be very vigilant at this point in time,  have not yet overrun the area.    The report further says that the plateau Phnum Veng on Route  10 near Chineang is also being surrounded by government forces.    A senior Army officer said the government forces' advance  has  not encountered any heavy attacks and that the smooth headway  indicated that the Khmer Royal Armed Forces are on the alert and  have never forgotten their recent shameful defeats.

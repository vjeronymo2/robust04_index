			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [24 Mar RENMIN RIBAO Editorial: "Resolutely Give Top </F> Priority to Agricultural Work This Year"]    [Text] Beijing, 23 Mar (XINHUA) -- No sooner had the "two  meetings" concluded than the CPC Central Committee called a  rural work conference to give top priority to agricultural work.  This fully demonstrates the high importance that the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council attach to agricultural  and rural work.    Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy.  Handling well this year's agricultural and rural work is of  particularly pressing and practical significance. China truly  needs a stable social and economic environment since this year  is an important year for implementing the "Decision" adopted at  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and  for establishing a socialist market economy. Social and  economic stability depends first of all on the development of  agriculture and stability in rural areas, on the abundant supply  of sideline agricultural products, and on achieving market  stability. Past experience shows that whenever agricultural  development exists, stability prevails in rural areas, stability  exists in the entire society, and reform and development can be  smoothly promoted. Therefore, we should make every effort to  promote agricultural and rural work. Only when the agricultural  base is consolidated and when the rural areas enjoy stability  can there be stability in the entire country, can the reform be  smoothly carried out, and can the economy develop in a  sustained, rapid, and healthy manner.    Last year, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council  adopted a number of important measures whose major aims were to  solve such problems as the issuance of "IOU's" in the  procurement of sideline agricultural products and the problem of  excessive burdens on farmers. Those measures have protected and  mobilized farmers' enthusiasm for farming and have been  instrumental in helping maintain excellent development momentum  for agriculture and the rural economy. At present, the general  situation in rural areas is good. But we should also know that  we cannot afford to overlook some problems and contradictions in  agriculture and rural areas. They include: low efficiency in the  production of grain; difficulties in fulfilling this year's  production plan for such staple agricultural products as grain  and cotton; slow growth in farmers' incomes; and the widening  income gap between urban and rural citizens. Therefore, the  entire party and all levels of government departments should  attach great importance to these problems and contradictions and  adopt timely measures to solve them.    It should be pointed out that definite goals for  agricultural and rural development have been set, and various  concrete principles and policies have been adopted. The key now  lies in effectively implementing them. At present it is  necessary to implement every concrete measure in a step-by-step  manner in line with arrangements worked out by the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council, to promote this year's rural  economic development, to increase the income of farmers, and to  bring social stability to rural areas. This is the basic task  of this year's agricultural and rural work. First, we must give  priority to doing a good job in grain, cotton, and edible oil  production and in the "shopping basket" project; we must  increase the effective supply of agricultural sideline products;  and we must contribute to the alleviation of inflation pressure.  We must maintain stable grain production growth because grain  is a special commodity and has an important bearing on stability  in a country. In a big country like ours, we must strive to  achieve self-sufficiency in grain production and attain a rough  balance between supply and demand in grain. Major grain growing  regions should do a good job on grain production. Developed  coastal regions should also strive to prevent a further  shrinkage in the acreage of land available for grain production  and stabilize grain output and the grain inventory. All levels  of governments should attach great importance to cotton  production and try for a big increase in cotton production this  year. Mayors of all large and medium-sized cities should  include the "shopping basket project" on their major agenda and  ensure an abundant supply of non staple food and price  stability. In addition, effective measures should be worked out  to promote comprehensive development of the rural economy and to  bring about a large increase in the incomes of farmers. We must  take the resolute step of developing high-output, high-quality,  and high-efficiency farming. On the premise of stabilizing  grain and cotton production, great efforts should be made to  promote multiple farming operations and to comprehensively  develop farming, forestry, animal husbandry, agricultural  sideline products, and fisheries. The development of diverse  forms of secondary and tertiary industries, including  agricultural sideline product processing, should be greatly  encouraged. At the same time, support should be given to  developing a number of "locomotive" enterprises and businesses  that integrate trading, industrial, and agricultural operations.  Separate guidance should be given to village and township  enterprises according to their lines of operation. Particular  attention should be given to supporting the development of  village and township enterprises in central and western regions  of China. We must continuously do a good job in lightening the  burdens on farmers and earnestly implement the "State Plan to  Move 80 Million People Out of Poverty in Seven Years."    Promoting further development of the rural economy requires  the main line of deepening reform to be firmly upheld. The  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the  CPC Central Committee's rural work conference last October have  made arrangements for that. Localities should proceed from  reality, boldly explore, and carry out promotional work  vigorously. On the premise of a stable policy, we need to  improve the basic operating system in rural areas; give vigorous  support to, offer correct guidance to, sum up the experiences  of, standardize, and healthily develop the various shareholding  and cooperation systems. It is necessary to further reform the  grain procurement system; enhance the state's macro regulation  and control over grain; ensure grain supply; prevent big  upheavals in grain price; deepen reform of the financial system  as well as the supply and marketing system in rural areas; and  promote development of the rural economy.    The strengthening of agricultural status and the development  of the rural economy are inseparable from the importance  attached to them by various levels of leading organs. The  latest CPC Central Committee rural work conference has defined  responsibility and decided that in assessing future performance,  agricultural and rural work will be made an important criterion  in evaluating the political performance of all levels of leading  cadres. This is an important measure to further enhance the  leadership of all levels of party committees and governments for  agricultural and rural work. Tackling agricultural and rural  work requires not only dealing with economic development, but  also grassroots organization building, spiritual civilization  building, and comprehensive management of social order. It is  our belief that the entire party and society will surely help  bring about a new and prosperous phase in our country's rural  areas through their joint efforts.</p>

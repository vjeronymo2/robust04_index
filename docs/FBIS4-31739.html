			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by S.A., J.S.: "Businessmen and Experts on `Strategy </F> for Poland'; Not at Any Cost"]    [Text] So far, privatization has brought uncertainty  to mind. In order to gain social approval for ownership  transformations, privatization must be done with society in  mind. So "Strategy for Poland" also envisages the establishment  of social protection for the workforce of those enterprises  being sold to foreign investors, said Professor Jan  Monkiewicz, a secretary of state in the Office of the Council of  Ministers, and an associate of Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz  Kolodko. According to a statement issued at a press conference,  the Polish Business Council [PRB] has received with satisfaction  the governmental Strategy for Poland program. Its provisions are  largely in agreement with the views of PRB which has demanded  such a document for two years now.    One cannot strive at privatization at any cost, by  applying the principle of the state getting rid of a burden.  Investors must have the financial means for investment and  development. In addition, Jan Monkiewicz added, we  want to maintain the workforces' influence over the fate of the  companies where they work.    Placing the private and state-owned sectors on an equal  footing in terms of their rights is an equally important issue  relative to the functioning of enterprises. This is to  facilitate transforming state-owned enterprises into companies  based on Commercial Law. The transformation will have yet  another dimension, as well: At the point that Commercial Law  companies are established, employee boards will disappear since  the Code of Commerce does not provide for such boards in  enterprises. So there will be a clear division of  authority between trade unions, and the companies' governing  boards, J.Monkiewicz explained.    When asked how fighting inflation will be reconciled with  fighting unemployment, Dr. Jerzy Hausner replied that according  to the Strategy, the inflation level will be decreasing faster  than the unemployment rate. The program envisages that  unemployment will continue to rise both this year and next.  According to J. Monkiewicz, high employment would not increase  inflation, providing the work week is cut short and salaries are  reduced in accordance with the work done. Such methods  have been applied in Germany among others. But for that, one  needs first of all social consent, said Professor J.  Monkiewicz.    The lifting of popiwek [enterprise tax on above-normative  pay] is to serve the goal of changing the situation of  enterprises. In the view of experts, popiwek does not guard  against anything but only serves as a bargaining chip. Salary  negotiations should be conducted at the level of individual  enterprises while the state may just be an umpire. Some  method of salary regulation is applied everywhere, said  Professor Danuta Hibner. In Poland, one receives a penalty  for raising salaries. The new element will be the possibility  of awarding enterprises for observing rules, instead of applying  punishment.    The establishment of a Treasury Ministry has already been  decided. It will take over ownership supervision over  state-owned enterprises. Work on a new law on the State  Treasury is taking place in several different places. The  discussions are about the functions and powers of the future  Treasury Ministry, Professor J. Monkiewicz stated. We  still do not know at this stage when the law will become  effective.    PRB has noted with satisfaction the governmental Strategy  for  Poland program. Its basic assumptions are largely in agreement  with the views of PRB which has demanded such a document for two  years now.    In our view, the Strategy identifies the problems that  our economy is facing very well, both in the microscale and the  macroscale. When we hear views that the program is unrealistic,  we disagree. The problem is whether we know how to consolidate  all the means in order to implement the program, said PRB  Chairman Jan Wejchert.    According to PRB, the program's success will depend on the  speedy implementation of the detailed provisions that will  enable a speeding up of the rate of privatization, and the  development of the capital market. The program's success will  also depend on making bold changes in the tax system which would  render the system clearly investment-oriented and  exports-oriented. There must be a system of installment-based  privatization procedure, a consolidated balance of payments for  holdings, and a Guarantee Privatization and Development Fund.  PRB is also preparing a proposal to introduce a system of  breaks using investments as their legal basis; it would also  include establishing new jobs and exports measures. According  to PRB, implementing the measures being proposed by it, along  with other measures mentioned in the Strategy, would result in  establishing over 500,000 new jobs over four years.  Maintaining existing jobs is as important as the  establishment of new ones. The constantly changing legal  provisions concerning taxes and customs, are a reason behind the  fall in the number of jobs, says PRB Deputy Chairman  Zbigniew Niemczycki.    In his view, Poland still does not have the kind of  investment dynamism that businessmen would like to see. Capital  is being invested only in those places where there is a  motivation for doing so.</p>

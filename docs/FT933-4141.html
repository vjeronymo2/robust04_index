			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Japan's parties see donations fall JAPANESE political parties said they raised Y173.9bn (Pounds 1.08bn) last year, but this is believed to be only a fraction of their real wealth, writes William Dawkins. The figure, in a home affairs ministry annual survey, is about a third of the actual amount raised, estimated Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and government spokesman. It does not cover illicit funding, which the new government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa has pledged to attack with strict controls on party financing, to be tabled before the end of the year. Also, political parties are obliged to disclose only the source of donations worth more than Y1m. The figure last year represented a 6.3 per cent fall from the record Y185.7bn in 1991, and the first fall for five years. This is in part a reflection of the impact of the economic slowdown on corporate donors' generosity and in part the fact that there was only one election last year, for the upper house of parliament, after several years of much political activity. Nearly half of the total is due to donations, the rest from parties' own fund-raising activities, such as tickets for lavish receptions, subscriptions to party publications or membership fees. Mr Hosokawa's own Japan New Party, founded in May 1992, put in a spirited start on the fund-raising trail by raising Y609m in the same year. The seven coalition members raised Y84.9bn, said the report. Each coalition members' fund raising power pales beside that of the Communist party, which told the ministry that it raised Y33.6bn last year. That is compared with Y25.5bn raised last year by the LDP, the former government party and many times larger than the Communists. The Communists' income is unusually high because it includes earnings from its popular newspaper, Akahata (Red Flag). The LDP figure is deceptively low because it does not include funds raised by the party's factions.</p>

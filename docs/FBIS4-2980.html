			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China's most  developed county -- Wuxi, Jiangsu Province -- today opened a  four-day trade fair in Hong Kong today, offering 50 projects  involving about 100 million U.S. dollars.    The projects include an iron and steel plant, a power  station, super markets, a gas plant, a sewage disposal factory  and land releasing.    This is the second time Wuxi has given a trade fair in the  territory since last year.    Wuxi is claimed to be the no. 1 county among China's top 100  counties for two successive years because of its economic and  social development.    In 1993, its GNP was 12.54 billion yuan (about 1.44 billion  U.S. dollars), with a total industrial and agricultural output  value of 48.024 billion yuan (about 5.52 billion U.S. dollars)  and its exports were valued at 6.6 billion yuan (about 0.76  billion U.S. dollars), ranking first in China.</p>

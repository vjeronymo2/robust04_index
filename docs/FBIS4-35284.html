			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces, today visited the Tariq Bin-Ziyad Camp. He was welcomed  by the camp's commander, officers, NCO's, and soldiers.  [passage omitted]    In an address, the brother chairman said that he was  extremely happy to meet with the camp's officers, NCO's, and  soldiers. He congratulated them and through them all valiant  officers, NCO's, and soldiers of the Armed Forces on all combat  axes as they wage the most honorable national battle to defend  the homeland's unity and the unity's future. He said: I  congratulate our people throughout the Yemeni homeland on the  great and successive victories that have been scored and are  being scored by our valiant troops, the soldiers of unity and  constitutional legitimacy, against the gang of apostasy and  secession which wanted to dismember the Yemeni homeland in  return for a handful of dirty money.    Addressing the officers, NCO's, and soldiers, the brother  chairman said: Your brothers on the combat axes are now waging  the final and decisive battle against the gang of apostasy and  secession and their supporters. He said this gang is an agent  tool that takes delight in subservience and betraying the  homeland. Backed by extensive popular support, our valiant  Armed Forces continue to bring the dens of this gang under their  iron grip to clear the homeland of their filth.    The brother chairman and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces added: I am here today to bring you the glad tidings of  the victory and to express appreciation for you and for every  soldier, officer, and NCO. Thanks to your faith, unwavering  resolve, and firm positions, you are recording epics of glory  and victory for the Yemeni people's will to maintain unity and  democracy. It is the will of the faithful, sincere men who  never yield in the face of ordeals and disasters and who are  defending the most precious gains of the Yemeni revolution and  the Yemeni people, namely, unity and democracy. You are  defending constitutional legitimacy and all the sublime  principles and values of our one Yemeni people and their eternal  unity.    The brother chairman and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces said: I convey to you and to the masses of our Yemeni  people the congratulations of the fighters who are firmly  advancing toward the last strongholds and dens of the  secessionist gang in valiant Aden to purge it of their filth.  Your valiant troops are also marching toward Hadhramaut to  liquidate the remainder of the gang, led by agent, treasonous  criminal 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    The brother chairman said: Congratulations to you in the  Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, as you wage or  contribute to this national battle, the battle of unity,  democracy, and defending the homeland; the battle of honor,  heroism, self- denial, and dignity. Glory to all the righteous  martyrs. May they have God's mercy and forgiveness in the  Garden of Eden. Be sure that God is on your side and that our  people back you. March from one victory to another. May God  support you. Peace be upon you. [passage omitted]</p>

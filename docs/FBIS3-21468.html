L'OPINION, citing official sources, claims that acts of  intimidation are being perpetrated against tax authorities in  the wilaya of Algiers, according to the official press agency  APS. The intimidation campaign is being waged by means of  threats against tax collectors, demanding that they quit  collecting taxes beginning 17 February.    It goes without saying that the terrorists hope with these  threats--which some are too frightened to withstand--to bring an  already reeling state to its knees. Especially since, according  to unconfirmed reports, some municipal tax authorities take the  threats dead seriously. This is the case, for example, with a  certain fiscal entity in uptown Algiers where several  resignations reportedly have been submitted following receipt of  such threats.    All this attests to the urgent need for the state to throw  all its weight against the latest in this seemingly endless  series of terrorist challenges.    In that regard, official sources quoted by APS have vowed  that: "the destabilization efforts will not succeed in  interfering with the operations of the tax authorities, and the  authors of these threats will soon be identified and brought to  justice." The same sources add that tax authorities, "with the  steadfast support of their conscientious and devoted employees,"  intend to continue their "valiant struggle against tax fraud and  evasion and their efforts to improve collections of imposts and  taxes that belong to the nation."    Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that these threats have  come just as the tax collectors were launching an ambitious  campaign against tax fraud and evasion, which has cost the  Treasury some 5 trillion (yes, five trillion!) centimes.    One can imagine the importance of such a sum at a time when  the country is facing unprecedented financial needs. According  to APS, the lost collections would be enough to build 75,000  housing units. In other words, such a vast sum could provide  shelter to more than 600,000 Algerians who lack any decent sort  of housing.    Given all these facts, one cannot fail to ask why the  terrorists (and their hidden backers) have chosen this  particular time to attack the tax sector? The answer is obvious  to many observers: In addition to undermining the authority of  the state, the terrorists are trying to protect their own  channels of funding.    In fact, the 5 trillion in lost revenue must be sought  within  the parasitic informal sector, the terrorists' principal  domestic source of financing. The linkage between smugglers,  speculators, and terrorists has been proved many times over in  raids on various terrorist cells and in trials of individual  terrorists. At the same time, by acting in this fashion the  terrorists are trying to apply on a grand scale the racket they  are already practicing in small localities on the south side of  Algiers. Their other objective over the medium and longer term  is to prevent implementation of serious economic reforms, since  they realize a market economy cannot be built without a modern,  proactive, and above all effective tax service.    In light of all these facts, it seems necessary to emphasize  the importance and gravity of this new challenge. Shortly after  now-deceased president Mohamed Boudiaf returned to Algeria, one  of his confidants said the state's authority could be gauged by  its ability to enforce the highway laws. Today, it must also  defend its power to tax.</p>

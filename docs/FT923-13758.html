			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Markets: Another fine mess you've got us into - London Markets IT'S ALL your fault. You, the great British consumer, were supposed to lift the economy out of recession by pouring all that cash you have been stockpiling into new cars, houses and consumer goods. Turn to the 'How To Spend It' page immediately and do your duty. Those readers who are still with us may know exactly what went wrong with the economic recovery. It takes confidence to rush out and spend money on flim-flams and confidence is just what consumers are short of right now. Any spare cash is going to pay off existing debts rather than run up new ones. Government statistics released this week showed that consumers repaid Pounds 146m of their credit card and finance house debt in the three months to May. The rate of repayment has fallen a bit, as the graph shows. That could be taken to mean consumers are beginning to get less worried about their debts  -or that they are so hard up they cannot even bring down their credit card debt any more. Retail sales are still looking poor. At least 'top people' in the service of the public will be better off. Their pay rises are being limited to 4 per cent, but the inflation rate, announced yesterday, is only 3.9 per cent. All those judges and generals enjoying a real increase in their incomes will, one feels sure, do their bit for Britain. Three months ago you could ask a selection of economists when gross domestic product numbers would turn positive, and a good proportion would give the answer 'this quarter'. With consumer spending accounting for about two-thirds of the economy, many wonder if the upturn will even come this year. That makes the third false dawn the stock market has had to cope with in the last 18 months. The post-election jump in share prices has been reversed. The mood in the market is gloomy, even though the FT-SE 100 index is only down 6.3 points over the week, to 2,490.8. As well as having no good news from the UK economy, the market is getting no help from Wall Street or Germany either. British consumers are not just failing to buy houses, cars and goods. The retail investor is not buying shares either, judging by the poor response met by companies launching themselves on the stock market. Yesterday the public offer by MFI Furniture Group - worth Pounds 157.5m - closed undersubscribed. The final number of applications has yet to be announced, but it is fair to assume that the institutions who underwrote the offer will be taking a large proportion of it. Earlier in the week Anglian Group, the double glazing company, saw only 6 per cent of the shares it offered to the public taken up. Investors put in bids for Pounds 2.7m worth of shares out of a public offer of Pounds 44.1m. Wednesday was the first day of dealings in shares of The Telegraph, whose flotation the week before was less than one-third taken up by public investors. The shares ended their first day at 283p, 42p down from the 325p offer price. At that price some analysts said the shares were cheap, and by yesterday's close they were 293p. It is not just retail investors, though. Institutional investors are also cutting down on shares and taking a look at bonds again. All over the City asset allocation committees are concluding that gilt-edged stock is a better bet than shares. This might seem curious as the government's borrowing requirement is going to be so high this year that there will be a flood of gilts being issued. One might suppose with such huge supply that investors would be cautious. But then, when the government needs to sell so much stock it must make it look attractive - rather like privatisations. Low inflation makes the hedging characteristics of equities less important, while dividend cuts by companies emphasise the security of the high yield on gilts. It is also worth remembering that investors would have been better off keeping their money in cash or bonds rather than shares over the last five years. News from the corporate front this week has reinforced the feeling that consumers just are not consuming. The likes of Dixons, the electrical retailer, and Rank Organisation, the bingo to Butlins group, see no lightening of the gloom. Albert Fisher, the fresh produce company, bemoaned a glut of food and falling prices - surely one piece of good news for their customers - and saw its shares plunge 25p to 41p on Thursday, closing yesterday at 39p. With the interim results season opening shortly, there is likely to be yet more bad news from companies. Certainly stockbrokers are downgrading many more profit forecasts than they are upgrading. But it is not uniformly black. The regional electricity companies do appear able to extract money from consumers, but then it helps to be a monopoly supplier with a captive market. At least Seeboard, which covers the south east of England, has the grace to give some of the profits back to its customers, through a Pounds 10 rebate. It must also be encouraging for Abbey National, the building society turned bank, to know that 390,000 of its customers are so well off that they can afford not to claim 39m free shares, worth Pounds 108.4m at yesterday's closing price of 278p, that they were due as part of the company's 1989 flotation. If only they could find them they could draw up a mailing list which others would clamour to buy. But perhaps the best indicator of consumer confidence comes from Eurocamp, the camping holidays specialist. At one and the same time it claims to have an upmarket clientele and cheaper holidays than many package tour groups. Its bookings are more than 15 per cent up this summer. The ABC1 classes have discovered the joys of sleeping under canvas.</p>

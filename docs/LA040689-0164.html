			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WINNING PIANIST;  </P> <P> FOCUS ON GIVING A GOOD PERFORMANCE -- PLUS PERSEVERANCE -- PAYS OFF THE SECOND  TIME AROUND FOR 19-YEAR-OLD COMPETITOR  </P> <P> Winning was easier the second time around for 19-year-old pianist David  Andruss.  </P> <P> Last year, Andruss entered the eighth annual Young Keyboard Artists Assn. West  Coast International Piano Competition and made it to the finals but wasn't able  to place.  </P> <P> This year, he took both first place in the Concerto Division, winning a 7-foot  Young Chang grand piano valued at $15,000, and first place in Division 6, for  entrants ages 18 to 20, for which he pocketed $500. In all, more than 300  musicians competed in six divisions in the March 19-25 event at Chapman College  in Orange.  </P> <P> What made the difference?  </P> <P> "I attended the association's summer institute," Andruss said in a recent  interview. "I learned a lot about competitions, about what it means to become a  performing artist and the work behind it all."  </P> <P> But above that, he credits studying with Malcolm Hamilton at USC, where he  enrolled in 1987.  </P> <P> "It seems like everything I've heard from the time I started studying with  Dottie Nix (in Orange) has all been a piece of advice here and a piece there,  and I haven't really understood how they fit together.  </P> <P> "After I came back this year to USC, Malcolm Hamilton helped me (take) the  information I've been getting from all these other sources and put it together.  . . .  </P> <P> "Where I used to learn the notes and get tips on interpretation, now I'm more  able to take a piece and see what it's about using the analytical skills I've  learned at the university, and apply those principles and make my own  interpretations."  </P> <P> He stressed: "It hasn't restricted me in terms of interpretation. It's opened  up my musical ideas."  </P> <P> Andruss was born in Covina, grew up in Placentia and, in 1987, moved to  Anaheim, from which he commutes to USC.  </P> <P> "My mother tells me that I was getting up at the piano around 3 years old,  trying to pick up things my brothers and sisters were playing," he said. "I  started lessons when I was 4. I've been taking lessons ever since."  </P> <P> Fourth-born among the siblings, Andruss has one brother and three sisters. Of  the others, only his youngest sister, a 17-year-old soprano, is pursuing music  professionally, studying at Fullerton College.  </P> <P> "I always loved to play and practice," Andruss said. "But in my senior year I  really got serious about it. My teacher, Dottie Nix, started training me for  the things I would have to do to really begin playing the piano professionally.  Before then, it had been a matter of fun."  </P> <P> Under her tutelage, he began entering competitions and waking up to the  realities of better competitors.  </P> <P> "I heard others who were as good as if not better than I was, so I had a goal  to look up to," he said.  </P> <P> He placed first in a 1986 Musical Arts Club competition, an event at Cal State  Fullerton open only to Orange County residents. Other small awards followed.  </P> <P> Andruss was cagey in his strategy, choosing the firepower Prokofiev First.  </P> <P> "It's really one of my favorite concertos and also an excellent competition  piece," he said. "This was a one-movement concerto competition, and the First  is a chance to play the entire one movement continually.  </P> <P> "In a sense, I get four movements in one with this concerto."  </P> <P> For the Senior Division, he learned two new pieces: the Overture to Bach's  Partita in D and the first movement of Beethoven's Sonata No. 4.  </P> <P> "I spent 20 hours a week practicing the solos, in addition to school work," he  said.  </P> <P> Andruss said he felt he was up against challenging competitors at the recent  contest, but he confessed that he didn't hear many of the others play.  </P> <P> "That makes me too nervous," he said. "After I play, then I can go and listen  to the others."  </P> <P> The day of the finals was grueling for the young contestants: Andruss competed  in the senior division during the day, then come back in the evening for the  concerto finals.  </P> <P> "That's a tough battle," he said. "I was so exhausted. I went home to relax  before coming back to play for the concerto. I tried to take a nap," he said,  laughing.  </P> <P> But he did have a change in attitude to help him. "It's always been  nerve-wracking before, going in thinking, how do I have to play to win the  prize? But my goal has changed a little bit. Malcolm has helped me. I go in now  trying to make music. . . .  </P> <P> "This was the first time I could go in and think, 'What do I need to do to make  a good performance?' That was the goal this time. I was thrilled. I was so  happy with the way I played."  </P> <P> He is not letting winning the awards go to his head, however.  </P> <P> "I'm not really sure what (winning) does for me, to be truthful," he said. "It  feels wonderful. But at the same time I'm not sure what this means.  </P> <P> "The best thing for me to do is go right back to work, and if opportunities  come as a result of this, I'll be there and ready to take them.  </P> <P> "I can't sit back and relax and think, 'Look what I've done.' If I do that,  then this is really worthless."  </P> <P> Andruss plans to compete in the Young Keyboard Artists Assn. East Coast  International Competition, to be held June 26 through July 2 in Winter Park,  Fla.  </P> <P> "I think it will be a lot tougher," he said. "There will be a lot of people  from the East Coast, maybe even from the Juilliard (School of Music) prep  school and maybe even Juilliard students because it's open to 20-year-olds.  I've got my work cut out for me."  </P></p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US exchanges go to market with commodity baskets - Index-based futures contracts being developed for trading in Chicago THE WORLD'S two largest futures exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, may have built their massive trading volumes on financial futures, but they are about to take a step back toward traditional, physical commodities. The return path for the two exchanges will be futures contracts based on commodity price indices composed exclusively of physical market prices for products such as soyabeans, copper, live cattle and crude oil. The CME will be first in to bat with futures on the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI). Mr Jack Sandner, the CME chairman, says that the exchange plans to launch the contract by the end of July. He is convinced that the investing world will be keen to trade an index of major commodities that has a good record of anticipating the inflationary cycle. Goldman Sachs, the big Wall Street investment bank, started the index only a year ago, in May 1991. But, thanks in part to Goldman's international prominence, it has quickly gained market recognition. The index was developed to offer investors a product having a low correlation with stocks and bonds. Goldman's market analysts believe that interest in the index will be encouraged over the next few years by a widespread recovery in commodity prices from the recent historic lows. The GSCI is composed of 18 physical commodities - wheat, maize, soyabeans, cotton, sugar, coffee, cocoa, crude oil, unleaded gasoline, heating oil, live cattle, live hogs, aluminium, copper, gold, zinc, platinum and silver - weighted by production. The weighting is based on United Nations production data and all weights are a five-year average, lagged three years. The index base is 1970. Because it is production weighted and production is influenced by consumption, the index is more sensitive to changes in real economic conditions than an equally weighted index. The CME's future will be cash settled to an index price of the nearby futures contracts of which it is composed. The trading unit will be Dollars 250 times the GSCI, with contract months of February, April, June, October and December. Trading hours, in Chicago time, will be 7:20 am to 2:15 pm. The price increment will be a tenth of an index point or Dollars 25 a contract. The CBoT is developing an international commodity index, also composed of only physical prices, in co-operation with the Commodities Research Bureau, a division of Knight Ridder Financial. Neither the CBoT nor CRB will disclose what exactly will be in their new index, but they say it will be production weighted and composed of 18 commodities traded on seven US and foreign exchanges. The CRB has had an index since 1957, which is the most widely known and the most widely followed in commodity trading. That index today is composed of 21 equally weighted commodities - cattle, cocoa, coffee, copper, cotton, crude oil, gold, heating oil, live hogs, lumber, maize, oats, orange juice, platinum, pork bellies, silver, soyabean meal, soyabean oil, soyabeans sugar and wheat. A future based on it has traded at the New York Futures Exchange since 1986, but not with a great deal of success. Its peak trading volume year was 1988, when 205,951 contracts changed hands. But volume then dwindled and by last year had declined to just 61,185 contracts. The CBoT is awaiting regulatory approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US watchdog, to proceed with the contract. No time frame for a launch is yet set. Despite the enthusiasm of both exchanges for commodity index futures, the NYFE's rather dismal record with the CRB index would seem to raise doubts about the prospects for such a product. A few important differences may, however, give the Chicago exchanges a better shot. The indices will be production weighted and both exchanges are large, liquid markets compared to the tiny NYFE. The CME may in addition have a few advantages over its old rival, the CBoT. The GSCI has market recognition and the gleam of a big Wall Street firm to it. While the original CRB index enjoys market recognition, the new international CRB index is an unknown. The GSCI is completely and easily investible - that is one can buy the separate contracts underlying the index - within the US and in the same time zone. The CBoT's global CRB index will include contracts traded on foreign exchanges in different time zones. While the CBoT has not even yet unveiled its new index, the CME has begun to market its product vigorously already. It has even run advertisements in the Wall Street Journal offering special permits to attract new traders. Furthermore, a suspicion that the CBoT's contract is another 'me-too' product may not help it. The CBoT announced its intentions to begin a new index future long after the CME's plan on the GSCI was known. The two exchanges have historically competed against each other by introducing similar contracts, though usually only one truly takes off. And sometimes both fail.</p>

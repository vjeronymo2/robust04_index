Talbott was named to replace Clifton Wharton, Clinton's  highest-ranking black official, who resigned on November 8 last  year under pressure after eight months of intense criticism of  Clinton's foreign policy team for the handling of the Bosnia,  Somalia and Haiti issues.    The vote to confirm Talbott was 66-31.    After the confirmation, Talbott will enter a key  policy-making circle at the U.S. State department, responsible  for overall management of the department.    An expert on Russia and a longtime friend of President  Clinton, Talbott was named last April as an ambassador-at-large  to the former Soviet Union.    Talbott, a native of Dayton, Ohio state of mid-west U.S.,  graduated from Yale University in 1968, and began his journalist  career in 1971 when he was assigned to Eastern Europe as a  correspondent for the U.S. "TIME" magazine.    Among the most famous works he has done is the translation  and editing of the three-volume memoir of the late Soviet leader  Nikita Khrushchev.</p>

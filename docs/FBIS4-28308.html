He said:    We sharply denounce this barbaric bombing, regarding it as a  crude encroachment upon the sovereignty of Lebanon and a grave  challenge wrecking the Mid-East peace process.    It is due to the unjustifiable pro-Israeli policy of the  United States that the military offensive of Israel on Lebanon  has not come to an end. This was made plain by the attitude  taken by the United States toward the recent bombing case.    The United States, while crying for "sanctions" against the  DPRK by bringing to the United Nations Security Council its  "nuclear issue," which is not a matter for argument, as often as  it pleases, connives at the military outrages of Israel which  deserve denunciation and sanctions and tries to hush them up,  ignoring the just demand of many countries.    If the United States is really concerned for world peace and  security, it must not unreasonably take issue with our peaceful  nuclear activities but pay primary attention to checking the  aggressive acts of such countries as Israel, which are virtually  disturbing world peace.    The Israeli authorities must stop the aggressive acts  against  Arab nations and withdraw from the occupied Arab territories  without delay.    Our people will as ever express firm solidarity with the  Arab  people in their just struggle to resolve the Mid-East problem in  a fair and peaceful way.</p>

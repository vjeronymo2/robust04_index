			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Venezuela bank chief quits Mrs Ruth de Krivoy, president of Venezuela's central bank, resigned last night after facing heavy pressure from the government of President Rafael Caldera to change the bank's monetary policy and force reductions in interest rates. Mr Omar Bello, the first vice-president at the central bank, will temporarily replace Mrs de Krivoy, who is an internationally respected economist. She was viewed as playing an important stabilising role in Venezuela's public sector. Mrs de Krivoy's resignation represents a serious blow to the image of the Caldera government, which began a five-year term in February. Beset by economic and financial problems, the Caldera administration has developed policies aimed at placing it in the middle ground between free market economics and heavy government intervention. As part of this programme, the government recently began pressing the central bank to force domestic interest rates downward even though inflation remains high. Mrs de Krivoy apparently rejected these pressures, saying in her letter of resignation that she could not carry out policies that violated economic principles. Mrs De Krivoy insisted on the need to maintain a tight policy to stop speculation in the money markets, to fight inflation and to protect foreign reserves that have fallen because of a banking crisis. Authorities have spent about Dollars 5.9bn - the equivalent of half the 1994 budget - to support banks. About Dollars 2.7bn was spent to bail out Banco Latino, previously Venezuela's second biggest bank, which was taken over by the government after failing to meet financial commitments.</p>

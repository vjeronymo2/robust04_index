			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Management (The Growing Business): Lower overheads and increased productivity: Subcontracting - Charles Batchelor on the benefits of off-site production Elf Holdings, a Slough-based company which supplies audio equipment to schools, is well into a programme to run down its own manufacturing operations and to subcontract the work to Remploy, which provides manufacturing services to a wide range of businesses. Elf will cease manufacturing at its Brighton factory and hand over responsibility for making products such as cassette recorders and public address systems to Remploy's factory in Islington, north London. Some of the Brighton employees will switch to repair and service work but the overall result will be the loss of 10 jobs, reducing Elf's workforce to 22 people. Chris Crump, managing director of Elf, expects that the move to subcontracting will reduce production costs and relieve it of the burden of coping with an uneven order flow. (Remploy produces for many companies so it can control its own workload.) Elf, which has sales of Pounds 2m, will assemble kits of components and deliver them to Remploy though it may later arrange for its suppliers to deliver directly to the subcontractor. Crump, who joined Elf a year ago to ginger up a flagging performance, says he considered moving production to Slough but this would still have required him to make a judgment on the size of the workforce he would need to meet fluctuating demand. Sourcing products from the Far East was not an option either because schools frequently require modifications to the standard items Elf supplies. The complexity of many products has meant that large companies in areas such as automobile manufacture and engineering have long moved to extensive subcontracting of specialised components. Increasingly, smaller companies are turning to subcontracting, either to reduce the cost of getting started or to bring down the overheads of a long-established activity. Small and medium-sized businesses, those employing fewer than 500 people, account for no less than 82 per cent of Remploy's customers and 61 per cent of its turnover, the company calculates. 'It is even more important for the smaller company, with its limited resources, to focus on certain activities and subcontract out the rest,' says Brian Small, managing director of Ingersoll Engineers, a Rugby-based consultancy. The present recession, which has made companies even more aware of the need to reduce costs, is providing a spur for more businesses to subcontract out parts of their operations. Manufacturing savings, together with reductions in other areas such as premises and stocks can allow businesses to finance the restructuring of their operations from their own resources, says Small. Frequently the crunch comes when a business decides it needs to modernise its production capacity. Gent, a Leicester-based manufacturer of fire detection and alarm equipment, took a hard look at its metal fabrication shop when it was planning a move to a new factory. 'We had lots of ancient small presses and turning machines making rings, contacts, even screws,' says Andrew Robinson, managing director. 'We realised our main strength was electronics so we didn't want dirty, oily activities alongside. In addition our tooling was getting old and it would have taken a big investment to replicate.' Gent, which has sales of Pounds 24m and which forms part of RTZ Corporation, shed most of its metal fabrication activities. The buy-in value of the abandoned components was only Pounds 500,000 a year and the profit improvement was less than Pounds 100,000 but the saving in terms of the 'distraction value' to management of these peripheral activities was significant, Robinson says. But there are further considerable benefits to be gained from buying in or subcontracting parts of a company's activities: Deciding to buy in rather than make can have an important impact on the market-awareness of a company, argues Brian Small. Companies which make a fetish of manufacturing all or most of the components required are less likely to be oriented towards the needs of their customers. Small businesses may be able to improve quality control by handing over responsibility for manufacturing to a large, more sophisticated subcontractor. 'If something goes wrong Remploy's quality control can pick it up,' says Robert Belcher, managing director of Manrose Manufacturing, a supplier of domestic fans. Both Remploy and Manrose's supplier of plastic mouldings have obtained BS5750, the main UK standard for quality control, but Manrose itself has yet to qualify. Increasingly, customers are requiring suppliers to conform to this standard. A subcontractor can help a customer even out uneven order flows and hold-ups in the supply of components. Hayward Tyler Fluid Dynamics, a Luton-based manufacturer of specialised pumps, has subcontracted out fabrication and plating operations accounting for 5-10 per cent of total activities as part of a far-reaching restructuring programme. Hayward Tyler employs 250 people, down from 440, and has sales of Pounds 20m. 'This will give us flexibility,' says Roger Harrop, chief executive of Hayward Tyler and of its parent company, Sterling Fluid Systems. 'It will be easier to switch off a subcontractor than our own people.' The company's plating shop had anyway only been used for three days a month, he adds. Sub-contracting can also improve a company's cash flow. Instead of paying weekly wages to the shop floor workforce the company moves to paying the subcontractor on 30 or 60-day terms. The company can also set the cost of the subcontractor's services immediately against profits whereas investment in capital equipment usually takes place over a number of years. But the decision to subcontract out parts or even all of a business's manufacturing operations can be highly charged. Some companies believe the benefits of subcontracting outweigh the loss of total control of their activities. Others are sensitive about admitting that they are sticking their own label on someone else's product. Production specialists say that before considering whether to buy-in rather than make a particular item managers must decide which activities are core to their company's survival. High value items and products which involve confidential design features and manufacturing techniques should always be made in-house, says James Byers of Ingersoll Engineers. Stock items such as nuts, bolts, bearings and washers, or loss-makers essential to the company's range should be contracted out. In addition, managers must be prepared for a short-term disruption of production when they subcontract work out. 'We had a few teething problems in the first six months,' says Gent's Andrew Robinson. 'It was not easy to get someone else to make items which our own skilled workers had been making for 20 years.' Managers must monitor the relationship with the subcontractor very closely. One start-up business which subcontracted out the plastic injection moulding on which it depended was set back for a year when it was forced to replace a large number of products which customers returned as being faulty. 'We assumed there would be someone at the subcontractor who had an overall view of the project but there wasn't,' says the company's executive director. But the difficulties do not always lie with the subcontractor. Companies are frequently unrealistic in their forecasts of production volumes, says Edward Selby, business manager of Remploy's southern region factories. Managers sometimes misjudge the market for their product but they may also deliberately exaggerate volumes to negotiate a keen price from the subcontractor. Nor is it unknown for managers to order wildly excessive volumes of raw materials. 'If a customer thinks his product will sell for a number of years he buys a massive quantity of raw materials. If a juggernaut pulls up outside your door with three years' worth of materials it is difficult to tell the customer you can't let them in,' Selby explains. Subcontracting should not be seen as an easy way of disposing of the complexities of running a manufacturing operation, the experts warn. But properly handled it can have a significant impact on costs and on the ability of a smaller company to service its customers.</p>

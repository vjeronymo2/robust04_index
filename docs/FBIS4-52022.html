			<p>BFN     [Text] In hopes of resuming the Japan-U.S. framework trade  talks, Japanese cabinet ministers and deputy ministers will meet  their U.S. counterparts one after the other towards the latter  part of the consecutive holidays in May. Being a minority  government, the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  finds it difficult to hammer out a strong trade policy. On the  other hand, the United States is faced with the problem that  further appreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar  could have an undesirable effect on the U.S. economy. Since a  prolonged dispute could shake the very foundations of both the  Japanese and U.S. Governments, there is a possibility that both  governments may take this opportunity to try to move towards  each other.    Japanese and U.S. officials plan to meet informally, taking  advantage of international conferences they are scheduled to  attend. On 6 May, Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade  and industry, is scheduled to meet Ronald Brown, U.S. secretary  of commerce, in Warsaw. Subsequently, Sadayuki Hayashi, vice  minister for international affairs at the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI], is scheduled to meet  Joan Spero, U.S. under secretary of state (in charge of economic  affairs), during an OECD meeting in Paris to be held 9-10 May.    As a minister in the new administration in charge of the  framework trade talks, MITI Minister Hata hopes to gain U.S.  understanding by explaining the administration's intention to  promptly carry out deregulation and other plans even while its  faces difficulties in trying to work out differences between  ruling and opposition parties. During his meeting with Spero,  Hayashi is expected to listen to, among other things, specific  U.S. requests in connection with conditions for resuming  bilateral trade talks that were recently indicated by U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech.    Regarding Japan's new flexible approach, the United States  considers the approach to be "merely a temporary deferment,"  while the United States plans to "watch how Japan will now  handle the situation."    However, the U.S. Commerce Department and other government  agencies have shown growing concerns that the bilateral trade  friction may lead to depreciation of the U.S. dollar, stocks,  and securities. Thus, there are indications that in some  quarters of the U.S. Government, there are some officials  calling for reconsidering the hardline policy the United States  has taken against Japan.    As the series of meetings among Japanese and U.S. officials  are to be held under such circumstances, it is believed that  these meetings may turn out to be an opportunity in which both  Japan and the United States, while taking into consideration  their respective problems, can coordinate their opinions toward  an early resumption of the trade talks.</p>

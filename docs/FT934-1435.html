			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Markets: Dow surges on while others languish - Wall Street The good economic news keeps coming, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average keeps setting new record highs, but anxiety on Wall Street about the condition of equity markets continues to cast a shadow over the final weeks of 1993. The economic fundamentals remain positive, with this week's statistics suggesting that growth is steadily accelerating. Industrial production in November rose 0.9 per cent, a stronger than expected gain and the six straight monthly increase in the output numbers. Also, housing starts rose 3.9 per cent last month, weekly unemployment claims fell in early December, and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported that manufacturing activity in its region has been extremely robust lately. This array of confidence-boosting data propelled the Dow to an all-time high of 3,764.43 on Monday. That, however, was not as impressive as it looked. Gains in just two stocks - IBM and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing - accounted for almost half of the day's 24-point gain, and three other stocks, Alcoa, International Paper and Du Pont, contributed the rest. Moreover, while the Dow was reaching new highs, the rest of the market was languishing. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, a much broader measure of market performance, rose less than two points on Monday and remained below its record peak, while the Nasdaq composite index fell. This divergence between the large-capitalised stocks that make up the Dow and the rest of the market - in particular the indices that track the performance the shares of small-and medium-sized companies - is cause for concern among analysts. Some believe that the market has been undergoing a corrective phase for the past two months, but that it has escaped almost everyone's notice because the Dow has performed so well. Since mid-October, the Dow has climbed 3 per cent, and regularly moved into previously unexplored territory. Yet, over the same period, the S &amp; P 500 has fallen about 1 per cent, the Nasdaq composite almost 4 per cent, and the Russell 2000 index 3.5 per cent. All three remain below their all-time highs. In the past, when the Dow has continued to rally to peaks while other, broader indices have lagged, it has been the sign of an exhausted bull market. The weakness in secondary stocks has taken its toll on the market for initial public offerings, or company flotations. This week several IPOs of small, growth-oriented companies were postponed at the last minute, with underwriters citing 'unfavourable market conditions' as the reason for the hasty withdrawal. Although a rash of pulled IPOs might be viewed as evidence that the market has overreached itself (the theory being that conditions in the IPO market have deteriorated because investor accounts, already full-to-the-brim with new stock, are being much choosier about which new issues they should buy), there may be another explanation for all the postponements. The underwriting calendar, which is normally quiet at this time of the year, has remained unusually active this month, and underwriters are finding that there are simply too many IPOs for investors to handle. So companies have been shelving flotation plans, but most will probably return to the market in early 1994, when they expect demand from investors to remain strong. If a deterioration in the IPO market is not on the cards, what might be lurking around the next corner that could trigger the sharp correction in the Dow that the weakness in secondary stocks has suggested may be imminent? Perhaps a foreign political crisis? Although the Dow set a record high on Monday, it fell 50 points in the next two sessions, and traders blamed the losses on nervousness about the situation in Russia, where ultra-nationalists won a large share of the vote in last weekend's parliamentary elections. The nationalist party's leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, has pledged to rebuild Russia's armed forces, has talked of reviving the nation's expansionist ambitions and has made threatening comments about Russia's neighbours. This kind of talk makes US investors nervous, even if the far right in Russia is unlikely to hold the reins of power in the new parliament. And if developments in Russia do not trigger a panic, the situation in North Korea, which continues to make belligerent noises about South Korea, could, if it deteriorates any further, prove sufficiently disturbing to set off a stampede of selling. This may not be a particularly festive thought, but for the stock market Christmas has often been the season - the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the start of the Iran-Iraq war - of nasty external shocks.  ------------------------------------------ Monday        3764.43  +  23.76 Tuesday       3742.63  -  21.80 Wednesday     3716.92  -  25.71 Thursday      3726.14  +  09.22 Friday        3751.57  +  25.43  ------------------------------------------</p>

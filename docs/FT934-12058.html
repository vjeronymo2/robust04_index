			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Rush to invest in south-east Asia's biggest flotation: The public clamour for a stake in the Singapore Telecom privatisation INVESTORS in Singapore have been rushing to make final share applications in advance of the partial flotation next week of Singapore Telecom (ST), the island republic's post and telecommunications utility. The ST offer, billed as the largest flotation so far in south-east Asia, closes today. The government has valued ST at a minimum of SDollars 30.5bn (Pounds 12.7bn) but analysts predict that aggressive buying of ST shares could raise the company's market capitalisation to between SDollars 40bn and SDollars 50bn. 'The large amounts of foreign funds that have come into the Far Eastern markets in recent months, particularly from the US, have given confidence to domestic share buyers,' said one Singapore broker. 'But it looks like even the allocation of ST shares available to foreigners is being bought by Singaporeans. Foreign investors are watching and waiting on this one.' About 10 per cent of ST is being floated with 50 per cent of the shares reserved for Singaporeans, the bulk of them at a discount. The rest of the shares are being made available to both Singaporeans and foreigners on a tender basis. ST has a monopoly on domestic and international services from Singapore until the year 2007 and is keen to raise funds to expand overseas. ST's net income rose 9 per cent to SDollars 1bn in the year to March 31, 1993 on sales of SDollars 2.8bn. The Singapore government has been conducting an intense publicity campaign aimed at encouraging wider domestic share ownership. But there are now fears that the campaign could backfire as overly anxious Singaporean investors bid up the price of ST shares to what are considered to be unrealistic levels. The government has priced ST at SDollars 2 per share. But brokers say some Singaporeans are willing to bid more than twice that figure to ensure an allocation of shares available on a tender basis. This, it is feared, could result in a 'freak' high strike price which would then encourage Singaporeans who bought at SDollars 2 to quickly offload their shares. The strike price for the tendered portion of the ST shares is due to be announced tomorrow. Trading - which is expected to be frenetic - is due to start on Monday.</p>

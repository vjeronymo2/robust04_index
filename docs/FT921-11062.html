			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Dutch Government Bonds: Borrowing programme off to flying start THOUGH 1992 is barely five weeks old, the Dutch government has already managed to raise more than 40 per cent of its total public borrowing requirement for the year. This is thanks largely to the overwhelming success of two recent state bond issues. On Wednesday, the finance ministry's agent closed the state's 15-year, 8.25 per cent 'tap issue', after raising a total of Fl 5.5bn (Dollars 3bn). The previous Friday, a 10-year bullet bond with the same coupon - sold this time through the standard tender system - attracted successful subscriptions worth Fl 10bn. These two loans, combined with a late 1991 issue which raised a more modest Fl 2.8bn, mean the ministry has already pulled in Fl 18.3bn, or 40.3 per cent, of the 1992 PSBR of Fl 45.4bn. Analysts believe private placements have probably pushed the figure up to nearly 45 per cent. With the state's needs covered, no new state issue is expected for the time being, enabling investors to concentrate on existing state loans. The bullish sentiment that characterised the market in January augurs well for February, though sentiment has been tempered in recent days by the threat of steel industry strikes in Germany. On Friday, these worries caused the 10-year 8.25 per cent issue to close down nearly 0.20 points at 99.31, for an effective yield of 8.35 per cent, up 3 basis points from Thursday. The success of the state's 10-year and 15-year loans was due to institutional investors scrambling to buy now that Dutch interest rates  - contrary to previous expectations - seem to be heading downwards. Following January's declines in interest rates, pension funds and insurers are keen to lock into current levels before they drop even further. Foreign institutions were also active buyers, with the 15-year bond in particular helping to satisfy overseas demand for longer maturities. With Germany facing industrial strife, the guilder market is again benefiting from its reputation as a safe alternative to the D-Mark. The guilder's favour with foreign investors makes it unlikely that the Netherlands will soon issue its first Ecu-denominated state loan. Mr Wim Kok, finance minister, reiterated last week that he had no objections in principle to Ecu issues, but stressed that the time was not ripe for a Dutch debut on the Ecu stage. Though Ecu rates had recently fallen to around the levels prevailing in the guilder market, the cost of issuing Ecu loans was still higher than that of guilder-denominated bonds. 'The success of the past two state issues, which raised more than Fl 14bn in the space of a single week, shows that guilder-denominated bonds have not lost any of their attractiveness,' he noted.</p>

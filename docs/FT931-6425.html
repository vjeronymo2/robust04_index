			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Suharto promises to relax 'iron grip' PRESIDENT Suharto of Indonesia yesterday opened the national assembly with a promise to relax the 'iron grip' of government. 'We have been enjoying dynamic national stability for more than a quarter of a century. Such stability cannot be maintained by an iron hand, regardless of its strength,' he told the People's Consultative Assembly. Government critics, who say the assembly itself reflects the government's intolerance of democracy, greeted the speech with cynicism. The 1,000-member assembly, which meets once every five years to elect president and vice-president and discuss state policy, is certain to elect the unopposed President Suharto for his sixth five-year term. General Try Sutrisno, who last month retired as head of the armed forces, is expected to be elected vice-president. Although the assembly is the nation's highest body, it has never used its power to initiate legislation and remains, critics say, beholden to the president. Its membership consists of 500 members of the lower parliament - which is dominated by Golkar, the governing party, and representatives of the armed forces - and a further 500 people directly appointed by the government. The government also dissuades the assembly from using its right to vote, arguing that agreement by consensus better reflects Indonesian values. Members have been told not to disrupt the meeting. 'It's a pretence of democracy. Indonesia's got 180m people and we're all being fooled,' complained one dissident former army officer. Government supporters, however, say the assembly's support of the government has been the bedrock for political stability and economic growth averaging 6 per cent over the past 20 years.</p>

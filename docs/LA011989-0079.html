			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK;  </P> <P> COUNCIL SETS MEETING LIMIT  </P> <P> In a decision literally made at the 11th hour, the City Council last week  unanimously voted to set an 11 p.m. limit on its meetings. The meetings usually  begin at 7 p.m. The vote on the motion coincidentally came at 11 p.m., eight  minutes before the council adjourned the meeting.  </P> <P> Council members have said they want to end meetings earlier to eliminate  excessive rhetoric. In recent years, council meeting often have lasted until 2  or 3 a.m. "You'd get so tired, you couldn't even keep your eyes open," said  Mayor Barry L. Hatch, who proposed the time limit. "Often council members,  including myself, get a little lengthy when we're talking."  </P></p>

No ransom was paid for  their release. [passage omitted]    A meeting was held in Sakaeo Province yesterday morning to  discuss ways of rescuing the three and suppressing the bandits.  The meeting was attended by governor Kasem Chaisit, Burapha  Force commander Maj-Gen [Major-General] Niphon Pharannit,  provincial police deputy chief Col Somrit Yangprida and  representatives of the Land Department, Thai-Cambodian  Coordination Office and Foreign Ministry.    Governor Chaisit revealed that the Thai side would be happy  to pay the ransom to secure the release of three of its  citizens. After that the Thai authorities contacted Maj-Gen Ko  Choun, deputy commander of the 7th Division, which is  responsible for this part of Cambodia to seek cooperation in  getting the Thais released. The three Thais, however, were freed  and returned to the Thai side of the border yesterday afternoon  without any money changing hands.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE FARM AND PROPOSITION 103  </P> <P> Not so long ago a friend spent considerable time and energy trying to convince  me that my vote is important, that it counts. Because I respect this person, I  decided to give our democratic process a try.  </P> <P> Last November I went to my local polling place and I voted in favor of  Proposition 103. Wow, I won! Didn't I?  </P> <P> Why should anyone cast a vote when insurance companies and individuals  representing this state can and do set their will above the will of the people?  </P> <P> If the insurance companies operating in California are not required to abide by  the laws of this state, then the citizens should not be compelled to purchase  their products.  </P> <P> E. BARTON  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

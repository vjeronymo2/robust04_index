			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Pacific Horizon hits out at manager Jupiter Tyndall DIRECTORS OF Pacific Horizon, the investment trust, yesterday issued a strong attack on Jupiter Tyndall, its manager, which last month blocked an agreed takeover. Martin Currie Pacific had made an offer but Jupiter Tyndall assembled a 25.1 per cent stake in the trust's warrants. This enabled it to block a resolution allowing for an improved version of the Martin Currie offer at an extraordinary meeting of warrant holders. A majority of 75 per cent was required. Pacific Horizon's board continues unanimously to recommend the Martin Currie bid. It said it believed it 'unlikely that Jupiter will now put forward proposals which are better for shareholders than the current Martin Currie Pacific offers'. The board's statement went on to express concern at the effect Jupiter Tyndall's management functions could have on its independence in the offer. It added that the warrant holding had an approximate aggregate cost of Pounds 150,000, and that Jupiter Tyndall's management fees in the nine months to the end of April this year were Pounds 216,873. It stands to lose these if the Martin Currie bid is successful, according to Pacific Horizon. The bid has been extended until today. Martin Currie said yesterday that up-to-date figures on valid acceptances would not be available until this afternoon. A decision would be taken on whether to continue the offer once this information is available. The terms of the deal are complex. Martin Currie is offering to pay shareholders 92 per cent of the trust's formula asset value. This excludes 11 per cent of the fund's portfolio invested in illiquid stock, which would be sold, the proceeds being distributed to shareholders.</p>

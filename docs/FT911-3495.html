			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / East Europe should learn from Asia: From central planning to a market economy East European countries engaged in the heroic change-over from centrally-planned to market-driven economic systems have been getting most of their advice from the west. They would do well to look to Asia as well. Advice to eastern Europe from western experts largely follows classical economic lines: free prices, remove subsidies, open your economies to international trade, make your currencies freely convertible, privatise the state-owned companies, invite foreign investment, close inefficient plants and retire redundant workers. This, the experts acknowledge, will involve some costs - higher prices, unemployment, lost income, and more foreign debt and servicing. But these are short-term and will be more than offset by the longer-term benefits that accrue from free markets. They urge, therefore, that their recommended reform package be adopted quickly and in full, while supporters of economic change still hold the high ground. Initially, east Europe's economic reformers assumed that advice about markets from advisers schooled in market economies could not be wrong. More recently, however, the first rush of enthusiasm for a cold-turkey approach to reform is fading. Euphoria over economic emancipation is giving way to a more hard-headed assessment of the people and institutional deficits that will have to be cleared before eastern Europe's economies can survive - much less compete - in a free-market world. The deficits are formidable: most of the basic skills and institutions needed to make a system work - double-entry book-keeping, personal property rights and a commercial banking system, to name a few - do not exist. Industrial equipment and technology are, by western standards, obsolete. Few companies can estimate their net worth or unit production costs, or judge what they could produce competitively - information all serious foreign investors would insist on. Arching over these deficits are the problems of severe environmental degradation, long-neglected infrastructure and the virtual disappearance of the region's pre-war ethic. Increased awareness of their economies' internal weaknesses, together with doubts about continued public support for a reform process that involves hardships of unknown magnitude and unpredictable duration, are raising second thoughts among eastern Europe's leaders about the wisdom of exposing their still-fragile democracies to what amounts to an economic free-fall. Other factors have surfaced as well that reinforce the need for a second look. The recent rout of agricultural subsidies by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the continuing row between the US and Japan over market access, for example, suggest that the free-market approach recommended for eastern Europe is honoured as much in the breach as in the observance by the market-oriented countries of the west. A further discovery is that the path to the market being urged on east European countries is substantially different to that taken by countries that have most recently successfully navigated the course from economic backwardness to world-class competitors. These, of course, are Asia's Newly Industrialised Countries (NICs): Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Many cultural, political and social differences separate east Europe from east Asia, and comparisons should not be pushed too far. But in terms of how to go about transforming a backward economy into an efficient, competitive one, there is much common ground and many lessons to be shared. A few examples of the differences in the approach recommended to eastern Europe and the way that NICs, and earlier, Japan, went about the work of economic reform and restructuring are perhaps instructive: Industrial strategy and support: Neither Asia's NICs nor Japan entrusted to the market, or to foreign investors, responsibility for deciding which of their industries would prosper and which would fail. On the contrary, they formulated industrial strategies based on forecasts of market developments and assessments of which of their 'neo-infant industries' could be expected to carve out a competitive niche in world markets and which could not. For the first group, they provided protection from import competition as well as export incentives, tax relief and other financial help to bolster their growth and competitiveness. To ensure that the beneficiary industries would not become protection-dependent and would become internationally competitive over time, fiscal support was provided on a declining scale. At the same time, companies in uncompetitive or declining industries were helped to diversify or phase out, and workers retrained. Eastern Europe, after 40 years of disastrous economic planning, understandably eschews all forms of central planning, including Asia's market-directed, indicative type. The same attitudes carry over to the question of transitional help for industries trying to adapt to market forces. While these attitudes are consistent with a free-market philosophy, Asia's less doctrinaire approach might save some east European companies that with reasonable transitional support could adjust to a market environment, but without it would likely go under - taking jobs and income with them. Exchange rates: Asian countries have used exchange rates as an important tool of economic policy. As typified by Korea and Taiwan, exchange rates were set to encourage exports and savings and discourage imports. Only after exports had penetrated big overseas markets - and they had amassed large reserves in the process - did these countries agree (reluctantly) to a revaluation of their currencies. East European countries are being advised to do the opposite: let the market determine the volumes of imports and exports and, by default, set the market-clearing exchange rate. Foreign investment: Japan earlier, and the NICs more recently, have acquired much of their technology through licences, franchises, market-sharing arrangements and reverse engineering (Asian for 'pirating'). They wanted knowledge and technology, not foreign partners, and foreign equity investment was (and is) not actively encouraged. During Japan's first period of modernisation in the 1860s, Japan imported European bankers - but not their banks - to help create a domestic banking system. When enough Japanese had learned to be bankers, the foreign advisers were sent home. The NICs have adopted an essentially similar technique. Price liberalisation and subsidies: Prices in Asia's NICs are nominally set by market forces. But key prices may be adjusted further by fiscal means (tax rebates, tariffs, duties, subsidies) to ensure that the buy/sell, save/invest signals they emit conform to national priorities: high savings and investment rates, aggressive exporting and relative self-sufficiency in food. It is incongruous that while east European countries are being urged to let market forces determine their domestic prices, there is no market price for imported rice in Japan - because there is no imported rice; and agricultural prices in the US and Europe are influenced as much by national budgets as by market forces. A final consideration. It is axiomatic that public support for economic reform is inversely proportionate to the distress it causes. Common to both Asia's and eastern Europe's economic restructuring efforts is the need to enlist and maintain public support for the reform process. Asia's NICs have demonstrated that it is possible to achieve market-driven economic restructuring without incurring unacceptably high economic and social costs. Eastern Europe's economic reformers might find it rewarding to take a closer look at Asia's experience.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Col-Gen Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief </F> of the Russian Federation's Border Troops, by correspondent  Eduard Lunev: "The New Border Situation"]    [Text] [Lunev] Andrey Ivanovich, this year Russia's Border  Troops are commemorating their official holiday on new lines.  The length of the border would appear to have been shortened,  but, judging from the fact that you are spending most of your  time out of the office, the number of concerns has increased in  inverse proportion. What is the explanation for this?    [Nikolayev] The border of the former Union exceeded 62,000  km, while Russia's border is 60,932 km. Not a large difference,  as you can see. The numerical strength of Russia's Border Troops  is 30,000 men below the Union level. As much as 30 percent of  the Border Troops' assets, along with engineering and technical  equipment, remained outside of Russia. This means that the  border has been weakened by the same percentage. Around 1,500  border violators have been apprehended just since the beginning  of this year. Around 400 weapons and a large quantity of  ammunition have been detected and confiscated. And so, as you  can see, the border fully reflects those disturbing processes  occurring inside the country. This is why I perform my job more  on the border than in the office. This is confirmed by the fact  that I have gone on special assignment 14 times in 2 months.    [Lunev] You were recently made a member of the Security  Council, which means that the border service today is regarded  not just as armed protection and defense of Russia's borders but  also as a political field contributing to the maintenance of  diplomatic mutual understanding of contiguous states. Is that so?    [Nikolayev] One has to be a diplomat, to seek and find  mutually acceptable decisions on issues involvig contiguous  states. Reality is forcing us to do that:    the border with countries which are not members of the  Commonwealth--the Baltic states (which have a border with the  Russian Federation stretching 1,025 km, and the crossing of the  border is not defined in the international legal respect);    the border with Norway, Finland, Poland, the PRC, Mongolia,  Korea, Japan and the USA, which coincides with the border of the  former USSR (with a length of 9,758.2 km; the maritime border  with Japan and he United States is not defined by legal treaty);    the border with the Commonwealth nations--Belarus, Ukraine,  Georgia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan--which extends more than  12,000 km (these border sections are not covered in the military  respect and are not defined by legal treaty).    [Lunev] Andrey Ivanovich, your name appeared in the  newspapers when you were still a young lieutenant. Today you are  a colonel-general. An entire lifetime separates these  milestones. If you can, tell us about that briefly.    [Nikolayev] I was born in Moscow four years following the  Victory. I had to become a military man if only because that was  the main occupation for men like us. My father was a  colonel-general. He brought us up in such way that I was never  the general's son, but I was the son of a general. The reader  may not believe that this fact brought me many unpleasant  moments during my studies at the school. My career as an officer  then began. I commanded a company, a battalion and a regiment. I  graduated from the Academy imeni Frunze and the General Staff  Academy. In order for people not to think that I achieved this  through patronage I had to strive for gold medals, even though I  am indifferent when it comes to any kind of award. I shall be  happy if I can be of benefit to Russia in this post and if at  least one of my sons continues the family tradition.    [Lunev] How do you see the future of the Russian border?  Will  it be an "iron curtain" or something like the American-Mexican  border?    [Nikolayev] We shall form on the basis of treaties groups of  Russian border troops in states of the "near abroad" for the  joint protection of the CIS' external borders. Such groups have  already been set up in Armenia, Georgia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzia.    On other sectors of the border there will be a gradual  transition from continuous (solid) engineering and technical  equipment of protection based on barbed-wire obstacles to a  system of covering individual sectors using the latest  achievements of science and technology. With time, I am certain,  there will be no "iron curtain."</p>

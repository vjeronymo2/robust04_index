			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DORNAN TRYING TO BLOCK MOVE TO NORMALIZE VIETNAM TIES  </P> <P> In a split with fellow Republicans in Congress -- Vietnam war veterans among  them -- Orange County's Rep. Robert K. Dornan is opposing moves by the Bush  Administration toward normalizing relations with Hanoi.  </P> <P> And while the conservative Garden Grove Republican is exchanging harshly worded  memos with the State Department over the normalization issue, he is pressing  ahead with legislation aimed at making it easier for former Vietnamese citizens  to gain refugee status in this country.  </P> <P> Dornan, a former fighter pilot and television talk show host with a taste for  controversy, is one of the few members of Congress who is not hesitant to make  his voice heard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shaping U.S. Policy  </P> <P> And if his critics have sometimes dismissed him as long on rhetoric but short  on substance, the 56-year-old congressman has in fact made himself a  significant factor in the shaping of U.S. policy toward its former foe.  </P> <P> In combative correspondence with the State Department, as an official member of  the U.S. delegation to a conference on Vietnamese refugees, and as a legislator  who counts 78,000 former residents of Vietnam as constituents, Dornan has  repeatedly made his weight felt in maintaining a tough line toward the  communist regime that now rules all of Vietnam.  </P> <P> While two Vietnam veterans and fellow Republicans, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)  and Rep. Tom Ridge (R-Pa.), are urging the Administration to move toward  normalizing relations if Vietnam withdraws its occupying troops from Cambodia,  Dornan is by far the most vocal -- and strident -- of those who oppose the  move, several congressional aides said.  </P> <P> Some see Dornan as a rabid anti-communist whose bombastic style is rooted in an  inability to move beyond the rhetoric of the Cold War.  </P> <P> But many see him as a serious player in the battle over Vietnam policy, whose  interests in a wide range of issues, including Vietnamese refugees and missing  American servicemen, transcend his anti-communist tirades.  </P> <P> Even McCain, a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for 5 1/2 years, acknowledges  that Dornan, a strong and early supporter of George Bush during the 1988  primary campaign, has the ear of the White House.  </P> <P> "Obviously his opinion is respected over there," McCain said.  </P> <P> But McCain insists that "the Administration's decision (about re-establishing  relations with Vietnam) will be based on a lot of other factors."  </P> <P> A State Department official specializing in Far Eastern affairs said the Bush  Administration is willing to move toward establishing normal relations with  Vietnam "in the context of an acceptable settlement in Cambodia," which Vietnam  has occupied since December, 1978.  </P> <P> Such a settlement, the official said, must include withdrawal of Vietnamese  troops, establishment of a popularly elected government, and provisions to  prevent the return to power of the Khmer Rouge, which was responsible for a  bloody reign of terror in Cambodia from 1975 through 1978. Vietnam has vowed to  remove its troops from Cambodia by the end of September.  </P> <P> Even if that occurs, Dornan is adamantly opposed to any rapprochement.  </P> <P> In a letter sent to Secretary of State James A. Baker III in May, Dornan wrote:  "As you know, my Orange County, California, congressional district is home to  the largest Vietnamese-American community in our country. . . .  </P> <P> "It would send shock waves throughout Vietnamese families nationwide if  recognition of Hanoi's government were to occur at all, let alone early, in the  Bush Administration.  </P> <P> "Some voices in Congress will dovetail with Hanoi's propaganda efforts designed  to create the perception that Vietnam now fits into a new world socialist mold,  which accepts a Vietnamese version of glasnost and perestroika." Such an  impression, Dornan said, is patently false.  </P> <P> The State Department's response was largely disappointing, Dornan said.  </P> <P> In the second paragraph of a June 2 letter, Assistant Secretary of State Janet  G. Mullins told Dornan, "Longstanding United States policy envisions  normalization of relations with Vietnam, involving diplomatic recognition and  an end to our economic ostracism," once the Cambodia question is settled.  </P> <P> Dornan termed the letter "exceedingly weak," and complained, "I have a good  enough relationship with Jim Baker that he should have written me himself."  </P> <P> However, Dornan said he believes continuing efforts to pressure the White House  will pay off. He noted that even the Bush Administration formally opposed a  move last year by McCain and Ridge to permit Vietnam and the United States to  set up "interest sections" -- a step in the direction of establishing full  diplomatic relations -- in each other's capitals.  </P> <P> Furthermore, Dornan said, last month's massacre by the Chinese army of  protesting students in Beijing may persuade American leaders to take a slower  approach toward recognition of what Dornan termed a brutal communist  government.  </P> <P> "I think they're going to be so obsessed with China now that they're not going  to have time to play games about (whether) now is the right time to start  normalizing relations with Vietnam," he said.  </P> <P> On another front, Dornan's efforts to shape policy toward Vietnam have met with  more immediate success.  </P> <P> The House last week approved a measure, which Dornan co-sponsored, that would  for one year make it easier for emigres from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and the  Soviet Union to earn political refugee status from the United States.  </P> <P> The legislation, authored by Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.), directs the  attorney general to establish categories of Soviet and Indochinese emigres who  will not be required to prove they are victims of political persecution in  order to enter the United States.  </P> <P> Such proof is now required by the Department of Immigration and Naturalization  before it will accept emigres as political refugees.  </P> <P> A Dornan-authored bill that would grant presumptive refugee status to any  Vietnamese interned in a "re-education camp" is pending in the immigration  subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee.  </P> <P> Recognizing Dornan's interest in the refugee issue, the White House earlier  this year named him to the U.S. delegation to the Conference on Indochinese  Refugees, held in Geneva last month. Dornan was the only member of Congress  named as an official delegate.  </P> <P> The continuing crush of refugees from Vietnam into adjacent jurisdictions,  including Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong, has brought increasing pressure to  stem the tide. The so-called "first asylum countries" have instituted screening  procedures to separate victims of political persecution from what they contend  are "economic emigres," people who fled Vietnam in search of economic rather  than political security.  </P> <P> Dornan credited the United States with preventing the delegates to the  conference from adopting rules that would permit the host countries to deport  those emigres already in residence who fail the "political-persecution test."  </P> <P> "I said to the Dutch ambassador, and anybody else who would listen, 'When did  we ever drag anyone back across the border into a communist country?' " Dornan  explained, his voice rising. "The Shah of Iran did it to a MIG pilot once, and  the guy was executed with great fanfare."  </P></p>

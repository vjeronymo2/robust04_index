I just went for it."  </P> <P> Graham and Birch later teamed up to advance to the doubles final. Graham and  Birch moved into the final with victories over teams from Florida (by default)  and Georgia (6-3, 6-3).  </P> <P> Top-seeded Brad Gilbert led three Americans into the third round of the Italian  Open with a 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 victory over Luis Mattar of Brazil on the clay  courts in Rome.  </P> <P> Also advancing to the round of 16 were second-seeded Aaron Krickstein, who  defeated Karel Novacek of Czechoslovakia, 6-2, 6-2, and ninth-seeded Jim  Courier, who beat Jaime Yzaga of Peru, 6-3, 6-4.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Steffi Graf needed only 42 minutes to beat Katia Piccolini of Italy,  6-0, 6-1, and reach the quarterfinals of the German Open at West Berlin.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Monica Seles of Yugoslavia overwhelmed Nicole Jagerman of the  Netherlands, 6-1, 6-0, in 45 minutes, Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina defeated  Elise Burgin, 6-2, 6-1.  </P> <P> The quickest match of the day was Soviet Larisa Savchenko's 6-3, 6-0 victory  over No. 15 Hana Mandlikova of Australia in 40 minutes.  </P></p>

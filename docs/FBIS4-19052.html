			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "gb": "Alternatives to the Present Monetary </F> Policy Exist; New Money Supply Concepts and Other Methods of  Estimation; The Bundesbank Hesitant at the Moment"]    [Text] Frankfurt, 23 Mar--The Bundesbank's monetary policy  has become the topic of much discussion. Its fundamental premise  is that the height of the rate of inflation is basically  dependent upon the amount of money in an economy. For this  reason it is the aim of the Bundesbank to control the amount of  money in circulation that is used to pay for goods and services,  called the money supply. What is included in this, however, is a  matter of discretion. The M3 money supply, the amount selected  to be used as a guide, comprises note and coin circulation as  well as sight deposits held by domestic firms and private  individuals at domestic banks and savings institutions, time  deposits with up to a four-year notice, and savings deposits  subject to a three-month withdrawal notice. The criticism of the  Bundesbank's monetary policy goes so far as to call for the  abandonment of current money supply policy altogether. It is  also being considered, however, whether changes in money supply  policy will suffice.  <H5>  1. Change in the Definition of Money Supply </H5>   One radical move would be to replace the M3 money supply.  The  new money supply would be augmented by the amount of German mark  deposits held in foreign markets ("Euromarkets"), because monies  held outside the country can be transferred into the country and  used for payments at no significant delay or cost. This new  money supply would have the advantage over M3 that short-term  movements of money in and out of the country would have no  influence on the estimation of the growth in the money supply.  For quite some time now the Bundesbank has done calculations for  such a money supply, which it calls the "M3 extended" money  supply. However, it seldom quotes this growth rate.    Differentiated models present another concept. Here the  separate components of the money supply would be weighted with  an interest rate; for example, time deposits would be weighted  with a money market interest rate. This would give those  components like time deposits, which are used not for payments  but as investments, a lower weighting. The result of this would  be that capital investment transactions such as rearrangements  of time deposits and securities would disturb the money supply  less than before. However, differentiated money stocks are also  disputed. Estimates show that their relationship to the price  level is often not as close as the relationship of M3 to the  price level.    In addition, the Bundesbank has already changed the money  supply once, from the central bank money stock to M3 in 1988. To  the surprise of many banking experts, the chairman of the board  of experts, Herbert Hax, recently expressed his support for the  old concept. In comparison with the M3 money supply, with the  central bank money stock the note and coin circulation was  weighted relatively heavily as compared with M3, which, in the  event of fluctuations in demand for note and coin currency,  seriously distorted the rate of growth of the money supply.  <H5>  2. Change in Method of Estimation </H5>   A different method of estimation could be more promising for  M3 than a change in the money supply limits. Up to now the  Bundesbank has used a method of annualization, that is, it has  calculated an annual rate from monthly rates. A growth rate of  21.2 percent for January does not mean an increase in the money  supply of 21.2 percent between the fourth quarter of 1993 and  January of 1994. The money supply actually grew much more  slowly. The rate of 21.2 percent results from the assumption  that the growth rate that occurred between the fourth quarter of  1993 and January of 1994 will continue over the entire course of  the year. For, what is of interest to the Bundesbank is not the  January figure but the growth rate for the fourth quarter of  1994 as compared with the fourth quarter of 1993. The method of  annualization becomes problematic at the beginning of the year.  Why should the rate of expansion of the money supply observed  over two months automatically continue over many months? This  method is questionable particularly when the figure for January  becomes distorted by extraordinary factors, as has occurred here.    One alternative would be to calculate averages. In this way,  developments in the money supply over a six-month period could  be compared with developments during the corresponding time  period in the previous year. During a six-month period of  observation, if one month's figures are inflated as a result of  extraordinary factors, they do not have such a strong effect on  the overall figure. BHF Bank recently proposed a completely  different method. Although they are basically in favor of  retaining the method of annualization, they have proposed that a  different type of calculation be used for the first three months  of the year in hopes of neutralizing extraordinary factors, at  least in part.    Although the Bundesbank is aware of the difficulties with  the  money supply, there may actually be little readiness to discuss  the problem. It has been said that they are waiting for quieter  times before discussing alternative concepts. If the Bundesbank  were to alter its policy now it would be said: "If they are not  satisfied with the figures, they simply change their concept."  They do not want to create this impression.</p>

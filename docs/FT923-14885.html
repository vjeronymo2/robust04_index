			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Fighting flares in Sarajevo as peace talks fail: United Nations launches humanitarian relief operation to feed starving in Bosnian capital PROSPECTS for an end to the civil war in Bosnia-Hercegovina looked bleak last night after Lord Carrington, chairman of the European Community's peace conference on Yugoslavia, said in Sarajevo that he had made no headway in peace talks, and the fiercest fighting for many days erupted in the city. Lord Carrington's remarks coincided with the launch by the United Nations of a massive humanitarian relief operation aimed at feeding the 300,000 starving inhabitants of the Bosnian capital. Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy Bosnian army have besieged the city for 89 days. After talks with Moslem, Serb and Croat representatives, Lord Carrington said: 'I do not think we have made any progress at all today.' Late last night, heavy artillery fire was reported in the western suburb of Dobrinja, while red tracer fire arched across the sky from Serbian positions in the surrounding hills. Mr Mirsad Becirovic, an editor of Sarajevo Radio, said Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic had refused to negotiate the territorial division of Bosnia along ethnic lines, a plan backed by the EC and by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs. 'If the UN has recognised Bosnia as an independent and integral state, there cannot be ethnic regionalisation,' said Mr Becirovic. 'If Carrington still wants to meet Karadzic than he must understand what (Mr Karadzic's) Serbian democratic party has done to Bosnia. Europe has not seen such crimes since the Nazis in the second world war.' The Bosnian government has insisted on foreign military intervention as the only way to stop the war. Mr Izetbegovic has refused to hold face-to-face talks with Mr Karadzic, saying the SDS is a terrorist organisation responsible for the bombardment of Sarajevo and the ethnic cleansing of eastern Bosnia. Serb forces currently control more than half of Bosnia, in an effort to link territories with neighbouring Serbia. Witnesses have reported the summary execution and mass deportation of Moslems to rid the region of non-Serbs. Meanwhile, in Belgrade, Mr Milan Panic, Yugoslavia's prime minister designate, is due to hold talks on the formation of a new government. On his arrival in the city last night, Mr Panic, a 62-year-old California-based businessman, said his first priority was to stop fighting in the former Yugoslav federation and lift UN sanctions against Belgrade. Under intense international pressure and faced with a string of defeats by Croat forces in western Bosnia, Serb forces on Monday handed over the airport to the UN. Over 100 tonnes of aid has now been airlifted to the city. As local charities started distributing the food aid, inhabitants said it was just a 'drop in the ocean' towards rebuilding their lives. Humanitarian officials in Sarajevo say some 200 tonnes of food is needed to feed the 300,000 people trapped in the Bosnian capital. Mr Pero Butigan, secretary of the Bosnian Red Cross, said 22 tonnes of oil, flour, tinned food and juices, part of the French relief effort, were now warehoused in the city awaiting distribution. 'The problems are enormous. Sarajevo has been cut off for three months and people were either on the verge of hunger or already hungry. When the roadblocks are lifted the situation will really begin to turn around,' he explained. 'Meanwhile people are being killed, and expelled from cities in the eastern Bosnia - Foca, Gorazde and Bjeljina - they are completely cut off from the outside world even from international humanitarian organisations,' he said. Relief workers yesterday greeted the trickle of aid with mixed emotions. 'The reopening of the airport is only one step. But it will not end the war and horror,' said an official of one of the Moslem, Serb and Croat charities representing Bosnian's three main national groups. The three charities closely co-ordinate their work with the UN High Commission for Refugees and together give priority to the hardest hit cases, refugees and districts which have been completely cut off.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: Synchronised sin KEN CAMPBELL'S directorial debut was organising the shallow end for the Summer Water Show at Bournemouth. Campbell has swum a long way since then, and with Pigspurt at the Riverside Studios presents not so much synchronised swimming as synchronised sinning. For those prepared to take the plunge, this is vastly enjoyable. Campbell's tense anarchy has enlivened The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the 22 hour Warp at the ICA, and created a lugubrious Gonzalo in Derek Jarman's Tempest. If Pigspurt is not the most accessible Campbell, at least his crazed invention, disregard of convention, and superb control are fully available in this chaotic one man show. Campbell spurns plot, opts for coincidences which take one from an archeological dig in Oman via Hebrew football commentary in Munich to Pidgin translations of Ken Dodd in the Solomon Islands. He has the extraordinary gift of insinuating insanity everywhere. What starts as a paean to the stock 'Third Act Inspector' in detective dramas broadens into a portrait of the Bishop of Colchester overcome by guffaws of laughter in the stalls, squeezing Cub Scouts like bellows in his merriment. After the break, Campbell finds that his nose resembles a woman in Man Ray position (without the cello holes); the show's second half is a quest for the perfect match, turning a bare possibility into a naked fact by photographing nude women. Meanwhile - incomprehensibly - the right half of Campbell's face becomes Elsie the housewife, the left half a randy squire straight from Smollett; this turn of events ushers in transvestism and a strange party at La Maitresse. Further explanation beggars belief. Campbell is perplexing, infuriating and refreshing; sometimes hilarious, often scatological, and always mad. Perhaps it is no accident that he went to school in Barking.</p>

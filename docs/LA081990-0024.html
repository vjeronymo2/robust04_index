			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> WILD VIDEO: So who directed Chris Isaak's new video "Wicked Game"? Here's a  hint -- the same guy who put the song in "Wild at Heart" . . . David Lynch. The  film's quirky director used a pair of other Isaak songs, "Blue Spanish Sky" and  "In the Heart of the Jungle," in the film's sound track.  </P> <P> "Sky" and "Wicked Game" are featured on PolyGram's new "Wild at Heart"  sound-track album, which also offers Nicholas Cage's syrupy renditions of  Elvis' "Love Me Tender" and "Love Me," Gene Vincent's "Be Bop A Lula," Them's  "Baby Please Don't Go" and "Up in Flames," a song penned by Lynch himself which  is performed by blues queen Koko Taylor. . . . Meanwhile, Warners Records has  slapped a promo sticker on Isaak's last album, reminding consumers that it  features music from "Wild at Heart." Warners also is releasing a "Twin Peaks"  sound track that contains a pair of Julee Cruise songs plus music (for new  fall-season episodes) by composer Angelo Badalamenti. . . . "Drugstore Cowboy"  director Gus Van Sant has produced a video starring beat-poet icon William S.  Burroughs, which promotes "Dead City Radio," a new Burroughs spoken-word  project adorned with original music from John Cale, Donald Fagen, Sonic Youth  and Blondie's Chris Stein.  </P></p>

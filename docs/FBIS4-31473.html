			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 9 (CTK) -- The cancellation of the  clearing account for trade between the Czech and Slovak  Republics would be no big problem for the Czech Republic from  the viewpoint of foreign currency reserves, but may create a  problem for both sides as regards the volume of trade, Czech  Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said today. Kocarnik was  responding on NOVA Television to yesterday's statement by Slovak  Economy Minister Peter Magvasi that the clearing account had  outlived its usefulness. He told CTK that payments ought to be  liberalised which meant trading in convertible currencies.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: NOT A TYPICAL HISTORICAL ROMANCE  </P> <P> Mollie Aghadjian's new book, "Terms of Surrender" (Harlequin), is a historical  romance set in Napoleonic France.  </P> <P> But the story of a mysterious merchant trader whose business is threatened by  Napoleon's incursions into Europe offers more than the typical historical  romance, says the Mission Viejo author, who wrote her new book under the pen  name Mollie Ashton.  </P> <P> "I kind of push against the edges of the genre," said Aghadjian, adding with a  laugh: "Sometimes I get away with it; sometimes I don't."  </P> <P> In writing historical romances, she said, "I generally make historical  characters very much a part of the plot. Most historical romances don't.  They'll talk about Napoleon's troops -- you can hear the cannons in the  distance -- but that's about as much reference as you get to the period  usually."  </P> <P> In "Terms of Surrender," she said, "the hero of the story is actually very  mysteriously and deeply connected with the Bonaparte family, and the Bonapartes  are major characters in the story."  </P> <P> "Terms of Surrender" is Aghadjian's ninth book. She also writes Silhouette  romances under the pen name Moeth Allison.  </P> <P> The English-born author, who has been in this country 30 years, does a lot of  primary research for her historical romances in England. Although she has  written contemporary romances, she said the historicals "seem to be my medium."  </P> <P> "One of the reasons is, though I'm an American politically, I don't have that  sense in my bones of having grown up here," she said, "knowing what it's like  to go to school here, the radio and early television and all those things that  go to make up an American today."  </P></p>

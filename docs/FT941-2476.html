			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Labour plans to lift cost of part-time workers Labour is considering extending employers' national insurance contributions to part-time workers to encourage a shift back to full-time employment. Mr John Prescott, Labour's employment spokesman, said a Labour government would also extend full employment protection rights to part-time workers. 'We will certainly take away the incentive that means that employers go to part-time - turning a full-time job into two part-time jobs - in order to avoid paying national insurance and denying employment rights,' he told Granada television. 'Most of Europe (has) rejected that philosophy and even our courts have said it is wrong to discriminate against part-timers. We can remove the incentives that have transformed 3m full-time jobs into 3m part-time,' he said. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, committed the party to equalisation of employment rights in his speech to the Trade Union Congress conference last year. Mr Smith also underlined Labour's commitment to improve conditions for part-time workers in a speech to party members in Birmingham yesterday. He said the next Labour government would give working people the job security they deserved. He pledged: 'Equal rights for full and part-time workers. The right to protection against unfair dismissal. The right to proper health and safety standards. The right to join a trade union and to union recognition. And the right to a minimum wage.' Labour officials said, however, that Mr Prescott appeared to have exceeded his authority by committing the party to equalising national insurance contributions. The party fought the 1992 election on a platform promising increased employment and pension rights for part-time workers, but has since repudiated most of the manifesto. The national insurance issue is being considered by the party's economic commission, chaired by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. It was set up by Mr Smith to produce a coherent economic policy in time for a general election in 1996. Labour has been wary of making specific proposals about part-time employment because of fears about alienating support among part-time workers. Many in the party believe, however, that the increasing part-time feminisation of some of the UK's workforce has been at the expense of full-time male jobs.</p>

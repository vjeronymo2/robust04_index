			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Hills urges reform of domestic trade curbs US trade representative Carla Hills yesterday urged America's leading economic partners to dismantle their trade curbs as part of a five-year effort to reform the global trading system, Reuter reports from Washington. 'We have put our restrictions on the table. We would like Europe, Japan, Korea, and all our trading partners to put theirs on the table, and begin to bring them down,' she added. Lowering trade curbs was not a concession but was in the best interests of all countries.</p>

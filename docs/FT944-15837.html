			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Chains expect Christmas improvement Consumer confidence has shown some improvement recently, and predictions of a difficult Christmas for retailers may be proved wrong, according to Sir Malcolm Field, managing director of WH Smith, the newspaper, books and music group. His cautiously optimistic views reflect those of a number of retailers which have reported results recently. WH Smith experienced a slow midsummer period but things improved in late summer and early autumn. That partly reflected the arrival of cooler weather after the July heatwave, and some improvement in sentiment. He said: 'There is some underlying improvement in confidence, but the question is, is it sustainable? I think Christmas will be good, but only the best chains will win. You have to fight for every sale these days.' Sir Malcolm added that he often felt official retail sales figures did not reflect what was happening on the high street 'I sometimes wonder who is contributing to them.' Among other retailers, Storehouse - the clothing group which includes BHS and Mothercare - issued a trading statement earlier this month saying that sales for the six months to October were expected to be up by about 10 per cent. Next, the fashion retailer, last month reported sales 13 per cent ahead of last year. Body Shop, the natural cosmetics retailer, said on Thursday that underlying UK sales in the six months to the end of August were up 5 per cent - compared with a 5 per cent fall in the same period last year. However, Kingfisher, which includes the B&amp;Q, Woolworths, Comet and Superdrug chains, said conditions remained tough, particularly in the DIY and electrical goods sectors. Competition on price also remains tough, holding inflation down.</p>

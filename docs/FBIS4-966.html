			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation is calm in Niamey today after the  weekend's clashes between security forces and opposition  supporters. According to a NIGER PRESS AGENCY dispatch, a  precarious calm reigns today over the capital Niamey. The  report adds, however, that the large teams of policemen deployed  yesterday are still patrolling major crossroads.    Also, the interior minister whom we contacted by telephone  this afternoon has confirmed that about 50 people who had been  arrested were freed between yesterday and this morning. Mr.  Ousmane Oumarou also disclosed that preliminary investigations  show that no charges have been brought against the 50 persons  released. The interior minister further added that five key  opposition leaders and two members of parliament are still under  arrest.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["wtr"-signed commentary: "Sheer Populism"] </F>   [Text] It is sheer populism that not only the chancellor  but also his challenger in the elections now demand that violent  Kurds be deported to Turkey. Admittedly, Scharping is linking  his demand more clearly and precisely to Ankara respecting human  rights than does Kohl, but this is not the way to do it!  Presenting oneself as tough for the sake of right-wing voters  and dangling human rights guarantees in front of liberal and  thoughtful people at the same time is dangerous. It is  dangerous, because it creates the impression that it only  requires a few talks with Ankara to remove the obstacles to  deportations that have quite rightly been built up by the law on  foreigners and the Geneva Convention on Refugees.    Reality looks quite different. Turkey has violated every  human rights agreement it has ever signed. Turkey is using the  fight against the Workers Party of Kurdistan to complete its  political, cultural, and social oppression of the Kurds. And,  in Turkey, promises of the civilian government do not carry much  weight. In the Kurdish areas -- and not only there -- the Army  has the final say.    Politicians should be careful not to create the impression  that the problem is easy to solve. Otherwise they might  pressure themselves into having to violate international  obligations in order to keep their promises. No, there must be  an end to suggestions that Turkey is a country to which people  can be deported. Anyone committing an offense in Germany must  be tried in Germany and put in German prisons.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] The U.S. policy aimed at tightening the blockade  against Cuba has recently proved that it completely lacks  support. A large segment of the international community does  not care that in his so-called message to the Cubans, U.S.  President Bill Clinton vowed he would continue the economic  boycott of Cuba.    President Clinton and U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli,  who  is known worldwide as the author of the law that bears his name  and reinforces the blockade, are now more isolated than ever  before. Torricelli, wrapped in the anti-Cuban aura he loves to  cultivate, failed in his attempt to interfere in the internal  affairs of Mexico, a country he visited recently. During his  stay in Mexico, the U.S. congressman certainly hoped to foster  one of his aggressive moves against Cuba. But the attempt  proved futile, and this author of a bill demanding political  reforms in Mexico faced the rejection of deputies, high-ranking  officials, and the media.    Mexican citizens belonging to the Go for Cuba solidarity  group protested Torricelli's visit in front of the U.S. Embassy  in Mexico City, where they burned a coffin and an effigy of the  congressman and his anti-Cuban law.    In Mexico City, delegates attending the 20th Conference of  the Latin American Economic System [SELA] passed a resolution  condemning the U.S. economic, trade, and financial blockade of  Cuba, which has been in force for more than 30 years. The SELA  document urged the lifting of all restrictions against Cuba --  the effects of which it described as detrimental to the  population -- and it demanded the suspension of unilateral  actions that are not in keeping with the current international  economic and political environment.    While SELA was issuing this declaration, the Nonaligned  Movement's 11th Foreign Ministers Conference demanded an end to  the U.S. blockade of Cuba and asked Washington to stop  committing acts contrary to the spirit of being a good neighbor.  In addition, SELA asked for the return of Guantanamo Naval Base.    These governmental and popular rejections of U.S. harassment  of Cuba echo two resolutions that were approved two years in a  row by the UN General Assembly in 1992 and 1993. As of today,  however, the U.S. Government has failed to heed the letter and  spirit of these resolutions. The fact that the White House  appears to be ignoring international pronouncements against the  blockade does not detract from the importance or the value of  these declarations. On the contrary, these actions are simply  proof of the stubbornness of a nation that is ignoring a growing  international trend.</p>

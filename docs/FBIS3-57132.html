The Prime Minister stressed that although the new government  was cut by 20 percent, this will not affect its performance  because of the professional skills of its members.    He told senior cabinet members that the government must  build  its relations with the Federal Assembly on the basis of  cooperation, given that the cabinet and parliament were being  led by "common state interests."    Chernomyrdin had accepted a proposal made at the session of  the State Duma that the government should make weekly reports in  the house. In his view, the prime minister or his deputies do  not have to appear regularly in parliament but cabinet members  and ministers must keep in permanent touch with the deputies.    Chernomyrdin stressed in particular that members of the  reformed cabinet should not pay much attention to forecasts of  "how long it will last, given that the present government is  quite viable".    It was decided that the government would meet in a full  session on February 17, with President Yeltsin possibly  attending it.    Chernomyrdin warned the ministries and departments against  any excessive spending while forming this year's budget.</p>

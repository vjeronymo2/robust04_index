And today it was made clear there was no question of lifting  the ban on Mr Adams entering mainland Britain.    The sources urged the U.S. to put "firm pressure" on Mr  Adams  to use the opportunity of the visit to announce a ceasefire.    "We very much hope that now Gerry Adams will be in New York  that his hosts at this meeting will demand in the clearest  possible terms that the IRA gives up terrorism immediately.    "We would hope his hosts will make plain to him that  continuing evasive and non-committal statements are just not  enough and that the responsibility for peace rests with him and  his colleagues," a source said.    He said of Mr Adams: "He has given the impression in the  last  few days that personally he is against violence. If the  Provisionals continue their campaign, they continue terrorism  and bombing, then the hollowness of their words will be exposed."    Britain was looking for "deeds not words," it was stressed.    "We don't think Sinn Fein should be treated like a  democratic  party until it behaves like a democratic party and gives up its  support for terrorism," the source said.</p>

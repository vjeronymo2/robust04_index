			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Minister rebukes Dublin over Army call THE Irish government was rebuked by a Northern Ireland Office minister yesterday for publicly urging the withdrawal of the Parachute Regiment from Northern Ireland, Ralph Atkins writes. Mr Michael Mates, the security minister, told MPs that 'megaphone diplomacy in this sort of case seldom helps'. The 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement established a joint secretariat through which disputes could be resolved in private, he said. Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, called for the regiment to be withdrawn from the province after clashes between soldiers and civilians in Coalisland, County Tyrone, last weekend. At Commons questions, Mr Mates confirmed that the regiment would remain in the province and told MPs that 'it is best if these matters are kept for private discussions, and we have a mechanism for doing so'.</p>

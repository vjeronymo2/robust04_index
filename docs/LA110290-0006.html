			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Empress Brooke?: Brooke Shields stirred up the Japanese media recently when she  dropped in on an old friend, Crown Prince Naruhito. Shields was in the country  last week to mark the 100th anniversary of the Harry Winston jewelry store and  the future emperor invited her to stop by the Imperial Palace.  </P> <P> The two first met five years ago at Princeton University while Shields was an  undergraduate and Naruhito visited the campus on his way back from his alma  mater Oxford University. The bachelor prince was the object of press attention  earlier this year when his younger brother, Prince Aya, got married before him  and Shields' visit stirred up the reporters again. One newspaper resurrected a  photo of Naruhito's college dorm room with a poster of Shields prominent on the  wall. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

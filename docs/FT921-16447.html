			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Jamaican minister replaced MR Percival Patterson, Jamaica's finance minister, has been replaced in a cabinet reshuffle announced by Mr Michael Manley, the prime minister. Mr Patterson, who was also the deputy prime minister, leaves the cabinet. The new finance minister is Mr Hugh Small, previously the industry minister. The cabinet and all junior ministers had offered their resignations last week to allow Mr Manley to change portfolios. Mr Patterson subsequently told the prime minister that he did not want to be considered for a cabinet post. Mr Patterson has been under pressure to resign since he authorised a waiver of import duties for an oil company headed by a member of the executive of the ruling People's National Party. An earlier casualty of the furore over the waiver was Mr Horace Clarke, the energy minister, who resigned last week. Mr Patterson's resignation is a setback in a political career in which the next step was expected to be the prime ministership, with indications that Mr Manley would step down this year. Government officials say Mr Manley is now likely to delay his departure from politics. In announcing the new cabinet, Mr Manley reduced the number of ministries, and said he would present new economic policies in a few days. The government is trailing the opposition according to opinion polls. The polls suggest that the government's support has been eroded because of the economic and social effects of its programme to economic deregulation.</p>

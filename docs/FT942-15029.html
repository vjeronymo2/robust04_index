			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Golden Virginia is chilled by realities: Mrs Bottomley is quietly agitating for a move to a safer department as the troubled NHS is returned to the political front-burner Suddenly it seems to be going wrong. The National Health Service, no longer immune from the grim realities of the government's finances, has returned to the front-burner of politics. For nearly two years the NHS has been kept off newspaper front pages. The Labour charge in the 1992 general election that the government would privatise the most cherished pillar of the welfare state has been put to rest. The new internal market in state health care has been entrenched. The essential characteristic of the market - a split between the purchasers and providers of health care - looks irreversible. The new trust hospitals and general practitioner fundholders have boasted with some justification that they are providing better care and shorter waiting lists. Not so long ago Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, was tipped by her more excitable admirers as a future contender for the Tory leadership. Mrs Bottomley must have known it could not last. Faced with a Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement the Treasury called a halt last autumn to the rapid growth in NHS spending. The health secretary began quietly agitating for a move to a less dangerous department in this summer's cabinet reshuffle. But the speed and intensity of health's return to the front pages has dismayed Tory MPs. What one minister calls the 'smile-and-it-will-go-away approach', which has seen Mrs Bottomley get through previous scrapes, no longer seems to be working. Unsympathetic colleagues are suggesting that, now the going is getting rough, Mr Major must keep her on at health. Headlines highlighting the fat salaries and expensive perks paid to the new breed of NHS administrators have been accompanied by a spate of damaging incidents at trust hospitals. Reports of elderly patients being denied treatment because they are not covered by the contracts signed by trusts and local health authorities make for very bad politics. So does evidence that the new GP fundholding system is allowing some patients to jump hospital queues. There are other problems. Mrs Bottomley's rationalisation of health care in London has provoked a damaging political backlash ahead of next month's critical local elections. Her assumption that everyone would agree that London consumed a disproportionate share of NHS resources failed to take account of the powerful public support for the capital's teaching hospitals. In particular she misjudged the strength of opposition against the plan to allow the renowned specialist departments at Guy's hospital to be threatened by merger with neighbouring St Thomas's. The campaign to save Guy's, led by Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP, has the tacit support of prominent Conservatives. Many of the wealthy benefactors who have poured millions of pounds in charitable donations to develop Guy's have traditionally helped to fill Conservative party coffers. Ministers have been told those funds could well dry up if the merger goes ahead. What would in effect be the closure of Guy's is regarded as a bad mistake by Tory as well as opposition MPs. The health secretary has also come under fire in Whitehall for failing to get to grips with the burgeoning administrative staff in the NHS. The public criticism of NHS bureaucracy in Wales voiced by Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, has seriously undermined Mrs Bottomley's efforts to defuse the issue in England. It does not help when health authority auditors uncover payments of more than Pounds 200,000 to cover the relocation expenses of a senior trust executive. But the government's problems with the NHS run much deeper than the coincidence of a few bad headlines. The real causes are rooted in money. For all the opposition's complaints about 'underfunding' the government has poured money into the NHS over the past few years to lubricate the changes to a market-based system. The creation of an internal market was always bound to expose the rationing of provision which has been a feature of the NHS since its inception. There is nothing new about patients being turned away from hospitals and intolerable waits in accident and emergency units. But real annual increases in resources of 4 per cent and above since the late 1980s have clouded the transparency promised by the internal market. They have obscured also the fact that the new system gives much more power to health producers than to consumers. Instead of money following patients the sick have found themselves chasing the money. The financial cushion is now disappearing. Last year's public spending settlement provided for growth in the NHS's Pounds 30bn budget of less than 1 per cent annually for the three financial years 1994-95 to 1996-97. District health authorities and hospital trusts are now adjusting to the harsher financial climate. There are other resources available - through productivity and efficiency gains - but no one in Whitehall doubts that in the run-up to the next general election available resources will fall significantly short of demands on the service. Longer waiting lists and well-paid bureaucrats are an explosive political mix. Opposition parties will exploit every story of managerial extravagance, and there will be many more, to attack the health service reforms. Mrs Bottomley is discovering that for Conservative governments there is only one route to peace in the NHS - money.</p>

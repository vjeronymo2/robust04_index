			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 16 Apr -- Today, after his return to Poland  from the informal summit of the presidents of the Central  European countries in Litomysl, President Lech Walesa announced  that he would dissolve parliament if the government coalition  were to attempt to curb or change his constitutional  prerogatives.    "Let me remind you, the president is guardian of the  Constitution and if there are matters or changes that are  necessary, I will support them. However, not every time and not  all changes -- I will not allow such changes. One must not do  it at this moment -- I cannot allow this to happen in the  interest of democracy and in the interest of the role of  president of the country," the president said.    Asked about what excuse he would use to dissolve parliament,  the president replied: "The same excuse that is being used to  amend the Constitution. This decision is final. If there is a  change in the Constitution, if someone dares to do it in this  manner, he should not kid himself -- I will face the State  Tribunal but parliament will be dissolved," Lech Walesa said.    Commenting on his meeting with the presidents of Austria,  the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Hungary in Litomysl,  Lech Walesa said that regional cooperation was necessary and  that it was an outcome of the changes that had taken place in  Central Europe. He said that such cooperation should be  discussed and that this will bring results.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Pacifists delay Swiss jet order THE Swiss government, bowing to pressure from a pacifist pressure group, is set to postpone a controversial Dollars 2.45bn (Pounds 1.3bn) order of 34 McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft until a national referendum can be held on the issue next year. The decision is a radical departure from the traditional process for approving military purchases, and reflects an increasing paralysis in Switzerland's much praised system of government. It has been customary for military matters to be decided by the Defence Department. There has been growing public unease over the plan to buy the highly sophisticated and expensive F/A-18s at a time when external threats seem to have disappeared and the economy is in deep recession. A pacifist movement launched a petition to force the government to hold a referendum on the issue. To the surprise of many, the Group for an Army-Free Switzerland (GSA) needed only 12 days to gather the 100,000 voters' signatures needed. Unnerved by the apparent scale of public opposition, the cabinet proposed delaying the order and the lower house of the federal parliament agreed yesterday by a narrow 103-84 margin after an unusually animated three-day debate. The question must now be referred back to the more conservative upper house, which voted in early April to place the order immediately.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Jan 06, BNS -- Estonian political circles  seem to have reached the conclusion that a border between  Estonia and Latvia is not needed, Udo Helme, the head of the  Estonian delegation to the joint border commission, charged in  an interview to BNS today.    "Since Estonia and Latvia have established a visa-free  regime  between the two countries, erroneous references to several  western countries that also don't require entrance visas are  made," Helme said. "People who do so confuse the different  functions of a border -- the political, the juridical, and the  security ones.    "This is detrimental to the de facto restoration of the  Republic of Estonia as an independent state," Helme claimed.    A Foreign Ministry official told BNS that Vello Saatpalu,  the  chairman of the parliamentary Foreign Commission, made a  proposal to the government to stop designating the boundary  between Estonia and Latvia, since it is "a waste of the  taxpayers' money."    Under the Estonian-Latvian agreement on restoring the  boundary concluded in March 1992, Estonia is to mark off the  border from the Pededze River in the east to the town of Valga,  and Latvia, from Valga to Ikla in the west.    Estonia has until now marked off an 82-kilometer stretch of  the border out of a total of 158 kilometers.    The cost of the work was originally estimated at 9.2 million  kroons, of which 2.3 million has been spent.    A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of  anonymity, told BNS that, if the work is suspended, resuming it  will cost Estonia an additional 4 million to 4.5 million kroons.  Denmark's aid to the amount of 2.4 million Danish kroner will in  this case also stop.    "Thus, it is most doubtful if stopping the construction  saves  the taxpayers' money," the official told BNS.    Under the agreement, the demarcation of the border should be  completed by the end of 1995.</p>

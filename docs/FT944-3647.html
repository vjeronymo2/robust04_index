			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: New York The most prominent feature of recent movements in the US Treasury market has been the flattening of the yield curve, as investors buy long-term bonds in the belief that inflationary pressures will be driven out of the economy next year. That belief was strengthened last week when Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan made clear that more increases in short-term interest rates were in store, and probably soon. Will the trend continue? The market's nerve could be shaken over the next few days in what is slated to be a busy week for economic data. Some of the figures could lead to worries that, in spite of the recent increases in interest rates, economic growth is failing to cool off in the way the Fed would like. For example, the retail sales figures for November, due out on Tuesday, are expected to show a solid gain of 0.5 per cent as a result of buoyant consumer confidence. Also on Tuesday, a rebound in energy and vehicle prices is likely to have contributed to a 0.4 per cent increase in the producer price index for November, compared with the 0.5 per cent decline in October. And there could be more bad news on Wednesday with the publication of November's consumer price index: Salomon is predicting a surge of 0.4 per cent, the largest advance in 13 months, led by increases in clothing and housing costs.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Geneva talks on new map of Bosnia International mediators convene in Geneva today to put the finishing touches on a 'take-it-or-leave-it' plan for Bosnia's partition. The plan's architects - from Russia, the US, the UK, Germany, and France - propose giving 51 per cent of Bosnia to the new Moslem-Croat federation and the remainder to the Serbs, who currently control 70 per cent of the war-torn country. Foreign ministers from the five-nation 'contact group' are due to meet tomorrow to endorse the maps. Leaders of the rival factions are also set to discuss the maps which have already come under criticism. Bosnian and Croatian foreign ministers, meeting in the Turkish capital Ankara on Saturday, gave only qualified endorsement to the peace plan. Bosnia's foreign minister, Mr Irfan Ljubiankic, said his government would 'not be the first to reject the plan', stressing however that the most important issue was the 'quality of the territory and the guarantees for the implementation of the plan'. A joint communique warned that Bosnia and Croatia would reject any peace plan that failed 'to redress the consequences of acquisitions of territories through the use of force and ethnic cleansing'. But Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, dismissed as 'humiliating' the maps which he said would prolong the war. 'If the current proposals are not changed, we should finally cancel our co-operation with this worldwide mafia . . . we should deny them the right to regulate Serb states,' he said. Diplomats say the plan represents a 'last chance' for the warring sides to decide whether they want 'carrots or sticks' from the international community, united behind the newest maps. Measures could include the lifting of sanctions on Belgrade, imposed for Bosnia's violent carve-up, or ending the arms embargo on the Bosnian government. Sources in Belgrade said that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia was 'taking the peace plan seriously'. He may exert pressure on his Bosnian proxies in order to win the lifting of UN sanctions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [CHINA DAILY Commentary: "Year of Reform"] </F>   [Text] The year 1993 was marked by China's intensified  reform efforts to build a socialist market system and  accelerated economic growth that has eclipsed that of most other  countries in the world.    A nation with 1.1 billion people is also enjoying political  stability, national unity, and social progress.    The Chinese Government has demonstrated maturity and greater  insight during the past year by resorting to economic means,  instead of mere administrative decrees, to regulate the once  overheated economy; it is fostering the rule of law and  introducing a civil service system to improve efficiency; and it  has waged a timely campaign against corruption to keep the  administration clean and honest.    The decision endorsed by the Party's Third Plenary Session  of  the 14th Central Committee last November blueprinted the  framework for the socialist market economy and spelled out the  immediate tasks and goals for the country's reform and opening  up during the 1990's.    In fact, China has steadfastly embarked on a road that  starts  from a centralized planned economy and leads to a socialist  market system throughout the last 15 years of reforms. The  decision further provides principled guidance for the most  crucial stage of such a transition.    The nation has a reason to be proud of its achievements last  year: Its gross domestic product rose a hefty 13 percent over  the previous year. The output of cereals, edible oil, and meat  all surpassed records. The income of urban dwellers, accounting  for the double-digit inflation, was 10 percent higher than the  previous year, while the living standards of the rural  population continued to improve.    Internationally, China's prestige rose remarkably thanks to  its firm adherence to an independent foreign policy that  emphasizes world peace and progress and, in particular, to  President Jiang Zemin's successful overseas tour. This in turn,  has contributed to building up a favourable international  environment for China's domestic development.    The year 1994 will be crucial for the country's development  of a market economy because the heaviest reform package is to be  put forward, including a substantial restructuring of the  banking, financial, taxation, and state industrial sectors.  They are indispensable in the framework of a market economy.    The task is challenging indeed because the deepening reform  will readjust the functions and interests of different  departments and the national and local governments.    This requires, on the one hand, the various sectors and  localities to place the interests of the whole nation above  departmental and regional gains while, on the other hand, the  policy-makers to be extremely considerate of the demands of  ordinary people.  <H5>  Macrocontrol </H5>   It is essential for the central government to continue and  improve its macroeconomic regulation. This is a delicate job  because an overdose will suffocate the economy while a looser  package will fuel inflation.    Agriculture deserves special support because it remains the  basis for China's economic development and because income of the  800 million people in the countryside has yet to catch up with  that of the nation as a whole.    The State-owned industries need to undergo thorough  restructuring to adopt modern enterprise mechanisms and to  maintain their leading role in the economy.    It is only natural that various problems may crop up during  the reform process, considering the scope of the change and the  size of the country. Yet it has become the nation's consensus  that only further reforms can lead the country forward.    It is hoped the new year will see more extensive development  of the socialist market economy, social stability, democracy,  and cultural life.    After all, China's progress and prosperity will mean greater  contributions to world peace and development, and to the whole  civilization of the human race.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities race ahead THE LOOMING results season for the utilities and the above-average yield attractions of the water, electricity and power generation stocks triggered a flurry of demand for all three sectors. County NatWest was said to have been among the keenest supporters of the spread of utilities. Ms Rachel Lucas, at County, said the sectors offered considerable potential following the general election result. County especially favours the regional electricity companies and the generators which, according to the broker, stand to gain most from growing perceptions in the market that the recent national grid report on overcapacity is implausible. County was particularly keen on utilities reporting early in the season, including North West Water, up 9 at 422p; South West Water, 6 higher at 421p; and Norweb Electricity, 8 ahead at 343p. National Power rose 6 to 227p. Glaxo gain limited Pharmaceutical group Glaxo Holdings retreated following the dramatic fall and suspension of shares in Toronto of an allied company. Glaxo had started brightly in London, along with the other leading drugs stocks, putting on 18 by midday. However, as Toronto opened, Biochem Pharma, which is developing its 3TC anti-Aids drug exclusively for Glaxo, requested a suspension after seeing its shares plunge, and talk in the London market erroneously put this down to problems with the new drug. The group's request came as a result of rumours that it had run into difficulties with a share placement, due to be made by US broking house Morgan Stanley. Biochem shares resumed trading after London had closed and ended sharply down. The company said it was not aware of any reason for the decline, and said it intends to proceed with an issue of up to 3.5m common shares in late May. Glaxo closed in London 2 up at 738p. Banks weaker Trade in Midland Bank slowed to only 8.1m shares, compared with 27m on Tuesday, as the market continued to take on board implications of the bid situation. The stock slipped 7 1/2 to 386 1/2 p after the bank again recommended the offer from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking. Rival bidder Lloyds Bank lost 2 to 415p. Analysts suggested that there may be sizeable arbitrage trade between shares in Lloyds and Midland over the next few months, with prices reflecting whether investors believe the Lloyds bid will succeed. At present the cheapest way into a combined Lloyds/Midland group is through Midland. Barclays declined 6 to 347p on continuing worries about its exposure to the debt of property company Olympia &amp; York. Institutional buyers snapped up Williams Holdings' 9.8 per cent stake in Racal, the 130m shares being placed by SG Warburg at 58 1/2 p. Williams, which collected Pounds 81m from the sale, closed 7 firmer at 352p. Racal held at 60 1/2 p. RTZ jumped 23 to 635p in brisk turnover of 2.9m. There was talk that a strike in Chile, the world's largest copper producer, could benefit RTZ, and also that the company had sold part of its industrial division. Speculation of a takeover offer from Minorco lifted Lonrho 7 to 98p. British Airways was in demand ahead of the annual meeting later this month. The shares gained 9 to 280p as a hefty 9.2m were traded. Vodafone slipped 6 to 351p in busy volume of 5.6m as James Capel downgraded the telecoms group. Fisons, up 18 at 384p, led a strong drugs sector, with the market keen to anticipate a positive decision by the US Food and Drugs Adminstration, which is examining Fisons' Holmes Chapel facility. Presentations by Wellcome over the next few days, and in the US next week, ahead of its share issue helped the stock rise 7 to 1036p. Whitbread 'A' climbed 13 to 457p, outperforming the rest of the sector on hopes of recovery. Mr Mike McCarthy, breweries analyst at Smith New Court, said Whitbread has the most recovery potential among national brewers. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew took Travis Perkins, which reported results in line with expectations yesterday, off its buy list following the builders merchant's recent good run. The shares were unchanged at 224p. The broker is recommending a switch into Wolseley, off 8 at 453p, or Meyer International, down 3 at 415p. Two crosses by a leading agency broker in Costain Group - one of 1.4m shares at 81 1/2 p and another of 2.5m at 82p - lifted the day's turnover for the stock to 8.5m. The shares put on 2 to 81p. Selected construction issues advanced on offical figures showing a rise in orders for the first quarter. The long-awaited finance deal between Greycoat and a consortium of banks for the property group's Embankment Place development in central London lifted it 7 to 61p. Talk that ICI's first-quarter results today will contain some good news pushed the shares 11 higher to 1381p. A shortage of stock in BOC Group squeezed it up 13 to 726p. Among supermarkets, Tesco receded 9 to 282p on turnover of 5.4m shares following a recommendation by BZW to switch into J. Sainsbury. The latter was unchanged at 433p as the sector continued to react nervously to Credit Lyonnais Laing's criticism of property valuation and accounting policies. Dixons was off just a penny at 256p in hefty turnover of 3.1m shares after recovering most of an early loss caused by a profits downgrade from County NatWest.

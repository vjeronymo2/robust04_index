			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON'S LUCZAJ NAMED BUENA PARK FOOTBALL COACH  </P> <P> Former Fullerton High School football coach Martin Luczaj, who turned a  struggling program into a playoff participant for six consecutive seasons, has  been named football coach at Buena Park.  </P> <P> Luczaj, 36, compiled a 52-19 record, winning three league titles and leading  Fullerton into the Central Conference championship game twice (one title)  before he resigned in March 1987.  </P> <P> Luczaj became Orange County's youngest head coach at 28 in 1981. Fullerton, 1-9  in 1980, won the Freeway League title in Luczaj's first season with an 8-3  record.  </P> <P> Luczaj spent the past two years as Fullerton's baseball coach and as an  assistant football coach at Fullerton College.  </P> <P> Buena Park has struggled in the Freeway League during the past six years,  losing 28 consecutive league games before defeating Sonora, 21-13, last fall.  </P> <P> "Marty wanted to get back to coaching on the high school level and there are  some distinct advantages at Buena Park," said Greg Bice, assistant  superintendent in charge of personnel for the Fullerton Union High School  District.  </P> <P> "Buena Park has a very successful bingo program (generating funds for  extracurricular activities) and the school has added a weight room and a  training room," Bice said.  </P> <P> Bice also announced the hiring of football coaches at Fullerton and Sonora. Pat  Ward, an assistant at Chaffey College, was named to replace Steve Nishimoto at  Fullerton. Nishimoto resigned in December after three seasons to concentrate on  his teaching assignment.  </P> <P> Terry Cox, varsity football coach at San Gabriel High School, was named varsity  football coach at Sonora. Cox replaces Larry Allen, who resigned after two  seasons with a 3-17 record.  </P> <P> Bice said Luczaj, Ward and Bice will begin teaching assignments at their  schools in two weeks.  </P></p>

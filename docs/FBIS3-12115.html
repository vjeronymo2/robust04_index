According to the government, sales might be possible  only if Cuba complies with conditions established by Ecopetrol  [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] for the sale of crude on the  international markets. A spokesman for the [word indistinct]  ministry said no concessions will be made.    According to official sources, Cuba has offered to cover the  cost of the negotiations with sugar, in a three-party  transaction that is not acceptable to Colombia. The island  government would reportedly sell sugar -- the island's main  source of currency -- at low prices to a third country. That  nation, which has not been further identified, would resell the  sugar on the international market. With the proceeds from the  sale, this nation would then pay Colombia for the oil sold to  Cuba.    An official spokesman said: We prefer a letter of credit. As  long as there are no payment guarantees, there will be no  negotiations. He explained that until now President Castro's  government has not made another proposal. The failure of the  negotiations, which are now practically suspended, would not be  due to international pressures exerted after the negotiations  were announced but because Ecopetrol's conditions for  negotiations of this type have not been met, the government said.</p>

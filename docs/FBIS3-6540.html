			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa called Friday [18 March] for opening deliberations on  the 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994, suggesting he is  ready to give more explanation over his loan from a  scandal-tainted trucking company as demanded by the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party.    "I have already answered (on the loan problem)  wholeheartedly. (but) if the House of Representatives Budget  Committee is held, (I) will speak about what I can tell,"  Hosokawa said.    The LDP has refused to open budget deliberations unless  Hosokawa produces proof to support his claim that he returned  the 100 million yen he received from Sagawa Kyubin Co.    Hosokawa, who spoke to reporters at his official residence,  however, rejected an opposition demand to submit further  documents related to his loan from Sagawa in 1982.    The premier also turned down another opposition demand that  the Diet summon his former secretaries to clear up the loan  problem.    "We must be careful not to set a precedent for calling up  private (sector) people (to the Diet)," he said.    Hosokawa has insisted that he borrowed the money to repair  his home in Kumamoto Prefecture and buy a condominium in Tokyo,  and that he fully repaid the money nine years later.    The parcel delivery firm was involved in a money-and-mob  scandal which forced former LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru to resign  in disgrace in 1992.    Hosokawa also brushed aside the LDP's reported intensifying  attempt to bring down the government, saying it is a matter of  the LDP's interparty affairs.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Banks' German subsidiaries face an uncertain future if the merger goes through - The Battle for Midland IT IS easy to forget that two of Germany's leading investment banks are owned by Lloyds Bank and Midland Bank, so discreetly is the arms length relationship conducted on both sides. Midland owns 80 per cent of Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt, the Dusseldorf bank which specialises in innovative securities dealing, while Lloyds has more than 75 per cent of Frankfurt-based Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst which concentrates on institutional stockbroking and fund management. What will happen to them if a merger between the UK banks goes through? At this stage, the future of the German banks must have a low priority for their parents. First of all, the legal complexities of any merger would have to be negotiated. Then, the initial concentration if a deal took place would be on sorting out the British operations. Both Trinkaus and SMH are profitable and have high reputations, so no immediate action would be necessary in Germany. Clearly, however, a merged UK bank would have to consider whether it needed two private German banks, however successful. This raises the question of sale or merger. Trinkaus is a quoted company, so its sale would conceivably be easier. There have been market rumours in the past that Midland might be forced to sell the bank, but it has asserted that it intends to keep Trinkaus. Lloyds, for its part, has sold off some of its smaller foreign operations, but has hung on to SMH. Alternatively, the German banks could merge, especially since their operations complement each other rather than overlap. This then raises the question of style and personal chemistry and again is something Lloyds and Midland would certainly not address at the start of any merger. At present, the German banks are clearly happy with the policy of non-interference followed by their UK owners. 'We do not have griffins (the Midland emblem) stamped all over us", said Mr Herbert Jacobi, Trinkaus's senior partner. Before Midland came on the scene in 1980, Trinkaus was owned by Citibank of the US, which had tended to neglect securities dealing in favour of commercial business. Since then, it has developed its strength as an innovator on the capital markets and is also active in commercial banking and asset management. Lloyds rescued SMH after it nearly collapsed in the early 1980s over a lending scandal. Three years ago, it sold about 5 per cent of its holding to the German bank's partners and management to help it cultivate its identity as a specifically German private bank. A month ago, SMH, which concentrates on institutional stockbroking and fund management, announced its first capital-raising exercise in eight years with a planned rise in equity capital of DM40m to DM180m (Pounds 61.2m).</p>

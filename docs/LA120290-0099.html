			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> KUWAIT CHILDREN IN EXILE SKETCH MIXTURE OF HOPE AND ANGER, SNAKES, TANKS,  PLANES  </P> <P> American warplanes and tanks pound Iraq's armed forces as the world kicks Iraq  out of Kuwait. Or, an Iraqi snake strangles the Persian Gulf emirate.  </P> <P> Such images -- drawn or colored by Kuwaiti children -- display a curious  mixture of anger at Iraqi President Saddam Hussein with an almost naive hope  that their country will be freed soon.  </P> <P> Kuwaiti youth aged 4 to 18 composed the drawings in exile in the last few  months in the Geneva area, where hundreds of families have stayed or fled to  after the Iraqi invasion in August.  </P> <P> Their imaginative artwork was displayed in an exhibition in London and Geneva  in November, and the organizers plan to take it to Vienna, Paris and other  cities in the next few months.  </P> <P> "He's no good," Nora, 4, said of the Iraqi leader. "He killed Kuwaitis. He  burned houses in Kuwait. He destroyed cars. He exhausted the petrol."  </P> <P> But she added hopefully: "Kuwait will be returned."  </P> <P> Nora had drawn a simple picture of a Kuwaiti child giving flowers to the emir  of Kuwait and to President Bush -- on whom many of the children seem to pin  their hopes.  </P> <P> Other drawings portrayed a strong arm of the United Nations plucking Saddam off  the world, or a man with a globe as a head booting an Iraqi soldier out.  </P> <P> One picture has small, white-robed Kuwaitis tying up a giant Saddam, swastika  on his officer's cap, and staking him to the ground while raising Kuwaiti flags  once again -- reflecting the small but growing Kuwaiti army training to fight  Iraq.  </P> <P> Although the U.S. Navy did help escort Kuwaiti oil out of the Gulf during the  latter part of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, most Gulf Arabs seemed embarrassed by  their friendship with Washington -- until Iraq took over Kuwait.  </P> <P> The children in this exhibition made clear, however, that they are friends of  any who came to their aid.  </P> <P> Eleven-year-old May depicted children of France, Italy, Germany, the United  States, Japan, Turkey and Egypt offering their help and sympathy to a crying  Kuwaiti girl.  </P> <P> For every sign of hope, however, there was one of sadness or hatred.  </P> <P> "I'm very angry. Saddam is like a snake. He's a crazy man. He took my country,"  said 12-year-old Shoroq, standing in front of her graphic depiction of a snake  squeezing the life out of the map of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Another depicted a dog biting the hand -- in the national Kuwaiti colors of  red, green, black and white -- that fed it. Kuwait had provided billions of  dollars to help Iraq in its war with Iran.  </P> <P> Iraqi jets drop bombs while Iraqi soldiers fire on a flaming house in the  imagination of 6-year-old Sheikha. Inside the house, tears fall from the cheeks  of two tiny children waving flags.  </P> <P> Saddam is depicted variously as a blood-dripping, fanged Dracula, as a lazy man  on a settee watching his Kuwait in a bird cage, or as a shark or vacuum cleaner  swallowing up all Kuwait's goods.  </P> <P> One rear view portrays an Iraqi soldier showing "friendship" with his arm  around the shoulder of a white-robed Kuwaiti. Behind the Iraqi's back he holds  a sharp dagger.  </P> <P> "Most of the bloody pictures are by the kids who were in Kuwait at the time of  the invasion. Those who were outside the country used their imagination based  on what they heard," said banker Mahmood, one of the organizers.  </P> <P> Like others at the Geneva exhibition, he asked that his family name not be  revealed for fear of Iraqi reprisals against his relatives.  </P> <P> "Our children are not enjoying their childhood. They don't play. They sit and  talk about how they can play a trick on Saddam, or how to kill him," said  Mahmood, himself a father.  </P> <P> Another of the organizers, 21-year-old Kuwait University student Huda,  explained the feeling most of the Kuwaiti exile community seemed to feel toward  fighting to drive out Saddam, a sentiment that the children have taken on and  understood.  </P> <P> "We don't want war. But if he refuses to get out of Kuwait, this is the only  solution. He refuses every peaceful solution."  </P></p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Details of sale of Total stake revealed THE French government plans to sell 22.9m Total shares, representing a 12.4 per cent stake in the oil company, by July 10, if market conditions permit, Reuter reports from Paris. According to the Finance Ministry, the sale will be spilt into three tranches, a French tranche of about 8m shares, a public placement in the US of about 7.4m shares, and an international placement of about 7.5m shares. It will also exchange four Total investment certificates for three ordinary shares, as announced on May 15, the ministry added. The offer represents 6.5 per cent of Total's capital, it said. General plans for both operations were announced in May. As announced, the operation will cut the government's stake in Total to 15 from 34 per cent. The government will then have only two representatives on Total's board instead of four. The state will still have some exceptional rights over Total relating to protection of national interests and will be able to veto the nomination of the company's chairman, but it will no longer be able to veto the choice of board members and directors. Subscriptions to the public offer in France will be open for three days according to a schedule which will be given at a later date, the ministry said. The other two tranches will run according to the same schedule, it added. Total shares shed FFr5.30 to close at FFr250.70 yesterday. In a separate statement, Total said the exchange of shares for certificates would involve 12.1m Total shares. The US offer of 7.4m shares is equivalent to about 14.8m American Depositary Shares, it added. The state will also sell shares representing 7.7 per cent of Total to state-owned financial institutions, it said. Insurers Assurances Generales de France and Groupement des Assurances Nationales already own 2.3 per cent of Total.</p>

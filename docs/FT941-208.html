			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Fears revive in Belize Belize says neighbouring Guatemala has revived its claim to Belizean territory, despite an interim agreement reached two years ago between the two Central American countries, Canute James reports from Kingston. The Belizeans say Guatemala's 130-year-old claim was revived in a letter sent this month by the government to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, saying that an end to Guatemala's claim on the former British colony would come only with a final treaty. The latest Guatemalan statement coincides with the dismantling of a 1,500-strong British garrison which had been stationed in Belize to discourage the Guatemalan military from invading in pursuit of the territorial claim.</p>

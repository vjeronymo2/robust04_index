			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Mosaic shares drop to 19p as trading resumes SHARES IN Mosaic Invest-ments, the Birmingham-based mini-conglomerate which has been reorganising its business and finances for the last nine months, fell by two-thirds to 19p when they resumed trading yesterday. The shares were suspended on September 29 last year at 60p after the group had failed to raise finance for the redemption of preference shares and had to pass a dividend it had already announced. Since then Mr Hugh Sykes, chairman and company doctor, has been putting together the complex restructuring and reorganisation package. A sharp reduction in the share price had been expected following the restructuring which included debt for equity swaps and lifted the number of issued shares from 17.1m to 34.4m. The restructuring, approved by shareholders at an extraordinary meeting earlier this week, involved converting preference shares into ordinary shares at the rate of 20p each. New banking facilities have been put in place together with a number of board changes. Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, who has been on Mosaic's board since 1987 has now resigned as a non-executive director in view of his other business commitments. He briefly acted as temporary chairman before Mr Sykes was appointed and confirmed yesterday that he retains a 'not very significant stake' in the group.</p>

The meeting was presided over by Zhong Qihuang. Wu Guanzhen  and Lu Xiuzhen spoke at the meeting.    In his speech, Governor Wu Guanzhen fully confirmed the  province's achievements in last year's press and publicity work.  He thanked central press unit reporters stationed in Jiangxi  and Jiangxi reporters for their hard work and expressed his  Lunar New Year greetings to them.    He stressed: In this year's economic work, the province  should pay attention to three main points: The first is  strengthening agricultural and rural work to ensure an increase  in peasant income. The second is strengthening basic facilities  construction to improve Jiangxi's investment environment in  three to five years. The third is concentrating efforts on  reform, opening up, introducting foreign capital, and expanding  exports.    He hoped that central press unit reporters stationed in  Jiangxi as well as provincial and city reporters would make  further efforts to give wide publicity to Jiangxi's development.    In his speech, Lu Xiuzhen requested Jiangxi reporters to  continue to give publicity to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to uphold the  policy of unity, stability, boosting the morale, and positive  dissemination, to strengthen guidance over publicity, to  properly organize reports on reform, to propagate Jiangxi's  achievements overseas, and to improve the ranks of journalists.</p>

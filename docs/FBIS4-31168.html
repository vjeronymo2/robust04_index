			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic] </F>   [Excerpt] Again no favorable news from Gorazde: As of this  morning no withdrawal by the chetniks from their positions in  the three-kilometer exclusion zone have taken place. On the  right bank of the Drina River they are just a few hundred meters  from the town, while on the left bank they are still within 2.5  kilometers of the center of town.    The quibbling over whether these are soldiers, police, or  armed civilians is more than pointless. When all is said and  done uniforms have never killed anyone in this war. [passage  omitted]</p>

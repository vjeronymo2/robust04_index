			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Healthcare reforms constrain sales of medicines HEALTHCARE reforms and changes in the customer base have constrained the drugs markets in both the US and the European Union this year. Sales in pharmacies in the seven largest European markets fell from Dollars 33.7bn to Dollars 30.2bn in the first eight months, but were affected adversely by currency depreciation. Excluding exchange rates, there was a 1 per cent increase, according to figures compiled by IMS International, the specialist research-based company. The European market was held back by the effects of healthcare reform in Germany and Italy. Sales in Germany fell from Dollars 9.6bn to Dollars 8.2bn, a drop of 10 per cent at constant exchange rates. The Italian market fell from Dollars 7.47bn to Dollars 6.6bn, a drop of 3 per cent excluding currencies. Sales in the UK also fell, from Dollars 3.6bn to Dollars 3.3bn, but increased at constant rates by 11 per cent. Those in Spain also fell from Dollars 3.3bn to Dollars 3bn, but rose 12 per cent excluding currencies. The Spanish market could slow in coming months, following the introduction of measures to control drugs spending. The French market continued to grow, up from Dollars 7.7bn to Dollars 7.9bn or 7 per cent at constant rates. The Dutch market was up 13 per cent, from Dollars 979m to Dollars 1bn, while sales in Belgium were static in dollar terms at Dollars 1bn, but increased 6 per cent excluding currencies. The US market increased 4 per cent from Dollars 27.8bn to Dollars 28.8bn. Compared with 19 per cent in 1991, growth is anaemic. Sales have been hit by patent expiries and increasing use of generic products, as well as greater discounting to bulk-buyers of medicines which are becoming increasingly aggressive The Japanese hospital market increased 13 per cent at constant rates, up from Dollars 9.9bn to Dollars 12.8bn. However, the market is likely to be hit next year when the health ministry is expected to implement one of its biennial prices cuts - expected to be about 7 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------      WORLD PHARMACY DRUG PURCHASES JANUARY-AUGUST 1993                         (Dollars bn)*  ----------------------------------------------------------------                             Europe        US       Japan Cardiovascular               6.759     4.696       1.961 Alimentary/metabolism        5.128     4.572       2.440 Anti-infectives              3.331     4.772         653 Central nervous system       2.784     2.703       1.761 Respiratory                  2.869     2.942       1.055 Musculo-skeletal             1.648     1.459       1.242 Blood/organs                 1.476     1.186         954 Others                       6.233     6.476       2.767  ---------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                       30.228    28.806      12.833  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Increase %**                     1         4          13  ---------------------------------------------------------------- *Hospital market only. **Excluding currencies.

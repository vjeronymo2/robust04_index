Asked by journalists when the Partnership for Peace,  the American scheme which he called "small but beautiful" would  become a "big step," the president said that it depended, among  other things, on western public opinion as well as on how the  mass media would present the participation of former communist  states in NATO.    Asked whether he assessed the Prague meeting as a success,  the president replied: "As the birth of new concepts which  certainly proceed in the same direction, but the issue is the  tempo and how advantage can be taken of certain situations which  are appearing. I am such an activist who takes advantage of any  suitable moment-- there are other strategists who just, step by  step, follow the marked out path."    The president disagreed with an opinion that talks between  Clinton and Boris Yeltsin in Moscow will decide on the real  outcome of the Prague meeting. "Moscow does play a significant  role on the map of the world and from that point of view we  always have to take it into account," the president said. In  the president's view the Visegrad Group does not have to "show  its force" any more which was necessary when its member-states  were demanding the dissolution of the Warsaw Treaty. As Walesa  put it, today the time had come for hard work for the countries  which belong to the Group, the work based upon the establishing  of economic cooperation.</p>

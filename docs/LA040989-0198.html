			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOROS AND DONALD STILL TIED FOR LEAD  </P> <P> Jim Booros and Mike Donald shot four-under-par 66s Saturday to continue sharing  the lead in the $200,000 Deposit Guaranty golf tournament.  </P> <P> The two players, close friends off the course, were at 199 after 54 holes on  the Hattiesburg Country Club's 6,280-yard course.  </P> <P> "I would rather play with a friend like this," Booros said. "Mike said a few  things that relaxed me."  </P> <P> Robert Thompson, David Peoples and Fred Funk shot 65s, and Lance Ten Broeck,  who was in third place by himself going into the round, had a 67. All were at  201.  </P> <P> P.H. Horgan III, whose 64 was the day's best round was at 202 with Steve Lowery  and Bob Wolcott. Lowery shot a 65 and Wolcott a 66.  </P> <P> Donald, third at the Woodlands last week after leading for three rounds,  started fast Saturday with three straight birdies.  </P> <P> He dropped back with bogeys on the sixth and ninth holes but made three more  birdies on the back nine.  </P> <P> Booros, who has held or shared the lead in all three rounds here, had an  eagle-3 on the 482-yard third hole and a fine save for par at No. 6.  </P> <P> He birdied Nos. 11 and 13, had a bogey at the 15th and finished with a birdie  on the 18th. The bogey was only his second of the tournament.  </P></p>

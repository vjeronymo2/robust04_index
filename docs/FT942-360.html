			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hunters Armley rises 28% Investment in production facilities helped Hunters Armley, the web offset commercial printing company, push pre-tax profits up by 28 per cent in the six months to March 31. Sales improved 21 per cent to Pounds 19.8m Operating profits rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 1.5m and after a net interest charge of Pounds 251,000 (Pounds 172,000), pre-tax profits stood at Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 973,000). A 1-for-4 rights issue in May, which raised Pounds 9.4m, helped reduce gearing which stood at 84 per cent, on net debt of Pounds 6.28m at the half year. Following capital expenditure of Pounds 1.16m in the first half, the company plans to spend Pounds 5.6m over the next nine months, mainly on completing the second phase of a printing facility in Bradford. Mr David Bird, chairman, said the Bradford plant, which houses the latest in web offset, sheetfed presses and finishing equipment, had contributed significantly to improved sales and operating margins. He added that the development of pre-press facilities had enabled the company to improve product quality and win new customers. Further investment in artwork and graphic reproduction was planned. 'The development of the production facilities means we are as well placed as any other in the industry to take advantage of the pick up in the market,' he said. An interim dividend of 1.32p (1.25p) is declared on improved earnings per share of 3.99p (3.15p). Yesterday the shares closed up 7p at 170p.</p>

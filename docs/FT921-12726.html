			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Observer: Cradle robbery Of what does a Londoner have 1 1/2 times more than a New Yorker, 2 1/2 times more than a Parisian, and 11 1/2 times more than a citizen of Tokyo? The answer is available park space. And Tokyo's per capita average of a mere 2.6 square metres to London's 30 is combining with another Japanese statistic to cause the Tokyo authorities to contemplate re-writing a well known proverb to read: What you lose on the swings, you gain in the bathchairs. With Japan's birthrate at a record low and forecast to keep falling into the next century, the share of the population made up of over-65s is expected to rise from its present 10 per cent to 25 by the year 2019. So planners are considering pruning Tokyo's parks of the seesaws and such for weenies, and replacing them with diversions for wrinklies. One of them, says the construction ministry, is a croquet-like game called gateball. Other possibilities include greenhouses for elderly gardeners and cafes serving green tea.</p>

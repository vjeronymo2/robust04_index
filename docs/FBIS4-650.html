			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria April 14 SAPA -- Defence Minister Kobie  Coetsee has instructed senior SADF [South African Defense Force]  officers to communicate with the Lesotho Defence Force in order  to calm the situation in that country following reports of  another military mutiny.    Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Lesotho's Prime Minister Dr  Ntsu Mokhehle told a South African embassy official that the  Lesotho Defence Force arrested the Deputy Premier S. Baholo and  three other ministers on Thursday [14 April]. The prime  minister was deeply concerned about their personal safety, Mr  Botha said.    "The head of the Lesotho Defence Force could not be traced.  At the time of the meeting with the prime minister no-one knew  anything about his whereabouts."    Lesotho's prime minister requested immediate South African  mediation with the Lesotho Defence Force.    "I informed the South African Minister of Defence Mr Kobie  Coetsee about the situation and he is giving instructions for  senior members of the SADF to communicate with the Lesotho  Defence Force in an attempt to calm the situation and to find a  solution to the present crisis," Mr Botha said.    He had also informed the Transitional Executive Council's  [TEC] sub-committee on foreign affairs of the events in Lesotho  as well as the foreign minister of Zimbabwe. President Robert  Mugabe was the chairman of the committee consisting of Botswana,  Zimbabwe and South Africa which had been involved for the last  few months in assisting the Lesotho Government and the Lesotho  Defence Force in finding a solution to a dispute that has  threatened the country's stability.    "The South African Government and the TEC appeal to the  Lesotho Defence Force to abandon its present course of action  and to avoid bloodshed at any cost," Mr Botha said.    The South African Government wished to emphasize that it  would not recognize any government that endeavoured to come into  being through violence. Steps would be considered in  conjunction with Zimbabwe and Botswana on how to deal with the  present situation, Mr Botha said.    In the meantime South Africans were cautioned not to visit  Lesotho until greater clarity emerged on the situation. Mr  Botha appealed to those reponsible for arresting the ministers  concerned not to inflict any physical or other harm upon them.    The South African Government stood ready to negotiate with  the officers concerned for the ministers' release, which may or  may not include safe conduct to South Africa.    An international task force earlier found that the Basotho  people should solve their own political and military problems,  although South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana were prepared to  assist in this regard. This was the essence of the findings of  the task force which investigated the Lesotho situation  following earlier instances of military insurrection.    The three countries' heads of state met in Gaborone in  January and, following an appeal for assistance from the Lesotho  Government, instructed the task force to investigate fighting  amongst factions of the country's defence force.    Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira told a news  conference in Pretoria in January: "We are trying to assist the  Basotho people to solve their own political and military  problems.    "The (task force) stressed this factor in this report and  the  heads of state will be appraised of this fact also.    "It is a Basotho problem that must be solved by the  Basothos."</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Domtex suffers from recession DOMINION Textile, Canada's only surviving integrated textile group, had big losses in the third quarter and nine months due to the North American recession and high raw material costs. However, it said the denim market, in which it is a North American leader, and the yarn and carpet-backing markets are showing signs of picking up and it expects improvement in the final quarter ending June 30. The third-quarter loss was CDollars 23.4m (Dollars 20.10m), or 73 cents a share, against a net profit of CDollars 1.5m a year earlier when nothing was attributable to the common stock after preferred dividends. Sales were CDollars 302m against CDollars 317m. The nine months' loss was CDollars 58.5m, or CDollars 1.93 a share, against net profit of CDollars 16.8m, or 44 cents a share, on sales of CDollars 913m against CDollars 1bn.</p>

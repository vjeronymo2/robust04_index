			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Technology: Collapsing the system without getting the sack - Simulators are being used for training, design and crisis management If power engineers have nightmares, they probably include hurricanes, thunderstorms, blizzards, bolts of lightning, generating equipment failures and severe voltage losses - anything likely to threaten the electricity system or even collapse it. For most of them - at least in the National Grid system along which electricity is distributed in England and Wales - such incidents never occur in real life. Only around 20 per cent of those controlling the power system ever experience any emergencies. Thus when the National Grid planned its new Pounds 80m control network, brought into operation last October, it included a sophisticated training simulator designed to give those engineers who had only worked trouble-free shifts a taste of what to expect when chaos intervened and nightmares came to life. 'We're not trying to frighten them,' says Steve Allamby, lead instructor. 'But people on shift can go for a number of years without seeing major faults. So we put them under very onerous multiple fault conditions like hurricanes.' Every one of the control engineers at the National Grid's four regional centres and the national control centre in Wokingham, Berkshire, is being put through the simulator course. 'This is the only place in the British Isles where you can collapse the system and not get the sack,' says Gordon Stirrat, head of the simulator training operation. Teams of engineers from around England and Wales - Scotland's power distribution is handled by the generating companies - spend two days at the simulator in St Albans, just north of London in Hertfordshire. If Wokingham goes down for any reason, the St Albans facility can rapidly be switched over from training to run the whole National Grid. On the simulator, engineers are subjected to several scenarios of growing severity. These are based on possible conditions in their own areas, so that engineers from the south could be faced with winds from the English Channel or a sudden failure in electricity imports from France, while those in the north could have ice and snowstorms. The instructors can use the simulation software to build up the series of events so that the engineers have to cope with a 'cascade effect', as Stirrat puts it. The faults are usually related, but it is not always obvious which one is potentially the most serious. If the engineers are coping too easily, extra faults can be introduced to stretch their abilities further. To add to the confusion, a report can be phoned in of someone having climbed a pylon, so that power has to be routed around it. The effects on the power system of the hurricanes of 1987 in south-eastern England can be recreated, as can the vicious countrywide snowstorms of 1990 which caused even more damage. A band of lightning which tends to sweep across the south-east coast and up to East Anglia through London is also featured. In the midst of coping with all this, an instructor can distract the engineers by pretending to be a regional grid manager and march on to the control floor demanding an instant report on what is happening. Each session lasts around two hours, with those on the simulator sitting at a bank of computers in front of a large screen with a detailed diagram of the National Grid. Engineers from the regions look at the part of the screen containing their own power stations, sub-stations and electricity lines. Flashing lights and indicators alert them to problems, to which they react by studying their screens and telephoning experts along the network to find out what is happening and have matters put right. The roles of those at the other end of the telephone are played by instructors and team members not involved in the session. They sit in a room overlooking the simulator floor. As well as seeing how those on the simulator handle the incidents, with only a few minutes available for some solutions, the instructors also observe how well and coolly the senior team member analyses events. Generally, says Stirrat, engineers react correctly to the incidents thrown at them. If they make mistakes, it is important they are aware of why things went wrong. No one has yet found it all too much and walked off the floor, but Stirrat recalls that an engineer did throw up his hands in (presumably) mock despair once and cry out: 'I surrender.'</p>

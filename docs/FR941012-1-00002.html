Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule proposes to implement section 904 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 3544; hereafter referred to as the ``McKinney Act''), as amended by section 903 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992 (1992 HCD Act) and section 3003 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, approved August 10, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 904 of the McKinney Act authorizes HUD to require applicants and participants and adult members of their families in any HUD program involving initial and periodic review of an applicant's or participant's income to sign a consent form authorizing: (1) HUD, the PHA, or the owner to verify employee income information from current or previous employers; and (2) HUD or the PHA to request wage and claim information from the State agency responsible for the administration of the State unemployment laws. On February 22, 1991, the Department published a final rule implementing section 904 of the McKinney Act (56 FR 7518). In accordance with section 904(b) of the McKinney Act, HUD regulations make signing the consent form an explicit condition of initial or continuing eligibility for participation in the covered programs. This requirement is designed to ensure that correct determinations of eligibility for assistance and level of assistance are made under these programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 903 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (1992 Act) amends section 904 of the McKinney Act by adding a subsection (e) to section 904. Section 904(e) prohibits the Department from requiring the release of information by third parties as a condition of receiving housing assistance unless the requested consent for information is in compliance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) and is appropriately limited as to time, relevance and necessity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Fight for riverboat inquest renewed The mothers of two victims of the 1989 Marchioness riverboat disaster on the Thames yesterday renewed their legal bid to force the reopening of an inquest into the tragedy before a new coroner. Lawyers for the women accused Dr Paul Knapman, the coroner who conducted the basic inquest into the incident in which 51 people died, of being unreasonable in refusing to conduct a fuller inquiry. He was also accused of showing 'apparent bias' to the extent that he should disqualify himself from any further hearing. The Court of Appeal was told that Dr Knapman had described one of the mothers to a newspaper as being 'unhinged'. He had written in a letter that others among the bereaved were mentally unwell, said Mr Daniel Brennan QC for the two women. Mr Brennan said the collision between the pleasure boat and a dredger was unique among recent catastrophes in that there had been no public inquiry or full inquest. The hearing was adjourned until today.</p>

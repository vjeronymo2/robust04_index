			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from respondents Mia Rose Products, Inc., a California corporation, and Mia Rose Palencar, individually and as an officer of the corporation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and take other appropriate action or make final the agreement's proposed order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This matter concerns two products, named ``Air Therapy'' and ``Pet Air,'' sold by Mia Rose Products, Inc. (``the company''). Air Therapy and Pet Air are air sprays made from the essential oils of citrus fruit and/or herbs. These two products have identical ingredients, and are both sold for their alleged air freshening, air cleaning and insecticidal effects. The Commission's complaint charges that respondents' advertising contained false and unsubstantiated representations that these products are effective in eliminating indoor air pollutants and household insects. Specifically, the complaint alleges that respondents falsely represented that: (1) These products are effective in cleaning or purifying indoor air; (2) these products are more effective in cleaning or purifying indoor air than conventional air cleaning products; (3) spraying these products into the air eliminates smoke; (4) spraying these products into the air eliminates pollen; (5) spraying these products into the air eliminates airborne bacteria; (6) spraying Pet Air into the air eliminates pet dander; (7) spraying Air Therapy into the air eliminates household insects; and (8) spraying these products into the air eliminates, rather than masks, odors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. Part I of the proposed order would prohibit the company from making any of the false claims delineated above for Air Therapy, Pet Air, or any products with substantially similar ingredients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part II of the proposed order includes broad fencing-in relief, requiring the respondents to cease and desist from representing the efficacy or performance of any air cleaning, air freshening, or insecticidal product unless such representation is true, and at the time of making such representation, Mia Rose possesses and relies upon competent and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part IV of the proposed order is a provision that allows the company a period of four months from the date the proposed order becomes final before it is obligated to re-word its labeling on its current inventory of Air Therapy and Pet Air cans. All other provisions of the order become effective immediately upon the Commission's issuance of the order as final. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed order also requires the respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate claims covered by the order; to provide a copy of the consent agreement to all employees or representatives involved in the preparation and placement of the company's advertisements, or in communication with the company's customers or prospective customers; to notify the Commission of any changes in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order; to notify the Commission of certain changes in the business or employment of the named individual respondent; and to file one or more reports detailing compliance with the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald S.

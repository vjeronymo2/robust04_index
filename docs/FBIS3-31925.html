			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Celis; from the "Guatemala Flash" newscast] </F>   [Text] Another large group of peasants has already reached  the corner of 7th Avenue and Roosevelt Street in the Zone 11.  Here with us is someone who will give us some details about the  demonstration. It is already headed downtown. It left the  assembly area approximately 15 minutes ago. They said they are  headed downtown, and will pass by the Supreme Court of Justice  and the Congress and will wind up at the National Palace. Let  us listen:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified person, shouting] [Words  indistinct]    [Celis] What is your name?    [Tilin] Juan Tilin.    [Celis] Why is this large number of peasants demonstrating?    [Tilin] This is one of the demonstrations scheduled for  today  to continue to demand that the Government provide a concrete  response to the petition we presented on 16 November demanding a  minimum wage for farm workers. We made the formal request on 16  November to the government, to the Labor Ministry, to the proper  officials so that we would get better wages for farm workers in  view of the difficult moment we are experiencing. The most  difficult economic situation is evidenced in the farms along the  southern coast, in farms in diverse parts of the country where  the workers don't even receive minimum wages. Furthermore, the  treatment accorded to the workers is infrahuman. The Labor  Ministry has done nothing up to now. That is the reason for  this demonstration. [end recording]    [Celis] We can tell you that at El Trebol there is a large  group of peasants of the GAM [Mutual Support Group] who are  waiting for the two groups coming from Aguilar Batres and  Roosevelt Avenues to join them in order to march together to  downtown. As we reported earlier, another large group of  peasants is marching on the Salvador highway and another on the  highway to the Atlantic. They will meet at the National Palace  to submit their petitions to the president and tell him about  the problems the farm workers in the interior are experiencing.</p>

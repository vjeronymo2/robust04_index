			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance returns to black - Pounds 350m turnround achieved by emphasis on sound underwriting Sun Alliance, one of the UK's largest insurers, returned to profit in 1993, after three consecutive years of losses, with Pounds 221.7m pre-tax, against losses of Pounds 129.6m. The group said the turnround was achieved by an emphasis on sound underwriting and generating sufficient profits on the general insurance business to absorb continuing losses on its domestic mortgage indemnity business. The year also saw a strengthening of the balance sheet, with shareholders funds rising by Pounds 465m to Pounds 2.01bn and solvency - net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income - returning to 64 per cent, compared with the 54 per cent of last year. Earnings per share were 22.3p, against losses of 16.1p and the board is recommending a final dividend of 9.5p, for a total of 14.75p (14.25p). The shares closed the day 12p up at 326p. Premium income from general insurance in Sun Alliance UK fell slightly to Pounds 996m (Pounds 1.01bn), but was accompanied by a return to underwriting profit of Pounds 3m against losses of Pounds 190m. General insurance business in Sun Alliance International generated premium income of Pounds 859m, up from Pounds 825. Losses on underwriting were lower at Pounds 136m (Pounds 248m). Though underwriting of the general business in Sun Alliance Overseas once again made a loss of Pounds 110m, premium income was up sharply, to Pounds 1.54bn (Pounds 1.3bn). The life side premium income rose to Pounds 394m (Pounds 260m). This increase came partly from the acquisition of Hafnia in Denmark during the year. On the life side Sun Alliance suffered a drop in its premium income in the UK to Pounds 740m (Pounds 1.04bn) as a result of a fall in its single premium business, although its annual premium income rose. The group said that it had been prepared to sacrifice some market share rather than write business at a loss. Mr Roger Taylor, who will be group chief executive from July, warned that the favourable recent period of mild weather would not last, and said that in many classes of insurance premium rates were too low for the risks being underwritten. Sun Alliance is not making any special provision for potential compensation to be paid to any of its 18,000 clients who had transferred out of occupational pension schemes. See Lex</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Ministers accept principle of loans to Latin America THE European Investment Bank (EIB) is to be allowed to lend to Latin America and to countries with which the European Community has co-operation agreements, European finance ministers agreed on Saturday. The decision mainly affects Latin America, as the EC has separate arrangements for other regions. Ministers set a ceiling of Ecu250m (Pounds 175m) annually over three to four years for EIB lending for projects to be agreed on a case-by-case basis. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, was enthusiastic about the agreement, which will be reviewed in three years. He said: 'We've broken the barrier preventing Latin America from getting EIB loans.' Spain and Portugal, which have close ties with Latin America, had been pressing to allow EIB lending to the region. A mechanism to establish guarantees for the loans has yet to be established. Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said France was not in favour of guarantees coming from the Community's budget, but he expected a solution within weeks. The EC foreign ministers stressed the importance of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in co-ordinating financial assistance to the states of the former Soviet Union. This did not exclude an EC role, said Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, Portugal's finance minister. But Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor, was more cautious, saying that 'until these countries have IMF programmes in place, (EC) assistance would not be appropriate'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- An official from the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] said  here today that the country has taken strict measures to protect  the intellectual property rights [IPR] involved in technology  imports.    These include proprietary technology, technical know-how,  trademarks and computer software, he said.    Addressing the '94 Beijing International Symposium on  Intellectual Property Protection, Zhao Chunhua, deputy director  of department of science and technology, said that the measures  include allowing each foreign software owner to register of his  own will his software with the China computer software  registration agency to safeguard his property interests.    Meanwhile, the quantity of imports of certain foreign  computer software that is stipulated in the software license  contract constitutes the base for China to exercise its  administration of the domestic market, in order to prohibit and  punish any acts of imitation or illegal copying of the relevant  software.    According to incomplete statistics, China's trade volume of  computer software by now has exceeded several hundred million  U.S. dollars.    Zhao Chunhua noted that China has promulgated the patent  law,  the law against unfair competition, the trademark law and the  copyright law, which provide the legal basis to protect  intellectual property rights involved in technology imports.    "Moreover," Zhao said, "regulations on technology imports  are  now being deliberated and will soon be formulated."    He told the 130-plus participants of the symposium that  China  also allows the recipients of technical know-how to conclude,  before importation, a "secrecy-divulging agreement" with the  foreign suppliers, to pay necessary expenses and to undertake  necessary responsibility for keeping secrets.    Zhao added that foreign suppliers are also allowed to impose  necessary and reasonable restrictions on people who have access  to the know-how, and to place reasonable restrictions on areas  where the products manufactured with the know-how are sold.    In using foreign suppliers' trademarks to produce or market  products, Chinese recipients are ordered to vindicate the  reputation of the trademark, while the quality and property of  the products that are manufactured by the recipient and bear the  supplier's trademark must conform to the quality and property of  the products bearing the original trademark.    Foreign suppliers also have the right to exercise necessary  supervision and guidance over the production and marketing of  the products bearing the suppliers' trademark through proper and  reasonable means.    Zhao pointed out that in the process of importing foreign  patented technology, the patented technology whose supplier  fails to provide sufficient proof or guarantee for the validity  of the right of the patented technology is not permitted to be  imported into China.    Meanwhile, it is stipulated in the contract of patent  technology imports that recipients of the technology in China  and foreign technology supplier should conclude contracts  specifying the scope and duration of the use of the proper  patent in order to prevent proliferative use of the technology.    China also ordered that in the contract of patent technology  imports, there should be an explicit authorization clause.    Zhao Chunhua said that if disputes over intellectual  property  involved in technology imports arise, the two parties concerned  should first negotiate to avoid any hindrance to the smooth  implementation of the imported technology.    "If negotiations or mediation fail," Zhao added, "the two  sides may request arbitration or start legal proceedings in the  intellectual property divisions of China's courts."    China has so far set up such courts in Beijing, Shanghai,  Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan.    Zhao said that it has been proved that China's courts and  administrative authorities at various levels have pledged  continued efforts to enforce the law to the letter and bring to  justice violators of the intellectual property rights.    Moreover, a Sino-U.S. bilateral negotiation agency on  intellectual property has been set up under the Sino-U.S. joint  committee on commerce and trade.    "It provides a place where some disputes relevant to  intellectual property of the two countries are exchanged and  mediated regularly, thus playing a role in mediating and  settling disputes over intellectual property of the two  countries," Zhao concluded.</p>

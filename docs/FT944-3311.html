			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Students finding jobs more easily The number of UK university students finding a job within six months of graduating increased sharply last year, the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services revealed yesterday. The proportion finding permanent employment rose by 3 percentage points to 43.9 per cent, in spite of a 20 per cent increase in the overall number of graduates. The proportion of unemployed fell by 1 percentage point, but remains high compared with historic levels, at 11.7 per cent. Ms Margaret Wallis, director of the careers advisory service at the University of Warwick, suggested that increased graduate recruitment by small and medium-sized companies accounted for most of the rise. This was demonstrated by the continued fall in the number of large recruiters using the 'milk round', with interviews held on campuses. A survey by the University of Southampton has suggested the number of milk-round sessions booked by employers in 'old' universities (which held their status before polytechnics were upgraded to universities in 1992) will drop by 14 per cent next term from its level in the spring term this year. 'New' universities are likely to experience a sharper cut of 23 per cent in such bookings. Employers also appear increasingly to be targeting individual institutions, with only 308 visiting former polytechnics, while 1,574 have booked to visit old universities. There was also no revival in employment prospects for scientists, with civil and electrical engineering, physics, computing and sociology showing the highest unemployment rates, all at about 13 per cent. Instead, courses such as economics, geography, history and modern languages proved more popular with employers. Women were more likely to find permanent employment than men. Only 42.3 per cent of male graduates found permanent employment, compared with 45.4 per cent of female graduates. Ms Wallis said young women appeared to be more 'assiduous' in applying for jobs, and appeared better prepared at interviews. The association emphasised that the employment market was only recovering slowly. But Mr Nigel Llewellyn, national recruitment partner with Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, said: 'There is clear evidence that the market for graduates is turning up. As the output of graduates levels off, we could well see a squeeze on employers as candidates start to pick and choose. It's all a far cry from three years ago.' Careers services said employers took a strong academic record for granted, and wanted evidence of strong involvement in extra-curricular activities, and of interpersonal skills.

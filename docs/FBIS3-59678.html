			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On 2 September 1993 the United States and Russia  concluded a space cooperation agreement: basic agreement was  reached on a cooperation concept that would allow the Russian  Space Station MIR to dock with International Space Station  Freedom. While the handshake between the two space powers could  be viewed as invigorating the moribund Space Station Project,  one could also make the sober observation that the agreement  adds the unstable element of Russian participation. Japan, which  participates in the Space Station Project, has been asked for a  more nearly definite response than that sought from it up to now.    Following the signing of the agreement with Russian Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin, Vice President Gore emphasized that "two  countries, who have been competitors in space development, have  now entered an era of cooperation." The Vice President spoke as  though a powerful supporter had been added.    The United States had three basic reasons for taking the  decisive step of asking for Russian participation in the Space  Station Project at this point: reducing costs, using Russian  manned space technology built up by the operation of the MIR  Space Station, and utilizing large Russian rockets for  propulsion.    The construction budget under the original budget for Space  Station Freedom was said to be $30 to $40 billion, but under the  revised design the prospect is for costs to be held down as far  as to about $25 billion. Using Russian technology would enable  an even further reduction of consts.    As a result of the end of the Cold War there is no longer  any  need for the United States to compete with the former Soviet  Union in space. Moreover the fiscal-deficit reduction measures  advocated by President Clinton had strengthened the power of  those opposed to the Space Station and had done so at a time  when criticism of big science projects was mounting.    What made matters worse were the repeated delays of the  launch of the space shuttle "Discovery" and the failure of the  Mars probe "Mars Observer." The fragility of manned launch  methods was revealed and the U.S. space program came under  increased criticism in Congress due to the loss of the nearly $1  billion budget for the Mars Observer without having achieved any  results.    This crisis in U.S. space development accelerated  cooperation  in Russia. Naturally cooperation with the United States in space  would have various benefits for Russia, such as in obtaining  foreign currency. Russia is probably aiming to use cooperation  in the Space Station Freedom Project to gain a foothold in  entering the much desired Western space-services market.    Officials at Japan's Science and Technology Agency (STA)  concerned with the Space Station acknowledged that they were  almost completely taken by surprise when the United States and  Russia agreed to cooperate in space this way. Their reaction was  "who would have imagined that the United States would go as far  as docking Space Station Freedom to the Mir Space Station?"    A unilateral review bearing on the Space Station Project was  underway prompted by conditions on the U.S. side and it was on  the verge of causing Japanese distrust of the United States. For  a time members of STA and the National Space Development Agency  (NASDA) were seized with the uneasy feeling that the United  States might make another change in the program without  consulting them first. It was 9 September, two days after  signing the agreement with Russia, that the United States  formally briefed the countries with which it was cooperating,  such as Japan, about the agreement. Cooperating countries'  questions naturally focused on how Russia's participation would  affect the Space Station.    On that occasion the United States presented a space-station  design final draft that posited on quadrilateral participation  by the United States, Japan, Europe, and Canada. The United  States emphasized that it was a draft design flexible enough to  accomodate docking or not docking with Mir. STA officials  participating in the meeting stated that they were "somewhat  relieved to find that the United States was more cautious than  we had previously thought on considering Russian participation  in the Space Station." It seems, however, that Russia's  participation cannot avoid having some effect on the project.  For example, in order to enable joint use of the Space Station  by both the United States and Russia, the shuttle will have to  be launched to a higher orbit latitude than previously planned.  In that event the space shuttle's payload would be reduced and  there is a possibility that this would have an effect upon  scheduling and the scale of cooperating country facilities.    The United States points to the possibility that the overall  program will be expedited by Russia's participation. There are,  however, reports to the effect that the Japanese Experimental  Module (JEM) will be delayed by one to two years from its  initially planned 1999 launch. For the time being STA's stance  is to watch what the United States is doing.    Th U.S.-Russian agreement symbolizes the end of the Cold War  in the space area. In order to actually orbit a space station in  which the major nations of the world participate Japan will be  asked to take a different approach than it has up to now, such  as by closing its eyes to its convenience and switching to a  position supporting the project.</p>

The Cyprus New Agency reports  that an official statement on Abu's appointment will be issued  Monday [7 February] by EU Commissioner on Foreign Policy Hans  van den Broek during the EU Council of Ministers' meeting.    Speaking to correspondents following a meeting with Foreign  Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis in Brussels today, van den Broek  noted that the observer, as an employee of the EU, will brief  the relevant commissioners directly with special reports and  follow the developments in the negotiations. He said the EU  Commission will have a credible and responsible witness if it  ever wants a briefing. He added that Turkey accepts the observer  because he will only observe not participate the negotiations.  Mr. van den Broek expressed the conviction that Turkey will  cooperate in the promotion of the confidence-building measures.    Furthermore, van den Broek said after his meeting with  Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis that Cyprus' membership in the EU  will definitely take place but it is a matter of time. We  proceed very well and have good cooperation in the economic and  technical fields, said the commissioner. However, he added, we  cannot underestimate the political difficulties and obstacles  that must be overcome. Responding to a question on whether if  progress is made on the Cyprus talks the country's application  for membership will be discussed earlier than 1995, the  commissioner said that any positive development will be  seriously considered. However, he said he believes that the  political problems that must first be resolved are many and  serious, and that is why the January 1995 date remains. Our  efforts toward a solution to the Cyprus problem will continue,  he concluded, so that by January 1995 the dialogue will have  progressed with the achievement of significant steps.    In Brussels, Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis also met EU  Commissioner on Foreign Economic Trade Sir Leon Brittan.  Mikhailidhis asked the EU commissioner for the improvement and  expansion of the terms of the association agreement between the  EU and Cyprus beyond the fields defined by the agreement. Our  correspondent reports that Mikhailidhis asked for the dispatch  of EU experts to contribute to a better harmonization of the  Cyprus legislation with that of the EU. Mikhailidhis described  his two meetings, with van den Broek and Brittan, as substantial  and added that they took place in a very positive atmosphere.    Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis left Brussels for London,  where  he will meet with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.</p>

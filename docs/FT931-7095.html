			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / PowerGen seeks Pounds 140m pit payment POWERGEN, the electricity generator, is seeking government compensation of more than Pounds 140m over five years in return for agreeing to requests that it keep coal stocks at existing levels to help preserve some of the threatened 31 pits. Its negotiating stance suggests that the government package for saving pits may cost considerably more than the subsidy British Coal would need to enable it to sell some of its output at world coal prices. The British Coal subsidy is expected to be at least Pounds 500m over five years. Any money paid to PowerGen and National Power, the other generator for England and Wales, for holding stocks would add to this cost. National Power's plant capacity is 50 per cent larger than PowerGen's. PowerGen's stance on stocks is just one of the problems the government must overcome before finding a way out of its predicament. A leaked National Power letter showed last week that it is threatening the generators with legislation to force them to take more coal unless they reach a voluntary agreement. The Department of Trade and Industry's preferred solution depends on persuading the generators to buy 65.5m extra tonnes over five years. Whitehall sources say PowerGen has told the government that, without adjustments to the market, it believes the generators can take only 43m. National Power's estimate is 40m. Taking more than that, the generators say, would mean significant stockpiles and the 65.5m would be achievable only if either some of the expected growth in gas-fired or nuclear power was curtailed. PowerGen's claim for more than Pounds 140m for stockpiling arises because it wants to cut its stocks from 16m tonnes to 5m tonnes in the next few years. For the government to come anywhere near its 65.5m tonnes target, the generators would have to keep stocks at their present level and possibly raise them. PowerGen argues shareholders should not have to pay for the costs of excessive stocks and that government money is needed to compensate it for handling the stocks and for loss of interest on money tied up in stocks. National Power stocks amount to 18m tonnes, about three times above what it considers to be normal commercial levels. In both companies' cases, stocks are higher than anticipated at privatisation three years ago because of a fall in demand caused by the recession, stronger competition from nuclear power plants and a warm winter. National Power and PowerGen were committed to buying coal on three-year contracts which end next month.</p>

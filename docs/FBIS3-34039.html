			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Feb 2, INA -- AL-JUMHURIYAH daily of  Baghdad has said that the report of U.S President Bill Clinton  to the Congress is rife with lies and pre-fabricated tales with  the aim of keeping the blockade imposed on Iraq.    A paper article affirmed that President Clinton had misled  the supreme legislative authority and pushed it to back up an  inhumane and unjust policy, entirely intercepting values and  principles included in the U.S Constitution. This behaviour  simply contradicts the oath of presidency in which Clinton vowed  to perform his duties sincerely, the paper said. It added that  President Clinton had perpetrated the crime of insistence on  killing thousands of Iraqis through maintaining the blockade for  longer time.    If the Congress is loyal and sincere to the American  Constitution and its well-known duties, it should underline  Clinton's premeditation on lie and misleading the American  public opinion and the Congress and committing the crime of the  human race annihilation, the paper confirmed. It stressed that  Clinton's lies were another evidence of his political and moral  failure and bankruptcy and his weakness and reluctance.</p>

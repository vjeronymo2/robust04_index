			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz to return to profit Mercedes-Benz, the luxury car subsidiary of Germany's Daimler-Benz, will be back in the 'black' in 1994 following heavy losses of more than DM1.2bn (Dollars 760m) for 1993, Mr Helmut Werner, chairman of the board said yesterday in an end-of-year statement. However, he did not disclose the extent of the profits. At the same time, Mr Werner confirmed that world-wide group sales rose 9 per cent to DM70bn for 1994. The more optimistic results stem from an upswing in the US and west European economies, a trend which is expected to continue throughout next year. But Mr Werner added that the optimistic forecasts were also based on what he called a 'product offensive' in both business areas (cars and trucks), adding that Mercedes will start a complete renewal of van and truck programmes at the start of 1995 with the introduction of its new transport vans. This year, Mr Werner said car deliveries would rise by 15 per cent, or by more than 585,000 compared with 1993, while deliveries of trucks and buses would grow by a similar margin to 290,000. For 1995, he added that 'we expect an increase in deliveries of cars on the same scale as this year, despite the replacement of our E-Class, and a clear rise to over 300,000 units in commercial vehicles'. Next year, Mercedes-Benz expects its worldwide deliveries of cars to match 1994 levels, while deliveries of commercial vehicles should rise to more than 300,000 units from 290,000 in 1994.</p>

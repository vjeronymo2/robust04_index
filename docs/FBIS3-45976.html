At a luncheon given in honor of him by Gret Haller,  president  of the National Council of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland,  Qiao said China and Switzerland have a long history of friendly  contacts.    He said that since diplomatic ties were established between  the two countries in 1950, bilateral relations have developed  smoothly in the fields of politics, economy, culture, science  and technology.    Such relations have grown in an all-round way over the past  few years, Qiao said. The exchange of visits is on the increase  while bilateral trade has jumped and economic and technological  cooperation is fruitful.    "All these fully show that the friendly and cooperative  relations between the two countries based on mutual respect,  equality and mutual benefit have broad prospects," Qiao said.    He said China will implement a series of important reforms  on  taxation, finance and foreign trade this year.    As China's reform and opening up are going deeper, the  economy will become more vigorous and dynamic, he said, adding  that this will create more favorable conditions for furthering  the all-round friendly cooperation between China and Switzerland.    Qiao said China's NPC is willing to deepen the mutual  understanding and friendship between the two nations, expand  bilateral cooperation and make its due contributions to bringing  such relations to a new level.    He praised Switzerland, as an eternal neutral country and a  residing place of the European organizations of the United  Nations, for its unique contributions to promoting international  cooperation and safeguarding world peace.    In her speech, Haller extended her warm welcome to Qiao,  saying that it is her aspiration that the friendly cooperation  between the two countries and the two parliaments will be  further expanded.</p>

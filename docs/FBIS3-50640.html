Local clergyman Gonzalo Ituarte Verduzco said that airplanes  and a helicopter fired shots between 1700 and 1800 (2300 and  0000 GMT) near El Corralito, southeast of San Cristobal de la  Casas, and the armed groups responded from the ground.    San Cristobal de las Casas, one of the first cities seized  on  1 January and occupied the following day by armed men of the  so-called Zapatista National Liberation Army, is under the  control of civilian and military authorities.    The violent seizure of towns and Army attacks have left 96  dead, including 59 members of the armed groups, 22 policemen,  seven soldiers, and five civilians, according to official  reports.</p>

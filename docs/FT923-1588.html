			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (5): Change on the way - Banks and financial services THE steady expansion of Belize's economy over the past decade has placed new demands on its financial services sector. Changes are being made to domestic banking and the government is putting into place legislation to develop an offshore financial services sector. The 20-year-old Banking Act has worked well, says Mr Keith Arnold, governor of the central bank, but aspects of it need to be updated. The new act, similar to legislation in the Caribbean islands, will be completed by the end of next year. 'We are making sure that we do not encounter any problems, and we have learned lessons from developments such as those which have accompanied the operations of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International,' says Mr Arnold. The new legislation will strengthen the central bank's supervisory systems, allow greater protection of the clients of financial institutions, and changes mandatory capital requirements. The impending changes, officials are keen to emphasise, are merely protective. Belize's one bank closure recently was that of a branch of a state-owned Mexican institution which was divested. There are four commercial banks, two of which are locally owned. 'The country is adequately banked and is well-served by the number of banks it has,' says Mr Geoffrey Hart, the manager of Barclays Bank in Belize. New legislation is also planned to improve the country's offshore financial services sector. 'We need to look at the possibilities of offshore banking,' says Mr Arnold. 'We recently had a few inquiries about setting up offshore banks in Belize but our legislation does not provide for these institutions and we need the regulatory framework.' The indications of interest in offshore banking followed the opening of an International Business Companies register in 1990, similar to that of the British Virgin Islands. The 350 companies registered so far do not pay taxes and are not allowed to do business in Belize. The emergent offshore business sector has also had success with its shipping register which lists 129 vessels. New legislation has been enacted to encourage the creation of trusts. 'This new law . . . applies to all trusts including charitable, non-charitable purpose trusts and offshore trusts,' explains Mr Glenn Godfrey, the attorney-general. 'The trustee is regarded as non-resident in Belize for the purposes of exchange control.' Thought was given by the government to the creation of a stock exchange, but there was not enough business to support a market. An alternative was found in the creation of public investment companies .</p>

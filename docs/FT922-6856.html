			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Bank seeks tougher standards THE Bank of England is pressing for a change in international banking regulations to ban banks from branching outside their home countries if they fail to meet certain standards. The Bank's tough stance in talks with other regulators on the Basle Committee for Banking Supervision emerged yesterday when the Bank published its annual report and a separate report of its supervisory activities. It is understood that Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank's representative on the Basle committee, hopes that by the end of the year bank supervisors from the big industrial countries will have agreed to radical changes in the 1983 Basle Concordat, which lays down a regulatory framework. Mr Quinn is believed to support a proposal that bank supervisors should ban bank branches from their countries if the branches' owner fails to meet standards laid down in the concordat. In the wake of last year's closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a change in the concordat is likely to be that international banks should submit to being regulated worldwide by at least one supervisory authority. A second change to the concordat would be that banks must meet the international capital adequacy standard, the Basle ratio, intended to ensure that banks are robust enough to withstand shocks. The Bank's reports contain much information on its work and views. Highlights include: The Bank criticises the 'lending criteria' observed in the 1980s. UK banks expanded their lending portfolios very rapidly in that period and have recently suffered big losses on those loans. The Bank says it has encouraged UK banks to review their procedures for making loans. However, it is adamant that in a market environment it would have been inappropriate to prevent the banks from making such mistakes. It discloses that it became concerned last year that small banks might run into serious difficulties. Many small banks' access to liquid funds became severely reduced because local authorities, public-sector corporations and other professional investors transferred their deposits to bigger banks. They made the transfers because of fears that small banks might fail as a result of big losses on loans. Their concerns became even greater after the closure of BCCI. The Bank of England kept a very close watch on the small banks in this period and believes they handled the crisis prudently. A few decided to wind down their business in an orderly way and all were urged by the Bank to explore whether they could reduce dependence on volatile sources of deposits. The Bank made an operating profit of Pounds 166m in the year to February 29 1992, 3 per cent up on the previous year. From that it paid the UK Treasury Pounds 67.6m, down from Pounds 81.5m. The number of authorised banking institutions operating in London fell from 530 to 518. The Bank of England revoked the banking licence of only one institution, BCCI. The fall in authorisations was the result in part of mergers of banks and reorganisations of international banking groups. The Bank reiterates its view that the banks do not operate a cartel in the small-business loan market. Nevertheless, it is concerned that small-business customers may find it difficult to shop around for a new bank because of technical difficulties in terminating an existing bank relationship. However, the Bank believes that competition in the small-business loan market has increased greatly in the past decade, with the entry into the market of TSB Group and foreign banks and the growth of the Scottish clearing banks. It has given those views to the Office of Fair Trading, which is deciding whether Lloyds Bank's proposed bid for Midland Bank should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The Bank gives aggregated figures for the trading results of the big UK banks - Barclays, National Westminster, Lloyds, Midland, Standard Chartered, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland and TSB Group. They show that the banks collectively made record provisions to cover losses on loans of Pounds 6.8bn, up from Pounds 4.1bn in 1990. The running costs of the banks as a percentage of total income fell, ending a trend which began in 1985. USE of the Pounds 20 note is increasing rapidly, according to the Bank of England's annual report.  In the past year, 489m Pounds 20 notes were issued, compared with 252m the previous year. The Pounds 10 note remains the most commonly issued denomination, with Pounds 5.74bn worth of them in circulation, compared with Pounds 5.29bn for the Pounds 20 note.</p>

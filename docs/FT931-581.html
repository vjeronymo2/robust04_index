			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / French Elections: Left's leaders paint gloomy picture of problems they face POLITICIANS are often prone to melodramatics, but last night the leaders of France's defeated Socialist party seemed to be locked in masochistic contest to find the most scathing ways of describing their appalling performance in the parliamentary elections. Mr Laurent Fabius, insouciant first secretary of the Socialists, spoke of 'a very severe defeat'. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, who will this morning tender his resignation as prime minister, painted a gloomy picture of 'the many problems' awaiting the French left. Even Mr Jack Lang, the usually ebullient arts minister, was reduced to adjuring the Socialists 'not to lose hope'. The critical question for the Socialists as the results filtered through last night was whether they would win the minimum 58 parliamentary seats necessary to table motions of censure against the government and thereby cling to their status as a mainstream party, rather than be relegated to the ranks of the minorities alongside the Communists and the National Front. With all but eight of the 577 seats counted last night the Socialists had only 53. Whatever the final tally, the French left must tackle the painful question of its future. Should it abandon the Socialist party that President Francois Mitterrand revived in 1971 and which has been the fulcrum of French centre-left politics ever since? If so, what should replace it? Only a few weeks ago the answer seemed obvious. The Socialists had appeared doomed to defeat ever since the start of the campaign. Weary after nearly a decade in government and scarred by scandals, they had been tumbling in the opinion polls ever since President Mitterrand's disastrous decision two years ago to replace Mr Michel Rocard as prime minister with the unpopular Mrs Edith Cresson. But on February 17 Mr Rocard made a stirring speech at a rally in Montlouis-sur-Loire near the city of Tours, scene of the original Socialist party's dissolution in 1920. He called on the French left to jettison socialism in favour of a 'big bang' alliance with ecologists, progressive communists, human rights activists and even conservative centrists. The 'big bang' met with a rapturous reception from senior socialists and other influential figures, including Mr Bernard Kouchner, the charismatic health minister, and Mr Brice Lalonde, founder of the Generation Ecologie environmental movement. Even the electorate responded positively. The Socialists rose in the opinion polls for the first time in the campaign. Mr Rocard's proposals did, after all, seem to make sense. The ecologists, who first emerged as a political force in last spring's regional elections when they won 14 per cent of the votes, had done so well earlier in the parliamentary campaign that, at one stage, they threatened to steal second place from the Socialists. A coalition of Socialists and ecologists ought in theory to have stood a good chance of ousting the conservatives. But the outcome of the parliamentary elections has raised serious questions about the validity of Mr Rocard's proposals. The ecologists are no longer such attractive partners for the Socialists. They polled 7.6 per cent of the first round votes last Sunday and failed to win a single seat in yesterday's second round. Mr Lalonde's Generation Ecologie, always more receptive to Mr Rocard's overtures than the radical pressure groups within the Greens, did particularly badly with just 3.6 per cent of the first round. The Socialists themselves did much worse than expected. Mr Fabius, Mr Beregovoy and Mr Lang all managed to keep their seats, as did Mr Bernard Tapie, minister of towns. But the conservatives now command the largest majority of any French parliament since the early 19th century. A number of senior Socialists lost their places in parliament, notably Mr Roland Dumas, foreign minister, Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister, Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, Mr Lionel Jospin, former education minister, and even Mr Rocard himself. Moreover Mr Rocard's premise that the left was moving smoothly towards the centre has been stymied by the unexpectedly strong performance of the Communists. In the first round of voting last Sunday the Communists polled a respectable 9.8 per cent, against 17.6 per cent for the Socialists, and last night were on course to retain most of their seats in the National Assembly. Even Mr Georges Marchais, the veteran Communist leader, managed to defy the polls by clinging on to his Paris constituency. The Communists' performance admittedly owes more to the idiosyncracies of the French electoral system than to a genuine groundswell of support for the extreme left. But their relative success has undoubtedly added yet another obstacle to the 'big bang' initiative. Mr Kouchner, one of Mr Rocard's staunchest supporters, said on television last night that the French 'do not seem to look at the future in terms of the left'. Even Mr Rocard seemed stumped yesterday. He confirmed on French television that, despite his defeat in his Yvelins constituency on the outskirts of Paris, he still plans to run as Socialist candidate in the 1995 presidential elections. But he added wearily: 'This is neither the time nor the place' to discuss it.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- YESTERDAY'S RESULTS*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PARTIES                                   SEATS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RIGHT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RPR (Gaullists)                             245 UDF (centre-right)                          213 Other right                                  22 National Front                                0                                             480  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LEFT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Socialist party                              53 Communist party                              23 Left Radicals                                 6 Other left                                    7 Generation Ecologie                           0 Greens                                        0                                              89  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Results after second round of elections for France's National Assembly with 569 of 577 constituencies counted (including 80 won in first round).

			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> OIL FIRMS' RESULTS MIXED; OCCIDENTAL PROFIT EDGES UP  </P> <P> Five major oil companies reported mixed quarterly results Monday.  </P> <P> Earnings were down at Exxon Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and Atlantic  Richfield Co. Occidental Petroleum Corp. said earnings rose slightly. Amerada  Hess Corp., bucking the trend, said earnings more than doubled.  </P> <P> Analysts said higher worldwide crude oil prices partly offset weaker refining  margins due to a fall in gasoline prices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM  </P> <P> Net Totals $108 Million  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based Occidental earned $108 million in the third quarter, up from  $105 million a year earlier.

The lower nine-month earnings reflected the company's provision for  the March 24 Alaska oil spill.  </P> <P> AMERADA HESS  </P> <P> Net More Than Triples  </P> <P> New York-based Amerada Hess' third-quarter earnings jumped to $51.8 million  from $15.8 million, reflecting much stronger refining and marketing segments  that bucked the general trend in the industry. The company also benefited from  unused tax credits of years past.  </P> <P> The third-quarter results included a charge of $30 million, associated with  expenses from a refinery shutdown in the Virgin Islands during Hurricane Hugo.  </P> <P> Amerada Hess' third-quarter revenue rose to $1.2 billion, up 28% from $925  million in the same 1988 period.  </P> <P> Amerada Hess' nine-month earnings jumped to $406 million, from $57.9 million.

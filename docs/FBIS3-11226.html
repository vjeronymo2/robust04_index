Salvadoran citizen Jose Francisco Guerrero, president of the  Parlacen, explained that the diplomat's appointment is temporary  until Nicaragua, which has already ratified the charter for this  regional forum, elects its 20 representatives.    He added that Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal  notified him in writing of Diaz' appointment as permanent  observer, given "the importance of Parlacen meetings."    The Parlacen was created three years ago as a regional forum  to discuss the area's political, economic, and social issues.  So far only Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras have appointed  representatives, while Costa Rica and Panama have yet to ratify  the charter.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Kordestan, as the barricade of freedom, has always  been a thorn in the side of the ruling regime. From the very  outset, the Islamic Republic has used all of its hellish  strength to crush the national-democratic movement of our people  and has not spared any crime or any violence -- neither  military, police, nor political -- in this effort.  Nevertheless, we see how, after 15 years of suppression, the  Kordestan movement continues to stand strongly and powerfully in  the struggle against reaction, and that the banner of this  struggle continues to be in the powerful hands of the Democratic  Party of Kordestan.    The Islamic Republic sees itself at an impasse any way it  turns and it also is well aware that one day Kordestan will  explode like a bomb and will shake the unpopular rule of the  regime. Thus, thinking that it can prevent such a fate, it once  again wants to send even more forces to Kordestan to further  militarize this area and to display its military strength in  this part of our country.    However, such a military expedition and such an amassing of  forces in Kordestan not only does not show the strength of the  Islamic Republic of Iran but, on the contrary, shows the  regime's helplessness vis-a-vis the problems of Kordestan and  the other (?national problems) in the country.    The regime is facing many problems because of the reduction  in oil prices, its lack of credibility stemming from its  inability to repay its foreign debts, the private sector's  control over the foreign exchange market, the devaluation of the  rial, because of the closure of a large number of (?plants and  factories), and because of [word indistinct] (?shortages).  Meanwhile, the people's dissatisfaction and aversion are  growing. Unemployment and high prices are (?threatening) [words  indistinct], and the regime's isolation on the international  scenes and the West's pressures on the regime have [words  indistinct] the ruling regime.    It is because of all these things that the Islamic Republic  has decided to equip its armed forces more than ever and to  prepare itself to confront possible incidents. The military  maneuvers that were recently carried out by the law-enforcement  forces were also because of this.    Clearly, there is a powerful popular movement in Kordestan.  The regime lacks a (?political) base in this region, and  Kordestan is the weakest link in the chain of the Islamic  Republic's rule. So now the regime thinks that by a military  expedition and by accelerating the militarization of Kordestan  it can (?overcome these problems). However, the experience of  the past 15 years has shown that supression and violence cannot  destroy the struggle by the Kurdish masses, but that this  struggle will become stronger each day.    We firmly believe that one day the military and police  forces  of the regime will melt like snowmen from the heat of the  struggles by the Kurdish people. We thus assure the regime's  officials that this time too, as in the past, they are making a  mistake in their calculations on the Kordestan problem.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Audit 'quarantine' period extended PARTNERS in accountancy firms will be banned from working for the same client for more than seven years at a time under draft rules on ethics issued yesterday. The proposed draft rules come in a 'white paper' from the joint ethics committee of the three institutes that represent chartered accountants in the UK and Ireland. The rules also say partners will not be allowed to resume audit work for the client company for a further five years. That represents an increase in the length of the 'quarantine' period from two years in response to comments received by the committee since its 'green paper' was issued last October. It reflects a concern that a firm's objectivity may be threatened or appear to be threatened if a partner in charge of an audit continues in that role for a prolonged period. The guidelines will be mandatory for auditors to listed and other public-interest companies, and will be recommended for all other companies. Mr Jock Worsley, chairman of the committee, said: 'A lot of people wanted very detailed regulations. But we believe that the guidelines will be most successful if they are applied and monitored for compliance with the spirit, not the letter.' Nearly 90 firms, committees and organisations responded to the guidelines, and most called for tougher recommendations on rotation. Any final comments on the guidelines should be produced by May 10 this year. If approved, they will be phased in over the next three years.</p>

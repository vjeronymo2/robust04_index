			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] In contrast to CIS countries against which Russia  does not wage any intelligence operations, Russia's Intelligence  Service treats the Baltic states as any other European  countries, the press secretary of the Intelligence Service  Director Tatyana Samolis declared in her interview with Interfax  on Wednesday.    She voiced a supposition that the Federal  Counterintelligence  Service Director Sergey Stepashin, who declared at the  scientific-practical conference in Moscow that the Eastern  European countries as well as the former Soviet republics "make  their intelligence activity against Russia more active,"  primarily meant the Baltic states.    Samolis underlined that "Russia's tactics with respect to  the  Baltic states will be a corresponding one in case Russia's  interests demand this."    At the same time she specially noted that "if Russia does  not  wage intelligence operations in CIS countries it does not mean  that it is not interested in the processes going on there." "In  1992 eight CIS states signed an agreement prohibiting  intelligence activity against each other. Nevertheless, Russian  intelligence follows the situation by all available means,  including special ones, -- said Samolis. They include  information collection via the third countries and analysis of  open sources. For example, we receive part of the information  about Tajikistan from Afghanistan. Russia's leadership does not  remain without any analysis of the processes taking place in CIS  countries."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Masaharu Gotoda, former chief cabinet secretary, </F> interviewed by Takakazu Matsuda, deputy chief, MAINICHI SHIMBUN  political section; place and date not given]    [Text] Deliberations are being held on a political  reform bill in the Diet, where the Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP], once on the offensive, now finds its position totally  reversed. What brought about the LDP's collapse after over 37  years of one-party rule? What steps should it be considering  next? To find out, we asked party elder and lower house member  Masaharu Gotoda.    Nagata-cho Logic, Political Reporters    [Takakazu Matsuda] One of the things you've been saying for  quite awhile is: "If the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] doesn't  carry out political reform, it's going to see hell." How do you  view the political situation today, now that there's been a  change of administrations?    [Masaharu Gotoda] When I made that comment, what I meant to  say, first of all, was that, if we didn't take another look at  our political system and make changes while we could, the issue  of political reform would get gridlocked in the Diet and the  objective situation at home and abroad would have completely  changed. Political reform is something that should be undertaken  at the hands of the LDP as the ruling party. If we don't do it,  I was saying, we'll see hell. By "hell," I was referring to the  day when people would no longer have any trust in parliamentary  politics and just throw up their hands and turn away from  government. That kind of climate, I was saying, would be very  dangerous for our country.    In another sense, I was saying that, if the present  political  situation continues, there will be no end to the corruption  surrounding politics, and there would no longer be any clear  line between money and politics. There would be a growing  distrust of politicians and government among the people, and the  end result, I was saying, would be the collapse of parliamentary  democracy in this country.    I meant the statement as a warning, but unfortunately, the  party's reign came to a close. I guess you can say, a new bud  has sprouted. So we can hope, at least as far as restoring the  image of government is concerned, that the Hosokawa  administration can carry out its work without any undue  confusion and disorder.    For me, the LDP is a very important political party. But in  a  real sense, the most important thing, as far as our citizens are  concerned, is that we create the kind of environment where they  have a definite sense that government exists in Japan. So, for  us, the Hosokawa administration is like a partner and here, on  this point, I would like to see it succeed.    [Matsuda] What was one of the reasons you thought the LDP  would be "seeing hell"?    [Gotoda] First of all, there are certain background factors  to consider. Until recently, the ideological confrontation  between East and West was carried over and projected into the  confrontation in this country between the ruling and opposition  parties. That's gone now. The LDP has come this far by having  successfully pursued policies as a member of the democratic  camp. The age of ideologies has literally disappeared. But the  LDP is still living in the age when there was one-party rule. It  has become careless, thinking that things will somehow turn out  as it wants. It still has an arrogant "do if we dare" attitude  about itself. Also, there's the turbidity that comes with having  maintained power for a long time.    The raison d'etre for political parties is usually to gain  power and put their ideologies into action. But the opposition  has neither that kind of ability nor vitality. But because of  that ideological tension in the background, the opposition does  serve a positive role for the country in restraining [the power  of the ruling party]. When that confrontation no longer exists,  the opposition exists without a role.    So, what happens between opposition and ruling parties is  the  kind of government where they rely on each other and work in  collusion with each other behind the scenes. To put it in a less  flattering way, they build up a mutual relationship while  licking each other's wounds. People no longer understand that  [kind of mentality].    So, we get the phrase "Nagata-cho logic." According to this  kind of logic, politicians get things done with easy-going,  behind-the-scenes maneuvering. This is all pretty far removed  from the average citizen. They might not have a clear  understanding of what's going on, but somehow they sense  something odd is happening. So, when a scandal breaks, they say,  "What? Again!" and they end up distrusting government even more.    I'm sorry to say, it is the mass media that is to blame.  It's  the fault of those who are assigned to cover us politicians.  Even when they know something is going on, they don't report  what's really happening. A give-and-take relationship develops  between the reporter who is assigned to cover the politician and  the politician he's been assigned to. I think this works as a  big negative for Japanese politics. Those in the mass media are  directing some pretty harsh criticisms at the government but,  from our perspective, they haven't really gotten the truth out.  In the end, reporters and the politicians they're reporting on  naturally begin to take up the same breathing pattern.    Prerequisites for Being Prime Minister    [Matsuda] What you say hits home. But to turn your argument  around somewhat, wasn't it former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka  who abused the assigned-reporter system the most and made it  into what it is?    [Gotoda] The change of administrations this time marks the  end of Tanaka-style politics. In other words, the quarrel over  who was to succeed (Noboru) Takeshita was a struggle over the  Tanaka legacy, and it threw the entire party into disarray,  leaving us with what we have today. It was a real pain for the  other factions. That's why (Ichiro) Ozawa (secretary general,  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]) didn't try to become party  president. (Ryutaro) Hashimoto (chairman, LDP Policy Research  Council) has the potential to become president. But he didn't  even try to get nominated. It's a period for him for  self-examination--which, I think, is good. Probably he's looking  over the political scene, knowing he should take a term or two  to quietly reflect on his situation.    [Matsuda] For a time there was a "Gotoda, [LDP] presidential  hopeful" theory going around.    [Gotoda] Not as far I was concerned. When there's a change  of  government, like the one now, people expect big changes. They  want someone fresh and new, not the head of some faction who's  like merchandise that's been on the floor for a long time. I'm  too old. Unlike before, today's prime minister is on the run all  the time. Generally speaking, he has to be about 60 or  thereabouts and be in good health and have lots of energy, or  else he isn't going to do this country any good. I wouldn't have  the stamina to keep up.    There's also another reason. You'll find it happening in a  company, a government office, wherever. Usually, he's a section  head or in that class. When he reaches 40 or so, say until he's  in his mid-40's, there is something in the air or something  about him that makes people think, "that guy is going to be a  top company executive" or "someday he's going to be vice  minister." It's the same with politicians, isn't it? After  someone has been reelected to his fourth or fifth or sixth term,  people are going to think, "there's a chance that guy is going  to be prime minister someday." But, then, there's the guy,  totally devoid of that kind of atmosphere, who tries and makes  it. It's all really very unfortunate for the country.    [Matsuda] Does (Prime Minister Morihiro) Hosokawa have that  air about him?    [Gotoda] Yes, he does. It's his upbringing.    The Hosokawa cabinet had a good start, which I thought was  very good for the country. If you ask yourself why his  administration has been able to get a 70-percent voter approval  rating, it's a reaction by the voters. They were disillusioned  with existing political parties, especially with the LDP and  Social Democratic Party of Japan, and wanted something new. That  feeling, I think, has something to do with the new  administration's positive ratings and was fueled to some degree  by the mass media. Whether the administration can maintain those  ratings or not depends on its performance from here on out.    The test will probably come in three basic areas: political  reform, emergency economic policy, and the economy's medium- and  long-range restructuring. The degree to which the Hosokawa  cabinet succeeds in these areas will determine its worth. If it  succeeds, it'll find itself a niche in history.    [Matsuda] What, then, in the midst of all this should the  LDP  be doing?    [Gotoda] We're looking into a number of reform  proposals--for  example, into an age limit of 70 and the dissolution of party  factions. Nothing startling or unexpected.    [Matsuda] Can you go for a system that imposes an age limit  of 70? It will be like cutting your own throat.    [Gotoda] It doesn't bother me. Mandatory age limits are  something we should have. As for our factional system, it has  presented too many obstacles in the past. On the other hand, we  can't have some 200-plus members of the lower house running  around every which way. Of course, some of them are on top of  any developments in our committees or affecting national  politics as a whole. Some have a half-way decent understanding  of what's happening. Others don't know what's happening. And so,  to discuss policy matters and share information, there have to  be meetings of various sorts--by region, for example, or with  regard to specific policy issues, or by the number of terms one  has served in the Diet.    The most important point here is that there be avenues for  communication. All 200-odd members of the party can't be  together all at once, so we have to have some alternative means  to communicate. But it's best to dissolve the kind of factions  we've had until now. Factions will have to be dissolved. It'll  happen, like it or not, if our political contributions system is  reformed. Practices like leaving it up to the factions to see to  whatever funds are necessary for routine political activities or  helping out with contributions when elections are held are  probably going to be a thing of the past. The day for that has  come, so there is no need to fight it.    Shedding Old Ways To Become a `Party of Trust'    [Matsuda] Would it be necessary to place age limits on the  heads of local governments, too?    [Gotoda] If you look at what's happening these days, with so  many gubernatorial and mayoral elections, you naturally begin to  wonder whether it wouldn't be better to impose restrictions.  That way, voters would be able to focus their attention again on  national politics.    [Matsuda] In planning its comeback, does the LDP have any  strategies with regard to national policy?    [Gotoda] There's the issue of the tax system. I wonder if  voters are going to go along with the idea of simply lowering  the income tax while raising the consumption tax. It will mean  higher taxes for the less affluent voter who is living on a  tight budget. Voters who have fatter wallets are the ones who  are going to benefit from an income tax cut. In a situation like  that, if you ask whether you can raise the consumption tax rate,  I would say, no, probably not. Then, you're going to have to  consider the consumption tax in regard to specific items. Some  items--like food, for example--are necessities whether you're  rich or poor, and you're going to have to consider how such  items are going to be handled.    Or, to give another example, how much of the consumption tax  is going to be shifted to the social security system? At what  percentage will the ratio be held between the tax burden and the  social security burden. Questions like this must be clarified.    Sitting at roundtable discussions these days, I'm always  asked the same question: "Sensei [teacher], people  like me are now contributing to the pension system, but when we  retire, will we be getting the same kind of benefits that others  are getting now?" Everyone is worried.    We have to give very clear answers to those kinds of  questions and then say, "We can't do everything at once. This  year we'll do this, next year we'll do that." We want voters to  have an image of us of the sort where they're going to say, "The  LDP is seriously studying the issues. It's a party we can depend  on."    Then, when that happens, we'll win in the elections. There  is  no reason at all, I think, for the party to lose confidence. How  much confidence does an opposition party with a collection of 50  or 60 members have? There's no way a major party with 227  members in the lower house alone will lose confidence.    [Matsuda] What do you see happening in terms of the  political  situation in the future?    [Gotoda] The realignment, or regrouping, of parties due to  the change of administrations is just the first step, I think.  Depending on the objective situation, there may be as many as  two or three further regroupings. Whether that will happen  before or after the next election or the election after that I  can't say. But it's still my opinion that there will be more  realignments.    Although I personally think it will be hard to get to the  point where we have a two-party system, the aim of political  reform is an electoral system--namely, a combination of  single-seat constituencies and proportional  representation--that, in effect, creates the kind of situation  where there are two major opposing parties, with political power  alternating between the two.    Two major political forces engage in a healthy face-off.  Sometimes they switch off and the other party is in power. It's  a political relationship with a certain degree of tension. And  because of that, Japan's parliamentary government is  invigorated. That, I think, will happen. It's what political  reform means. Political contributions, the electoral  system--they're means, not ends. They are a way of getting our  foot in the door so we can create the kind of political  situation I've just described.    [Matsuda] To change the subject, what is your opinion of  (Ichiro) Ozawa?    [Gotoda] I'm not sure. His political skills are impressive  and I respect him for all the effort he's seemingly putting into  political reform. But, if I were to consider just what I've read  in print about him, I'd think he had a dangerous leaning toward  national hegemony. I would frankly have to admit having certain  misgivings about him.    Friendly U.S.-Japan Relationship Is Fundamental    [Matsuda] There is a lot of talk about Komeito being an  issue  for the Hosokawa cabinet.    [Gotoda] It will be a problem unless we can get a clear  separation between church and state. I'd hate to see the day  when religious antagonisms are brought in to plague us  domestically. Komeito says a separation between church and state  exists, but that's certainly not the impression I get.    [Matsuda] Recently, at the general meeting of the Watanabe  faction and elsewhere, LDP president Yohei Kono's  pro-Constitution stance has been criticized.    [Gotoda] To be sure, there's that kind of criticism. But if  we take that attitude, we'll end up being isolated outcasts in  Asia. It's what you call being a national supremacist. What  other Asian countries fear most is a remilitarized Japan. [They  have] the plutonium and the technology to make nuclear bombs at  any time. The manufacturing ability exists to make any number of  them. So, we can't have Japan go overseas and start using its  military power. By then, warnings will be too late.    The most important thing for us to consider now is  maintaining friendly relations with the United States. We can't  be a dependent state. When something has to be said, we  shouldn't hold back. But at the same time, an amicable  relationship between our two countries is basic. So, in dealing  with Asian countries, we have to make sure we include the United  States. Don't leave the United States out and try to go it  alone. That's basic.    [Matsuda] How do you feel about Prime Minister Hosokawa's  "war of aggression" pronouncement?    [Gotoda] That I can't agree with. Colonialism isn't good,  and  certainly an apology to Korea is called for. I would also  acknowledge that [ours] was a war of aggression against China.  But there's absolutely no reason at all for apologies from us  concerning World War II. That's because it was a war waged for  world hegemony between two super-camps--on the one hand, Japan,  Germany, and Italy; and, on the other, England, the United  States, and the Soviet Union. The only difference between us is  that we lost. There's no need to apologize later.    But, in the process, Japan occupied other Asian countries.  That wasn't good. But you also had Indonesia under Dutch rule,  the Philippines under U.S. rule, and Singapore under British  rule. So, when the time came, Japan felt compelled to do what it  did. But that's speaking like a disinterested third party. In  the end, I guess you could say our actions were inexcusable.    Masaharu Gotoda. Born in 1914 in Tokushima  Prefecture.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] Urban prices in China continued to rage out of  control in March, with the cost of living in 35 large cities  rising 24.5 percent over a year earlier, sources in Beijing told  Eastern Express.    The March figure, which will be released by the State  Statistical Bureau (SSB) next week, is slightly lower than  February's but higher than January's, giving a first quarter  average of 24.6 percent.    Prices in some cities -- including Chongqing, Beijing,  Haikou  and Guangzhou -- are expected to show rises of more than 30  percent in March. Shanghai has already reported a figure of 38  percent over the first three months of the year.    The national picture, to be revealed later in the month,  looks even worse, SSB sources said.    The bureau expects the national cost of living to rise  between 24 and 25 percent for March compared with 22.3 percent  over the first two months of the year.    Although considered by Beijing to be less important to  social  stability than the urban figure, the national rate is used for  planning and reflects Beijing's failure to harness the runaway  economy since macroeconomic control measures were imposed last  July.    Beijing's pledge to hold national inflation to within 10  percent this year after a 13 percent rise in 1993 looks doubtful.    National retail prices, meanwhile, will show a rise to about  22-23 percent, compared with 20 percent over the first two  months, the SSB predicts.    SSB officials warned that inflationary pressure was likely  to  remain high through the second quarter of the year.    "We told the government that tighter administrative controls  are crucial to containing this momentum until the economy begins  to slow down," an SSB official said.    The figures will appear as seven national inspection teams  sent out by the State Council on April 1 begin their  double-pronged attack on inflation by cracking down on price  gouging and chaotic fixed investment.    Beating inflation emerged as Beijing's priority after last  month's meeting of the National People's Congress [NPC] when the  official China News Service described price rises as "part of  China's present-day social agony".    In the clearest signal of Beijing's concern, a vice-premier,  Li Lanqing, told the NPC: "If prices cannot be controlled,  popular feelings and stability will be affected and reform  cannot be carried out."    Since then, city mayors have been regularly asked by Beijing  to explain their cities' high inflation.    The Shanghai party secretary, Wu Bangguo, told an NPC  meeting  that he had been embarrassed by the Premier Li Peng, who was  more informed about prices of consumer goods in the city than  either he or its mayor, Huang Ju.    Plans to free prices on a range of goods in many cities this  year -- from staple foods to bus fees -- have been put on hold  since prices began to rise.    Inflation in China's leading cities was 19.6 percent last  year, the highest rate since 1988, when panic buying of consumer  goods forced Beijing to implement a credit squeeze that  sidelined the economy for two years.    The run-up in the "hot summer of 1988" is also considered a  factor that helped precipitate the student-led Tiananmen  protests the following spring.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Battling with the double whammy: Why the heat is on corporate treasurers The reversal in the interest rate cycle and resulting turmoil in the bond markets this year has hit corporate treasurers with a double whammy, as funding costs rise and the value of investments falls. In recent years, many companies have raised fixed-rate finance but swapped the proceeds into variable-rate debt. When interest rates rise, these swaps are likely to become costly. At the same time, companies with large amounts of cash to invest may also have been hit by the fall in bond prices. Glaxo's Pounds 100m loss  - mainly on structured bonds and collateralised mortgage obligations - has focused corporate treasurers' attention on the potential risks lurking in their investment portfolios. Like the losses on derivatives incurred by companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble and Metallgesellschaft, the lesson seems to be that unless controls, on both the investment and liability sides of the business, are tightly drafted and strictly enforced, there is no guarantee that individual traders will act responsibly or that risk will be managed effectively. 'Our philosophy is to have a floating-rate portfolio, which will not substantially alter in value (as rates go up and down) since it might be needed by the company,' said Mr Stephen Crompton, director of treasury at SmithKline Beecham. The Anglo-US healthcare group sold its investment portfolio before the acquisition of Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services in May. The rapid reversal of interest rate trends this year has created an extremely difficult environment for corporate treasurers. 'The violent reaction of US rates has made us reconsider the balance of fixed versus floating rate,' said Mr Doug Rees, financing director at Merck, the US pharmaceuticals group. He said that the company, which has outstanding commercial paper borrowings, would like to reduce the floating-rate component of its debt portfolio. However, because of the steepness of the yield curve in the US bond market, it is not a very attractive time to lock into longer-dated fixed-rate borrowings. 'It shouldn't be regarded as the treasurer's role to chop and change the interest rate profile of assets and liabilities around short-term considerations,' argues Mr Derek Ross, partner in charge of treasury at Touche Ross. 'That's the route to running into problems, on investment portfolios and on derivatives.' Glaxo is unlikely to be the only company to have suffered substantial investment losses. One pharmaceuticals and chemicals analyst said he knew of several European companies which are suffering from the effects of turmoil in the financial markets, including the currency markets. 'Obviously companies that are cash-rich and asset-rich are the hardest hit at a time when there is a spike upwards in interest rates,' said one dealer at a large London-based corporate treasury. However, this is not always the case. For example Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company renowned for its cash pile, stated that in the first six months of the year its financial income was again ahead of the first six months of 1993. However, many companies are loath to discuss what their policies are, and many analysts are struggling to factor in potential losses made on investments this year. Further complicating such calculations is uncertainty about how fully companies with substantial US sales have hedged themselves against the decline in the dollar. 'My experience is that most companies seem to give their treasury a lot more flexibility than I would expect them to,' said Mr Archie Donaldson, a director of the MTM Partnership and former treasurer of ICI. Mr Ross also thinks there is some room for companies to tighten up procedures. 'The area where there is weakness is that very few companies have a clear strategy of what the mixture of fixed-rate and floating-rate liabilities should be for a minimum risk profile,' according to Mr Ross. 'Most have gone through that process with foreign exchange but the skills for undertaking this process on the interest-rate side are less developed.' The Association of Corporate Treasurers, of which Mr Ross is chairman, is preparing guidelines for companies dealing in the derivatives markets, which are likely to be similar to the Group of Thirty's recommendations for dealers published last year. In some cases, the issue comes down to the conflict over how to run a treasury division, in particular, whether it should operate as a profit centre or a cost centre. 'If management puts the treasurer under pressure to achieve returns which are out of line with market rates, then inevitably a higher degree of risk will be assumed,' Mr Ross believes. In some cases treasurers have a package which relates to their contribution to the business, and may encourage them to seek profits more aggressively, even if this involves greater risk. However, Touche Ross recently completed a survey of 50 UK companies which showed that only 7 per cent treated treasury as a profit centre, and only 10 per cent allowed companies to trade rather than just hedge positions. For the derivatives specialists at investment banks, the problems of corporate treasurers have brought in some fresh business. 'There are plenty of corporate treasurers who got themselves into trades which started to look pretty ugly,' said one investment banker. 'Those who are running treasury operations as profit centres have had a good run in the last couple of years and had started to get more adventurous.' For example, he says that corporate treasurers who undertook 'range' trades - taking the view that interest rates or currencies would remain within a certain designated range by entering swap transactions or buying structure notes - found that instead of owning higher-yielding investments, they were left holding loss-making and often illiquid positions. As for company treasurers, perhaps they will take comfort from the fact that those worst hit by the turmoil in the financial markets this year are banks and securities houses, whose first- half results have shown more than a dent already.</p>

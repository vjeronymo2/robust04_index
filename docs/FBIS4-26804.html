			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] According to our correspondent in Moscow, on 8-17  June, the Vietnamese prime minister visited Ukraine, Kazakhstan,  and Russia. This is the first time the head of the Vietnamese  Government has paid an official visit to the CIS states since  the dissolution of the former Soviet Union.    For historical reasons, Vietnam economy had close relations  with the former Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries.  Annual import value of Vietnam from the former Soviet Union  reached over $1 billion. After the dissolution of the Soviet  Union, Hanoi quickly established relations with the CIS  community to maintain the traditional economic cooperation.  Since then some important changes have taken place, and the  reality has forced Vietnamese leaders to adjust their external  relations. In addition to actively seeking cooperation from its  neighbor countries in the region to invest in Vietnam, Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet also visited a number of Western European  countries last year, thus obtaining significant economic benefit  to Vietnam, leading to the cooperation between Vietnam and the  European community.    In the meantime, the situation of relations between Vietnam  and Russia and other CIS countries was not as good as expected.  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the  Vietnamese-Russian relations experienced a cold period. In  1993, the two sides began to resume bilateral economic and trade  relations but only to an insignificant extent. The total trade  turnover in the year was only $300 million. In addition to over  10 major projects that originated in the Soviet era, there were  no new projects set up in the last two or three years. The  joint venture enterprises between Vietnam and Russia and other  CIS states are basically small factories.    Development of cooperative relations with Russia, Ukraine,  and Kazakhstan, the three developed industrialized states in the  CIS community, is not only important to the development of  Vietnam, but it is also the starting point for the development  of cooperative relations with other states in the CIS community.  Both Vietnamese leaders and the public, therefore, highly  regarded the recent visit to the CIS states by Prime Minister Vo  Van Kiet.    Because of a number of concrete difficulties, both Hanoi and  Kiev this time expressed wishes to step up cooperative  relations. If flowers blossom in the spring, then the fruit will  come in the autumn. It is just natural that the people put  their hope in the visit this time of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet.    In Kazakhstan, both sides hoped for beneficial cooperation  in  agriculture, oil and gas, mining, and light industry. The visit  to Russia was certainly the most important leg of the visit to  the three states by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. Summing up the  visit, Russian public opinion maintains that the visit and the  meetings of the leaders brought the Vietnamese-Russian relations  to an important period. But the Russian-Vietnamese friendship  treaty has also left a profound impression. We could say that  the purpose of the Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit is to  reaffirm the basic conceptions of bilateral relations or to  adjust the regrettable cold relations in the last several years.  The Russian-Vietnamese basic friendship treaty replaces the  Soviet-Vietnamese treaty signed in 1978, which announced the  termination of the association between the two countries formed  in special historical conditions. The new treaty stipulates  that the two countries carry out negotiations only in cases of  crisis, and this is likely to be the foundation for relations in  the future. It is only natural that when the circumstances  change the foundation should change, too. However, with a new  foundation, many issues in the relations must also be reviewed.  For example, the discrepancies between the two sides in  bilateral and international issues include repayment of debts  that Vietnam had with the former Soviet Union, the lease of Cam  Ranh Bay of Vietnam to Russia, and so forth. If these issues  are openly discussed, people may be anxious about whether a  basic treaty could be signed.    Due to many urgent public engagements, President Yeltsin  could not hold a meeting with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet as  previously planned, and the two sides agreed to cancel it, but  the visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet was not wasted. Besides  the Russian-Vietnamese friendship treaty, the two sides also  signed bilateral cooperation agreements, such as the agreement  on encouragement and protection of investment. Both Moscow and  Hanoi believe that they have the necessary potential to carry  out favorable cooperation in the fields of politics, foreign  trade, science and technology, and so forth. Vietnam, Russia,  Ukraine, and Kazakhstan are all seeking new roads for economic  development. The development of mutually beneficial cooperation  should be their common demand and aspiration. Though they still  face some difficulties, good results will eventually come.</p>

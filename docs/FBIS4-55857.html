			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, 20 May (TANJUG) -- Macedonian Foreign  Minister Stevo Crvenkovski returned to Skopje this evening after  a several-day visit to New York, where he had several meetings  with Cyrus Vance, UN mediator in the dispute with Greece, and  with the U.S. President's special envoy, Matthew Nimitz. In a  statement for the press immediately on arrival at Skopje  airport, Crvenkovski said that certain progress has been  achieved in the dispute with Greece. Namely, the talks are  focused on overall bilateral relations and contacts between the  two countries are being maintained without Greece's three  well-known conditions. However, Crvenkovski concluded, it is  hard to say how things will develop further. He also announced  that Nimitz will soon be visiting Skopje.</p>

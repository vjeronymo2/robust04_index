He said that the patrolling of  Guatemala's border with Chiapas is normal and that no one can  cross the border illegally.    In leaving Los Pinos Residence, where Mexican President  Carlos Salinas received new year greetings from the diplomatic  corp accredited to Mexico, Maldonado said that Guatemala cannot  cooperate with Mexico in resolving the armed conflict in  northern Chiapas State. Let's hear what he had to say:    [Begin Maldonado recording] The Guatemalan Government has to  protect its own borders, Guatemalan territory. Regarding  cooperation, nothing has been said about that, and we do not  think it is necessary, because we believe that the Mexican state  has complete and absolute control over its actions. [end  recording]    The diplomat denied that there are Guatemalans involved in  the Chiapas conflict and that the problem there could extend  beyond the border and become a regional problem.</p>

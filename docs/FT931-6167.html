			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Floating rupee rises in forex market THE flotation of India's rupee, announced in the annual budget at the weekend, got off to a smooth start yesterday, with the currency rising modestly against the US dollar. The rupee closed at Rs31.85 to the dollar yesterday, compared with Rs32.78 at the opening and Rs32.58 at the end of trading last Friday, the last day before Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, disclosed his plan to float the currency. The government has abolished the former two-tier exchange rate in which exporters and other earners of foreign exchange were obliged to change part of their funds into rupees at a low official rate. This low-cost foreign currency was used by the government to import oil and other commodities. In place of the two-tier system, the rupee has been made fully convertible on the trade account, though numerous restrictions remain on Indians acquiring currency for other purposes. Dealers in Bombay said trading was quiet yesterday with the Indian Oil Corporation, the state-owned oil company and a major importer, staying out of the market. It was 'a very smooth transition,' said a dealer at the Bank of Baroda, an Indian bank, and quite unlike the hectic trading which prevailed when the two-tier rate system was introduced only a year ago. Meanwhile, in the stock market, shares continued their post-budget decline with the Bombay stock market's leading share index falling 27.36 to 2,543.82. However, stocks closed well above the day's low of 2,494.52, indicating that the sharp correction may be over.</p>

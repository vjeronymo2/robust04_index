			<p>BFN     [Text] Indonesia has welcomed the Philippine Government's  decision to deny entry to all foreign delegates to a seminar on  East Timor to be held in Manila. Commenting on the decision of  Philippine President Fidel Ramos on the conference, Foreign  Minister Ali Alatas said in a press statement in Jakarta today  that he is awaiting a formal report from the Indonesian Embassy  in Manila on the matter. He said the conference engineered by  Ramos Horta [leader of the Revolutionary Front for an  Independent East Timor or Fretilin] will in fact not be an  academic seminar on human rights but will clearly be part of  Ramos Horta's political campaign to discredit the Indonesian  Government. Accordingly, Alatas hoped the Philippine Government  will cancel the planned conference as well, because this will  reflect the common views of the two countries on the matter.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Brushing up on tradition - Baking soda, once a humble ingredient, has achieved new status. Nikki Tait and Karen Zagor report Draw up a list of quintessential '1990s' products, and baking soda toothpaste would almost certainly be a top pick. The very name evokes homy memories and 'back-to-basic' values. Baking soda - the main ingredient of which is bicarbonate of soda - has been a stalwart item in the traditional housewife's larder for decades. Its conventional uses range from helping cakes rise to keeping refrigerators odour-free. In image terms, no product could be further removed from Gucci bags, meals for the microwave and similar symbols of the 1980s-style yuppie. But baking soda did not arrive in toothpaste form until 1989. That was when Church &amp; Dwight, a quoted Princeton-based company and the world's largest producer of sodium bicarbonate, launched a line of baking soda dentifrice across the US under its 'Arm &amp; Hammer' trademark. It was, says the company, a natural product extension. Americans have used baking soda (mixed with water to form a paste) to clean their teeth for more than a century. Back in the 1920s, baking soda even carried a 'seal of acceptance' from the American Dental Association, the ultimate endorsement for dental products. Over the past four years, the product category has exploded. According to Nielsen Marketing Research, sales of baking soda dentifrice and toothpowder products totalled almost dollars 100m (pounds 65m) in the six months to mid-March, compared with dollars 637m for the toothpaste and toothpowder market overall - a near-15 per cent share. While toothpaste sales generally advanced by just 6 per cent during this period, the baking soda segment soared by 65 per cent. This heady expansion rate results partly from the entry of large consumer products companies into the baking soda segment. The likes of Unilever's Chesebrough-Pond's subsidiary and Colgate-Palmolive quickly decided that the product's in-roads were too substantial to ignore, and launched 'baking soda' versions of their traditional brands last year. Procter &amp; Gamble, the overall dentifrice leader in the US, is currently in the throes of a nationwide launch of a baking soda version of Crest. In the process, these consumer product juggernauts have partially eliminated the higher margins which the original baking soda toothpaste manufacturers were eager to extract. Today, most US supermarkets carry similar sizes of conventional and baking soda dentifrices at the same price. A 6.4-ounce tube of Crest sells for dollars 2.39, whether in baking soda or conventional form, for example. Arm &amp; Hammer products, however, have clung on to their premium. In the face of competition from the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, the company has carefully stressed that its formulation uses more baking soda than its rivals - 'anything from two to three times', says Davis Dickinson, marketing director. And despite the higher pricing, Arm &amp; Hammer - nothing to do with the legendary oil tycoon Armand Hammer until he ended confusion by buying a small stake in Church &amp; Dwight in 1986 - still commands a 63.5 per cent share of the total baking soda dentifrice market, although its sales growth rate over the past six months of about 20 per cent has been below that of baking soda toothpastes generally. However wholesome the baking soda concept may sound, the irony is that these toothpastes have no proven advantage over traditional rivals. Their impressive sales gains are as much a triumph of clever marketing as inherent product advantage. None of the baking soda products which have hit the supermarket shelves over the past four years has carried the American Dental Association 'seal of acceptance', for example, although Arm &amp; Hammer says that it has been talking to the Chicago-based organisation since 1989. Disciples argue that baking soda acts as a mild abrasive on teeth, cuts down on plaque acid and generally deodorises the mouth. But the ADA has not been convinced: 'We've not seen sufficient data to prove the effectiveness of baking soda in toothpaste,' it says. While it is true that the Crest baking soda product will carry an ADA seal, this is primarily because of Crest's formulation, not because of the baking soda element. 'We just got the ADA seal for effective cavity prevention. We had to submit separately to the ADA for Crest baking soda,' says the promoters. 'There's no proven therapeutic benefit to baking soda, but there is for Crest.' So how has baking soda toothpaste gained such an impressive hold in the market? From day one, Arm &amp; Hammer has sold heavily on the boast that 'two out of three dentists and hygienists recommend brushing with baking soda or a baking soda toothpaste.' The assertion, says the company, is based on a national, and regularly updated survey. Anecdotally, it seems to be partially supported. Many US dentists and hygienists do recommend baking soda to their patients even though they know that is proven efficacy is limited. 'I don't know how effective the toothpaste is, but baking soda itself is one of the few things you can use at home to remove light stains, like tea stains, without hurting your teeth,' says Michelle Freemark, a dental hygienist. 'Baking soda doesn't always work, but a lot of the other whitening products on the market are pretty abrasive and will hurt you. I have had some people who seem to think the toothpaste works.' The manufacturers are more than happy to support this impression. 'The most important quality is that it makes the mouth feel clean - like you've just left the dentist's office,' says Dickinson. Some of the claims by the toothpaste makers nevertheless seem slightly far-fetched. 'Dentists recognise that when consumers enjoy the taste of a toothpaste they brush their teeth more - we see this as a flavour-option,' says Procter &amp; Gamble. Retorts Freemark: 'In my opinion, if someone's a lousy brusher to start with, a better-tasting toothpaste probably won't make them change.'</p>

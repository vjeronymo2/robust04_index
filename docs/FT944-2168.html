			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Man in the News: Power in the background - Simon Keswick When Simon Keswick, chairman of Trafalgar House, announced this week that the company was contemplating the first hostile bid for a privatised UK utility, he was putting himself under the spotlight. He studiously avoids personal publicity. But a contested bid for Northern Electric would bring the kind of attention from the financial press that the tabloids reserve for National Lottery winners. As the Labour party has already pointed out, the main reason Northern is an attractive takeover target is the benign regulatory regime enjoyed by all the regional electricity companies. The companies have made substantial profits under the pricing regime put in place at privatisation. A bid would also raise eyebrows in the City, where analysts question whether it would be in the interest of the majority of Trafalgar's shareholders. They argue that it would be driven by the needs of Hongkong Land, the 25 per cent shareholder and an offshoot of the Jardine Matheson international trading house, which is one of Hong Kong's largest businesses and is controlled by the Keswick family. Jardine is trying to expand outside Hong Kong before the Chinese takeover in 1997. If to comes to a bid funded by Trafalgar shares, the defence will focus on the record of Simon Keswick and the rest of Trafalgar's new management team. Keswick has already come under considerable attack from the Chinese government in the context of a deteriorating relationship with Jardine. The Chinese authorities delight in remembering Jardine's origins as 19th century opium dealers and describe it now as 'a looter' and a 'bad element'. The animosity is both the cause and the effect of Jardine's efforts to reduce its reliance on the colony. Jardine's suspicion of the Chinese, born of the losses it suffered when the communists took control on the mainland in 1947, has led it to move Jardine Matheson's domicile from Hong Kong to Bermuda. At the end of this year it intends to delist its shares in Hong Kong. Two years ago, it adopted Trafalgar House as its main UK vehicle. Although these moves might seem a sensible insurance policy, Simon, and to a greater extent his eldest brother Henry, have been criticised for antagonising the Chinese unnecessarily. Some observers also believe that the Keswicks have failed to capitalise on opportunities in and around Hong Kong in recent years. But few deny Simon's achievement in turning the empire around in the mid-1980s. When he was installed as taipan (chairman and chief executive) in 1983, the web of Jardine companies was overextended, overborrowed and overcomplicated. 'He presided over the restoration of the whole of the Jardine group and the creation of a modern conglomerate with almost no debt,' says one colleague. Until then, he had been seen as something of a socialite, without Henry's business or political acumen. According to unkind critics, Henry got the brains while Simon got the looks. Some still question how much credit he should get for Jardine's transformation. 'It was very much a team effort as he would be the first to admit,' says one former colleague. But all agree that, among his other qualities, he is a good judge of management talent. 'He has a record of bringing on good people, like Nigel Rich,' says one Jardine adviser. Rich has just moved from the helm of Jardine Matheson to become chief executive of Trafalgar House. Having installed Rich at Jardines, Simon moved back to the UK while remaining chairman of key subsidiaries Hongkong Land, Mandarin Hotels and Dairy Farm (the colony's biggest grocer and 29 per cent shareholder in Kwik Save). He is also a director of Hanson. Educated at Eton and Cambridge (briefly), he is a typical establishment figure: charming, unassuming, courteous and conventional (apart from his passionate support for Tottenham Hotspur). 'He is quiet, even in private, and not immediately very impressive,' says one business associate. Given his background, friends say he is remarkably humble. 'He believes that self-promotion is very dangerous because people start to believe the publicity. While he is very confident in his own judgment, and has an ability to get to the heart of a business problem quickly, he is very conscious that the success of the business depends largely on the rest of the team.' Friends say that Trafalgar House has given him the new challenge he needs. Hongkong Land took its stake in Trafalgar in 1992 as the engineering and property conglomerate built up by Sir Nigel Broackes was struggling. It soon became clear that Trafalgar's financial state was much worse than previously thought. Over the next 18 months Hongkong Land engineered a financial rescue that saw shareholders inject more than Pounds 700m to keep the group afloat. The old management was eased out and Hongkong Land took effective control, although it owns only 25 per cent of Trafalgar's ordinary shares. This is very much the Keswick way - the family calls the shots around the empire, although it owns less than 10 per cent of Jardine Matheson's shares. Such power wielded by minority shareholders tends to be frowned upon in London. If Trafalgar does bid for Northern Electric, the target is bound to argue that shareholders in both companies are being asked to dance to Jardine's tune. Northern is also likely to question Hongkong Land's judgment over its move on Trafalgar House, given the scale of the problems that subsequently emerged, and the attacks could well get personal. Although Rich will be on the frontline, some of the shots are bound to be aimed at Simon Keswick. But friends insist he will not respond. 'That is just not his style.' 'He may be basically shy but he is not thin-skinned. People have been saying nasty things about Jardine for 150 years,' says an adviser.</p>

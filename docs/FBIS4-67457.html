			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Demin, by Svetlana Sukhaya: "Don't Be </F> Afraid of Mirrors: Russians Must Know the Truth About the  Nation's Health"]    [Text] Every day I hear and read about new programs  that are aimed at improving the nation's health. Various  foundations and associations are springing up like mushrooms.  Meanwhile the situation with health of Russians is getting  closer and closer to the concept of "catastrophe." A. Yablokov,  chairman of the Interdepartmental Commission for Ecological  Security, of the RF [Russian Federation] Security Council,  provides an even more tragic formulation: "Ecocide in action."  He stated recently, "I have ceased hoping that the government,  caught up in the burning issues that face society today, will  itself recognize the terrible danger of ecocide. Society as a  whole must force the authorities to act!" That was the topic of  our discussion with Andrey Demin, a consultant in the MVK  [Interdepartmental Commission] apparatus.    Demin: So far, we do not have any broad public  movement for health. The organizations that basically engage in  these questions are rather narrow organizations of  professionals, primarily medical doctors. But no one is  coordinating their activities. The "Green" -- ecological --  movement is developmentally two to three years ahead of the  "White" movement for health that is being born today. In  analyzing what is occurring, we attempt not simply to confirm  the tragedy, but also to seek an answer to the question, "What  should we do?" I would answer that question in this way: the  only path is to build health into the country's socioeconomic  development. The crux of the matter is to assure that health  actually becomes the chief priority for the state, and to assure  that every decision is made with a consideration of its  consequences for people's health.    Sukhaya: What are the first steps in the "White"  movement?    Demin: It is necessary first of all to at least  collect the information and to unite the organizations that  already exist. One of our first projects is the preparation and  publication of an atlas, entitled "Health and the Environment."  It contains a scientifically substantiated picture of the state  of health of the population of Russia over its entire territory.  The task is to depart from the impersonal average figures and  provide specific information. Because the first report on the  health of Russians did not appear until late 1992. We are just  beginning to make our way out of the fog. All the base figures  and indicators used to be hidden and classified. For example, a  document on the problems of alcoholism at Goskomstat [State  Statistics Committee] was prepared for the leadership in only a  few carefully numbered copies. It used to be felt that some  "chief administrator," issuing commands from Moscow, could  change the entire situation in the country.    Recently I was at a seminar in Canada. I kept hearing the  term "a society that is moved by information." That is, a  society not moved by somebody's will, not by fraud, not by  slogans or an attractive idea, but by objective information. By  having that information, people are capable of understanding and  changing a lot. If, of course, they still have hope...    The information about health was too frightening, and too  obviously pointed the finger of responsibility at the system, so  it was "classified." But in recent years the authorities, who  have begun everything "from a clean slate," have taken the risk  of declassifying the situation. And thank God that the job has  been brought to its end. The first report was a purely  informational one. We were given the task of creating a mirror.  The mirror appeared. Russians looked into it and they were  terrified. But they learned the truth about themselves.  Moreover, the President's Edict and the government's decree  stating that similar reports are a mandatory annual procedure  were enacted.    Sukhaya: Let's hope to God that, with every  passing year, this mirror will frighten us less and less. But it  is also important that that mirror should not be "curved."    Demin: The first experience has indicated that we  can no longer deal only with average figures. There used to be  indicators for the mortality rate and the birth rate for the  entire Soviet Union. But with the tremendous difference between,  say, Central Asia and the Baltic republics, they lost any real  sense. They were all leveled off. It is impossible to change or  resolve anything by orienting oneself on them.    In 1992 joint research was carried out in Karelia by local  specialists and their neighbors from Finland. They studied the  people who were living right next to one another -- on identical  land, under the same sky, amid the same forests and lakes. But  how different the situation proved to be with our neighbors'  health! For example, on the Russian side the overall mortality  rate in the 33-64 year age group was almost twice as high, and  the mortality rate from cardiovascular diseases was almost 67  percent higher.    We should have realized long ago that health is not simply  something that is "God-given." It directly depends upon, for  example, whether the city has a normal water-supply line.    Sukhaya: It would seem that "omnipotent" Moscow  answered for the average figures. Does the specific data also  presuppose actions taken locally?    Demin: Of course a lot can be done by people's own  efforts, but some things require federal support. We plan to  send out our atlas for all the territories, and to make the  objective picture known to the local population.    Quite recently a group of specialists on the initiative of  and under the leadership of A. Yablokov prepared a report  entitled "The Population's Health and the Chemical Pollution of  the Environment in Russia." Once again, this was the first  attempt, on the basis of a tremendous amount of factual  material, to compile the proof of the pernicious influence that  specific chemical factors have upon various indicators of  people's well-being. By having that information, everyone is  free to decide how to avoid the threat to life -- his own, and  that of his children and grandchildren: whether he should leave  a dangerous area or, by uniting with other victims, to force the  polluter (including by way of the court) to stop his poisonous  emissions. The report was a compilation of hundreds of  scientifically proven figures and facts. We shall quote only a  few of them.    The industrial emissions from our enterprises are counted in  the millions of tons. The annual amount of pollutants for every  inhabitant of Russia is approximately 300 kilograms. The cities  that head this sad list of leaders are Norilsk, Nikel,  Novotroitsk, Angarsk, Monchegorsk, and Novokuybyshevsk. And, as  compared with Moscow, Samara, or Arkhangelsk, the indicators are  higher by tens of times!    In Moscow the highest level of pollution of the atmospheric  air is typical of the center, the northwest, and the northeast.  The level of the disease rate for bronchial asthma among  children here is higher by a factor of three or more than in the  city's relatively clean rayons.    In the children who have been subjected to the effect of the  polluted air, health problems arise even before the moment of  birth. For example, in Moscow the weight of newborn infants born  to mothers living in the area influenced by the emissions from  the Motor Vehicles Plant imeni Likhachev is an average of 400  grams less than in the cleaner control rayon.    The causes of childhood disability today include in first  place affections of the central nervous system. The frequency of  such diseases constitutes, on the average, 38 per 1000 children,  but in ecologically serious rayons that figure jumps to 50 or  more.    In Russia there is a constant increase in the number of  pregnancy pathologies, primarily in the major industrial  centers. In Ufa the indicator for various complications in  pregnant women during the past 20 years increased from 8.9 to  20.1 per hundred births -- this is almost three times more than  the average republic level. The reason is that a tremendous  number of women work in enterprises of the petrochemical  complex. In Bratsk 40 percent of the women who have decided to  have children have a premature cessation of pregnancy, and 51  percent have a pathology in childbirth. So just think about how  many chances a future mother who lives here has for carrying and  giving birth to a child without any complications.    The serious ecological situation increases the risk of  having  cancer. The highest indicators for lung cancer are recorded in  the major industrial oblasts: Leningrad, Nizhniy Novgorod,  Saratov, and Chelyabinsk oblasts. The cities that are especially  dangerous are those where aluminum plants that use obsolete  technology are located (Krasnoturinsk, Kamensk-Uralskiy,  Shelekhov, Bratsk). There is increased oncological mortality  among the population of cities where enterprises for the  smelting of copper and nickel are located (Rezh, Ufaley, and  Karabash in Sverdlovsk Oblast, and Nikel in Murmansk Oblast). In  Magnitogorsk in the atmospheric air the concentration of the  very dangerous carcinogen benzapyrene exceeds the PDK [maximum  permissible concentration] by as much as a factor of 90. There  is increased danger to people's health in many cities with a  well-developed chemical or petrochemical industry. For example,  in "chemical" Sterlitamak the oncological disease rate is twice  as high, the stillbirth rate is six to seven times higher; the  frequency of congenital defects in development is three times  higher; and the disease rate for bronchial asthma is six times  higher.    It was not too long ago when information such as this  probably would have been classified. Today we are attempting to  publicize it as rapidly and as widely as possible. Not in order  to frighten people, but in order to get them to take action.    Sukhaya: Do you believe in my favorite saying,  "Forewarned is forearmed?"    Demin: Definitely, a person can wave a warning  aside and fail to pay any attention to it. But he must have the  right to receive this kind of information.    This is a bitter truth. But there is no need to be afraid of  mirrors. As I have already said, by having information, people  are capable of understanding and changing much in their lives,  if, of course, they still have hope...</p>

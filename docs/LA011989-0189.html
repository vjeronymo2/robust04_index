			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEA VIEW LEAGUE;  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK GETS IT GOING AND BEATS CORONA DEL MAR  </P> <P> The Saddleback High School boys' basketball team overcame a sluggish, sloppy  first half Wednesday night to defeat Corona del Mar, 68-53, in a Sea View  League game at Saddleback.  </P> <P> The Roadrunners, the county's top-ranked team, looked pretty average in the  first half, thanks to Corona del Mar's pressing defense. Though Saddleback  committed 8 turnovers and was outrebounded, 14-9, it managed to hold a halftime  lead of 27-26.  </P> <P> But a strong third quarter kept the Roadrunners from struggling further.  </P> <P> Saddleback opened the third quarter with some impressive defense, forcing  Corona del Mar out of its normally patient offense. The Sea Kings also lost  their edge on the boards, as Saddleback outrebounded them, 8-3, in the quarter.  </P> <P> Saddleback also found its running game. The Roadrunners sped off 10 unanswered  points, boosting their lead to 42-32.  </P> <P> Sean Simon, normally Saddleback's point guard and defensive specialist, was the  team's hotshot in the third quarter. Simon handled the ball well, had 2 steals  and hit 3 consecutive baskets, including a 3-pointer.  </P> <P> Saddleback outscored Corona del Mar, 20-10, in the quarter for a 47-36 lead.  </P> <P> "It's taking us a while to get going, but when it's time to kick in gear, we  do," Saddleback Coach Pat Quinn said. "They get that look in their eye, and I  know it'll be all right."  </P> <P> Craig Marshall scored a game-high 17 points and Simon and Malru Dottin each  added 15 for Saddleback (17-1 overall, 3-0 in league play).  </P> <P> Matt Cwiertnia had 16 points and Brian Spratt 15 for Corona del Mar (12-5,  2-1).  </P> <P> "I thought we stayed even with them for the first half because we kept them off  the offensive boards," Corona del Mar Coach Paul Orris said. "But the second  half, they killed us. I thought we got a little tired too."  </P> <P> Estancia 68, Newport Harbor 49 -- Mike Curtis and Guty Heredia each had 16  points to lead host Estancia.  </P> <P> Estancia (15-2, 2-1) broke open the game by outscoring Newport Harbor, 18-8, in  the second quarter to lead, 27-18, at halftime. Scott Gray led Newport Harbor  (11-8, 0-3) with 18 points.  </P> <P> University 61, Tustin 47 -- Stephan Mumaw scored 20 points, Erik Glassen added  15 and Junior Oliver 12 to give the Trojans (6-11, 1-2) their first league  victory at Tustin.  </P> <P> Cheavly Ly and Jason Moore each scored 12 points for Tustin (11-7, 1-2).  </P></p>

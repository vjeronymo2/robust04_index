			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Greek equities weather change of government - The mood in post-election Athens The Athens stock market has weathered last week's change of government in Greece with unexpected resilience. The opposition socialists' victory in the October 10 general election provoked a rush of gloomy economic predictions. Some appeared to be confirmed when Mr Andreas Papandreou, the new prime minister, declared that the planned sale of 49 per cent of OTE, the state telecommunications monopoly, was being called off. Cancellation will mean revenue losses amounting to more than Dr300bn (Dollars 1.2bn), bringing the government's borrowing requirement for 1993 to around 13 per cent of GDP, against a target of 10.8 per cent. The sale of a 35 per cent stake in OTE to a foreign telecoms operator was forecast to raise at least Dr220bn, while the flotation of another 14 per cent on the bourse had been unofficially valued at Dr90bn. Since plunging some 14 per cent after the election was announced, the index has climbed back steadily, closing yesterday at 852. Although the market has failed to match its midsummer peak, when it reached 955, it is still 28 per cent up from the start of the year. Buying from abroad continues to drive equities, as local investors find interest rates averaging close to 20 per cent on short-term Treasury bills a more attractive prop-osition. Some European insti-tutional investors cashed in their gains when the elec-tion was called, but US fund managers continued buying. Mr Dimitris Verroiopoulos, an analyst at Alpha Brokerage, said: 'Greek equities are good value, with p/e ratios at 10 to 13 per cent, compared to other emerging markets.' The market's confidence is based on the assumption that the new government will maintain its predecessor's commitment to reducing inflation and the public sector deficit under the Maastricht requirements for European economic union. Analysts also seem convinced that the socialists will reverse their privatisation policy, at least where partial flotations of state enterprises are concerned, in order to raise funds for investment. Mr John Markopoulos, chairman of Sigma Securities, said: 'Our perception is that the government will soon be needing cash for OTE's modernisation programme. The constraints on public spending will oblige them to turn to the stock market, and we expect a minority stake in the company to be floated next year.' The optimistic mood is underpinned by anticipation of a flood of EC funding for infrastructure projects, starting early in 1994. With EC inflows expected to total between Ecu17bn and Ecu20bn over the next six years, construction, cement and building equipment companies should benefit. Three construction companies, likely candidates for contracts to be awarded under the new EC funding package, are seeking listings next month. Aegek is to raise Dr1.9bn, Proodeftiki Dr2.1bn and Themeliodomi Dr1.5bn through the bourse. Given these companies' prospects for growth, and the small size of the issues, demand is expected to be lively. However, so long as interest rates stay high, the outlook is less promising for bigger companies considering large rights issues. First-half profits were lower than forecast, even in the food sector where the recession had previously made little impact on sales. In the banking sector, where steady if unspectacular gains were recorded, caution prevails. Commercial Bank, the second-largest state bank, covered a Dr45bn of a planned Dr50bn rights issue launched last month, with many small shareholders said to be reluctant to participate. Following the election, Credit Bank, the country's largest private bank, decided to postpone a Dr30bn rights issue which included a sizeable tranche offered to institutions abroad.</p>

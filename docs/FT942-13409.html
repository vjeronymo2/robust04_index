			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / The Markets: Puncturing the equity bubble - Global Investor US Fed chairman Alan Greenspan did a splendid job in puncturing the global bond bubble. Yet he failed to do quite the same for equities, which on any long term assessment still look on the high side despite their recent volatile behaviour. To take a rather old-fashioned yardstick, the yield on US equities as measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices has risen by less than a quarter of a point to around 2.9 per cent since February 4, while the UK is up by about half a point at 3.9 per cent. Is there a risk that British pension fund managers, whose near-80 per cent commitment to equities sticks out like a sore thumb in all international comparisons, could still come unstuck? I have asked this question before and been rewarded with a mailbag that the politicians would call full and frank. Yet instinct - mine, that is, and clearly not widely shared - suggests that the 18.8 per cent total return on UK equities over the past 10 years cannot be repeated over the next 10 if nominal GDP growth is going to be in the disinflationary 6 or 7 per cent area. That would require the kind of levitation that markets rarely sustain over more than brief periods: a bubble, in short. My conviction that there will not be an early return to immoderate inflation, incidentally, is reinforced by the extraordinary twitchiness of bond markets at the merest hint of an upturn in earnings, or of drift in fiscal policy. We may be past the bottom of the inflation cycle in the English-speaking economies, but much trouble is already discounted. A more weighty case for returning to the question is provided by the publication of the invaluable Pension Fund Indicators, produced annually by PDFM, the London-based fund management arm of UBS. It is not difficult to use PDFM's data to make the case that equities are a dangerous long term investment at today's levels. The first and simplest of the arguments is merely that the returns on UK equities have been so exceptional for so long. Since 1975 they have outperformed the US, Germany and even Japan in sterling terms. Measured in local currency, UK equities still outperformed except in the period of extreme overvaluation in Tokyo in the bubble of the second half of the 1980s. British pension fund managers clearly derived great benefit from their aggressive stance in UK equities in a period when the market value of pension fund assets was rising from Pounds 46.5m (at 1993 prices) in 1963 to an estimated Pounds 491m at end-1993. There was a huge windfall to equities at the expense of gilts on the basis of unanticipated inflation. Yet such success over such a long period may be a handicap in assessing the future, especially if bond market thinking is still over-influenced by past inflation, in which case gilts could have a windfall at the expense of equities. In the long run equity earnings will tend to grow in line with national income. Equities are also expected to generate a higher total return than gilts because markets are said to price equities to allow for their greater volatility - though the risk premium argument is not entirely persuasive in a world where inflation has seriously upset gilt valuations; nor again in an institutionalised market where portfolios are widely spread and UK actuaries value funds by reference to income rather than stock market values. The more important point made by Jim McCaughan of PDFM is that over the past 10 years UK equities have had the benefit of a big favourable valuation adjustment; and that the penalty over the long run for getting the initial value of the investment wrong is lethal, regardless of underlying corporate performance. On a set of perfectly plausible assumptions about a reversion to long run trends in price/earnings ratios, dividend yields, dilution (as a result of capital raising), growth and inflation, he arrives at a projected global real return on bonds over the next 10 years of 2.6 per cent, compared with real equity returns of 2.1 per cent for the US, 2.4 per cent for Europe and minus 3.6 per cent for Japan. That is not what the average UK pension fund manager is expecting, with exposure to real assets (equity and property) of 84 per cent. Still less what the average Japanese manager is preparing for. Yet the vulnerability of Japan to downward valuation adjustments is precisely what should be expected from a market that went from a p/e ratio of 25 in 1983 to 68 at the end of last year - the only mature economy with an emerging market p/e. The message is not reassuring for those buying equities for the long haul. Buy high, sell low In his days as chief investment strategist for James Capel, Alastair Ross Goobey used to do a provocative conference turn in which he demonstrated statistically that pension fund managers almost always concentrate their cash flow on last year's investment story, not on assets that are out of fashion and due for a comeback. PDFM makes much the same point: the peak allocation by pension funds to UK equities - up to three quarters of cash flow - took place after big market rises in 1987 and in 1990-91. Another way of emphasising the importance of timing the initial purchase - see charts - is to look at the number of occasions on which a given level of p/e ratio has been followed by good or bad investment returns. Today's historic p/e on the FT-SE 100 index is over 19. The charts tell us that the number of occasions on which an investor would have earned a positive annual return when the average quarterly p/e has been between 17 and 20 has been a mere three out of 15 times. This is not unlike the exercise carried out by Daniel O'Shea for M&amp;G on the basis of BZW's figures of annual returns between 1918 and 1990, using dividend yields. Taking his figures, you find that in those years when the market has yielded 4 per cent or less, the subsequent five-year real return was negative in 10 out of 12 cases during that period. If fund managers are bad at short run judgments, as Mr Ross Goobey believes, and if the historical evidence suggests that longer run returns will be poor from today's valuation levels, the exposure to equities in the UK needs rethinking. Before reaching for your poisoned pen, do not forget that when George Ross Goobey, Alastair's father, promoted the cult of the equity after the war, portfolios were as choc-a-bloc with gilts as they are today with equities. And with Ross Goobey fils now in charge of PosTel Investment Management, Britain's biggest pot of pension money, we need someone else, please, to do his conference turn. Is he really resisting the temptation to buy high and sell low? Lloyds etc Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society's readiness to accept a less than generous offer from Lloyds Bank has prompted speculation about a stampede to snap up other societies. The financial logic is certainly compelling. In effect, Lloyds is exploiting an arbitrage opportunity between two different forms of ownership. Operating outside capital market discipline in a framework of only modest accountability, the managers of mutually owned building societies may be prepared to accept smaller acquisition premiums to obtain the buyer of their choice. Few customers will quibble about exit p/e ratios. But Lloyds still faces formidable legal obstacles to completion. And as Patrick Frazer of banking consultants DIBC suggests, it may turn out to have scooped the pool much as it did in life assurance with its acquisition of Abbey Life. As with insurance there are many building societies not worth having and some good ones that may not want to be had. A stampede? That's going it a bit.  -----------------------------------------------------------------             TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 21/4/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------                 -------- Per cent change over period---------                  US   Japan   Germany   France   Italy   UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Week           0.07    0.04     0.11     0.12     0.15     0.09 Month          0.30    0.21     0.49     0.53     0.70     0.43 Year           3.44    3.25     6.75     7.81    11.00     6.13  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Week           0.12    0.06    -0.74    -1.10     0.97    -0.85 Month         -1.38    0.82    -0.18    -0.83     1.61    -2.33 Year           0.50    5.86     7.03     8.37    22.66     5.51  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Week           0.60    0.15    -1.95    -2.37     1.37    -1.09 Month         -2.28    2.27    -1.42    -2.54     2.80    -2.83 Year          -0.48    7.09     5.62     7.72    32.65     6.90  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Week           -0.6    1.2      -0.1     2.6       3.8      1.0 Month           2.3    1.7      23.3    15.7      41.4     13.0 Year           -5.3   -6.6      -2.6    -4.5       8.2     -3.8  -----------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------         BEST PERFORMING STOCKS FROM FT-A WORLD INDICES               IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO  21/4/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------                         -------- per cent change ---------                           Close    Week    Month     Year  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Golden Plus (Mal)          9.75    30.0     21.1    316.1 Kelanamas Ind.

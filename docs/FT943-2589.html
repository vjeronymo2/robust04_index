			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / India lays down tight telecoms rules India at the weekend laid down tough terms for the entry of private companies, including foreign groups, into the country's telecommunications market. The government, which said in May it was ending the state's monopoly of basic telephone services, had raised hopes that it would set attractive conditions for entrepreneurs because it is seeking substantial investments of up to Rs230bn (Pounds 4.7bn). But opposition from officials and workers in the telecommunications department has persuaded the government to impose important restrictions. In addition, crucial issues such as revenue-sharing arrangements between the private operators and the state service have yet to be settled. Under the new policy, announced by Mr Sukh Ram, the telecommunications minister, private companies will be limited to providing local networks. They will be barred from operating the much more lucrative long-distance and international services. Foreign companies, which are expected to contribute most of the technology and expertise to the new carriers, will be limited to a 49 per cent stake in an Indian carrier. Companies will be free to bid for licences in 18 regions, which roughly correspond with states. Only one private carrier will be permitted to operate in each region, and will compete with the state-owned service. Licence-holders will have to offer lines in rural areas as well as more lucrative towns and cities. The licences will run for 15 years and there will be no restriction on the number awarded to any one company. Mr Sukh Ram said bids would be invited in the next two or three months and he hoped the first private carrier would start operating in 1995. Mr Sukh Ram also announced the establishment of a regulatory body, called the Telecom Regulatory of India, which will oversee the private operators. The new guidelines evoked a mixed response from the industry. While there was relief that the announcement brought forward the day when private operations might start, there was disappointment about the conditions of entry and the fact that revenue-sharing and tariff arrangements have yet to be decided. Mr Amit Sharma, head of the Indian office of US electronics group Motorola, said: 'The policy of opening up basic services on a limited scale is clearly disappointing. In most countries when basic services are opened up, the long-distance and international lines are the first to be opened, as these are seen to cross-subsidise local services.' India is partly liberalising its pharmaceutical industry, taking measures to let foreign companies take majority stakes in their Indian ventures. Foreign groups will be able to own up to 51 per cent of an Indian pharmaceuticals company, according to Mr Ram Lakhan Singh Yadav, the minister for chemicals and pharmaceuticals.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Securities  Administrative Commission under the State Council and the China  Securities Supervision Council held a joint news conference here  today. Ma Zhongzhi, deputy director of the Securities  Administrative Commission's General Office and the relevant  persons in charge of the China Securities Supervision Council,  respectively, spoke in connection with stock markets and some  related policies in 1994.    Ma Zhongzhi said: With the approval of the State Council,  China will issue 5.5 billion worth of renminbi stocks this year,  roughly the same amount as last year after readjustment. This  amount has been determined after taking full account of the  financial capabilities of this year's stock markets. Ma  Zhongzhi said: In issuing stocks in 1994, the method of  controlling the total supply and demand and the method of quota  administration will still be adopted. At present, the total  amount of stock has been determined, but the stocks have not  been distributed to localities and departments. In view of the  reality that the issuing of stock in 1993 was carried out  largely after August and that some enterprises have postponed  their issuing of stock to this year, in issuing stock this year  it is necessary to take into full account the financial  capabilities of the market. At the same time, it is necessary  to improve the work of reexamining the issuing of stock, enforce  the examination and approval system strictly, and through the  reexamination process, safeguard the state's industrial policies  and the quality of companies whose stocks are listed.    Turning to the listing of state stocks and corporate stocks,  Ma Zhongzhi said: The majority of enterprises in China which  have switched to the shareholding system have been state-owned  enterprises. In this process, stocks have been divided into  state stocks, corporate stocks, individual stocks, and foreign  stocks according to the actual conditions and needs of the time.  Both state stocks and corporate stocks, being ordinary stocks,  should share profits on an equal basis. Currently, however,  only individual stocks and a small amount of corporate stocks  are listed on the stock market, while state stocks have not yet  been listed. Ma Zhongzhi pointed out: In the long run, this  problem must be solved. However, in actual operations, many  problems still remain in the listing of corporate stocks,  because of the lack of good, feasible laws and regulations. Ma  Zhongzhi said: The State Council has ordered the State Economic  Restructuring Commission and its Securities Administrative  Commission to step up the drawing up of relevant laws and  regulations on the basis of summing up past experimentation  experiences, to expand experiments in this field after the  relevant laws and regulations are approved by the State Council,  and for the time being, to temporarily suspend the examination  and approval of applications for the listing of new corporate  stocks. Ma Zhongzhi stressed: Even if measures for  administering the listing of corporate stocks are promulgated,  it will be impossible to list all at once all corporate stocks,  which have accumulated over the years. The listing of corporate  stocks should be solved step by step while taking into account  the financial and technical capabilities of the market. Because  the listing of state stocks is facing an even greater number of  problems, it will be impossible to list them ahead of corporate  stocks. He stressed: The listing of state stocks requires a  process.    Turning to the problem of issuing renminbi stocks  domestically by enterprises whose stocks have been listed  outside the national boundaries, Ma Zhongzhi said: Last year,  the stocks of six Chinese enterprises were successfully listed  in Hong Kong, which attracted the attention of financial and  press circles the world over. The move opened up a new path for  China to attract foreign capital and also helped to speed up the  linking of China's securities markets with the world market as  quickly as possible. In accordance with the instructions of the  leadership of the State Council, a relevant department of state  has decided that 22 enterprises will have their stocks listed  outside of China this year. Ma Zhongzhi said: Each of these  enterprises will be transformed according to a standardized  shareholding system and audited according to international  practices. After that, their stocks will be listed when  conditions are ripe. Their stocks will be listed mainly in Hong  Kong, but a small number of them may list their stocks in the  securities markets of the United States and other countries. Ma  Zhongzhi noted: Taking into consideration the fact that the  amount of stocks to be issued this year must be kept within 5.5  billion yuan, that enterprises which are going to list their  stocks outside China are all state-owned enterprises, and that  the amount will be too large if these enterprises are to issue  A-type stocks, the Securities Administrative Commission under  the State Council has decided that these enterprises will not  issue A-type stocks for the time being and that even if they  want to issue A-type stocks, they must keep the amount under 5.5  billion yuan.    Turning to the administration of stocks for internal staff  and workers issued by shareholding limited companies whose funds  are raised directly, Ma Zhongzhi said: At present, in issuing  stocks for internal staff and workers, some of these companies  have exceeded the proportion and limits, have made public  internal stocks, and have individualized corporate stocks, all  of which run counter to the original purpose of setting up such  companies. Therefore, the State Council recently issued a  circular explicitly banning various areas from engaging in the  high-interest-rate collection of funds in the name of carrying  out experiments on the internal shareholding system. The State  Council has also asked the State Economic Restructuring  Commission to cooperate with the State Economics and Trade  Commission and the State Planning Commission to accelerate the  enactment of standard measures for administering enterprises'  issuing of internal stocks for staff and workers. Ma Zhongzhi  said: Before the new measures are promulgated, the state will  temporarily suspend the examination, approval, and issuing of  stocks for internal staff and workers. To deal with enterprises  which violate these measures, the state will not reexamine their  applications to issue stocks, and still less, to permit their  stocks to be listed.    At the news conference, the persons in charge of the China  Securities Supervision Council told reporters about the illegal  activities of the Shanghai securities office of the Xiangfan  Trust and Investment Company under the Agricultural Bank of  China in the course of serving as an agent for dealing in the  stocks of an enterprise in Shanghai and the decision taken to  punish the violator.</p>

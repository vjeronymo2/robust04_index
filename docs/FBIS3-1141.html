The unions pointed out that  although the government has agreed to the principle of paying  overdue step increases, it has not earmarked funds for the  increase in salary indexes. The government is insisting that  all salary changes should not exceed the allocated 9 billion CFA  francs. The unions recall that the amount can only cover a 10  percent increase on the basis of the 1990 salary index. The  unions, therefore, conclude that the government's decision to  accept the principle of paying overdue step increases is only  aimed at curtailing the workers' past gains. Due to the above  reasons, the unions maintain the strike call and urge all  workers to give their maximum support to the strike in order  that, quote, government maneuvers fail, unquote. Furthermore,  the unions have decided to refer the matter to the appropriate  legal institutions in the country as well as international  organizations for what they term government's machinations,  which infringe on labor rights.    Following the resumption of negotiations with the  government,  the National Federation of Workers' Union of Benin [UNSTB], also  a signatory to the strike motion, has just backed out of the  action. It held an extraordinary session on 19 March during  which its steering committee reviewed workers' social  conditions, especially those of its activists. Given that the  government has accepted the principle of paying overdue step  increases, increasing the salary index, and increasing family  allowances to the tune of 9,225,328,610 CFA francs, the UNSTB  thinks there is a need to continue negotiations with the  government. It has, therefore, decided to suspend its  participation in the strike and urges all its activists to  report for duty as of 0800 this morning.    The government has reacted to the strike threat. It has  reaffirmed that in its 16 March cabinet meeting report, it  expressed readiness to negotiate by agreeing to meet two of the  unions' demands. The government communique clearly stressed  that the cabinet has already confirmed the government position  and informed the unions. It said the government will also  proceed with the necessary actions for the payment of the  28-percent salary increase in conjunction with union  representatives chosen by the unions. It further stated that  work on this has been under way since 18 March to enable the  government to take up the matter quickly at the National  Assembly for an enabling draft bill. Thus, payment of workers'  financial benefits, pending the adoption of the 1994 budget, as  well as their salary readjustments and promotions will be  effective as of the end of April. [passage omitted]    In view of the government's decision, the two reasons given  for the five-day strike announced on 15 March are no longer  valid. Moreover, since no strike motion or any other workers'  demands have been brought before the government, the civil  service minister urges all workers in all sectors to report for  duty without fail as of 0800 this morning.

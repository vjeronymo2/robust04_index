			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / President at the eye of the storm: Attacks on Walesa reflect political uncertainty in Poland Poland's President Lech Walesa, the former army corporal and shipyard electrician who led the Solidarity movement to victory against communism in 1989, is under fire from all sides. The shots are the opening salvos of what promises to be a bruising and prolonged presidential election campaign, in which Mr Walesa is fighting not only for re-election but also for the incorporation of strong presidential powers in the new constitution currently in preparation. Thus far Mr Walesa is the only declared candidate for an election that will not take place until November 1995. His most likely challenger is the smooth, English-speaking Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, a rising star in the last communist government who re-emerged as the eminence grise behind last year's electoral victory of the Communist party's successor, the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD). But the most painful attacks on Mr Walesa to date have come not from his ex-communist opponents but his former Solidarity allies. They have regrouped in a new coalition called the Freedom Union, following their defeat at elections called by Mr Walesa, against their advice, in September last year. That election brought victory for the former communists. For many former Solidarity supporters, calling the election was the most serious of a string of tactical miscalculations made by Mr Walesa since he split the Solidarity movement by his determination to become Poland's first post-communist president in 1990. Last week Mr Bronislaw Geremek, the Solidarity veteran and chairman of the Freedom Union parliamentary group, told the president to his face: 'You pose a threat to constitutional order and democracy in Poland.' Mr Geremek's accusation was followed by harsh criticism from a string of former close Walesa allies, including the former prime minister, Ms Hanna Suchocka. All accused the president of subverting democracy and parliament through what they claimed were his personalised, unaccountable meddling in delicate affairs of state. Mr Walesa's cunning political style helped him outwit the communist apparatchiks five years ago. But the growing army of Mr Walesa's critics view such talents as unsuitable for the president of a democratic society based on law. Critics liken him increasingly to a typical Communist party first secretary under the old regime, used to giving personal orders to cronies and oblivious to legal or constitutional restraint. Under the terms of the 'small constitution', an interim document containing amendments to the communist-era constitution still in force, Mr Walesa secured partial control over the defence, foreign and internal affairs ministries. His intention to maintain and, if possible, strengthen these powers lie behind the actions for which he is now being criticised. These include his interference in the allocation of TV broadcasting licences by the Radio and TV Council, an independent regulatory body. This is seen as an attempt to ensure that licences went to groups likely to support his political aims. And he has used his defence powers to manoeuvre inside the top reaches of the military establishment in a bid to strengthen his grip on the armed forces. Mr Walesa sought the support of top army leaders to remove Admiral Piotr Kolodziejczyk, a one-time ally and former Warsaw Pact admiral, from the post of defence minister. The president saw his generals, led by General Tadeusz Wilecki, the chief of staff, as allies against the minister because of their unhappiness over continuing military spending cuts. Mr Kolodziejczyk resisted the attempt to sideline him, but the move has precipitated a political crisis over control of the 200,000-strong army. It has attracted criticism of Mr Walesa in parliament from Solidarity supporters and former communists, who united to pass a resolution that his actions 'were endangering democracy'. At the same time as Mr Walesa is coming under fire from his former allies, there has been bitter in-fighting between the leaders of the uneasy coalition government of former communists and peasant farmers, which is now at the start of its second year in power. Mr Kwasnieski is the senior partner in the coalition, his SLD party having won most votes in the September 1993 general election. However, he has been consistently frustrated and outclassed by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister and leader of the Peasant party. Mr Pawlak displays qualities of stubborn craftiness traditionally associated with the peasantry in this still largely rural country of small private farmers. While Mr Kwasniewcki has been supporting ideas for modernising Poland, such as privatisation, Mr Pawlak has been dragging his heels and concentrating on using power for the benefit of his peasant supporters. This week, Mr Pawlak agreed to sign a bill to launch the long-stalled privatisation programme - after months of insistent prodding by Mr Kwasniewcki. But he agreed to sign only after securing concessions that take several enterprises of interest to the rural sector out of the programme. Mr Pawlak has also positioned his party as a suspicious watchdog over the largely foreign-managed investment trusts that will manage the 460 or so enterprises included in the programme. In so doing, he has upstaged the ex-communists in pursuit of latent anti-capitalist voters. The prospect of a bitter presidential contest and governmental in-fighting does not appear to have had any impact on Poland's economic recovery and its new found attractiveness for foreign investors thus far. The government's proposal to limit the independence of the central bank  - whose current governor was nominated by Mr Walesa - by creating an advisory board nominated by politicians, is one worrying straw in the wind. It reflects a conflict between the central bank's willingness to keep interest rates high to counter inflation and the government's desire for cheaper financing of the budget deficit. But the recovery in Poland's export markets of Germany and the rest of the European Union, growing trade with and financial inflows from Russia and other former Soviet states, and strong domestic demand are combining to keep up the growth which began in 1992. The economy is set to expand by 4.5 per cent this year and next. Industrial output rose by an extraordinary 13 per cent over the first nine months of this year and growth was export-led. Exports increased 23 per cent in this period to Dollars 10.7bn while import growth slowed to 7 per cent at Dollars 11bn. Rapid growth and higher real incomes carry some risk of over-heating, however. Inflation accelerated in the third quarter, causing prices over the first nine months to rise by 32 per cent on the same period of 1993. But money supply and the budget deficit for this year are both within the limits agreed in the summer with the International Monetary Fund as part of negotiations over a loan to help reduce Poland's commercial debt. Next year's draft budget with a planned deficit of 3.3 per cent of GDP appears achievable. Inflation next year, according to the Finance Ministry, should be about 23 per cent, down from the 31 per cent forecast for 1994 as a whole. Meanwhile the prime minister's go-ahead for the mass privatisation programme will allow the the IMF to disburse funds promised to help finance the first payment of Dollars 1.9bn in the Dollars 14bn London Club debt reduction deal finalised last month. The IMF had earlier made clear that progress on privatisation was a condition for releasing the funds. The combination of debt reduction, IMF approval and mass privatisation is expected to attract foreign fund managers to Warsaw to help the privatisation programme. Their skills will be needed in setting up and running the 20 National Investment Funds that will manage the privatised enterprises on behalf of millions of Poles who have bought privatisation vouchers. Despite the risk of political storms in the months ahead, the improving economic outlook should also be attractive to foreign banks and investors, who have so far been reluctant to set down roots in Poland. Yet this country, the first to overthrow communism, has also been the first to restore macroeconomic stability and, for the past two years, one of the fastest growing economies outside south-east Asia.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Poland's economy: the upswing continues  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                1989   1990   1991   1992   1993   1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- OUTPUT &amp; EXPENDITURE (% CHANGE) GDP at constant prices          0.2  -11.6   -7.6    1.5    3.8    4.5 Consumption at constant prices -1.3  -11.7    3.3    5.0    5.3     na Gross fixed investment at  constant prices                5.1  -24.8   -14.2  -2.6    2.9     na Industrial production          -1.4  -26.1   -11.9   3.9    5.6   13.0* Exports                         4.5   43.4    17.5   9.7   -2.9   23.0** Imports                        16.3   17.9    46.9   6.1   17.7    7.0** PRIVATE SECTOR (% OF GDP)      28.6   30.9    30.0  40.0   45.0  55-60++ PRICES &amp; WAGES (% CHANGE) Consumer prices (annual  average)                     251.1  585.8    70.3  43.0   35.3   30.0 Wages and salaries (annual  average)                     291.8    398    70.6  38.9   37.9     na UNEMPLOYMENT (% OF LABOUR  FORCE)                         0.1    6.1    11.8  13.6   15.7     na MONETARY SECTOR (% CHANGE) Broad money (end-year)        526.5    160    36.9  57.5   36.0     na GOVERNMENT SECTOR (% OF GDP) State budget balance           -6.1    0.7    -7.0  -6.8   -3.4   -4.0 State budget expenditure       36.9   32.7    32.7  33.8   32.5     34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * 1st 9 mths ** 1st 8 mths provisional ++ Estimate  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

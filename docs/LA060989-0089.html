Investor Arthur Goldberg of  Somerset, N.J., who holds 14.1% of Di Giorgio's shares, offered to buy the  company for $30 a share, or about $153 million. The company said it would  respond "in due course." Di Giorgio shares jumped $3 to close at $31 on the New  York Stock Exchange after the offer was disclosed.  </P></p>

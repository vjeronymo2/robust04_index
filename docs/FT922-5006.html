			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ekofisk oilfield back to full production NORWAY'S EKOFISK oilfield was back in full production yesterday, less than a week after being shut down following a fire in an air filter on one of its platforms. Phillips Petroleum, the field's operator, said Ekofisk was producing at slightly above its usual output of 250,000 barrels a day, because of a small build-up of pressure while the field was closed. The nearby Valhall and Hod fields, linked to Ekofisk by pipeline, were pumping a combined 114,000 b/d, up from their normal 100,000. Gas supplies from Ekofisk to a consortium of European buyers via Emden in Germany had also resumed. NPD, Norway's oil industry watchdog, ordered the closure of the field on Monday of last week pending clarification of the cause of a brief fire in the air filter of a gas turbine. Phillips said yesterday that the incident was the result of human error, which led to a small explosion in the turbine following routine cleaning. The company is changing the alarm system on its turbines as a result. The fire occurred only hours before a planned maintenance shutdown that would have closed the field for about 90 hours. Had the Ekofisk closure lasted for an extended period, there were fears that this might have affected production from the giant Statfjord and Gullfaks fields, with combined output of more than 1m b/d. The Ula and Gyda fields, which are also tied into Ekofisk, were not yet producing because of maintenance work, Phillips said, but were expected to be back on-stream soon.</p>

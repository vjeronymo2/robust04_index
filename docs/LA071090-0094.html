			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PAGEANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> FACE TO FACE WITH LIVING MASTERPIECES;  </P> <P> RE-CREATIONS: LAGUNA BEACH'S ANNUAL PAGEANT OF THE MASTERS IS A SURREAL,  SOMETIMES QUIRKY BUT UNDENIABLY MESMERIZING TRIBUTE TO GREAT ARTWORKS.  </P> <P> Smeared with blue-green greasepaint, a naked young woman stands posed on stage  while Tony the Tiger tells an audience that the "uninhibited freedom" of her  orgiastic cult is "pure and radiant."  </P> <P> Has some kind of smutty pagan/cornflake performance art taken over Laguna  Beach's Irvine Bowl? Nope, it's just the Pageant of the Masters in a  neoclassical moment, waxing idyllic about a bronze sculpture of a maenad that  once decorated a private fountain.  </P> <P> With Thurl Ravenscroft, the voice of the cereal-pitching tiger, providing  narration, the 57th annual edition of the "living pictures" show unfolded  Saturday, a surreal melange of art and stagecraft, pretentious, kitschy,  sometimes cloying and -- undeniably -- mesmerizing.  </P> <P> Using live models to pose in blown-up, brilliant copies of paintings, sculpture  and decorative arts, the pageant inevitably produces a spectacle. The  re-creations are like a television screen or a train wreck: It's nearly  impossible to take one's eyes off them.  </P> <P> They display a virtuosity in almost every theatrical craft. In fact, the  pageant is a theater technician's fantasy land: It is perhaps the only  production in which the skills of set painters, costumers, makeup experts and  lighting technicians literally take center stage, free from the shackles of a  playwright's script or an actor's ego.  </P> <P> However, since it lacks any dramatic content, the pageant's impact is as  ephemeral as a fireworks display.  </P> <P> In choosing their repertoire, pageant directors carefully sift the artistic  heritage of the world to remove anything remotely disturbing or challenging,  leaving little but a collection of pleasant decorations.  </P> <P> Instead, the pageant's 23-piece program leans heavily on sentimental paintings  by obscure 19th- and 20th-Century artists, along with a smattering of  historical artifacts and more familiar works. This year's survey of famous art  includes a Monet, a Matisse and Emanuel Leutze's "Washington Crossing the  Delaware."  </P> <P> Pop art is represented by Jules Cheret's fin de siecle posters for a Parisian  ice skating rink. Tex-Mex sculptor Luis Jimenez is the token modern artist  included, while exotica is handled with a display of antique Japanese festival  dolls. The affair closes with the pageant's traditional finale, Leonardo da  Vinci's "The Last Supper."  </P> <P> The program moves more briskly than would be seemly in any museum; a few  minutes of Ravenscroft's reading Dan Duling's reasonably informative script, a  few minutes of eye strain to see if the models are breathing, and on to the  next piece. No time here to contemplate the eternal verities of the muses.  </P> <P> On the other hand, one does have two hours to contemplate how they make a  three-dimensional reality look like a two-dimensional painting trying to look  like a three-dimensional reality. There's room in the world for at least one  Pageant of the Masters.  </P> <P>  The Pageant of the Masters runs through Aug. 26 at the Irvine Bowl, 650 Laguna  Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. Information: (714) 494-1145.  </P></p>

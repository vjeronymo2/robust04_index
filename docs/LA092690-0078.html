			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> SHELL CREDITS BACKS' UNSELFISHNESS  </P> <P> Coach Art Shell said the secret of his team's success is that players have been  giving up personal goals for the sake of the team.  </P> <P> "If you want to be a part of something, you have to leave your egos at the  door," he said.  </P> <P> "The guys have done that."  </P> <P> He cited the tailbacks in particular. Marcus Allen and Greg Bell, both stars,  have shared the position, meaning each gets fewer carries and fewer yards.  "That's the greatest example right there," Shell said. "With those guys, there  are no complaints. It's just going out and playing football and working,  practicing. They get in games and they root each other on. There are no  problems with them."  </P> <P> Bell, coming off consecutive 1,000-yard rushing seasons with the Rams, has  gained 88 yards in 23 carries this season. By contrast, he gained 417 yards in  76 carries with the Rams through three games in 1989. Allen, the Raiders'  all-time leading rusher with 7,404 yards, has 129 yards in 29 carries in 1990.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial information available regarding the past, present and future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threats faced by the arroyo toad in determining to make this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. The arroyo toad has been extirpated from a substantial portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its historic range. Virtually all remaining populations are small and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> face a variety of immediate threats to their continued viability. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toad lives in highly specialized habitats that have been and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be targeted for development and degradation by human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities and is extremely vulnerable to habitat modification and water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality changes. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list the arroyo toad as endangered. Other alternatives to this action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were considered but not preferred because not listing this species at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all or listing it as threatened would not be in keeping with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of the Act. For the reasons discussed below, critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not being proposed at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires to the maximum extent prudent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and determinable that the Secretary designate critical habitat at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not presently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prudent for the arroyo toad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Species,'' the arroyo toad is threatened by taking, an activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to control. Remaining populations of the arroyo toad are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small and geographically restricted, so that they are now vulnerable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unrestricted collection. Publication of specific localities, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required in proposing critical habitat, would reveal precise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locality data and, thereby, make the species more vulnerable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional collection and acts of vandalism and increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficulties of enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service has been notified of the locations and importance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of protecting this species' habitat. Protection of this species'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat will be addressed in the recovery process and through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 7 consultation process. Therefore, it would not now be prudent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine the critical habitat of the arroyo toad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups; and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must enter into formal consultation with the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service (Department of Agriculture) and the Corps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Department of Defense) are the main Federal agencies that will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to protect this species if it is listed. Federal agencies must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consult with the Service, as described in section 7 of the Act, on any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project that may affect this species. The Forest Service harbors a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial portion of known arroyo toad populations; hence, some of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Forest Service actions within the species' habitat may be affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Forest Service activities, such as the construction and maintenance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roads, and the issuance of special use permits for dam and bridge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction, mining, and water diversion projects would be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act's section 7 requirements. Corps activities or issuances of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits subject to section 404 of the Clean Water Act would be subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Endangered Species Act section 7 requirements. Any Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions that are subject to environmental review under the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Policy Act may be subject to the requirements of section 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Listing of the arroyo toad as endangered will provide for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of a recovery plan. Such a plan will bring together both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and Federal efforts for its conservation. The plan will establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a framework for cooperation and coordination among agencies in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation efforts. The plan will set recovery priorities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish them. It will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also describe site-specific management actions necessary to achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation and survival of the arroyo toad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a series of prohibitions and exceptions that apply to endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take (includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collect; or attempt any such conduct), import or export, transport in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wildlife species. It is also illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

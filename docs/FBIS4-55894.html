			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Two Croatian dailies, Zagreb VJESNIK  and Split SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, reported in their 2 May issues on  a 30 April meeting in Zagreb at which breakaway members of the  ruling Croatian Democratic Community (HDZ) founded a new party,  the Croatian Independent Democrats (HND).    "Our appearance on the Croatian political scene restores  belief in democracy in Croatia," Croatian Parliament President  Stjepan Mesic stated in his opening speech (VJESNIK; SLOBODNA  DALMACIJA). Explaining the establishment of the new party, he  added: "The HND has appeared on the Croatian stage because of a  crisis that has afflicted the process of democratization of  Croatian society and the system of governing by the ruling party  and the Croatian state." According to SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, Mesic  said that a "rift" had occurred at the Second Assembly of the  HDZ in October 1993 and that advocates of a "military approach  to the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina" and of "authoritarian rule,"  who sought to limit democracy in Croatia, had prevailed. Under  conditions of war, VJESNIK cites Mesic as stating, "one could  and had to tolerate authoritarian rule over state affairs from a  single center," but now everyone was asking for democratization.    Listed below are the goals and policies of the HND that  Mesic  laid out in his speech, as reported in the VJESNIK and SLOBODNA  DALMACIJA accounts:    - Separation of power into three branches of government;    - Freedom of the media;    - Protection of minorities and respect for human rights;    - Majority rule and a Western-style parliamentary system;    - Decentralization of power through the strengthening of  local administration and self-management to "promote regional  particularism";    - Integration of Croatia into European "trends";    - Promotion of peace;    - Unchangeability of borders;    - Decrease in the level of armaments in the area;    - Support of Bosnia-Herzegovina's integrity and the  Washington agreement establishing the Bosnia-Herzegovina  federation;    - Rejection of Serbia's right to intervene in the "so-called  krajina" issue and cooperation with Serbia only after its  recognition of Croatia within its internationally recognized  borders;    - Closer relations with Slovenia;    - Taking into account "Montenegro's individuality";    - Development of relations with Islamic, nonaligned, and  Mediterranean countries;    - Denationalization;    - Rapid privatization;    - Decreased state influence on the economy and free  enterprise;    - Restoration of the dignity of peasants;    - Social welfare and care for refugees and war invalids; and    - A modern educational system.    SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported that Mesic was elected HND  president, receiving 191 of a possible 197 votes, and that Josip  Manolic, Tomislav Duka, Slavko Degoricija, Perica Juric, and  Dragutin Hlad were elected vice presidents. Darko Hrastovec was  elected the party's secretary. The following persons were  elected to the HND Presidency: Stanislav Pavic, Pero Kriste,  Romano Bolkovic, Leticija Drndic-Antolic, Andjelko Sikiric,  Dalibor Kovacevic, Emanuel Justament, Ante Sare, and Josip  Zebic. A 15-member Executive Council and a 5-member Supervisory  Council were also elected.    After the founding meeting, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported, the  HND leaders held a news conference. Stipe Mesic refused to  answer a question about how many members the new party had,  explaining that "the people are going through the wringer, and  great pressure is being exerted on them." When journalists  pressed for information on what kinds of pressures were involved  and on whom they were being exerted, Josip Manolic responded  that "people were summoned during the night for talks with the  president, during which there were offers and a few threats."    Manolic stated that the HND was already the second-largest  opposition party in the Assembly, adding that "differentiation"  with the HDZ had just begun and will last until the  disintegration of the HDZ, the abolition of the "one-man  monopoly," and the establishment of a political monitoring of  the government by the opposition.    In reply to numerous questions about the HND's support for  increased regionalization, Mesic said that the new party  advocates such plans when they are responsive to regional  individuality and needs. Slavko Degoricija maintained that the  territorial division of Croatia into 22 counties was artificial  and that, historically, it would be more justified to set up  eight to nine regions and to develop regionalism that would  contribute to the integrity of Croatia. The VJESNIK account of  the news conference reported that Croatian Assembly deputies who  had joined the HND said they did not intend to give up their  Assembly seats. VJESNIK also noted that Mesic stressed that the  balance of power in the Assembly with regard to Croatia's  Bosnia-Herzegovina policy had been altered by the establishment  of the HND. In contrast to what he claimed was Tudjman's policy  of partitioning Bosnia between Croatia and the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia, Mesic supported an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 13 Mar (TANJUG)--Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the Srpska republic's people's assembly, has said  the Serbs have no reason to join with Croats and Muslims nor to  allow anyone to deny them the right to join with the Serbs from  other republics.    Krajisnik said this after talks in Pale today with the  Russian president's special envoy Vitaliy Churkin, which took  place after Churkin's talks with Muslim President Alija  Izetbegovic in Sarajevo.    "Churkin came here to inform us about the talks he held with  the Muslim side and about the talks between the Croats and  Muslims. He wanted to hear our position on this," Krajisnik  said after the talks with Churkin.    "Churkin said no obstacles should be put in the way of the  Croat-Muslim agreement. He also said that some people think  that the Serbs should also have a loose link with the  Croat-Muslim federation, perhaps in the form of a union,"  Krajisnik said.    He added that he had told Churkin that the Serb side's  position will be officially presented tomorrow in Belgrade,  where Churkin is expected to meet Nikola Koljevic, the Srpska  republic's deputy president, and Aleksa Buha, the foreign  minister.    "Churkin told me the Bosnian Serbs should have a firmer link  with the rest of the Serb people," Krajisnik said, and added  that the Russian envoy did not define the nature of such a link  in clear terms. "The concept is not exactly clear, but we have  nevertheless undertaken the obligation to negotiate all possible  solutions," Krajisnik said, adding that the Serb side is ready  to resume talks as long as Serb interests are not threatened.    As regards Churkin's statement after the talks with  Izetbegovic that Tuzla airport will not be under the control of  Russian troops but that the Russian military observers will be  deployed there, Krajisnik said: "We reached an agreement on  this in Russia. According to the agreement, civilian Russian  representatives will be deployed at Tuzla airport, together with  the Serb ones. I think this is a realistic agreement, and Mr.  Churkin said today the Russian side will insist on it. This  gives us encouragement in our belief that we will finally reach  the right solution for the opening of Tuzla airport," Krajisnik  said in conclusion.</p>

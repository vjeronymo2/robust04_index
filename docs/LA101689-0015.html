			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS DON'T GET THEIR KICKS, LOSE TO SEAHAWKS, 17-16  </P> <P> The Chargers are getting better at getting worse.  </P> <P> Last week in Denver, a fourth- quarter fumble cost them three points. Moments  later, two defensive penalties led to seven more as they lost to the Broncos by  six.  </P> <P> Sunday at home-bittersweet-home, they allowed the Seattle Seahawks to block an  extra-point try and a field-goal attempt. Both in the final period. The extra  point would have tied the game. The field goal would have won it.  </P> <P> Instead, the Chargers lost, 17-16.  </P> <P> "This," said Charger defensive lineman Joe Phillips, "is as bad as it gets in  my mind."  </P> <P> It was pretty bad in the locker room, too. "It's like we're fighting ourselves,  not the other team," said free safety Vencie Glenn.  </P> <P> The defeat dropped the Chargers to 2-4 and into a two-way tie for last place in  the AFC West. It was also their ninth loss in their last 10 games against  Seattle (3-3), a team that hasn't won a home game.  </P> <P> After Seahawk end Jeff Bryant looped inside and blocked Chris Bahr's  extra-point kick with 4:14 to play, the Chargers trailed by one. They got the  ball back immediately when Lester Lyles stripped return man James Jefferson and  David Brandon recovered.  </P> <P> But four plays later, Joe Nash also looped to block Bahr's 51-yard attempt. It  was the fifth field-goal block of Nash's career, a Seahawk record. It was the  team's second of the year.  </P> <P> Also, Seattle blocked an extra-point kick against Phoenix the second week of  the season.  </P> <P> "They block kicks as well as anybody in the league," said Joe Madden, the  Charger special teams coach.  </P> <P> Still, the Chargers would have gotten one more shot at a game-winning field  goal if backup left tackle Joey Howard, subbing for the injured Joel Patten,  hadn't held linebacker Rufus Porter with 20 seconds to play. Howard's hold  nullified a Jim McMahon-to-Victor Floyd pass that would have given the Chargers  a first down at the Seahawk 24.  </P> <P> "We made enough errors in the fourth quarter to lose two football games," said  Charger Coach Dan Henning.  </P> <P> McMahon, who finished with 25 completions in 39 attempts for 286 yards, said:  "Just like last week."  </P></p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nedlloyd returns to black with earnings of Fl 10m Nedlloyd, the Dutch transport group, swung to a net profit of Fl 10m (Dollars 5.4m) in the first quarter of 1994 from a loss of Fl 86m in the same period of 1993. The company, which yesterday implemented its new policy of publishing quarterly figures, said the improvement stemmed largely from cost-cutting, lower interest expenses, the firmer dollar and higher volumes of ocean-going cargo. Turnover was virtually flat at Fl 1.60bn compared with Fl 1.61bn. In line with the company's performance in 1993, Nedlloyd's ocean shipping saw the biggest improvement, posting an operating profit of Fl 24m against a loss of Fl 57m in the same quarter of last year. Although downward pressure on shipping rates resumed in early 1994 after a period of stable rates in 1993, Nedlloyd said it was helped by a rise in the volume of cargo transported. Nedlloyd's European road haulage business saw a rise in operating profit to Fl 14m from Fl 9m, but the performance was still below expectations. Nedlloyd repeated earlier forecasts that it would post a profit for the full year.</p>

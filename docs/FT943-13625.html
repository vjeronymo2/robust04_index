			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Hunt promises to ease difficulties of teleworkers The government yesterday gave its most enthusiastic endorsement yet of teleworking - using information technology to work from home - and promised to review any regulations and restrictions which prevent its growth. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said: 'We need to know of any areas where legislation or its interpretation is creating special difficulties for telework so that we can deal with them.' He also revealed that Whitehall has established a Teleworking Special Interest Group to serve as a contact point for all with interests in the subject. Mr Hunt said at a seminar organised by the Social Market Foundation and 3Com, the US telecommunications company, that a recent Department of Employment survey found that one in 20 British companies employed teleworkers. The Henley Centre for Forecasting has estimated that there will be 3.3m teleworkers in Britain by next year, or about 4.6 per cent of the workforce, and some estimates say that 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the workforce in many developed countries will be teleworking to some degree by the end of the century. Mr Hunt said: 'Teleworking can have great benefits for both employers and employees, but it can also have pitfalls. We need to learn from experience, so the pitfalls can be identified and avoided.' Mr Hunt said that the employment department survey found a high level of satisfaction among teleworking managers. More than three-quarters of managers interviewed were 'very satisfied' with their present teleworking arrangements, and a further 19 per cent 'fairly satisfied'. The main reasons they gave for this, according to Mr Hunt, were higher productivity, higher reliability and work quality, high staff loyalty and lower staff turnover. Ms Janice Roberts, vice-president of 3Com, told the conference that studies in California had found that teleworking increased productivity by between 15 per cent and 20 per cent. She said that if it was necessary to mix working from home with coming into an office the best balance was usually three days at home and two days in the office.</p>

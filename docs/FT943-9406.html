			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: SCI given go-ahead in Great Southern battle Service Corporation International was yesterday assured of winning Great Southern Group, the UK funeral company, when the Takeover Panel refused an attempt to block its revised offer of 775p per share. Loewen, the Canadian funeral group, was trying to prevent SCI from raising its bid because the US company made a 'final' 680p offer which omitted a standard clause allowing this to be raised in the event of competition. The Panel decided this omission by SCI's advisers, led by Schroders, was attributable to 'a genuine mistake, however regrettable that might be'. Given these exceptional circumstances, the Panel judged that SCI should be allowed dispensation from the rules. Loewen has been refused the right to appeal the decision. The decision drew some criticism for setting a precedent whereby a financial adviser could benefit from a mistake through special pleading. However, SCI agreed to recompense all shareholders who sold shares under the misconception that the offer could not be increased. This made it awkward for the Panel to block an offer so clearly in the interests of all shareholders. The decision will be a relief to Schroders, SCI's merchant bank, which might have faced action from SCI had the bid failed due to the mistake. Loewen had offered 690p cash, 10p higher than SCI's earlier bid. The Loewen bid had a clause requiring 90 per cent approval for their offer - an impossibility given SCI's 29.8 per cent holding - but they had given assurances that this would be reduced. The clock will now be reset for SCI's bid, but the outcome is now certain. JD Field has given irrevocable assurances on behalf of its 56 per cent holding of Great Southern's ordinary shares, so the US largest burial company will now become the third largest UK funeral business.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strong currencies reap clear bourse rewards BOURSES drew a clear distinction between weak and strong currencies in yesterday's pandemonium although Sweden, like the UK, seemed mollified by the extreme reaction at central bank level, writes Our Markets Staff. On London indications, Switzerland and the Netherlands put up the best performances yesterday afternoon, and Spain and Italy the worst. Mr Reinhard Fischer, head of equity research at Paribas Capital Markets, noted that the Germans, in a so-called hard currency market, were paying DM1.14 for a Swiss franc compared with DM1.07 a few months ago. STOCKHOLM had little time to evaluate the increase in the central bank's marginal lending rate, back to 75 per cent from the 20 per cent announced in the morning. The later rise to 500 per cent, as the bank moved to protect the currency against devaluation, came after the close. In a turbulent day the Affarsvarlden index lost 5.1 to 740.0 in turnover of some SKr430m, down some SKr599m on Tuesday. Mr David Longmuir of James Capel said that the massive interest rate rise would stop any speculation against the krona, but such a rate could only be held for a few days. The Riksbank later said that 'considerable inflows of currency' had been noted after the rate rise was announced. A stronger dollar helped some sectors, especially forestry, with Stora free shares rising SKr9 to SKr220 and SCA free shares gaining SKr2 to SKr285. PARIS moved from lows in the morning session, reflecting news that President Francois Mitterrand had had cancerous tissue removed and the first of the day's two rises in UK interest rates, to gains in late trading. Some analysts said that the market was given the boost by expectations of an EMS realignment today, accompanied by a devaluation of sterling and a further cut in the German Lombard rate. Currency movements and a rise in the bond market fed through into equities and the CAC-40 index closed up 23.63 or 1.3 per cent at 1,859.78. The index had earlier seen a low of 1,786.37 while turnover rose to FFr3.4bn from FFr2.4bn. FRANKFURT see-sawed but ended almost even, the DAX index closing just 2.99 lower at 1,584.56. Investors returned to German shares near the end of the session, via orders from the futures market, after the Netherlands and Belgium announced cuts in key interest rates; by then the market was talking seriously about further German cuts and realignments. The speculation on another German interest rate fall - with the weekend cuts reflected in a further drop of 11 basis points, to 7.91 per cent, in the Bundesbank's average bond yield - prompted active trading in bank shares. Deutsche Bank rallied DM3.50 to DM650.50, putting on another DM5 in London later. However, the accompanying strength in the dollar did not do much for carmakers; while BMW recovered in the afternoon, by about DM5 after an official close DM2 lower at DM547, Volkswagen lost DM1.00 in the session to DM330.00 and recovered little thereafter. MILAN incorporated the losses seen in London on Tuesday afternoon, and after opening indications of an 8 per cent drop the Comit index fell 18.21, or 4.9 per cent to 354.93 during the official session. There were wide fluctuations in London's lira-denominated equivalent, but it ended less than 0.5 per cent down on the day. Turnover in Milan was extremely heavy by recent standards, estimated at around L200bn after a climb from L78.2bn last Friday. Banca Commerciale Italiana bucked the bearish domestic trend, closing L212 higher at L2,766 on speculation that the government wanted to sell its 57 per cent stake in the bank, and quoting L79 higher at L2,845 in the post-bourse. Fiat fixed L320 down at L3,505 and lost another L5 on the kerb. ZURICH stood out like a good deed in a naughty world, the SMI index rising 20.3, or 1.1 per cent to 1,871.7 and, in London, the Swiss component of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index putting on 39.97, or 3 per cent to 1,357.01. Dealers mooted the prospect of gradually lower European money market rates, and there was strong buying interest in interest rate-sensitive equities. In banking, SBC advanced SFr6 to SFr266; Zurich Insurance rose SFr55 to SFr1,955. AMSTERDAM was lifted by the 0.25 percentage point cut in interest rates by the central bank and the CBS Tendency index closed 0.4 higher at 112.7. Financial stocks were among the day's gainers with ABN Amro up Fl 1.50 to Fl 46.90, AMEV up Fl 1.70 at Fl 56.30 and Aegon Fl 1.40 higher at Fl 67.00. MADRID came off intraday lows as the general index lost 2.63 to 211.25. The market was unsettled by activity in the rest of Europe and fears that the peseta may have to be devalued today, some analysts said. Post-bourse trading in the Spanish component of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, calculated in D-Marks, reflected these fears with a 47 point fall to 1,000.79. There was heavy trading in Telefonica which went against the trend, rising Pta30 to Pta1,085 with some 2.7m shares traded. BRUSSELS, another strong currency market, put up a 2.64 point rise in the Bel-20 index to 1,110.60. Petrofina eased BFr10 to BFr8,740 with some 15,800 shares traded. Banks were heavily traded following interest rate cuts elsewhere in Europe. Generale de Banque fell BFr70 to BFr6,800 while Kredietbank climbed BFr40 to BFr4,930 with 15,800 shares traded. In chemicals, Solvay fell BFr150 to BFr11,800.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 16                             Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Open    10.30am   11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm    3 pm      close 1037.96  1037.63   1037.66  1041.06  1048.61  1049.50  1047.91  1053.63               Day's High 1057.53      Day's Low 1034.13          Sep 15      Sep 14      Sep 11      Sep 10      Sep 9         1051.69     1073.79     1033.57     1027.59     1021.42  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

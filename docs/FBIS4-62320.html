			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Text] Geneva, 14 May -- The document from the Geneva  meeting, which took place on Friday [13 May] clearly shows the  need to fulfill all the world community's decisions on Bosnia.  This applies, among other things, to the embargo and the  sanctions established by the United Nations, Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev told journalists today, commenting on  the recent decisions of the U.S. Senate and the Russian State  Duma, envisaging the possibility of a unilateral revision of  international obligations.    In the run-up to the Geneva meeting, we found ourselves on  the threshold of a kind of war between parliaments. The U.S.  Senate decision provides for the possibility of the embargo on  arms deliveries to Bosnia being lifted unilaterally. In our  Duma there are not a few supporters of a unilateral lifting of  sanctions against Belgrade. It is true, the minister said,  "Lukin's amendment" fleshed out the latest Duma decision, and it  is "fairly balanced."    In the Yugoslav conflict, all sides are bearing their share  of the responsibility, Kozyrev said. It is therefore not  fortuitous that in the communique of the ministers' meeting on  Bosnia, both hotbeds of the conflict -- both Gorazde and Brcko  are mentioned -- even though we had to argue a bit in this  connection.    The head of Russian diplomacy believes that unilateral  revisions of the UN Security Council [UNSC] decisions would only  result in the destruction of the system of international  relations. In that case the fulfillment of international  treaties would be out of the question, he said. That is why the  paragraph that mentions strict observance of all UNSC  resolutions has been included in the Geneva document.</p>

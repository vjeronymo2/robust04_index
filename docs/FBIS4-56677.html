			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 7 May (DPA) -- Charrito [Ciriaco Palacios]  and Northiel [Wilfredo Gutierrez or Wilfredo Chavarria], two  recontra leaders, have made death threats against Cardinal  Miguel Obando y Bravo, Esteli Bishop Monsignor Juan Abelardo  Mata, and parish priest Octaviano Rodriguez, Managua's morning  newspaper LA TRIBUNA reported today.    According to the publication, the religious leaders were  threatened because they favor the disarmament of the group of  former rebels organized in the 3-80 Northern Front, which  surrendered its weapons and returned to civilian society.    The bishop of Esteli, a city located more than 100 km north  of Managua, said the armed groups "have been telling the  peasants they are going to kill us because we helped El Chacal  (Jose Angel Talavera, who was the leader of the 3-80 Northern  Front) to demobilize."    The armed groups are being pursued by Army and police troops  following an order by Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro to  eradicate the armed gangs that have committed murders,  robberies, and kidnappings.    Esteli Bishop Mata received death threats last year from the  pro-Sandinist Peasant-Worker Revolutionary Front (FROC).</p>

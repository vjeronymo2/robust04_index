			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Accra, 10 Jan (PL) -- Captain Kojo Tsikata, member  of Ghana's Council of State, today voiced his concern over the  situation in Angola and the future of the ruling party, the  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).    During an interview with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina, the old politician charged that Western governments --  without mentioning names -- are exerting pressure to accommodate  in power Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the armed UNITA [National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola].    Tsikata criticized the support some governments are still  giving the Angolan armed rebel group that was defeated in the  September 1992 first-ever multiparty elections considered valid  and just by the United Nations.    In another part of his conversation with the Cuban foreign  minister -- who arrived yesterday in this city for an official  two- day visit -- Tsikata regretted the tensions prevailing in  Liberia, where Ghana has sent troops to contribute in the search  for a political solution to the crisis in this West African  state.    Likewise, he encouraged the Nigerian leaders to prevent an  outbreak of violence in that country.</p>

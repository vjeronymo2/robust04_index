			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Unit trust savings continue to flow in Savers continued to invest in unit trusts last month in spite of uncertain market conditions. Figures from the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds showed a net inflow of Pounds 726m, of which 87 per cent came from private investors. The figure is down from last May's inflow of Pounds 915m, but well above 1990-92 levels; 1993 was a record year for the unit trust industry, with net investment of Pounds 9.1bn. Mr Philip Warland, the association's director-general, said the figures pointed to a healthy change in saving habits, as investors appeared to be ignoring short-term market movements and investing for the long term. The growth of regular savings schemes, particularly via personal equity plans, also contributed to a steadier flow of money into trusts. Trusts in the UK equity income and UK growth sectors were most popular with private investors during the month, attracting Pounds 124m and Pounds 111m respectively. There are now more than 1m unit holders of UK equity income trusts. Among institutional investors, funds shifted out of the Far East excluding Japan, and European sectors, and into Japanese trusts in May. Japanese trusts were also popular with private investors, attracting a total of Pounds 158m net new money. Unit trusts now have a total of Pounds 95bn under management, down from the peak of almost Pounds 100bn in January this year, before most stock markets started to fall.</p>

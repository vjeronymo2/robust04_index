			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan 19 (AFP)--China will be able to  manufacture its own combat aircraft and "advanced helicopters"  by 2000, the president of the Chinese aerospace industry, Zhu  Yuli, said Wednesday [19 January].    Zhu provided no details about the aircraft, which he said  were part of an ambitious "takeoff plan" by his industry in the  coming 10-to-15 years. Western military experts said Zhu may  have been referring to the Super-7 fighter, which has been on  the Chinese drawing board for years. It is an updated version  of the J-7, which itself is a derivation of the Soviet-designed  MiG-21, they said. The MiG-21 is considered a relatively  mediocre craft, mainly because of the forward location of the  air intake, which limits the size of the radar. Russia is  already a known partner in developing an engine for the Super-7,  although it is not known whether it will take part in devising a  new radar for it.    China has been showing off a model of the prototype at air  shows abroad, in a bid to woo a foreign partner. The U.S. firm  Grumman Corp. put forward a proposal, but scrapped it after the  Chinese military helped quell pro-democracy protests in Beijing  in 1989. "Whatever kind of combat plane they have in mind, the  Chinese have to find a partner, because they don't have the  technical ability to manufacture a plane of this kind by  themselves," an expert said.    China has also been urging Russia to sell it a production  line for the high-performance and highly rated MiG-31.    Zhu also announced that China "will gradually construct a  complete research and production system for advanced  helicopters." Western experts said this was apparently a  reference to anti-tank helicopters fitted with night sights for  operations after dark. "However, the Chinese have much to learn  before they master this technology," one said.</p>

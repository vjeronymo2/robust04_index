			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Arjun-Rao Unannounced War Continues"] </F>   [Text] Ever since Narasimha took over the reins of this  country, Human Resources Development Minister Arjun Singh (who  was a candidate for the prime minister's position) has been  voicing his opposition to his performance very eloquently. Again  and again, he does something or says such things that cause  problems and worries for Narasimha Rao. On 20th April, while  talking informally with the news media, he told them out of the  blue, "The era when people caused problems between me and the  prime minister has gone. It will not happen again. The problems  that the ruling party and the nation are facing now are so  serious that there is no room for such activities.    "There was a time when each word I uttered was  misinterpreted and misunderstandings were created between us.  However, from now on, these people will not get the opportunity  to cause such disagreements between us.    "After the vidhan sabha elections in northern states, I had  met the prime minister on my own and discussed the political  scenario. I had told Mr. Rao directly that it did not matter  what people said, I believed that it was not in anyone's  interest to let such things go on and on. The prime minister had  agreed with me in that meeting. I have also shared my feelings  in the recent Congress high command meeting."    While Mr. Arjun Singh said this all, he also hinted that he  disagreed over the GATT agreement, however, he was going to  stand by whatever decision the Party makes.    It is especially important to mention here that Arjun  Singh's  opinion about GATT is his own and he had asked Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao to call a meeting of all political parties to  discuss GATT so that a national opinion can be formed.    When Arjun Singh was asked if he agreed with the government  over GATT, he said that he was on one side in the cabinet  decision and also did understand the meaning of "collective  responsibility." The way Arjun Singh said that made it clear  that he had his own opinions about GATT and several aspects of  the economic policy.    When the correspondents asked Mr Arjun Singh if he supported  the idea of knowing national opinion about GATT, he replied that  we must look at his issue very carefully. We all have accepted  the idea of liberalization and joining our economy with the rest  of the world. India cannot survive in total isolation.  Therefore, we have to develop standards keeping our nation's  interests in mind. Can a person deny the fact that these  standards should be collaborative and according to people's  desires?    Mr. Arjun Singh said that he had suggested to Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao before GATT was brought to debate in the  Parliament to call a meeting of representatives of major  political parties to form a consensus after listening to their  ideas. However, this meeting could not be called in the time  that was available. Mr. Arjun Singh used every word very  cleverly and cautiously when talking about Mr. Narasimha Rao's  efforts to call this meeting.    The reporters asked Mr. Arjun Singh why he did not defend  the  government over GATT in the Parliament. Mr. Singh presented a  lengthy explanation. He said that an informal meeting of the  central cabinet was held in the presence of Narasimha Rao on 28  February 1994. It was said in that meeting that many people were  raising "totally unrelated issues" to benefit politically. It  was decided at that time to prepare brief responses to issues  that were creating misunderstanding in order to share facts with  the public.    Mr. Singh said that the prime minister asked him to prepare  the list of these issues. After talking with the people who had  something to say about these issues, he prepared a list of those  issues according to his ability and sent to Commerce Minister  Pranab Mukherji after the prime minister's approval.    Talking further, Mr. Singh said that when he returned from  Egypt on 24 May [as published], he learned about the opinions of  the commerce minister on each of those issues. At that time, it  has been already decided to have special discussion on 29 March,  however, it was not possible to call a meeting of all parties  representatives during that time. It was very difficult for him  to talk or discuss these issues in the Parliament because of  these developments and because the people who had to say  something about these issues were not contacted for their input.    Mr. Singh took the reporters back to the recent past and  said  that he was asked to chair the cabinet committee formed in 1992  to review the Dunkel draft. This committee held some meetings  and opinions of various groups and people was solicited as the  issues included in this draft were very sensitive and important  for our nation's future. This committee seeing the long-range  implications of this issue, unanimously recommended that this  whole issue should be debated in the Parliament and only then  should the government make its decision.    All in all, Mr. Singh meant that by not getting opinions of  the major political parties before signing the GATT agreement,  the recommendation made by the cabinet committee was ignored.  His statement, which was delivered in very careful words, has  created a difficult situation for Narasimha Rao's government  once again. Its proof is that clarification of this statement  was requested in the Parliament yesterday and the government had  to face embarrassment.    Instead of going into the details of GATT and Dunkel  proposals or debating their appropriateness or unsuitability, it  would not be out of context to mention here that no one can  object to the idea of getting opinions from all major political  parties as it is important to have national agreement over  important national issues. However, the way he blows hot and  cold in the same breath, talking about ending his differences  with the prime minister, and then talking about ignoring the  cabinet committee's recommendations is really amazing. This  indicates that he has not changed his ways yet--his undeclared  war against the prime minister is still going on.    As for difference of opinion, differences are an important  part of the democratic process, however, there should be some  principle about expressing differences. Any difference of  opinion with the party or the government should be taken care of  within those organizations. No one benefits when these  differences are aired in public; instead, everyone gets hurt.    Anyhow, the way Arjun Singh has made contradictory  statements  at the same time has forced every intelligent person to wonder  which one is right and which is wrong. The poet [Kabir] was  right about Arjun Singh when he wrote, "God will not understand  whatever he does."</p>

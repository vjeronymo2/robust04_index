			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Polypipe maintains growth with 20.5% rise Polypipe, the manufacturer of plastic pipes and fittings and other domestic plastic products, yesterday announced results which continue its unbroken run of successive annual profit increases since its 1985 flotation. Pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 grew 20.5 per cent to Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 17.1m) on turnover ahead 21 per cent at Pounds 145.4m (Pounds 120.5m). Operating profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 17.4m), before unchanged net interest payable of Pounds 300,000. The shares rose 5p to 144p yesterday. Mr Kevin McDonald, chairman, managing director and owner of 21.2 per cent of the group, ascribed the maintenance of margins to three essential factors. First, he spoke of 'the group's consistent strategy of investment in a substantial and continuing capital expenditure programme'. In the year this rose to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 12.5m), against depreciation of Pounds 8.9m (Pounds 7.2m). Planned expenditure for the current year was Pounds 12.5m, with, said Mr Bryan Stock, finance director, 'Pounds 5m to Pounds 6m on plant, Pounds 3m on tooling, Pounds 1m on buildings and the rest on lorries'. Second, on the expansion front, the group bought Allerton Glass - now merged with GCA Windows - in June 1993, and last May it spent up to Pounds 10.1m on Janoplast, the Alsace-based manufacturer with 11 per cent of the French plastic conduit market. The French company, Polypipe's entree into Europe, contributed Pounds 1.9m to group sales in the year. It exports 9 per cent of its turnover, taking Polypipe beyond the French and into the Belgian, Czech, German and Swiss markets. Third was the group's 'ever-expanding range of products'. Part of the motive for this is the search to make products to the same specification but using less raw material. Mr McDonald said price rises of PVC of 20 per cent or more had led the group to lift its own selling prices. Polypipe had no gearing at the year-end and cash balances of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 6.7m). Earnings rose 19 per cent to 8.83p (7.4p) and the recommended final dividend is raised 10 per cent to 1.59p for a total of 2.3p (2.1p). COMMENT The biggest question exercising the City over Polypipe is: can it forever pass the rises in raw material prices on to its customers? The answer seems to be yes, for now. PVC accounts for 45-55 per cent of the group's selling prices, but Polypipe does scour the earth for cheaper supplies. Polypipe is also sensible in the way that some 60 per cent of its capital expenditure goes into profit generating areas, with the figure rising to 70 per cent in the current year. The recovery in the refurbishment market, echoed by Caradon on Tuesday, should take the eye off flattish profits at Janoplast for a year or two. With forecast pre-tax profits for the year at Pounds 24m, the shares are on a multiple of 14, in line with the sector, but perhaps with more to play for.</p>

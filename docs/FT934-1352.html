			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Oil-rich infants vulnerable to Moscow bullying: Popularity of Zhirinovsky increases Russian threat to republics The southern belt of the former Soviet Union and its infant petro-economy is perhaps the most vulnerable of Moscow's neighbours to a more aggressive foreign policy. The region, from the Black Sea to China's western border, seems threatened on various levels by the resurgent Russia promised by the Liberal Democratic leader, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, whose neo-fascist party won a large bloc of seats in parliamentary elections just over a week ago. Among the worries south of Russia is the prospect of agitation by the south's ethnic Russian population which, according to incomplete returns, supported Mr Zhirinovksy in equal or even larger numbers than he received overall at home. The backdrop to the anxiety is that, while much of the region may manage to assert itself once its oil and natural gas industries develop, the south still manages little resistance to Moscow's political and military dominance. Even before the election, an aggressive Moscow had reclaimed rights in Azerbaijan's rich offshore oilfields, Georgia's strategic Black Sea ports and Tajikistan's mountainous buffer zone against radical Islam. The first signs of trouble have already appeared in the eight-nation region (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan). In Kazakhstan, Mr Zhirinovsky's birthplace, which like Ukraine has a large ethnic Russian population, a nationalistic Slavic group called Lad (Concord) adopted some of Mr Zhirinovsky's ideas at a political conference last Saturday. The conference, held in the Russian-dominated northern city of Pavlodar to prepare for the republic's March 7 parliamentary elections, approved a platform including the establishment of a joint army and open borders with Russia, a return to the rouble zone, and the legalisation of dual citizenship. Mr Valery Galeyko, head of Pavlodar's leading Russian-speaking association called the Slavic Community, says Lad also plans alliances with local ethnic Germans, Tatars and Chechens, to oppose what it considers Kazakh discrimination. 'We need dual citizenship to restore the destroyed Soviet Union,' Mr Galeyko says. Lad's declaration may be only the beginning of the republic's ethnic problems resulting from the elections. 'When a neighbour's house is burning you cannot stay quiet,' says Mr Manash Kozybaev, a historian in the Kazakh capital, Alma-Ata. 'Russia is not burning yet, but there are those who want to set it on fire.' Kazakhistan is also insecure economically. Although one day it will be wealthy from its huge oil resources, today it is entirely dependent on Russia to refine and transport its oil. All of central Asia is vulnerable to Moscow to some degree. Russian forces, for example, are the conspicuous military backbone across central Asia's southern border with Afghanistan and Iran. Some 6,000 Russian officers supervise Turkmenistan's fledgling army. Ninety per cent of Uzbekistan's military officers are ethnic Russians. And Tajikistan is completely dependent on a more than 25,000-strong Russian force to protect its southern and eastern frontiers against a radical Islamic-led opposition. The same predicament is faced in the Caucasus. Before agreeing grudgingly to join the Moscow-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States, Georgia and Azerbaijan reached the brink of disintegration in wars that were armed and, according to an abundance of evidence, encouraged by forces in Moscow. Azerbaijan now seems likely to face even greater pressure to succumb to Russian demands for a 20 per cent stake in a British Petroleum-led consortium that has negotiated rights to exploit 4bn barrels of offshore oil. Moscow also wants Baku to abandon the idea of shipping its oil through Turkey, a step that would strip Russia of its leverage as Azerbaijan's sole distribution point.</p>

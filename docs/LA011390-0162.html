			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALLEN TO BRING 'MEN ARE PIGS' GIG TO IRVINE IMPROV  </P> <P> Men are pigs.  </P> <P> That's the launching point for Tim Allen's stand-up act. In Allen's world, the  men gather round to grunt approvingly at the new lawn mower on the block. They  track grease through the house as a way of marking territory, and turn a visit  to the tool department at Sears into some kind of religious/sexual pilgrimage.  </P> <P> If the household dusting were left to Allen, he would duct-tape all those  annoying knickknacks down and fire up the leaf blower.  </P> <P> Allen's fresh but decidedly middle-American slant on the old  men-and-their-tools routine has, to his own surprise, earned him a loyal and  growing following in trend-happy Southern California. He'll be in Los Angeles  tonight to tape a segment of the syndicated series "Comic Strip Live" before  heading south for a sold-out Sunday night gig at the Irvine Improv.  </P> <P> "I would never have thought Southern California would have taken to me," Allen  said this week during a phone interview from his Detroit home. But when he  appeared on a four-comic bill at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim last May, he  got the biggest audience response -- and when he returned to Orange County in  July for an extended stand at the Laff Stop, fans greeted him with his own  trademark "men are pigs" snort.  </P> <P> Allen gives a good part of the credit for his local success to the weekday  radio feature "Five O'Clock Funnies" on KLOS-FM, which has featured him  regularly. And he believes that Orange County's suburban flavor -- where  "taking care of your house and going to the hardware store are very fulfilling"  -- may explain why he has been able to build the exposure into a following  here.  </P> <P> No overnight success (he first took the stage as a comic in 1979), Allen has  toured incessantly for five years, building other loyal pockets of fans  throughout the Midwest and East. He even has a few devotees who follow him,  Grateful Dead-style, from gig to gig.  </P> <P> While he describes himself up as a solidly Midwestern kind of guy, he does live  in Los Angeles' Hancock Park a few months out of the year, acting in  commercials and attending auditions.  </P> <P> "I like it there," Allen said. "It's kind of a neighborhoody place. . . .  There's gutters to be cleaned. I could bring my parents there and they'd say,  'This is Los Angeles?' "  </P> <P> He says his "hardware-storeish" material stems at least partly from his own  interests -- he's a car fan who owns a vintage Mustang and a new Cadillac --  and he finds particular inspiration on the streets of Los Angeles. "I almost  break my neck looking at cars around there," he said.  </P> <P> Still, the former hardware salesman berated all those new, warehouse-style  discount hardware outlets, stating his preference for the small, neighborhood  store near his home in Detroit where the owner "knows every goddamn screw in  the place."  </P> <P> After his very first night on stage as a comic, Allen broke a ceramic tile from  the floor of the club; he now has it framed and mounted on his wall, with the  date written in felt pen: "3/23/79."  </P> <P> He claims he keeps it so that "when I go back to working in a hardware store, I  can tell my granddaughter, 'I used to be a comic.' And she'll say, 'Oh, sure.'  "  </P> <P>  Tim Allen headlines at the Improvisation, 4255 Campus Drive, Irvine, Sunday at  8:30 p.m. Admission: $7. Information: (714) 854-5455.  </P> <P> </P></p>

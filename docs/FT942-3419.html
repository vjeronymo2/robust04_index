			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Consumer prices rise by 0.2% as retail sales fall The pace of US consumer spending slowed last month and inflationary pressures remained modest, official figures indicated yesterday. The Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.2 per cent in cash terms last month, but remained 6.4 per cent higher than in May last year. The decline followed a revised 1.1 per cent drop in sales in April. Consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 2.3 per cent in the year to May. Both figures were weaker than analysts expected, but were in line with other data pointing to a loss of economic vitality in recent months. The dip in retail spending probably overstated the weakness of consumer spending, which was artificially boosted last year by cash released from refinancing mortgages at lower interest rates. Recent softness mainly reflects a sharp fall in car sales after a very strong first quarter. Spending may also have been depressed by higher tax payments in April following implementation of last year's deficit-reduction measures. Mr David Rolley, senior economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, the forecasting group, said he expected real consumer spending to grow at an annual rate of about 2 per cent in the second quarter, less than half the pace in the first three months. Spending, however, would probably rebound in the third quarter given strong recent increases in payroll employment, he said. The 'core' consumer price index - which excludes the volatile elements food and energy - rose 0.3 per cent last month and by 2.8 per cent in the year to May. Core consumer price inflation rose at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in the past three months, indicating a slight deterioration in the underlying trend.</p>

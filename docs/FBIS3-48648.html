Korea had exports of 11.69 billion U.S.  dollars and the lowest growth rate of the nine east Asian  countries except for Hong Kong, which registered a 2.8-percent  fall. Korean market share declined 0.1 percentage points to 4.9  percent. It was 4.2 percent in 1986 and since then had stayed  above 5 percent.    China's exports rose 21.3 percent, the highest rate of the  nine countries, because of price competitiveness and increasing  foreign investment. Beijing's share jumped from 7.3 percent to  8.5 percent.    Singapore had 16.3 percent growth on the strength of  electronic parts and Malaysia was at its elbow with 16.2 percent  as Japanese companies are expanding their investments.</p>

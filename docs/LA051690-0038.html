			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> Cambodian Dancers May Perform at L.A. Festival: L.A. Festival officials were  encouraged following talks concerning the proposed visit in September of the  National Dance Company of Cambodia. "Things went very well -- extremely well --  and we're very encouraged," said L.A. Festival executive director Judith Luther  Tuesday upon her return from a day of Washington meetings with immigration and  state department officials to discuss the visit. Luther said the officials were  "open . . . and, I think, supportive to the extent they can be," despite the  fact that the U.S. government does not recognize Cambodia or its current  leader, Hun Sen.

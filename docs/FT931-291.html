			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Orders for engineering products in west Germany fell in February Orders for engineering products in west Germany fell by 13 per cent in February compared with the same month a year ago, the German Engineering Industry Association reported yesterday, Ariane Genillard writes from Bonn. Orders coming from German producers were 20 per cent below the level of February last year, while orders from abroad dropped by 4 per cent. The association said the sharp decrease reflected the recession in the domestic economy, especially in the steel industry and among the motor manufacturers. For the three months to February, engineering orders were 20 per cent below the same three months last year. Orders for the whole of 1992 had fallen by 7 per cent. Orders in Germany decreased by 9 per cent. Orders from abroad fell by 3 per cent.</p>

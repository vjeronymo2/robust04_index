			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY AWARDS  </P> <P> In response to "Judge Slashes $5.74-Million Award Against West Covina Police,"  Metro, July 11:  </P> <P> I will never understand how a judge (one person) can justify in any way  overruling a jury's (12 people) award.  </P> <P> Why not do away with juries altogether in all cases where the judge does  whatever he wants? In my opinion this is just a joke and disgrace to our  so-called judicial system, and a clear violation of our civil rights to have a  jury of our peers decide on the amounts of awards, etc.  </P> <P> JEFF M.

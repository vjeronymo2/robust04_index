			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Palestinians put faith in arrival of policemen Thousands of Palestinians waving their national flag and singing traditional songs about the orange and olive groves in the land of Palestine lined roads to the Egyptian border yesterday and waited in vain to give Palestinian policemen a heroes' welcome. The policemen, many of them former soldiers and veterans of wars with Israel, are now expected to cross the border today. Their arrival is seen by most Arabs as the first real change on the ground after the Palestinian self-rule agreement for Gaza and Jericho, signed in Cairo last week. For hundreds of people left waiting yesterday, the police presence marks the beginning of the end of 27 years of Israeli occupation. More than 100 policemen had been expected to cross the border before nightfall and take over a former army base in Deir al-Balah. Another contingent of 270 policemen is camped on the Jordanian border waiting to cross into Jericho, the future seat of the Palestinian administration. Eventually the Palestinian police force will number 9,000 men, 7,000 of them from outside the occupied lands. Donkey carts and cars draped with the Palestinian flag and pictures of Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, choked the road to the crossing. As the policemen were delayed frustration overtook the festival spirit and Israeli police and soldiers fired rubber bullets, percussion grenades and tear gas to push back unruly youths. 'The whole world is here watching you,' shouted one marshal in a camouflage jacket. 'People are going to judge us by how we behave here. This is a historic day for celebrating, not for throwing stones,' PLO officials urged the crowd by loudspeaker. But violence broke out across the Gaza Strip despite the officials' efforts. At Neve Dekalim a Palestinian youth was killed when Jewish settlers opened fire on Palestinians throwing stones. At least 10 Palestinians were wounded by Israeli soldiers in other incidents. Young people, who remain suspicious and hostile to Israel, clearly intend to taunt and harass departing Israeli soldiers who are set to evacuate the Strip within days. Israeli officials blamed the delay on the PLO ill-preparedness and said they had wanted Mr Arafat to name his 24-member 'cabinet' before allowing police into Gaza-Jericho. Palestinians said part of the delay was caused by difficulties airlifting policemen from conflict-torn Yemen. Older Palestinians, however, were less impatient. 'We have been waiting years for this happy day; a few more hours won't hurt,' said Mr Abdel Malik el-Masri, 42, a farmer. 'The policemen are our soldiers and they will bring us safety and security and end the occupation. Things will start to change.'</p>

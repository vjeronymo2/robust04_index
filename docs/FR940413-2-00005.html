			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Results of the Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This review covers EMD entries into the United States by one manufacturer/exporter, TOSOH. Given the TOSOH did not respond to the Department's questionnaire, we consider it to be an uncooperative respondent, and have assigned to it a margin based on best information available. Our practice, for uncooperative respondents, is to apply as BIA the higher of (1) the highest of the rates found for any firm in the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation or prior administrative reviews, or (2) the highest rate found in this review for any firm (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Final Results of Administrative Review: Antifriction Bearings (other than Tapered Roller Bearings) from France <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 39729, 39739, July 26, 1993)). Therefore, we used, as BIA, the highest of the rates found for any firm in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Final Determination of the Antidumping Duty Investigation of EMD from Japan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (54 FR 8778, March 2, 1989), which is 77.43 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine that the following margin exists for the review period: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,15,11 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Manufacturer/exporter <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Time period <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Margin  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> (percent) <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> TOSOH  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 04/1/92&hyph;03/31/93  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 77.43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries for the period of review. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act. A cash deposit of estimated antidumping duties based on margins for the period of April 1, 1992, through March 31, 1993, shall be required on all shipments of subject merchandise from Japan, as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be that established in the final results of this administrative review; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this or any previous review conducted by the Department, the cash deposit rate will be the ``all other'' rate established in the LTFV investigation (54 FR 8778) of 73.30 percent, as discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade, in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Floral Trade Council  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  822 F. Supp. 766 (1993), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal Mogul Corporation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 839 F. Supp. 864 (1993), decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In proceedings governed by antidumping findings ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  proceedings originally investigated by the Treasury Department), unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department adopts the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final results of administrative review published by the Department of Commerce (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) as the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because this proceeding was investigated by the Department of Commerce, it is governed by an antidumping duty order. Therefore, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this review will be 73.30 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the LTFV investigation (54 FR 8778). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least seven copies must be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than April 25, 1994, and rebuttal briefs, no later than May 5, 1994. The Department will publish the final results of the administrative review including the results of its analysis of issues raised in any case or rebuttal brief. We will hold a public hearing, if requested, to afford interested parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be held on May 12, 1994, at 1:30 p.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce, room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.

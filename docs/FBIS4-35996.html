			<p>BFN     [Text] In Kashmir, a second attempt was made on the life  of the banned JKLF [Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]  president, Mr. Yasin Malik, in Srinagar today when he was  leading a processing to the Idgah graveyard. One of his  associates died and several were injured when extremists  showered bullets on them at Kankahi Mohallah. After the  incident, Mr. Malik was whisked away to a safe place by his  supporters. Later, he told a press conference that his  attackers belong to the pro-Pakistan extremist outfit, the  Hezbul Mojahedin. Yesterday, Mr. Malik had a narrow escape when  the Hezbul Mojahedin tried to kidnap him from a hospital, but  his supporters foiled the attempt.    [Hong Kong AFP in English 1618 GMT 3 Jun 94, in a  Srinagar-datelined report, adds the following: "A pro-Pakistani  Moslem rebel group Friday denied trying to kill a rival  separatist leader after dragging him out of hospital and later  firing on a march organised by him in this Kashmir summer  capital.    "The Hizbul Mujahideen group said the Thursday attempt on  the  life of Yasin Malik, the leader of the powerful Jammu and  Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), and the attack on a rally a day  later, were staged by disgruntled JKLF members.    "`Lobbyism in the JKLF was responsible for the attacks,' a  trenchant Hizbul Mujahideen statement said. `JKLF workers tried  to kill Yasin Malik on Thursday and Friday.'    "Hizb spokesman Mohammed Sadiq said Malik's charges were  baseless and an attempt to gain public sympathy and coverage in  the media.    "`It is a ploy,' he said, referring to Malik's allegations  that Hizbul Mujahideen activists had again targeted him Friday  during an attack on a procession which killed at least two  militants and injured four.    "`If it is proved that Hizbul men were involved, we will try  them,' Sadiq added.    "Malik, who advocates an independent Kashmir unlike most  other groups who want the state to accede to Pakistan, announced  a three-day strike from Saturday to protest the attack by `black  sheep and criminals.'    "He also announced a fast until the 70-odd warring militant  outfits reorganised themselves under three heads: those  favouring independence for Kashmir, those wanting to join  Pakistan, and a third `general category.'"]</p>

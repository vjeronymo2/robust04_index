			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mustafa al-Liddawi, representative of Hamas </F> in Beirut, by Ja'far Salim and 'Abbas Surur; place and date not  given]    [Text] [AL-'AHD] What happened recently between Hamas and  the Jordanian Government? What are the reasons?    [Al-Liddawi] The progress achieved by Hamas, especially in  the occupied territories, coincided with a clear decline in the  PLO leadership's popularity. The PLO leadership did not like  it. Through an alliance with Israel, it presented several  complaints to the Americans against Jordan, where the Hamas  representative and its official spokesman reside. Hakam  Bal'awi's visit to Jordan and his talks with the Jordanian prime  minister on the need to dwarf Hamas' role came within this  context. The visit took place 15 days ago and it was followed  by another visit to Jordan by Yasir 'Arafat, who tried to drive  a wedge between Jordan and Hamas.    The other reasons given are not true; they are not the real  reasons behind the threats to Jordan by Rabin and Peres.  Statements by the Hamas official spokesman and representative  in Jordan concerning the 'Afula and Hadera operations were made  after the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam groups inside the occupied  territories announced their responsibility for the two martyrdom  operations. The operations were used as a pretext to implement  this conspiracy against fraternal Jordan, to blackmail it,  especially after Jordan's recent position toward the blockade of  the Jordanian port of al-'Aqabah and Jordan's link between its  continuing participation in the bilateral talks and the lifting  of the blockade. On top of this comes the painful impact of the  martyrdom operations on the occupation government.    [AL-'AHD] It was said that Ibrahim Ghawshah and Muhammad  Nazzal's passports were withdrawn. What information do you have  on this?    [Al-Liddawi] We do not say that the Jordanian Government  withdrew their passports. But after the news conference that  King Husayn held in Amman following the Israeli threats to  Jordan, the Jordanian foreign minister summoned Ghawshah and  Nazzal to explain developments and the government's position on  them. After listening to the two, the minister asked their  permission to keep their passports with him.    [AL-'AHD] Many observers expect relations between Hamas and  the Jordanian regime to become tense.    [Al-Liddawi] We do not expect such a thing. Our relations  with the Jordanian Government remain good, despite what  happened. Jordan appreciates that the Palestinian cause is  important for it. There are many reasons leading it to create  good relations with Hamas, which in turn appreciates Jordan's  importance for the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian people  in general. We also deeply respect all the Arab and Islamic  countries, especially those where we have an information,  political, or charitable presence. We want their security to be  stable, especially Jordan's. Hamas has no organizational  infrastructure or armed presence outside Palestine. It is not  our policy to embarrass Jordan or any other country. We believe  that relations with Jordan will not be harmed by what happened.  The government's recent measures against Hamas will not last.    [AL-'AHD] King Husayn's recent statements indicate that his  regime recognizes only the PLO as the Palestinian people's  legitimate representative. How do you view these statements?    [Al-Liddawi] This stance is not new. It has long been the  Jordanian Government's official stance. So what is strange in  the king's statements? He has said nothing new.    As for our stance on the legitimacy of 'Arafat and his  organization's representation of the Palestinian people, we  believe that neither the PLO nor Hamas represent the entire  Palestinian people. In our view, the party that legitimately  represents the Palestinian people is the one that will be  brought forward by honest Palestinian elections in which all  Palestinians participate, wherever they are. This is what we  are calling for.    [AL-'AHD] Muhammad Nazzal told AL-'AHD two weeks ago that  Hamas would hit the Israeli settlements with rockets. What is  your comment on this?    [Al-Liddawi] That's what I and brother Muhammad Nazzal read  in the statement issued by the Martyr 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam  Battalions in the occupied territories. It threatened the  Zionists with more military operations against the enemy's  soldiers and settlers in retaliation for the massacre  perpetrated by the settlers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.    We are expecting more painful operations against the enemy  by  the Martyr 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions.    [AL-'AHD] Does this mean that the target of these operations  will be the settlements built in the territories occupied in  1967 or the ones throughout Palestine?    [Al-Liddawi] This question should be put to the Martyr  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions operating in occupied Palestine  because all the planning, preparation, and implementation of all  the military operations is carried out in the occupied  territories.    [AL-'AHD] How do you envisage the relations between Hamas  and Fatah in the event of the implementation of the self-rule in  Gaza and Jericho and the entry of 'Arafat and the Palestinian  police force into these two areas?    [Al-Liddawi] We yearn to maintain good relations with all  the  sides in the occupied territories. Fatah enjoys support in the  occupied territories and any fighting between Hamas and Fatah  would trigger the fire of civil war in Palestine. We must avoid  this as far as we can. Any struggle between the two inside the  occupied territories would be bloody and destructive to our  people. We must, therefore, try hard to avoid any explosion of  the situation. Proceeding from this perspective, we hold  meetings with all the forces in the occupied territories,  including Fatah and others.    Hamas will not take part in the Palestinian force that will  be established in Gaza and Jericho. We hope this force will  support our people and will not be a tool in the hands of the  occupation authorities.    [AL-'AHD] Are you afraid there will be sedition, especially  as many people predict there will be?    [Al-Liddawi] We are confident that sedition and infighting  are an Israeli dream. Israel is paving the way for them. If  there is sedition it will only serve the Zionist interests. It  will be devastating for the people. We hope that everyone will  realize the dangers and ramifications of sedition. We also hope  that the people are aware of this and will do all they can to  avoid it and undermine the objectives of the conspirators.    [AL-'AHD] How do you view the arms phenomenon in Palestine?  Is the Mosad involved in supplying the arms?    [Al-Liddawi] Weapons are being distributed inside the  occupied territories. Everyone is collecting the weapons for  his own goals. Some people gather weapons for the sake of the  resistance and jihad, while others store them for self-defense.  But other people are collecting weapons with the help and  planning of the Mosad to see that things flare up and any  sedition worsens. We all know the objectives of the Israeli  intelligence in stirring problems among the various parties.  For this purpose, the intelligence service is exerting every  effort and using its agents.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Leftist guerrillas claimed responsibility for the assassination of El  Salvador's national fire department chief. The Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front said on rebel radio that a commando unit ambushed Col. Roberto  Armando Rivera, 45. It said Rivera's death was justified because "he was a  military officer with a clear record of criminal acts and repression." They  said he gave courses in psychological warfare and interrogation techniques and  was linked to right-wing death squads that terrorized the country in the early  1980s.  </P></p>

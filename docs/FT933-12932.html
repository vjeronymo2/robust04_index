			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Chirac chides Balladur The emergence of Mr Edouard Balladur as a possible contender for the presidency appears to be playing on the nerves of his patron and party leader, Mr Jacques Chirac, who has rebuked the prime minister for not marking a sharper policy 'rupture' with the preceding Socialist government, writes David Buchan in Paris. A report by the Liberation newspaper that Mr Chirac used a lunchtime meeting on Monday with coalition leaders to chide Mr Balladur for not pursuing distinctive polices on the economy, education and defence was yesterday confirmed by some of the participants. Mr Chirac, who stayed out of the government to remain free to run for the presidency in 1995, seems to have been irked at Mr Balladur's failure to curb rising unemployment, at his acquiescence in President Mitterrand's decision to defer parliamentary consideration of private school funding, and at the prime minister's agreement with the Socialist president that France should continue its suspension of nuclear tests.</p>

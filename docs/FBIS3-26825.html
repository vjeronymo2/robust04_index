Chen Huanyou,  secretary of the provincial party committee and provincial  governor, made an important speech at the conference. Cao  Hongming, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and  secretary of the Commission on Politics and Law under the  provincial party committee, presided over the conference.    After fully affirming the work done by the procuratorial and  judicial front in Jiangsu in 1993, Chen Huanyou said in his  speech: To fulfill our province's objectives by the end of this  century, we must have a stable social and political environment  as our guarantee. Reform, opening up to the outside world, and  economic development on the one hand and stability on the other  form a unity, and they are mutually promoting each other.  Without economic development, there will be no foundation for  stability; at the same time, without a stable environment, we  will not succeed in doing anything, for stability is the basic  condition for reform and opening up to the outside world. This  year is crucial for us to push forward the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure. In accordance with the  unified plans of the party Central Committee, we will introduce  a series of major reform measures. Party committees and  governments at all levels must have a good understanding of  this. They must not only seize the opportunities and accelerate  development, but also stick to the principle of "grasping two  links at the same time and attaching importance to both" and  attach special importance to the safeguarding of social and  political stability. Procuratorial and judicial departments at  all levels, as the main force and the departments whose  functions are to maintain social and political stability, must  have a clear understanding of the situation and the heavy  responsibility they are bearing. They should further enhance  their sense of responsibility and their awareness of their  mission, exercise their functions scrupulously, work hard, and  continue to play a role in maintaining a social and political  environment characterized by stability and unity.    Chen Huanyou pointed out: In carrying out their work in  1994, procuratorial and judicial departments should focus on the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee and the main tasks set by the national conference on  judicial and public security work; while concentrating on the  requirements for establishing a socialist market economic  structure and on the task of ensuring the smooth progress of  reform, they should conduct thorough investigations and studies,  closely rely on the masses, further improve their standard of  implementing policies and enforcing the law, and go all out to  safeguard social and political stability. Procuratorial and  judicial organs must uphold the people's democratic dictatorship  to fully exercise their functions and role. All localities must  promptly organize forces to effectively crack down on criminal  elements and to resolutely check the increasing incidents of  serious crimes; do a good job of providing legal services in  line with the needs of the new situation; adhere to the  principle of integrating specialized organs and the masses;  implement the measures for the overall improvement of social  security; do a good job in reforming procuratorial and judicial  work; and strive to raise the standard of their work.    Chen Huanyou stressed: It is our steadfast principle to  strengthen the party leadership over procuratorial and judicial  work. Party committees and governments at all levels must  further strengthen their leadership over this work and grasp  firmly in their hands the important task of safeguarding social  stability. He said: We must always concentrate on economic  construction. At the same time, we must always bear in mind  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's elaboration of the principle of  "grasping two links at the same time and attaching importance to  both," never slacken our work of maintaining social and  political stability, and never allow the erroneous tendency of  grasping economic work while slackening efforts to fight crime  to reappear again. In the future, we must act according to the  stipulations of the party Central Committee and make the state  of social security an important criterion for evaluating party  leading cadres. Chen Huanyou said: Party committees,  governments, and leading cadres at all levels must consciously  safeguard the dignity of law and help procuratorial and judicial  organs to strictly exercise their functions according to law.  We must strengthen law enforcement supervision. Anyone who  ignores the dignity of law and interferes with the handling of  cases according to law, no matter who he is, must be strictly  dealt with. We must effectively strengthen the building of a  contingent of procuratorial and judicial personnel. First of  all, we must strengthen the leading bodies of procuratorial and  judicial organs by promoting to the leading bodies cadres who  are young and capable, politically sound, professionally  competent, and who are impartial in exercising their functions.  At the same time, we must guard against admitting bad people  into the leading bodies. We should pay attention to education  and training work and raise the political and professional  quality of the police force. Party committees and governments  at all levels should show concern for and attach importance to  the solution of practical difficulties faced by procuratorial  and judicial organs.    Yu Xingde, member of the Standing Committee of the  provincial  party committee, provincial vice governor, and deputy secretary  of the Commission on Politics and Law under the provincial party  committee, made a summed-up report at the conference. He called  on all localities to earnestly implement this conference's  guidelines and ensure the fulfillment of this year's  procuratorial and judicial tasks. He said: At present, it is  imperative to ensure political and social stability around the  time of the Spring Festival this year so as to guarantee that  the people of the province will have a happy, harmonious, and  peaceful Spring Festival.    Also attending the conference were Cao Keming, deputy  secretary of the provincial party committee; and Hu Fuming, Gu  Hao, and Li Yunshi, members of the Standing Committee of the  provincial party committee.</p>

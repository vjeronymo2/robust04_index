			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (15): Test case for the future - Indonesia: Power projects THE HEART of the government's programme to expand the power sector lies in the construction of the Paiton complex in East Java with a planned capacity of 4,000MW. The complex will consist of four pairs of units - two of 800MW a pair and two of 1,200MW - all anticipated to be coal-fired. The Dollars 305m contract for the construction of the first 800MW pair of units, which will be owned and operated by PLN, the state-owned electricity utility, was awarded in 1990 to a consortium led by Sumitomo of Japan. The contract for the second 800MW pair has yet to be put out to tender. In what will prove a test case for the future of the power sector, the government has asked private consortiums to finance and construct the remaining, larger, Paiton units. The units would remain privately owned and operated. An estimated 7,000MW is already privately generated in Indonesia, but the Paiton units would be the first to be linked to the national grid. The companies secure a return on their investment by signing a long-term price agreement with PLN for their production. Last year, the government awarded an exclusive right to negotiate for the pair to a consortium of Intercontinental Electric Incorporated (IEI) of the US and PT Bimantara Baya Nusa, part of the Bimantara Citra Group led by the second son of President Suharto. Industry officials say that IEI's preliminary proposal was for a long-term price agreement of over eight cents a kilowatt hour, while a competing consortium of Mission Energy of the US and Mitsui of Japan had requested about 6.3 cents a kilowatt hour. Industry officials say PLN's average tariff is 6.6 cents per kilowatt hour. The different bids would have provided a rate of return on project costing between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 2bn, industry officials say. One reason for the disparity of the bids, donor officials say, may have been the extent to which the different consortiums were offering to construct infrastructural facilities or differing assumptions on variable costs such as fuel. When the IEI consortium was awarded the exclusive right to negotiate for the project, industry officials say the World Bank expressed its concern to the government over the lack of competition in the final period of negotiation. The World Bank is not directly involved in Paiton, but it is funding other PLN power projects and has set PLN long-term cost and tariff targets. An element of competition has now been brought into the process, if only indirectly. The government has allowed the Mission Energy-Mitsui consortium to place a proposal for the construction of the remaining 1,200MW pair of units at Paiton. Neither project has yet been awarded, although the IEI proposal has received offshore borrowing approval from the government. Foreign bankers stress that the government must make a final decision quickly to win the confidence of the money markets. Industry officials say the pay-back period for the projects would be between 10 and 20 years and there is still uncertainty as to whether either consortium will raise the finance. Indonesia's other power sector ambition, still in its infancy, is to generate nuclear electricity. Canada's Atomic Energy Company has an active programme training staff of Batan, Indonesia's atomic energy agency. It has established a nuclear facility in Serpong, completed in 1989, although this is presently limited to workshops, a computer centre and a cycloton to produce radio-isotopes for use in nuclear medicine. A Japanese consortium is undertaking a consultancy study on nuclear feasibility, although no commercial reactor is likely to be in place for another 15 years.</p>

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said,  "Japan cannot agree to such an idea while they neglect to do  what they should do and are trying to wrench something from  Japan."    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and EU Commissioner  in charge of External Economic Affairs Leon Brittan have called  for the opening of negotiations with their counterparts in Japan  and Canada on market access issues.    The official, however, said, "it is another thing if they  are  willing to really seriously discuss trade rules."</p>

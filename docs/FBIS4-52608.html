			<p>BFN     [Text] Jala-Jala, Rizal -- President Ramos yesterday said  government has licked the insurgency problem, not through  military warfare but through economic development.    Inaugurating a P [Philippine pesos] 4.5 billion rural  development project funded by the Japanese government here, he  cited this farming-fishing town as an example of how to turn a  rebel- dominated area into a "vibrant, bustling community."    "Tapos na `yung problema na 'yon, nasugpo na natin `yon (We  have overcome that problem)," the president declared, referring  to the communist insurgency.    In the case of Jala-jala, he said, the government won not  through the military solution but by providing livelihood  programs and job opportunities to the people.    Mr. Ramos, a former Armed Forces chief of staff and later  defense secretary, recalled that this area used to be  "strategic" to the New People's Army.    He said this town by Laguna Lake was often used as a  jump-off  point because several key areas and provinces are easily  accessible from here.    Having been once stationed in the area as a junior military  officer, the president added he had seen how the Huk [anti-  government rebel group] and later NPA [New People's Army]  campaigns had turned the area into a "no man's land."    He also said this town had been isolated for so long from  the  rest of Rizal province and Metro Manila because of lack of  concrete roads and infrastructure.    "But now, you're no longer isolated here," he told farmers  and fisher folk in a speech at the newly completed rice  processing complex.    The president said the rural development project, now on the  second phase of implementation, has helped made this possible.    Funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency,  (JICA),  the project comprises a rice processing complex, irrigation,  water and power supply systems, and trunk and feeder roads.    Construction began early last year and is expected to be  completed March 1995. Yesterday's ceremonies involved the  turnover of some of the completed facilities and equipment.    Agrarian Reform Secretary Ernesto Garilao said Jala-jala has  also become a "model agrarian reform community" through the land  distribution component of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform  Program (CARP).    "The problem of skewed land ownership, which is the reason  for rebellion in the area, has been addressed," he said.    From having nine landowners, he said, Jala-jala has been  transformed into a town of 2,000 farmer-landowners.    For his part, Japanese Ambassador Yoshifumi Matsuda [name  and  title as published] said his government intends to give priority  to CARP projects in extending more economic aid in the future.    In brief remarks during the turnover rights, he said his  government believes CARP should be implemented "as fast as  possible."</p>

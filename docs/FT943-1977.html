			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (1): It's no longer a seller's market - Though equity prices have weakened this year, the flow of global issues has held up. But is the heavy autumn schedule too much? Activity in the international equities market has held up surprisingly well this year, given the adverse market conditions which have undermined share offerings. Despite the reversal of sentiment in the world's financial markets triggered by the rise in the US Federal Reserve's interest rate in February, international syndicated equity offerings launched in the first half of 1994 totalled Dollars 32bn, according to Euromoney, compared with Dollars 38bn for the whole of 1993. (Figures include all international tranches of equity offerings but exclude funds, preference shares, convertible bonds and bonds with equity warrants). However, the raw numbers do not fully reflect the reality of the international equities market this year. The fact is that offerings have become much harder to place, and a large number of deals have had to be postponed, cancelled, cut in size, or have their pricings adjusted to make them more attractive to investors. The heavy flow of new issues in the first half of the year, despite the poor performance of underlying stock markets, created severe indigestion in the new issues market. A lull in activity during the summer months, and a recovery in some stock markets, has helped the new issues market regain some of its composure, but there are still concerns that the heavy schedule of offerings for the autumn will be hard to absorb. 'The buyers are coming back and some deals are going well, but there is nervousness about the volume that is waiting to come crashing down,' says Mr Amir Eilon, a managing director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Investors have become more choosy about companies and pricing levels they will accept. In the bull market of the early 1990s, it was a seller's market. Fund managers had only recently woken to the attractions of diversifying their assets and were hungry for stocks from new markets to which they had little exposure. The partial removal of restrictions on share ownership in emerging markets encouraged a feeding frenzy, often with little heed to the fundamentals of the companies involved. The hardening of attitudes this year was partly spurred by the poor performance of some deals such as Ina, the Italian insurance company, and Austria's Mayr-Melnhof. However, the change of sentiment has been felt across a range of markets and sectors and cannot be pinned to any one deal, according to investment bankers. 'Investors are still there for good specialist stories, but they are staying away from overpriced deals,' says Mr John St John, a director of Kleinwort Benson. Those issuers unwilling to cut pricings to suit investors have in some cases had to shelve offerings. Among notable deals indefinitely postponed this year were Italian savings bank Cariplo's L1,650bn offering and a planned Dollars 1bn issue for Videsh Sanchar Nigam, the telecommunications monopoly, by the Indian government, which would not cut a price thought too high by fund managers. Other ambitious offerings have had to be scaled back. For example, Liberty Life, the South African insurance group, had to cut its planned Dollars 500m global convertible bond offering to Dollars 300m, partly because of jitters caused by the resignation of the finance minister shortly after the elections. Smaller deals have also suffered. For example, Ayala Land of the Philippines recently pulled a planned Dollars 100m offering of convertible bonds via Morgan Stanley. It was the company's second attempt to tap the market, having previously failed to bring an offering of global depositary receipts (GDRs). Although the nature of the international equities market is that offerings are distributed among a wide range of investors, two groups of investors - in the US and the UK - have played a pivotal role in the market's development. The appetite of investors in the US market has given US houses with an international presence and domestic distribution a particularly strong platform for international equities business in recent years. However, as the turn in sentiment hit the US market first, US investors have proved particularly selective. Arguably, domestic US deals have suffered most. But there has also been a sharp decline in US demand for international offerings. For example, the French privatisation issue for UAP, the insurance company, suffered from poor US take-up. The UK market has also been an important source of funds for the international equities market. According to estimates by Kleinwort Benson, the broking house, about Pounds 9bn of the Pounds 52bn of cash flow generated by UK institutions this year is likely to be dedicated to foreign equities - a decline from last year's level of Pounds 10bn or 20 per cent. That percentage, after rising steadily for a number of years, appears to have plateaued out. There has also been a shift of focus from the regional to the sectoral, which originated among US institutional investors. Historically, fund managers made decisions on asset allocation on a country-by-country, or region-by-region basis. But, as the understanding of the differences between regions has become more sophisticated - and as differences in countries' practices have started to be ironed out - more fund managers have looked at industry sectors, such as telecommunications, on a global basis. The result is a keener focus on the value offered by particular companies within their industry. This year, investment bankers have been spending a lot of time on the phone to finance directors, explaining why deals they have been mandated to arrange should be put on hold. However, some underwriters have been criticised for promising more than they can deliver to win mandates. But for most companies the fear of a failed issue, or the unwillingness to sell assets cheaply, overrides the need for financing. The exceptions are the sizeable number of European governments which need to raise funds through privatisations to finance deficits, and cannot afford to wait. These governments are more likely than companies to accept reduced profits from the sale of shares. However, the privatisation free-for-all has exacerbated the problems caused by market conditions. In the early years of privatisations, governments operated an unofficial queueing system, whereby they timed their large offerings to avoid a surplus of deals at any one time. Governments may react by skewing placement of privatisation deals towards their domestic markets, as is likely to be the case with Renault, the French carmaker. For investors, the positive side of the situation is that they are more likely to find bargains. For example, global depositary receipts are now being offered by Indian companies at substantial discounts. The lull during the summer has 'taken the froth off the market,' according to one investment banker. 'Those companies which are coming to the market are being much more pragmatic.' Despite this year's more difficult market conditions, competition for business remains fierce. For the year to date, Goldman Sachs leads Euromoney's league table of bookrunners. However, the weakening of appetite among US investors has led to a slight decline in the dominance of US institutions, with only four US houses in the top 10 for the year to date, compared with seven in 1993. The main gainers have been Paribas, which has jumped to second place, with only eight mandates, and Deutsche Bank, which has reached sixth place with only three deals. Among the losers, Salomon Brothers has dropped from seventh to 12th place and JP Morgan slid from ninth to 19th position. Away fom the ebbs and flows in the fortunes of individual underwriters, it is clear that new business has developed in the international capital markets over the past five years. The vogue for privatisation which has swept the world has been part of a broader opening up of equity capital markets. Fund managers and financial analysts are no longer stock pickers within a single market, but have to get to grips with a wide span of companies and markets. That is illustrated by this week's European Federation of Financial Analysts' Societies congress in Edinburgh, where subjects range from China to South Africa. Companies in small or underdeveloped economies can now raise funds from a potentially vast base of investors. Even companies in developed economies find they have striking new opportunities: German companies, for example, are starting to access the international equities market, signalling a loosening of the ties with their bank shareholders.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the opening of the </F> German-Singapore Economic Forum in the Chancellor's Office in  Bonn on 13 April]    [Text] Esteemed Mr. Prime Minister, esteemed guests from  Singapore, ladies and gentlemen, Dear Mr. Von Pierer:    It is a great pleasure for me, Mr. Prime Minister, to  welcome  you here today. Since my visit to your country about a year  ago, we have been able to make good progress in fleshing out the  agreements we achieved at that time. Today, at the beginning of  our talks, we discussed further initiatives, which we want to  shape intensively over the next 12 months.    Over the past years Asia has increasingly developed to an  international economic and political focal area. As a turntable  in the Southeast Asian region, your country, Mr. Prime Minister,  is playing a special role in this respect.    Therefore I welcome the fact that today we are able to  continue our dialogue about the deepening of our relations in  the political, economic, technological, and cultural field.    During my visit to your country we discussed for the first  time the idea of even closer cooperation between German and  Singapore companies on the growing markets of the Asian region.  I cite the PRC in this connection. I could also cite India or,  for instance, aspiring Vietnam. There our companies can achieve  great advantages if they proceed together.    I would like to especially express my pleasure, Mr. Prime  Minister, that your predecessor, current Senior Minister Lee  Kuan Yew, will visit us in a few days and that this also shows  the strength of our relations.    In our talks we have always agreed on the particular  importance that we attribute to the relations of our two  countries in the economic and technological fields. The  economic associations of our two countries -- and I would like  to stress this gratefully here -- also decided in favor of this  involvement right from the start.    Therefore today we can sign the founding document of the  German-Singapore Economic Forum under the patronage of the  Asia-Pacific Committee of German Industry.    However, I also want to stress that relations with your  country and with Asia in general are of great importance not  only for economic reasons but also with a view to cultural and  political cooperation.    Germany must be and remain a country open to the world. This  also includes that we cultivate friendship with many countries  in the world. I am happy that the friendly cooperation with  your country, Mr. Prime Minister, has developed so well.    In particular, I am happy that with the establishment of the  German-Singapore Economic Forum we have managed to take another  concrete step toward implementing the Federal Government's Asia  concept. It is our response to the great and constantly  increasing importance of the Asian region in the international  economy. The task of the forum is to bring together companies  from Germany and Singapore with similar interests in a direct  and pragmatic way and to make good use of joint opportunities.    I note with pleasure that two projects have been signed  today. The German laender are also open toward our idea of  cooperation, in particular with regard to the PRC. Only  recently did a delegation of entrepreneurs, headed by the  Bavarian economics minister and accompanied by an official  representative of Singapore, visit a Chinese partner province.  A delegation from Baden-Wuerttemberg will soon visit two  industrial parks in China, which have been planned by Singapore.    In this connection I would also like to mention that we  expect Chinese Premier Li Peng to visit in a few weeks. It is  our intention to contribute to having the important role of this  important country in the Asian region meet with more attention  and understanding both in the fields of economy and trade and in  international politics in general.    Today I expect the visit of the mayor of Shanghai and in a  few days the mayor or the representative of Guangzhou. I  consider these intensive talks and contacts very important to  gradually deepen political cooperation.    Esteemed Mr. Prime Minister, your country is enjoying an  excellent reputation as a dynamic economic center in the Asian  region. German companies have long valued this fact. Nowhere  else in the aspiring markets in Southeast Asia are there more  subsidiaries and representations of German companies than in  Singapore. In many cases, they already fulfill supraregional  business tasks. This is also a good basis for success in the  work of the German-Singapore Economic Forum.    Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to express once again my  pleasure at your visit. From our friendly personal relationship  I derive the certainty that we will continue this good  cooperation in the future. If a problem were to arise at some  time, or some matter were not to proceed as intended, we have  agreed, Mr. Prime Minister, not to wait long but to contribute  toward a quick solution in a personal talk.</p>

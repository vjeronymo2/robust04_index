			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / City aims to recruit jobless 'locals' A NON-PROFIT company was launched yesterday calling for 'a sea-change in City recruitment culture' by hiring more people from neighbouring socially deprived and high unemployment areas. Local Recruitment Brokerage is a partnership between the Bank of England, City employers Kleinwort Benson and S. G. Warburg and public-sector bodies including Hackney and Islington councils, the Corporation of London, Jobcentres and the City and Inner London North Training and Enterprise Council. Ms Jackie Sadek, director of the brokerage, said it was keen to encourage companies to recruit among ethnic communities and women returners in Islington and Hackney. But she emphasised it would 'never compromise on quality'. As many as 37 per cent of the ethnic community living in Islington have an advanced educational qualification, but only 2 per cent of middle and higher managerial City jobs are held by people from ethnic minorities. The company, which will seek charitable status, will aim to link financial and City institutions in their recruitment activities with local voluntary and public-sector bodies which can find the appropriately qualified staff locally. Launching the brokerage, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, said the Bank was 'well aware of the high levels of unemployment, the poor living standards and immense hardship that exist within a mile of the City.' The inspiration for the new company was a South Bank Polytechnic report two years ago that pointed out that City employers did not look to the skills and potential of the workforce on their doorstep, preferring to see the whole of London and the south-east as their employment pool. It called for a strategic partnership to create equal opportunity, bringing together private City companies and the local authorities.</p>

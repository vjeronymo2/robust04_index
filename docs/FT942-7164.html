			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hydro and Amoco in Russian oil agreement Norway's Norsk Hydro Production and Amoco Eurasia Petroleum Company yesterday announced a co - operation agreement that could lead to joint rights for petroleum exploration and development in the southern part of the Russian sector of the Barents Sea and the Pechora Sea. The agreement covers joint evaluation of oil and gas production opportunities of the vast region and close co-operation with Russian companies and research institutes. The two companies have separately studied this part of the Arctic during the past five years but have joined forces to co-ordinate resources in an effort to enhance their evaluations and working knowledge of the area, for which the Russians have announced their intention to issue exploration rights. A Norsk Hydro executive said that the two companies would also be looking at sites to identify a potential location for an oil export terminal. Amoco and Hydro last month joined Texaco and Exxon in establishing the Timan Pechora Company, which is negotiating a production sharing contract with Russia for an area onshore in the Timan Pechora Basin. In the Barents and Pechora Seas Hydro and Amoco will be seeking to identify areas where exploration could be undertaken. Five years ago Hydro provided technical assistance to the Russians during production testing of the giant Shtokmanovskoye field, believed to be one of the world's biggest gas fields, in the northern part of the Barents Sea. Hydro had hoped to be awarded a production sharing agreement for the field, which went instead to the Russian company Rosshelf. Hydro withdrew from the project in 1992.</p>

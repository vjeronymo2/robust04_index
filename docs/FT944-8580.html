			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Electric utility deal extends trade in pollution credits Two US electric utilities yesterday signed an agreement to trade pollution credits, which for the first time places a market value on reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide. Arizona Public Service, the largest utility in Arizona, will exchange 25,000 tons of sulphur dioxide emissions allowances for 1.75m tons of carbon dioxide reductions from Niagara Mohawk Power, which supplies electricity and gas in northern New York state. Sulphur dioxide emission reductions are mandated by law, and a market system has been set up to allow utilities which exceed their reduction targets to trade the surplus. Emission allowances are currently trading between Dollars 143 (Pounds 87) and Dollars 160 per ton. Reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, however, is a voluntary commitment that only a handful of utilities have made to the department of energy as part of a programme to meet the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit agreement to reduce emissions to their 1990 level by 2000. Yesterday's deal, sponsored by the Department of Energy, sets a rough value of Dollars 2 a ton on reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. The deal provides for Arizona Public Service to transfer 25,000 tons of sulphur dioxide allowances, which it does not need because the installation of new scrubbers has cut its pollution well below target, to Niagara Mohawk. The New York utility will then donate the allowances to a non-profit organisation to be permanently retired, and claim a tax deduction of around Dollars 1m on the charitable gift. That money will be spent on further projects to cut carbon dioxide pollution in New York state and outside the US. A direct donation of Niagara Mohawk's carbon dioxide reductions would probably not have been allowed as a charitable deduction because there is no defined market value for greenhouse gas reduction. Arizona Public Service expects not to have to emit the extra 1.75m tons of carbon dioxide, but plans to keep the reductions as an insurance policy in case energy demand grows.</p>

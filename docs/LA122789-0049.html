			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOUGH THEIR PAST GAFFES HAVEN'T FADED AWAY, THOSE FEARLESS PRO FORECASTERS,  HEADING INTO A NEW DECADE, HAVE NO HESTITATION IN PUTTING A . . . ;  </P> <P> FINGER ON FATE;  </P> <P> PEACE AND PROFITS  </P> <P> Early in this decade, William Shireman, a Sacramento environmental and  recycling consultant, says he looked into the future and saw relative peace and  harmony where there was only faction and discord.  </P> <P> Specifically, Shireman recalls that he predicted that "more and more legitimate  common ground" would be found between those traditional foes, environmentalists  and the business establishment.  </P> <P> To Shireman, the conclusion was quite logical. To achieve its goals in energy  efficiency, recycling and other areas, environmentalists -- largely unschooled  in the ways of the free market -- would have to seek common cause with business  people who saw a profit in a cleaner environment.  </P> <P> Now, Shireman contends that he was right, at least to a degree. While business  and environmentalists still are often at loggerheads, there are areas of peace.  Recycling has become a growth industry, he says, pointing to widespread  adoption of state recycling laws that have spawned new, profitable businesses  in metals and glass.  </P> <P> The discovery of common ground took a little learning on both sides, he says.  </P> <P> For example, in 1974 corporations generally scoffed at the environmentalist  contention that the U.S. living standard could be maintained with one-third  less energy use, Shireman said. A couple of oil crises later, the U.S. economy  is now one-third more energy efficient than it was 15 years ago, he said.  </P> <P> In this instance, business learned that environmental ideas could be one way of  cutting costs -- as well as making profitable energy-efficient products,  Shireman said.  </P> <P> He thinks that this trend will continue into the 1990s, partly because of a  move toward the "true costing" of natural resources such as forest products and  water.

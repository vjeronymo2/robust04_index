			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Trading of emissions. Although EPA's thinking on how to incorporate trading into a facility-wide emissions cap program has advanced in the last several months, EPA believes that the trading of emissions in the three FIP areas to meet facility emissions caps requires further study prior to implementation. To this end, EPA will be examining many of the issues that arise as a result of the use of emissions trading to meet emissions cap requirements. Some of the issues that will be examined are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The impacts of emissions trading on the FIP areas' ability to meet ozone attainment requirements; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;How enforcement of applicable requirements will be carried out with a trading system; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether VOC trading would pose an increased exposure to toxic emissions (or hazardous air pollutants, many of which are also VOCs) and whether toxics trading would be allowed given EPA's work on Title III regulations and EPA's commitment to environmental justice; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether differences in accuracy of emissions quantification methods would necessarily limit trading to source emissions that could be quantified within some minimum level of accuracy, or to limit trading to sources which are in the same source category; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether there would be an economic impact on the three FIP areas because of emissions trading; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The interface between trading and new source review requirements in the FIP areas; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Market structure issues, such as the length of the compliance period, the type of market established, market administration, implementation of trades, and general data tracking involved with trading; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Resource issues involved with the implementation of a trading system (i.e., can EPA provide the additional resources needed to administer a trading program?). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Manufacturers Bubble for Industrial and Commercial Solvents and Coatings. (a) Introduction. All of the California FIP areas suffer from emission reduction shortfalls after application of the proposed conventional FIP stationary, area, and mobile source controls. These shortfalls must be accounted for in order to bring the FIP areas into attainment. In this NPRM, EPA is discussing and taking comment on the use of a statewide manufacturers ``bubble'' rule as an alternative to the cap program to obtain required reductions in the FIP areas. Given that manufacturers sell products throughout California, EPA believes, based on its experience with other designs, <FOOTCITE>69</FOOTCITE>  that statewide regulation is the only effective means of controlling these emissions at the manufacturer level. The intent of EPA's extensive discussion is to provide sufficient detailed discussion of the manufacturers bubble concept so that between the proposal of the FIP and its final promulgation, EPA can develop and include in the final FIP promulgation a measure in final regulatory form that will incorporate the concepts discussed (EPA will avoid the task of a supplemental proposal by discussing the manufacturers bubble in detailed form). The purpose of this rule would be to reduce VOC emissions from industrial and commercial solvents and coatings. This reduction would be realized by limiting the VOC content of these products at the point of manufacture. This type of regulation is consistent with EPA's new commitment to preventing pollution at the source, rather than at the end of a process or processes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 69 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In particular, EPA is aware of CARB's efforts to design a similar program for consumer products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This manufacturers bubble rule would serve as a method to regulate the emissions of VOCs from industrial and commercial solvents and coatings. This proposed regulatory program would establish a VOC content limit that companies who manufacture solvents and coatings would have to meet, on average, for all of their products sold in the State of California. EPA is proposing this alternative in preliminary form only at this time and solicits the public's comments on the concept and technical merit of this program. If this approach is ultimately selected, actual rule language will follow, and will incorporate the concepts proposed in this NPRM, as well as ideas and concerns expressed in comments received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA realizes that the most straightforward means of regulation would be to put a firm limit on the maximum allowable VOC content on every coating and solvent, EPA has determined that this regulatory strategy may become, at some point, excessively onerous on the manufacturers and users of industrial and commercial solvents and coatings, and would limit the availability of commercially useful solvents. Imposing content limits stringent enough to obtain the necessary reductions in VOC emissions needed to bring the FIP areas into attainment may be technology forcing. In addition, EPA does not have the resources to effectively research the solvent and coating industries to determine feasible content limits for every coating and solvent, especially considering the court-ordered deadline for promulgation of this FIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends that the manufacturers bubble rule discussed here would achieve the VOC reductions necessary to bring the FIP areas, along with other control measures discussed elsewhere in this action, into attainment while minimizing any technology-forcing aspects of the rule. EPA believes that, within the FIP context, promulgating a rule that allows manufacturers to comply by averaging VOC content may provide necessary emission reductions with a minimum of adverse regulatory impact. Such a rule would allow manufacturers the flexibility necessary to comply at minimum cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Withdrawal of rules based on SIP progress. As noted elsewhere in this NPRM, the manufacturers bubble program rule may be affected (i.e., rescinded or modified) by State or local measures which are adopted and implemented prior to implementation of the manufacturers bubble program and which represent the necessary emission reductions from industrial and commercial solvents and coatings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Relationship with other FIP provisions. EPA intends that the manufacturers bubble rule discussed in this subsection will work simultaneously with the FIP cap program proposed elsewhere in this NPRM to obtain a significant portion of the reductions needed to reach attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the FIP areas. However, EPA is considering additional options for the interaction of these two programs (the FIP cap program for these emission sources and the manufacturers bubble for these same sources) and requests public comment on the merit of these options. EPA is considering using the manufacturers bubble program to preempt portions of the cap program (particularly the FIP cap program covering industrial and commercial coatings and solvents). The manufacturers bubble program may be used to relieve portions of the cap program requirements either for a particular source category (such as industrial and commercial solvents and coatings), or to reduce the total VOC emission reductions expected from the cap program. The following sections provide a detailed discussion of the proposed manufacturers bubble program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Implementation date. EPA is proposing that the manufacturers bubble rule would be implemented January 1, 2001 to be consistent with the implementation date of the FIP cap program discussed earlier while achieving the necessary reductions for attainment, unless it is withdrawn prior to that date on the basis of State or federal progress in reducing emissions of VOCs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

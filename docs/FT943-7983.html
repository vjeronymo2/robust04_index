			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Moody's lifts Westpac debt rating to A-1 Moody's has raised the long-term senior debt rating of Westpac, one the 'big four' Australian banks, to A-1 from A-2, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The subordinated debt rating was also improved from to A-2 from A-3. About ADollars 3.2bn of securities are affected. Moody's said the upgrade reflected Westpac's improving asset quality, earnings and capital levels. It said these positive trends should continue in the medium term, reinforced by Australia's favourable economic conditions. Although the banking sector generally suffered badly during the recent recession, Westpac - with heavy exposures to the property market - was among the worst affected.</p>

Ambassador Richard Kauzlarich said that while he was in the  United States he held important meetings with a number of  officials, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher,  Strobe Talbott, and various congressmen. Richard Kauzlarich  stressed particularly that the Secretary of State was pleased  with his meeting with the Azerbaijani president. He noted that  positive changes in relations with Azerbaijan is palpable in the  United States and the Western countries. The Ambassador also  noted that the United States is exerting serious efforts to  increase the CSCE role in the solution of the Karabakh problem,  and that his country is becoming more active in this direction.    The Azerbaijani president said that he was pleased with his  Istanbul trip, particularly with his meeting with U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher. He said he was certain that the  meeting would play an important role in the further development  of Azerbaijan-U.S. relations. He also said they had an  extensive discussion on Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan.    President Geydar Aliyev noted that we have not relinquished  our previous approach, and that we demand the withdrawal of the  aggressive forces from the occupied lands, the guaranteeing of  Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, and the inviolability of its  borders. We assess highly the role international organizations  play in such important issues, and stressed that the CSCE Minsk  Group's efforts on the matter will be very important. President  Geydar Aliyev also touched upon the agreements reached during  the meetings with the chairman of the [CSCE Minsk] Group Jan  Eliasson and Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. He  reiterated Azerbaijan's positions on this issue.    [Begin Aliyev recording] During the talks we declared that  we  are in favor of settling these issues peacefully and asked him  [not further identified] to ensure the continuation of the  cease-fire. We reached certain agreements. Therefore, I want to  state that our principal stance on these issues remains the same.    Your information that there is a positive turn in relations  between the Azerbaijani Republic and the United States, and  generally with the West, pleases me. I believe that our loyalty  to the democratic principles in our republic, the launching of  democratic and economic reforms, the measures to take our  country along the democratic path, and our desire and efforts to  resolve this grave problem -- the ongoing war between Armenia  and Azerbaijan -- by peaceful means and through international  organizations, all testify that the Azerbaijani Republic is  walking, and will continue to walk, on the path of democracy.

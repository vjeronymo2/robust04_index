			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 21 June (EFE) -- Peruvian Foreign Minister  Efrain Goldenberg reported today that, at the request of ousted  Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide, Peru has withdrawn its  recognition of Haitian Ambassador to Lima Roland Agustin.    The Peruvian foreign minister stated that Claudett Werleigh,  Aristide's minister of foreign affairs and culture, while  speaking on Aristide's behalf on 14 June in Washington, asked  Peru to withdraw Agustin's recognition.    Goldenberg said: "Out of respect for a democratically  elected  government, which is the only government we recognize in Haiti,  we have decided not to recognize Mr. Roland Agustin's  ambassadorial status."    This decision averted criticism by the opposition against  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori who rejected the idea of  military intervention in Haiti or Cuba during the recent  Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. The  opposition accused Fujimori of defending the Haitian military  regime headed by General Raoul Cedras "in view of his  authoritarian convictions."    Goldenberg added that Fujimori's position, and that of his  administration, is based "on the principle of self-determination  of countries." Goldenberg said Peru supports a political and  peaceful solution to the Haitian issue and supports the measures  approved by the OAS and the United Nations.    Regarding the criticism surrounding Fujimori's recent trip  to  Beijing, Goldenberg said Peru believes China has great potential  for Peruvian economic and commercial interests. He added that  "China is not a political model for Peru." Goldenberg stated:  "With all due respect, the Chinese political model is not an  example for us because we are in a different situation."</p>

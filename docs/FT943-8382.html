			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Warehouse side curbs Wal-Mart Continued weakness in Wal-Mart Stores' warehouse club operations checked the US discount store group's rate of profits growth at 14 per cent in the second quarter to July, the company reported yesterday. The figures, however, were in sharp contrast with the worsening losses reported by Kmart, Wal-Mart's biggest rival, the day before. They were also at the upper end of the market's expectations, and the shares rose Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 24 1/4 yesterday. Net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 564.8m from Dollars 495.9m on record sales of Dollars 19.9bn, up 23 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 25 cents from 22 cents. For the six months to July, sales rose 25 per cent to Dollars 37.6bn, net income advanced 12 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn and earnings per share increased 12 per cent to 46 cents. Until recently Wal-Mart had rewarded shareholders with compound earnings growth averaging 25 per cent a year, but that pace began to flag last year because of the poor performance of the warehouse club operations. In the latest quarter, sales of the Sam's Clubs rose by 32 per cent to Dollars 4.8bn, but that was because Wal-Mart added the Pace Membership Warehouse division bought from Kmart last year. On a store-for-store basis, sales were 3.6 per cent lower. In contrast, sales in the core Wal-Mart discount store division were 9.7 per cent ahead on a store-for-store basis. The division's total sales rose by 22 per cent to Dollars 14.2bn, boosted by new store openings and the acquisition and conversion of Woolworth's Woolco stores in Canada. Mr David Glass, chief executive, said the company's performance in a very competitive quarter, together with the planned conversion of the remaining Woolco stores in Canada, made him 'optimistic' about the remainder of the year. J. C. Penney and Dayton Hudson, two of the biggest US department store groups, both reported continued profits growth in the second quarter yesterday. J. C. Penney increased net income by 17 per cent to Dollars 132m and Dayton Hudson more than doubled net income from Dollars 24m to Dollars 49m.</p>

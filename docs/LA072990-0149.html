			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMING CLEAN;  </P> <P> THE RECOVERING ADDICTS IN THIS STORY INITIALLY AGREED TO SHARE THEIR  EXPERIENCES FULLY AND OPENLY, HOPING IT MIGHT HELP OTHER ADDICTS. DURING THEIR  MONTHS-LONG TREATMENT, HOWEVER, THREE CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND REQUESTED  ANONYMITY. LYNN WILLIMAS, KAREN ALLEN AND FRANK CASTILLO ARE PSEUDONYMS.;  </P> <P> AT THE IMPACT RECOVERY CENTER, EUPHORIA AND DESPAIR ARE DAILY VISITORS, AND THE  ODDS OF SUCCESS ARE SADLY SLIM  </P> <P> LYNN WILLIAMS, her thin, young body racked with pain, was still in the throes  of heroin withdrawal when she stumbled through the doorway of the Pasadena drug  recovery house last fall. The bizarre scene that confronted her might have been  another one of her drug-induced hallucinations: In the shady courtyard of the  sprawling stucco complex, a work crew raked leaves where there were none. A man  walked by wearing a muzzle. A woman carried a Narcotics Anonymous book in  handcuffed hands.  </P> <P> Those extraordinary disciplinary measures are everyday occurrences at the  residential drug recovery program, where addicts are asked to abandon not only  drugs but also their will. Let me out of here, Williams thought, panicking. But  she had nowhere to go.  </P> <P> At 23, Williams had reached the end of the road. What had started out as a  pleasant escape from the pain of a troubled childhood in the San Fernando  Valley had turned into a nightmare from which she could not awaken. She hated  living in abandoned buildings, stealing and breaking into people's homes,  sleeping with men she didn't know. All for a fix. She wanted to die.  </P> <P> Once settled in her new environment, Williams knew she had to stop running,  acknowledging that this time she would "have to change completely." Despite her  heavy eye makeup and her chain-smoking, she looked as vulnerable as a small  child, with long, silky blond hair. "I don't know how to live," she said, her  voice cracking.  </P> <P> Williams wanted to learn, but she knew it wouldn't be easy. Every day, she saw  addicts drop out of the recovery program only to return to the streets. She  knew what awaited her there, and it terrified her. Nearly every week brought  word of dropouts who had landed in jail, died of an overdose or been shot in  drug deals.  </P> <P> She had used drugs since she was 11, starting with alcohol and marijuana -- her  parents' drugs of choice. "I grew up thinking it was OK," she recalled. When  her parents divorced, her mother gave up her career as a professional jazz  dancer to raise her three children. And she never let them forget it.  </P> <P> The counselors assured Williams there was another way. It would entail hard  work and require discipline, honesty and self-esteem, qualities she didn't know  she had. It would take months of self-analysis and the courage to examine  emotions buried long ago. Yes, they could help her change her life. There was  only one condition: Williams would have to turn herself over to them. It would  require a leap of faith in a "higher power" -- be it God, a higher  consciousness or whatever name she chose to give it.  </P> <P> She wasn't sure she could meet this challenge. Without drugs' anesthesia, the  pain and remorse were overwhelming. "When emotions sneak up on you," Williams  said, shaking her head, "you feel like you're going to die."  </P> <P> THE IMPACT ALCOHOL and Drug Recovery Program operates out of a motel-like  building, one of several unassuming structures that house drug programs and  convalescent hospitals at the northern end of Fair Oaks Avenue. On clear days,  the San Gabriel Mountains seem deceptively close enough to touch. Just a few  blocks south, drug dealers beckon on the streets that surround the King's  Village public housing project.  </P> <P> Impact is one of about two dozen private, nonprofit drug recovery houses in Los  Angeles County. Established in 1971, it is among the oldest of these long-term  residential programs and is funded largely through government grants. Nearly  25% of the facility's 130 slots are set aside for state and federal parolees  referred to the program through the courts. The county pays for another third  of the slots to accommodate indigent addicts. A quarter of the slots are paid  for by private health insurance or by residents' families. The average four- to  six-month stay, including a few months of outpatient care, runs about $15,000  per resident. The program's clinical staff of about 60 includes administrators,  medical personnel and 15 caseworkers -- the vast majority of whom have all  kicked drug habits of their own.  </P> <P> Battle-scarred addicts arrive by the thousands every day at facilities like  Impact across the country. Most don't last past the first few weeks of these  intensive, months-long treatment programs, thought by experts to offer the best  chance at recovery. Some drop out; others are expelled, usually because they  are deemed not serious enough about getting better. An encouraging note,  counselors say, is that more than a third of those who leave prematurely return  months, sometimes years, later to give recovery another try.  </P> <P> "Once you get into the mainstream of the drug recovery subculture, you cannot  deny -- ever again -- that there isn't another way to go. That seed gets  planted," said James Stillwell, Impact's director. Silver-haired,  smooth-talking and energetic, the administrator has been clean for 17 years and  still attends meetings of Narcotics Anonymous.  </P> <P> The odds that Williams would stay and ultimately quit drugs were overwhelmingly  against her. Only about one out of five of those who land at Impact makes it  through the program, one of the toughest and most respected in Southern  California. Even for those who complete the grueling residential program, there  are no guarantees. Most addicts have long histories of failed attempts at  getting -- and staying -- clean.  </P> <P> Once at Impact, addicts who have spent most of their lives trying to forget  must delve into the darkest corners of their souls and expose their secrets --  incest, betrayal, prostitution, even murder -- to the world. Ultimately, they  must strip away the self-loathing and guilt and learn to embrace themselves, to  find the courage to change. They must give up the lying, cheating, manipulation  and self-deception that typically ensnare addicts' lives. They must trust drug  counselors to show them the way. Based on the "12 Step" philosophy of  Alcoholics Anonymous and its offshoot, Narcotics Anonymous, the program aims to  instill addicts with a new purpose and provide them a new foundation for  rebuilding their lives.  </P> <P> When Williams showed up, there was already a broad spectrum of addicts at the  recovery house: a Beverly Hills "little rich girl" who ended up turning $50  tricks in Hollywood for her pimp; a middle-aged $75,000-a-year mechanic who,  after losing it all -- his family, his job, his yacht and his dreams -- climbed  atop the Gerald Desmond Bridge in Long Beach and stared at the churning ocean  water below; a mild-mannered Mexican-American house painter who, having  betrayed family and friends, hid behind the inviolable mask of a street-wise  Chicano.  </P> <P> There was also a Korean immigrant who had convinced himself that he didn't have  a drug problem, just a run of bad luck -- even after he was arrested for  selling crack cocaine to an undercover agent at the post office where he  worked. Soon after arriving, Williams befriended a striking brunette whose life  read like something out of a bad B movie: witchcraft practitioner, teen-age  runaway, topless dancer, biker moll and cat burglar with a 20-year prison  sentence hanging over her head.  </P> <P> Newcomers were expected to start by focusing on their reasons for being there.  For the first 45 days, they were cut off from most contact with the outside  world and kept busy with menial chores. At this stage, some were still dealing  with denial about the severity of their drug problem. As they peeled away  layers of self-deceit, they were allowed to visit home and go out on weekends.  Dramatic turnarounds were common at this stage, as residents embraced the  program's philosophy and glimpsed a life without drugs. Some, however,  continued to stumble, unable to surrender their will.  </P> <P> During the second half of their stay, residents began working at outside jobs.  The real tests began as they continued outpatient treatment at the conclusion  of the live-in portion of the program: Some folded under the emotional  pressures of disintegrating marriages or the day-to-day grind of rebuilding  their lives.  </P> <P> Through all this, the members of Williams' group would experience miraculous  turnarounds -- only to be sidetracked at the next turn by old character flaws.  Inevitably, some would fall back on drugs. But even then, most would continue  the ever-tenuous struggle to liberate themselves. This is a chronicle of their  six months at Impact.  </P> <P> THE FIRST WEEKS at Impact can be the toughest. Everything -- from the strict  discipline to the endless rounds of therapy sessions -- is geared to helping  addicts recognize that they have a problem not only with drugs but also, more  fundamentally, with living. The transition from the streets to such a narrowly  focused world can be especially jarring.  </P> <P> Even after the violent spasms of withdrawal that tormented Williams' body began  to subside, the craziness of Impact did not. Williams saw other residents  forced to wear wool mittens as punishment for stealing even a comb or a vial of  lipstick. Those who "held their mud" -- refused to snitch on a fellow addict  who had broken a house rule -- had to carry large jars of mud for the day.  Anyone balking at the regimen had to wear a sign around the neck; "Am I being  held hostage?" one read.  </P> <P> "Some of our tactics may seem pretty harsh," Stillwell said. "But when you're  up against a life-and-death struggle, you don't play games. We call a spade a  spade from day one. We dump reality on them. We don't allow them to wriggle out  with a bunch of talk. We know all about that. We've been there ourselves."  </P> <P> For weeks, Williams battled the urge to flee. She longed for drugs' oblivion.  Maybe this time heroin would be a kinder master. But slowly the program began  making sense. "All your old rules, right or wrong, go out the window," she  said. The counselors "really break down your ego, your addict values, your  false pride."  </P> <P> Obediently, Williams got up and went to bed when she was told to. She scrubbed  toilets, dusted where there was no dust, washed spotless windows and swept  imaginary leaves in the courtyard just as she had seen others do. Discipline  had always been missing in her life. Now, she learned to appreciate it.  </P> <P> She also attended daily counseling sessions and group meetings during which  addicts told life stories not unlike her own. It demanded brutal honesty. Would  she, cold sober, have the courage to withstand the pain of her past?  </P> <P> Standing before a women's counseling group, Williams swept her long, straight  hair aside and, in her small voice, talked about the large drawing she held up  for them. The assignment, like many at Impact, was aimed at helping the women  dredge up suppressed -- and often painful -- bits of their past.  </P> <P> Williams' drawing depicted two small children cowering from a masked intruder  and their mother's angry face and accusing finger. Williams explained that when  she was 9 years old, a family friend had sneaked into her bedroom almost every  night for a year and raped her in front of her younger brother. "My parents  didn't believe me," she said, tears welling up in her eyes. As she spoke, she  unconsciously folded her drawing over and over until it was a tiny square of  paper. At the group therapist's prompting, Williams lit it with a match.  Transfixed by the small flame, she smiled for the first time. It was as if the  terrible memory itself had gone up in smoke, freeing her from its grip.  </P> <P> Counselors say that the recovery process is especially difficult for women.  Perhaps, they say, it is because women have a harder time coming to terms with  histories that often include sexual abuse as well as with the greater stigma  society attaches to drug abuse among women. And women tend to be more dependent  than men and to place others' welfare above their own. Those who are mothers  also often carry the guilt of neglecting or abusing their children. Many harbor  an unwavering desire -- no matter how unrealistic -- to be with their families.  </P> <P> Twenty-six-year-old Suzan Kidd, another member of the group, thought longingly  and often about her three young children. Kidd had borne children because she  wanted someone to love her unconditionally, but the terrible anger she carried  inside spoiled that dream, too. When she was younger, she erupted in fits of  violence against her family, once breaking her mother's ribs. Later, she turned  her rage on her own children.  </P> <P> As a child, Kidd was sexually abused by her stepfather and later rescued by her  grandparents, who brought her back to Southern California to live with them.  Her grandmother's wish, Kidd said, "was that I grow up to be an independent  lady, get a good education, get married and have children -- the same things I  want for my children."  </P> <P> But at 13, Kidd began running away from her grandparents' home and  experimenting with drugs. Alcohol and pot gave way to cocaine, speed, PCP and  heroin. Drugs helped her forget the sexual abuse. But they also led her into a  seedy world of crime and violence, cheap bars and biker gangs, where excitement  became as addictive as drugs. Kidd, a tall, natural beauty with thick brown  hair that cascades past her shoulders, radiates a certain innocence. But her  self-image couldn't have been more different. When she walked on the street,  she said, she saw a different reflection in other people's eyes: prostitute,  junkie, ex-con. Kidd, who specialized in breaking into post offices to steal  checks and credit cards, served 10 months of a 16-month prison term for forgery  related to the burglaries and still faces a 20-year term that was knocked down  to probation when she signed up for Impact.  </P> <P> More than anything else, Kidd told everyone, she wanted to be a good mother.  Under the program rules, she visited her children at her grandmother's home  only occasionally.  </P> <P> Kidd's desire to be with them would be a stumbling block in her treatment.  Outside issues, such as children and relationships, are a common distraction  that counselors advise recovering addicts to lay aside. First they must put  their own lives in order.  </P> <P> LIKE KIDD, Karen Allen of Beverly Hills arrived on Impact's doorstep via the  courts. The judge had reduced her four-year prison term for drug violations to  probation. Most of Impact's residents arrive the same way: pressured by the  judicial system, relatives or a spouse. What is crucial to their success,  however, is that they make recovery a personal commitment -- that they do it  for themselves and no one else.  </P> <P> For Allen, a 27-year-old veteran of many drug treatment programs, this was a  particularly difficult thing to do. She had always lived for the approval of  others, particularly that of men. At Impact, she and other residents were  frequently asked to write essays about forgiveness and independence, topics  that would help them recognize and conquer their low self-esteem.  </P> <P> One of Allen's assignments was to write a letter to her former pimp -- the man  she had once thought she was in love with. Whether she ever mailed the letter  did not matter.  </P> <P> "Dear Tony," it began. "What we had was real sick. . . ." The letter, written  in large, childlike block letters, recalled that Allen had wanted to bear this  man's child. It also recalled how he beat her when she returned home  empty-handed after working the streets and how his infidelity drove her into a  suicidal depression.  </P> <P> Carefully folding the piece of paper, Allen said that despite the searing anger  she had begun to feel toward him, she still prayed that "he's not dead  somewhere" and that he finds help with his addiction. "Deep down, he was a good  person," she said. "He was just screwed up because of his (drug) disease, like  me."  </P> <P> Allen began learning to like herself. It happened only after many failed  attempts at coming clean. Instead of heading for college, as her parents had  planned, the Beverly Hills High School graduate floated in and out of some of  the country's more exclusive drug recovery centers, where she hobnobbed with  rock stars and professional football players. She was tossed out of one program  for fraternizing with the men, which is strictly forbidden at most facilities.  In addition, Allen went through four methadone maintenance centers and several  detoxification treatments at hospitals.  </P> <P> Before Impact, Allen saw no real reason to quit. "I went to get my parents off  my back," she said. "It was like a big joke to me." She'd been drinking and  using pot since she was 12. By 15, she was snorting cocaine. A few years later,  she shot up heroin for the first time with her older brother, who ended up in a  drug recovery program as well but eventually managed to follow in their  physician father's footsteps.  </P> <P> Drugs distanced Allen from the unhappy, overweight child she had been while  growing up amid the "beautiful people." Then the bouts of bulimia and the car  accidents linked to her drug abuse began. And, to satisfy her habit, Allen  started stealing from her parents and their friends.  </P> <P> Once, for about a year and a half, she stayed clean in Minnesota. Fooling  herself that this time she would be able to control drugs, she returned to Los  Angeles two years ago and fell off the wagon. Before long, the child born to  privilege was out working the streets for her pimp.  </P> <P> Six months later, Allen finally called home for help. When her mother came to  pick her up, she didn't recognize her daughter, a gaunt, ashen woman with a  bruised body, chipped teeth and black eyes. Doctors said Allen had so neglected  her health and abused drugs that she might not live.  </P> <P> Once she settled in at Impact, it didn't take Allen long to shed her rich-girl  front -- designer clothes, expensive shampoos, snobbish airs -- and begin  opening up. The difference between this time and all her previous attempts was  that Allen had just fallen harder and lower than ever before. And, she figured,  this really might be her last chance.  </P> <P> JOHN MITCHELL can still picture the murky water as it looked from his perch on  the Gerald Desmond Bridge in Long Beach. At the tail end of his last four-day  run with crack, the master mechanic had nothing left but the 20 cents in his  pocket. Suicide seemed the best way out. As his trembling hands locked onto a  chain-link fence, the painful memories of his failed marriages and broken  dreams came rushing back. But he could not jump.  </P> <P> Shortly thereafter, he sought help at Impact. There, the self-reliant  48-year-old cried openly for the first time as he faced his guilt, especially  over the slaying of one of his daughters in a bad drug deal a year and a half  earlier. Though he was not directly involved, he couldn't forget that she had  come to him for help after several years on the street. He shared his drugs  with her instead. Besides the guilt, he acknowledged the feelings of sexual  inadequacy that led to an unending cycle of drug use with prostitutes and the  breakup of his three marriages.  </P> <P> But more than midway through the program, Mitchell hit a wall. It happens all  the time. Addicts arrive eager to learn. They do all that is asked of them,  then suddenly plateau, afraid to take the next step. For many, the most  frightening step of all is abandoning the addict's self-destructive tendencies,  the only way of life they've known. But counselors insist that it is essential  that they start anew. To accomplish it, the program often resorts to a "super  session" -- an ambush by counselors who confront recalcitrant residents.  </P> <P> Mitchell had withdrawn from group sessions and resisted advice from his  counselors. He also began making veiled threats about leaving the program. But  his heart sank when he walked into the counseling office. There were half a  dozen counselors and administrators, including Stillwell. Mitchell was sure he  was about to be expelled.  </P> <P> The counselors played good-cop-bad-cop, cajoling, accusing, pressing Mitchell's  back to the wall. They said he wasn't cooperating with the program. "You've got  to trust us; you've got to let us get close," one counselor said. Another told  Mitchell that he couldn't pick and choose the parts of the program he wanted to  follow. His commitment had to be unconditional.  </P> <P> Mitchell may have been an eager student of the Narcotics Anonymous principles,  the counselors said, but he had failed to start living them. He hadn't  abandoned his addict ways or placed his faith in a higher power. "Your  resistance is why you're an addict," they said. "Your lack of surrender puts  you in jeopardy."  </P> <P> Confused and defensive, Mitchell claimed ignorance: "You're probably right, but  I don't understand it. I feel I haven't tried to resist in any way." If he had  decided to leave the program, as they accused him of threatening to do, he  would be gone, he said, knowing they could see through his lies. "I'm being as  cooperative as I can."  </P> <P> It wasn't good enough, they shot back. "You're using what you've used all your  life -- your head and your mouth. Your brain doesn't recover you; your heart  does!" Stillwell then posed a challenge: "Right now is the moment you're going  to turn your will and life over to us, even if you don't understand what we are  doing."  </P> <P> Mitchell didn't hesitate. "I'll do it," he said. But, inside, he was scared. He  had never trusted anyone in his whole life. He was a master at manipulating  others and was used to getting his own way. Yes, he wanted to learn a different  way of living, but if he left things up to a higher power, things might not  turn out the way he wanted.  </P> <P> Not that he had done such a great job on his own. While he distinguished  himself as a high school swimmer, making the U.S. water polo team and competing  in the 1960 Olympics in Rome, he had to turn down college scholarships when his  girlfriend became pregnant. Mitchell, who had already begun drinking heavily,  apprenticed as a diesel-truck mechanic and began raising a family.  </P> <P> Though his weekend binges came to include drugs as well, he held good jobs and  took pride in being a good provider. While his work allowed him the luxury of  buying drugs with his earnings without resorting to crime, Mitchell said, he  wasn't above stealing from co-workers and employers. Along the way, his first  two marriages soured.  </P> <P> In recent years, as his abuse of rock cocaine and heroin made it progressively  harder for him to keep a job, his life unraveled before him. His third marriage  disintegrated, and then there was his daughter's death. Mitchell also lost the  36-foot yacht moored at Huntington Harbor that had been his home and the  embodiment of a dream to one day sail around the world. To pay for his last  binge before arriving at Impact, he sold his truck and his work tools.  </P> <P> "Drugs kicked my ass," said a beaten-down Mitchell. "They won hands down."  Impact, Mitchell believed, was his last hope. And he wasn't going to let his  habitual self-deception and stubborn self-reliance stand in the way.  </P> <P> The day after the super session, Mitchell began to express his new resolve in  an essay about "How John controls his life and why."  </P> <P> "I'm too much of a coward to let go," he admitted. "Just because I've lost  everything doesn't mean I'm willing to turn loose of the control. It's real,  real hard for me. I don't know how I will do it. I just will."  </P> <P> THE PRESSURE from counselors at Impact never lets up. Residents find that every  move is watched, every transgression is noted, any sign of backsliding is  checked. They have nowhere to hide.  </P> <P> It was under such scrutiny that Frank Castillo found himself making the  all-important leap of faith. His surrender came like a sudden downpour in the  middle of a drought. It was the kind of miracle that drug counselors say makes  their job worthwhile.  </P> <P> At first, Castillo dallied. Since this was his third go-around at Impact,  counselors had expected faster results. After all, the 32-year-old house  painter was telling everybody that he wanted desperately to stay clean. But he  did little more than parrot the "living-life-on-life's-terms" dogma the program  preaches.  </P> <P> Though Castillo believed he was satisfying the program's basic requirements, he  was missing the point. His case was discussed at the weekly daylong staff  meeting during which counselors assess each resident's performance. (Residents  refer to the meetings as "Black Tuesdays.") The consensus on Castillo was that  he was not delivering.  </P> <P> So Castillo's counselor issued the ultimatum: He either straightened up his  act, or he shipped out. Impact had a three-month waiting list and no time to  waste on someone unwilling to give 100%.  </P> <P> "What the hell do these people want!" an angry Castillo wanted to know after  being confronted. He was doing his best. Did they really expect him to stand  before a roomful of near strangers and share his innermost feelings? I've never  done that in my life, not even with my own family! Castillo thought. It was too  much to ask of a man, especially one who had spent much of his life hiding  behind a veneer of machismo.  </P> <P> He exploded again the next morning at a house meeting. "Give me one lion to  tame at a time, not 10!" he shouted. Before he knew it, Castillo was not only  venting his frustration but also spilling his guts. Something -- maybe the  anger -- clicked, and the controlled, you-can't-get-to-me attitude melted away.  Castillo realized his counselors were right. He had been hiding, even from  himself. Castillo knew then that he would go to any length to stay clean, even  if it meant baring his soul in front of 80 people. "I'll do it," Castillo said  firmly.  </P> <P> When he was a young boy, Castillo's parents moved to the predominantly Anglo  middle-class community of Sierra Madre to get away from East Los Angeles'  poverty and gangs. But Castillo felt he didn't belong there -- nor among the  cholo gang-bangers at the predominantly Latino high school in Pasadena to which  he was bussed. Still, to Castillo, the gangbangers were role models of "the  Mexican I thought I should be." His identity problems seemed to ease in the  drug haze that enveloped him at 15. He spent weekends partying and honed the  tough-guy exterior he used against a world full of rejection.  </P> <P> Though an early marriage ended in divorce, and he hardly knew his children,  Castillo was convinced that he did not have a drug problem. PCP, pot, acid and  speed were mild seducers compared with crack, which Castillo encountered about  four years ago. The coke that he injected showered him with ecstasy beyond  sexual orgasm.  </P> <P> To pay for his $500-a-day habit, Castillo, who by then had lost his  house-painting business, began stealing from employers, then neighbors and  finally his own brothers, whose professional success he greatly admired. His  second wife, who had resorted to welfare to feed their two small children, had  had enough. Finally, when she threatened to leave him, Castillo sought help one  more time.  </P> <P> Now Castillo could admit to himself that he had been devastated by his first  divorce; that his arrogance stemmed from claiming his brothers' accomplishments  as his own; that his disciplinarian father cared for him after all. The relief  accompanying these and so many other released emotions was amazing. He seemed  suddenly exuberant, self-confident, at peace with himself. And now he willingly  shared his experience with newer residents.  </P> <P> "I feel great about myself. Anything is possible," Castillo said. "It's a  feeling I want to hang on to."  </P> <P> MOVING DAY for Suzan Kidd arrived full of expectation on a clear January  morning. It seemed light-years away from those mornings when she awakened  dreading the new day, when her daylong mission would be finding drugs. Over the  previous six months, she had rewritten her life's script. Sobriety seemed an  exciting, if frightening, challenge.  </P> <P> Having completed the most rigorous part of the program, she and some of the  others began leaving Impact to start the slow process of rebuilding their lives  on the outside. Most rented homes nearby while they continued outpatient  treatment. By now, their odds for recovery had improved considerably. About  two-thirds of those who make it past the first three months of the program  survive to the end.  </P> <P> Kidd had recently gone for a job interview at a religious bookstore. When the  store manager asked about her previous experience, she burst into tears. She  had no high school diploma, no work experience, no references. When he asked  why, she told him the truth. Still, she got the job.  </P> <P> On that January day, Kidd opened her first checking account with savings from  the new job. She spent a few hours window-shopping at a nearby mall, feeling  like an "upstanding person." When Karen Allen drove her to do some last-minute  errands, they passed a police car and instinctively felt a twinge in their  stomachs. Then, realizing they no longer had anything to fear, they laughed.  </P> <P> Kidd was a whirl of activity, walking in circles as she packed her clothes. She  sat on the edge of her bunk to gather her thoughts in the cramped quarters she  shared with three others. "It's almost like I don't want to leave. I feel like  I've barely scratched the surface of recovery," she said. "Now I'm really  facing life by myself. It's really scary."  </P> <P> Actually, Kidd wouldn't be going far -- just moving into the home of another  recovering addict. She still ached to be with her children, but counselors had  warned her that she would be overwhelmed if she tried to resume caring for them  right now. Although her counselors had their doubts about her, they knew there  was little more they could do. She would attend weekly group sessions at a  nearby clinic as well as Narcotics Anonymous meetings most nights. As part of  the N.A. network, she had found a "sponsor" among more experienced recovering  addicts. She learned that N.A. must become her guidepost for the rest of her  life.  </P> <P> As Kidd walked out of Impact for what everybody hoped would be the last time,  well-wishers showered her with hugs and encouragement. "You're going to do just  fine. I know you are," said a friend, fighting to hold back tears.  </P> <P> THE EXCITEMENT of rejoining the outside world doesn't always last long. The  problems graduates leave behind -- and which they used drugs to avoid -- await  them there. But now they must deal with them sober.  </P> <P> Jai Sim, the 30-year-old immigrant who faced his drug problem in the program,  had been eager to return to his family's failing Long Beach grocery store to  try to it. Within a few weeks after leaving Impact, however, he was feeling  miserable. Overwhelmed by the demands of the store and a stressful separation,  Sim was disgusted that he seemed no better able to cope with life than before.  "I thought I was supposed to be better," said the bespectacled and shy man.  </P> <P> At the slightest provocation, however, his thoughts returned to "using." For  instance, after an argument with his mother over his marital problems, he had  stomped out of the store and thought seriously about connecting with his  favorite crack dealers. Nevertheless, Sim acknowledged that Impact's lessons  had served him well. That afternoon, instead of giving in to the temptation, he  calmed himself down with a cigarette and "shared" his frustrations later that  evening with fellow recovering addicts at an N.A. meeting.  </P> <P> This was a monumental change for Sim, who had always kept a tight lid on his  personal problems. When he arrived at Impact, he didn't feel he belonged. His  "little felony" for selling crack at the post office, he convinced himself, was  nothing compared to the stories that he heard from others. They were hard-core  heroin junkies and criminals. He was nothing of the kind.  </P> <P> Indeed, Sim's whole life in the United States has been a struggle to reconcile  the stoicism of his Asian upbringing with the realities of his new homeland. At  19, soon after his family immigrated here, he enlisted in the Army. He wore the  same uniform as everyone else but felt like an outsider. So, giving in to peer  pressure, he started smoking hashish with the guys. The loneliness left him. To  feed his habit, he started selling a little on the side. He was caught,  court-martialed and ended his hitch with several months in a stockade.  </P> <P> When he returned home, Sim couldn't find a job and began hanging out at  Koreatown bars. But even among his own he felt alone. He got married, the  marriage soured and his drug use escalated. By then, he was smoking crack every  day, even during lunch breaks at the job he finally found at the post office.  </P> <P> At Impact, Sim wept in front of others as he told how he had married and  divorced a black woman but kept their son a secret from his grandfather. His  parents had never accepted his wife, and his grandfather died without knowing  about the child. Crying in public, he said, is something Koreans just don't do.  But it had broken his emotional logjam. He accepted that he is a fragile as  every other addict.  </P> <P> As an outpatient, Sim continued to rely on the support of fellow addicts at  nightly N.A. meetings and at weekly group therapy sessions. Sim told his  support group that he still gets pressure from his estranged wife, his  probation officer, his parents, his business. But he was thinking about  organizing a Narcotics Anonymous chapter in Koreatown. Too often, Sim said,  Asian recovering addicts receive little support from families who refuse to  acknowledge such problems. To this day, Sim has not explained to his parents  any details of his addiction or treatment.  </P> <P> The others who listened in the smoke-filled meeting room agreed that the  novelty of escaping day-to-day regimentation at Impact quickly wore off. Suzan  Kidd also felt the world closing in around her. She had not yet found a car to  buy, the bus ride to work was driving her nuts and she felt overwhelmed by her  new job. She was irritable and impatient. "I still don't know if I like being  responsible for myself. I find it real hard," she droned in a monotone. "How am  I ever going to be able to raise three kids when I can't even get a room of my  own or a car?"  </P> <P> "We're all facing life on life's terms," the group counselor said. "It's not  always going to be easy. But you have to keep remembering it is better than it  was. Be happy with what you have today. Remember this is a lifelong process."  </P> <P> ON GOOD Friday, Frank Castillo lost the battle. Loneliness hit him like a ton  of bricks. He desperately missed his wife. He had gone back to work as a house  painter and, as an outpatient, was renting a place with a few Impact graduates.  But the program's demands were beginning to chafe like a leash around his neck.  And his wife couldn't decide whether she wanted him back or not.  </P> <P> The old hopelessness began closing in on him and sent Castillo tailspinning  into despair. Almost instinctively, he found himself driving along Fair Oaks,  not far from Impact but much closer to the spot where the drug dealers  congregate. Someone offered him some crack and he took a hit. Castillo spent  the rest of the night bartering what little he had -- a stereo, TV, radio and  the tools his wife had bought him as a gift -- in exchange for another rock, as  the solid and most addictive form of cocaine is also known. He and an  acquaintance spent the whole night and much of the next day in his pickup on  their bender.  </P> <P> Castillo's relapse hit his old friends from Impact hard, but it didn't really  surprise them. They are all too familiar with the razor-thin line that  separates using from staying clean. What surprised them was how quickly  Castillo recovered. As soon as he came down from his lost weekend, Castillo  drove straight to Impact. While he knew he was automatically expelled from the  program, he also knew he could find someone there to talk to.  </P> <P> Castillo resumed attending N.A. meetings and vowed that he would never again  allow his life to collapse around him. "I will not live that kind of hell  anymore," he said, angrily stamping out another in a long chain of cigarettes  as he talked openly about suicide. "I'll just get a real boost (overdose) and  finish it."  </P> <P> At times, he sounded like a spoiled child. He had put up with the loneliness of  his wife's absence for six months, he said, and that was long enough. "I don't  know how to deal without my honey, and I really don't want to," he said. "I  want what I want when I want it!"  </P> <P> Then, in a more reflective mood, tapping at his head, Castillo said, "This  thing . . . is out to get me. That's the disease of addiction. It won't accept  pain. It only wants to feel good."  </P> <P> Still, Castillo's counselors were not ready to give up, saying his resolve  seemed stronger than ever. They advised Castillo to steel himself for the next  test which, they assured him, would come -- over and over again. The counselor  told Castillo that his priorities had become confused: His wife had become more  important to him than his recovery.  </P> <P> Moreover, like Jai Sim and Suzan Kidd, Castillo had returned home to live with  his parents, a move their former counselors did not consider positive. Castillo  "really needs to break away, establish himself, grow up," his former counselor  said. But it's not unusual, he added, for graduates to run back home upon  re-entering a hostile world where the difficult task of rebuilding their lives  awaits them. Castillo has managed to stay off drugs since his lost weekend.  Nevertheless, his counselor said he cannot be sure whether Castillo will make  it. "He's still very much a little boy," the counselor said.  </P> <P> A FEW DAYS after Castillo's drug relapse, Impact counselors heard that Sim also  might be in trouble. Under terms of his probation, he was required to undergo  periodic drug tests. The latest one came back "dirty." He hadn't used, he  insisted to the unsympathetic lab technician who had heard such denials all too  often. Later that evening, Sim went with his troubles to the small group  gathered for the weekly N.A. meeting in Koreatown. Sim had gotten the group off  the ground about a month earlier. From the dozen recovering addicts there, Sim  received words of encouragement and hugs. They believed him.  </P> <P> Fortunately for Sim, further analysis eventually determined that the traces of  morphine that turned up in his urine sample were from a new medication  prescribed for a stomach ailment. He breathed a sigh of relief. Although it  seemed to Sim that life continued to throw him curve balls, he kept going to  the weekly Koreatown N.A. meetings. "It gives me hope," he said. For once in  his life, he did not feel alone. But counselors at Impact worried that he was  focusing too much attention on the group he had started while neglecting to  attend any others. Missing nightly sessions, considered critical for  outpatients, was not a good sign.  </P> <P> In April, Suzan Kidd moved back to her grandmother's home to be with her  children. Although she had completed the program, Impact counselors were  concerned. Not only did they consider it an evasion of personal responsibility,  but they also knew she wasn't ready to care for her children. On the phone, she  sounded dispirited and distant, her counselors said. They could feel her  slipping away.  </P> <P> She had lost touch with her N.A. sponsor and had begun weaving the addict's  familiar web of deception, her counselors said. She told everybody her  probation officer had ordered her to move when, in fact, it had been her  choice. One counselor was not optimistic: "Sometimes people relapse before they  get loaded. She may not be loaded now, but she's heading in that direction." By  early May, Kidd's phone had been disconnected.  </P> <P> To everyone's surprise, John Mitchell, who dropped out of the program just a  few days before he was scheduled to begin outpatient treatment, stayed clean  for a while. In his mind, he had received what he wanted from the program and  was ready to continue on his own. He had moved in with his surviving daughter  and, against the advice of Impact counselors, had gone to work as a truck  driver. Although there was no lack of opportunity to use drugs at the truck  stops he frequented, he said, he had the courage to resist.  </P> <P> Mitchell also said he remained involved in Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous.  But counselors were skeptical, citing Mitchell's tendency toward  self-deception. And last month, he disappeared. His daughter said he left for  work one day and never came back.  </P> <P> Lynn Williams was said to be living in Venice and was seen regularly at N.A.  meetings. Those who saw her said she sounded excited about her new life. She  was working as a house painter and planning on returning to school to study  art, a lifelong dream.  </P> <P> But she had decided to quit sharing her innermost life with a reporter. "I'm  tired of being a junkie and of people relating to me as a dope fiend," she  said. "I want to put that (Lynn) to rest. I'll always have ex-junkies around me  because I need their support. But I want to have a normal life and some day be  around normal people who don't necessarily know all about my past." Counselors  understood her attitude but considered it another form of denial, one of their  biggest enemies.  </P> <P> Karen Allen graduated from the program and stayed on as a full-time  counselor-trainee. But it wasn't long before she stumbled. Not surprisingly, it  was over sex, not drugs. It involved nothing more than a kiss. She and another  male counselor crossed Impact's strict line between friendship and  fraternization. As the more senior staffer, the man was immediately fired.  Karen was allowed to stay but was ordered to resume therapy and delve further  into her need for male attention. "I've depended on men my whole life to make  me feel good," she said, sounding contrite. "I hope I can change."  </P> <P> Like the others, Allen knows she has only begun on the long road to recovery.  Impact provided her a road map and some tools. The rest is up to her. "I don't  know what tomorrow will bring," she said. "All I can say is that I can stay  clean for today and make it through another day."  </P></p>

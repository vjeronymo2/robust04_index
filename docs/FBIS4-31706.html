			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H5>  MSZP Voters Found To Oppose Reform </H5>   Polling voters of the parties that ran in the May election,  the Hungarian Gallup Institute found that supporters of the  Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP)--which won an absolute  majority, with 209 of a total of 386, of the parliamentary  seats--are considerably more likely to oppose economic reform  and are less tolerant of minorities than supporters of the  Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), which the MSZP has invited  to become its coalition partner. According to the findings,  MSZP supporters are also far less inclined to favor economic  reform than supporters of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF),  the main party of the defeated right-of-center government, while  the views of MSZP and MDF voters differ little in terms of  social tolerance. Published in the 2 June issue of the  Budapestweekly BESZELO, the poll was conducted 21-23 May between  the two rounds of election balloting and reflects views  expressed on a questionnaire by 1500 Hungarians "representing  all voting-age inhabitants of the country nationwide." Although  15 parties ran in the election, the poll results published in  BESZELO pertain mainly to the six parties that made it into  parliament by getting at least 5 percent of the vote, the  threshold set by law.  <H5>  Gallup Official's Commentary </H5>   In the commentary accompanying the data, Hungarian Gallup  official Gyorgy Fischer suggested that the voters' dislike of  economic reform played a key role in determining the outcome of  the election and that this antireform attitude may undermine the  stability of any MSZP-SZDSZ governing coalition. "The most  promarket voting camps," Fischer noted, "are those of the MDF  and the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz)," the parties  that lost the most--MDF dropping to 38 seats from 159 in the  1990 election, and Fidesz barely surmounting the 5-percent  barrier into parliament with 20 seats, even though for a time  last year it had led popularity polls.    At the same time, Fischer indicated, the fact that voters of  the SZDSZ--which came in a distant second to the MSZP, with 69  seats--support a market economy "to a great degree" suggests  that if the MSZP and SZDSZ form a coalition, the two parties'  leaders will be under conflicting pressures from their  respective constituents. Voters of the two parties are "far from  each other" on key economic issues, Fischer stressed. "SZDSZ  voters are characterized by a promarket attitude and almost  completely lack support for the redistribution of wealth by the  state," while "in contrast, the MSZP's voting base is  characterized by strong hostility to the market and supports on  a large scale the idea of redistribution."  <H5>  Views on Economic Reform </H5>   The contrast between MSZP voters and supporters of the other  parties was sharpest on the question of whether private property  should be dominant, with only 18 percent of MSZP voters saying  they agree, as opposed to the following percentages for other  parties: SZDSZ, 40; MDF, 40; Independent Smallholders Party, 49;  Christian Democratic People's Party, 34; and Fidesz, 37.  Conversely, 43 percent of MSZP voters rejected outright the  proposition that private property should be dominant, while the  percentages for the other parties are significantly lower:  SZDSZ, 22; MDF, 28; Smallholders, 21; Christian Democrats, 24;  and Fidesz, 30. The antireform attitudes of MSZP voters was  shown, for example, by the fact that only 22 percent of them  agree that "unprofitable enterprises must be allowed to go  bankrupt." This is well below the percentages for other  parties: SZDSZ, 30; MDF, 44; Smallholders, 30; Christian  Democrats, 33; and Fidesz, 38. Conversely, the following  percentages disagreed with allowing bankruptcy: MSZP, 47; SZDSZ,  41; MDF, 33; Smallholders, 42; Christian Democrats, 39; and  Fidesz, 37.    Only on one question, asking whether respondents agreed  "that  Market competition should be limited," did supporters of another  party, the Christian Democrats, score higher than those of the  MSZP in opposing reform. The breakdown in the "agree" column  was as follows: MSZP, 45; SZDSZ, 37; MDF, 35; Smallholders, 43;  Christian Democrats, 53; and Fidesz, 37. The percentages in the  "disagree" column were MSZP, 24; SZDSZ, 36; MDF, 41;  Smallholders, 25; Christian Democrats, 23; and Fidesz, 36.    Although the aggregate data indicated that the MDF and  Fidesz  voters are the most consistently promarket, Fischer noted, the  survey showed that on "attitudes toward the redistribution of  wealth and toward the market," the MSZP and the SZDSZ are the  most sharply divided. The desire to increase the state's role  in redistributing wealth "is least characteristic of the  Smallholders and SZDSZ," while "social envy and the desire for  redistribution are by far the most characteristic of MSZP  voters," he said.  <H5>  Social Tolerance </H5>   The poll indicated that among Hungarian voters there is  little correlation between socialist economic attitudes and  social tolerance. According to Fischer, the aggregate data show  that, along with Smallholders voters, supporters of the MSZP are  "more intolerant than the average," while the "most tolerant"  voters are supporters of the SZDSZ--indicating that, as in the  case of economic reform, the respective voters of the MSZP and  the SZDSZ have "radically" different views, which could strain a  coalition between the two parties. Fischer noted that this  difference in social attitudes is also "what sharply separates  the SZDSZ from the Smallholders, to which it is so close in  terms of economic attitudes." At the same time, the data  indicate that the Christian Democrat camp, which stands closest  to the MSZP in socialist economic views, comes closest to the  liberal SZDSZ in social tolerance.    The Gallup Institute's survey provided a breakdown of voter  attitudes toward three groups: Gypsies, Jews, and "people of  color." The survey indicated that about half of the population,  with only an 8-percentage point spread among the parties, has  "an aversion to Gypsies": MSZP, 47; SZDSZ, 46; MDF, 49;  Smallholders, 52; Christian Democrats, 44; Fidesz, 44.  Responses to a question about anti-Semitism, on the other hand,  suggest that hostility to Jews is far less prevalent than toward  Gypsies, with socialist voters more inclined to anti-Semitic  views than supporters of the liberal parties, SZDSZ and Fidesz,  and more than supporters of the three right-of-center parties.  Percentages of those who said that they "dislike Jews" are as  follows: MSZP, 15; SZDSZ, 7; MDF, 10; Smallholders, 13;  Christian Democrats, 10; and Fidesz, 10. The MSZP was in the  middle of the pack, however, on the topic of racial tolerance.  Asked if "it would be better to limit the number of people of  color in this country," the following percentages of party  voters answered in the affirmative: MSZP, 30; SZDSZ, 27; MDF,  27; Smallholders, 35; Christian Democrats, 31; and Fidesz, 34.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Appointments: Mars executive for Asda Mars, which seems to churn out marketing experts as quickly as its ubiquitous chocolate bars, has produced another high-profile executive to fill the post of marketing director at Asda, the Pudsey-based grocery chain. He is Allan Leighton, 38, formerly marketing and sales director of Pedigree Petfoods, the Mars' subsidiary. His previous jobs include marketing controller of Mars Confectionery and general manager of its operations in Portugal. Asda has also appointed Gordon McBeath, the former director of management development at BAT, as personnel director. He will succeed Jonathan Fox who left last month. The two additions to the Asda management board reflect the attempts of Archie Norman, chief executive, to forge a new team to resuscitate the struggling food retailer. He has already appointed a finance director - Phil Cox, the former chief executive of Burns Anderson.</p>

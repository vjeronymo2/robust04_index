			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian oil reserves estimate raised by 12% THE NORWEGIAN Petroleum Directorate, the industry watchdog, has upgraded its estimate of recoverable reserves from the country's continental shelf by 12 per cent to 10bn tonnes of oil equivalent The previous assessment, released in 1988, was by far the most pessimistic prognosis on Norway's future prospects as a leading petroleum nation ever issued. But it has proved far off the mark. The directorate then predicted that there was limited sales potential for Norway's vast natural gas resources. But it now seems that Norway's gas sales to the European continent could more than double from the present annual level of 25bn cubic metres to about 60bn-70bn cu m by the turn of the century. About 11 per cent, or 1.13bn tonnes of the resources have been produced and sold, the directorate says, and existing production technology will allow for about 4.5bn tonnes of remaining discovered resources to be extracted. Of this, 40 per cent is thought to be oil and 60 per cent gas. At the current annual extraction rate of 80m tonnes, oil resources will last another 45 years while gas resources will last for about two centuries at an annual production rate of 25m tonnes.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains melt away by the close AN EARLY attempt by UK equities to push on towards the all-time peaks reached in March soon faded away yesterday behind a less aggressive stock index futures sector. Base rate hopes were reined in by cautious comment on German rate prospects from the deputy president of the Bundesbank, and a calmer dollar took the bounce out of the international blue chips. After being nearly 14 points ahead in the first hour of trading, the FT-SE 100 Index relinquished almost all of the rise later in the session. Shares in Rothmans, the South African based tobacco group, rose sharply in late dealings, giving a final hoist to the FT-SE 100, which closed 4.2 up at 2,907.6. The index is now 49.7 points, or 1.7 per cent, beneath its March peak. The more cautious tone across the range of the market was reflected in the first fall in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index for several sessions; at 3,217.9, the Mid 250 was finally 0.6 off, having lost an earlier gain of nearly 7 points. Restraining share prices towards the close were the prospects for the impending auction of UK government bonds, details of which came late in the session. London paid little heed, however, to a downward drift in the Dow during early dealings on Wall Street, which was 13 points off when the UK market closed for the day. London traders remained hopeful that German interest rates may be cut soon, thus opening the way for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, to deliver what is expected to be the final reduction in UK rates in this cycle. But hopes of a move by the Bundesbank this week were damped down by yesterday's comments from the deputy president of the German central bank. On the domestic front, there was little immediate response to UK gross domestic product figures for the first quarter of the year, while a modest widening of the current account deficit was read as strengthening the arguments for a base rate cut. The market was in good heart in the first half of the session, with Zeneca shares triumphant on the news that the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue, which formed the cornerstone of its demerger from ICI, had found 86 per cent acceptances; the remainder was sold in the market at a comfortable premium to the rights price, providing a further boost to underlying investment confidence. The premium on the September future contract on the FT-SE 100 Index remained solid but was half that of the previous day, and there was no repetition of the arbitraging deals which lifted the blue chips on Monday. Helped by good trade in Zeneca, Seaq volume edged up to 588.1m shares from Monday's 570.4m which came to Pounds 1.05bn in retail business worth. Non-Footsie shares made up around 60 per cent of yesterday's total turnover, in line with daily averages this year. The persistently good levels of retail business have been seen as perhaps a more reliable indicator of market confidence than the erratic path traced by the Footsie since the beginning of the year. Store and consumer issues showed mild disappointment with the lack of encouragement for base rate optimism but losses were small. There was little doing in the leading oil shares.</p>

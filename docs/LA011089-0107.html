			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BANDITS TAKE $100,000 IN MALL JEWELRY HEIST  </P> <P> Four bandits who held customers and workers at gunpoint in a Buena Park Mall  jewelry store Monday morning fled with about $100,000 in merchandise, police  said.  </P> <P> Officers said the robbery was similar to other recent Southland "smash-and-rob"  holdups, in which gunmen shatter display cases and escape with jewelry in a  matter of moments, fleeing the area in a stolen car that is quickly abandoned.  </P> <P> No injuries were reported.  </P> <P> Buena Park Police Lt. Tony Kelly said the four entered Ashley's Jewelry Store  about 10:20 a.m. One of the bandits trained a gun on employees and three  customers while another smashed glass display cases and the other two scooped  out jewelry. Then they ran out of the mall.  </P> <P> People who apparently watched the holdup from a nearby mall restaurant  telephoned police, who fanned out at mall exits but missed the robbers.  </P> <P> Kelly said the robbers fled in a car that proved later to be stolen. It was  abandoned a short time later near the residential intersection of Magnolia and  Greenleaf avenues in Anaheim, which is near the Santa Ana and Riverside  freeways.  </P></p>

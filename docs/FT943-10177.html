			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar steady The dollar firmed slightly yesterday on foreign exchanges despite US bonds reacting negatively to the release of employment figures, writes Philip Gawith. The July non-farm payroll rose by 259,000, above market expectations. The dollar initially firmed on the news, but later came off as bond prices fell. It finished in London at DM1.5822 from DM1.581 on Thursday. Against the yen it closed at Y100.485 from Y100.2. In the UK, it was business as usual with the weekly treasury bill auction a comparative non-event after last week's excitement. The highest rate accepted at the 91 day T-bill tender was 5.3747 per cent, down from 5.7558 per cent. There was little movement in Europe with markets exuding a perfunctory, mid-summer feel. The lira maintained its firmer showing, without showing much sign of strengthening, to close at L997.5 from L997.9 against the D-Mark. The dollar's performance - up on the expectation of higher rates, down when the bond market reacts negatively to the same prospect - was in keeping with its recent range-bound performance, between DM1.57 and DM1.60. As far as the dollar's strength against the D-Mark is concerned, the market's main concern is when and by how much the Fed will tighten monetary policy. The latest figures lend support to those who favour the policy-making FOMC moving at its next meeting on August 16. This view already had support from comments made on Thursday by Mr Robert Parry of the San Francisco Fed. In a generally hawkish speech, he said that monetary policy decisions could not be put off until inflation has appeared, while there were also signs of labour market tightness. The outcome of the UK T-bill tender was not much of a surprise since interbank money market rates had already come off during the week, as expectations of a near term tightening from the Bank of England disappeared. Sterling three month LIBOR traded at 5 5/8 per cent, up from 5 1/2 per cent on Thursday, but well below the 6 per cent level of a week earlier. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, commented: 'We have now gone back to the treasury bill 'so-what' market. The Bank has made it very clear that the Treasury bill mechanism is unlikely to be used as a mechanism for interest rate changes.' 'When the time for a change does come, it is likely to be through its normal daily operations.' Sentiment, however, continues to be very nervous, especially in the futures market. The September short sterling contract expires soon after the next monthly monetary meeting. The futures market continues to discount a tightening of more than 50 basis points before the September contract closes on September 21. The contract closed at 94.11, down from 94.13. Volumes were reasonable, with the December contract trading 28,640 lots. In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided UK money markets with late assistance of Pounds 280m. Earlier it had provided Pounds 182m assistance compared to revised forecast of Pounds 900m. Overnight rates ranged from 4 3/4 per cent to 7 per cent.</p>

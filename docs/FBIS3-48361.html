			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, January 21 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Chairman of the  Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful Reunification, Kim  Chong-su, said in a press statement January 20 that the plot of  new large-scale war exercises against the North framed by the  Kim Yong- sam puppet regime and the puppet Army brasshats from  the beginning of the new year revealed the intention of the  South Korean authorities to continue along the road of  confrontation and war contrary to the nation's desire this year,  too, not seeking national reconciliation and unity.    Recalling the declaration of the South Korean authorities  that they would stage massive joint military exercises under a  changed codename, instead of the "Team Spirit," he said: "This  is aimed at putting a spoke in the wheel of the DPRK-U.S. talks  and laying a new high hurdle in the solution of the nuclear  issue. If they stage the war game, the suspension of the `Team  Spirit' nuclear war exercises will practically be meaningless  and a more dangerous situation will be created in Korea."    "The South Korean authorities must clearly know that if they  continue to pursue confrontation and war, turning their back on  the compatriots desirous of reconciliation and unity, detente  and peace, they will face a stern judgment by the nation, sooner  or later," he warned.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "Appointment" column] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A reshuffle has occurred in  Luxembourg. Aleksandr Glukhov, director of the European  Department, has been appointed Russia's ambassador to that  country. Author Chingiz Aytmatov, Russia's former envoy to the  country, has received an offer from the Government of Kyrgyzstan  to become ambassador to Brussels. The author, however, stated  that his permanent residence is in Moscow and that he is in fact  a citizen of Russia, while his artistic plans require his and  his family's presence in Luxembourg. Apparently Aytmatov has  obtained a residence permit to live in that country.</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: A touch of cold steel December's agreement to curb subsidies and rationalise the European steel industry always looked brittle. The chances that the deal would break down increased considerably after the rescue plan for Klockner-Werke's Bremen plant went ahead. Though the European Commission has promised to take a tough line on the Bremen arrangement, the political lobbies have plenty of time to swing into action before it pronounces in July. The chances of the Commission stopping the deal are probably slim, despite the involvement of the Bremen state government. In those circumstances, the reluctance of non-aided steel companies to come up with fresh offers to cut capacity at tomorrow's meeting with the European Commission is perfectly understandable. The politicians responsible for December's agreement have only themselves to blame. Still, against the backdrop of the industry's voluntary supply restraints which lifted prices off their lows last year, a permanent cutback in capacity is less urgent than the need to deal once and for all with subsidies. Within 12 months or so, demand should be rising as European economies turn upwards. At the peak of the cycle, the capacity surplus may look markedly less than the 30m tonnes which is commonly estimated today. More imports would be needed to meet supply shortfalls then if capacity is cut back too zealously now. Such thoughts may help to explain the continuing resilience in British Steel's share price. With its low cost base, strong balance sheet and modest capital spending requirements, British Steel is in a stronger position than most private sector companies to ride out the storm, and even to develop lucrative new markets in the Far East. It will still pay a heavy price, though, if Europe fails to come to grips with subsidies that keep its inefficient competitors alive.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NMFS is proposing the following eligibility criteria: Participation in the commercial fishery in either 1992 or 1993; at least 50 percent of gross income from the commercial fishery in the base year, selected from 1986&hyph;1989, used to determine a loss; at least a 50 percent decline in commercial fishery income from the base year as compared to commercial fishery income in 1992 or 1993, whichever is greater; and, if single, 1993 gross income of less than $25,000, or if married, combined gross income of less than $50,000. Persons receiving a permit buyout would not be eligible for the jobs programs. The disaster relief funds are being made available under the IFA, which excludes government entities from receiving aid; tribal and local governments are ineligible for this program. However, individual tribal commercial fishermen are eligible to apply for the NEAP program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. If fishing permits are relinquished, how can their further reissuance be handled by the states?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A charterboat operator stated that the total number of permits should be reduced, beginning with the inactive permits. Under no circumstance should any new permits be issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An individual suggested waiting until salmon numbers increase, and then giving first priority for new permits to former permit holders who relinquished theirs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A tribe member stated that this should be coordinated with the treaty tribes and other entities involved, after studying the natural and biological effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS is proposing that, as a condition for receipt of buyout funds under this program, the administering authority must ensure that reissuance of purchased permits will not be allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. What should be the basis for the valuation of the permits, and should inactive permits be valuated differently?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A fisherman stated that permit value should relate to the current market value of Alaska troll permits that are for sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A charterboat operator commented that this should be decided by industry as a function of criteria for a permit buyout. Valuation should logically reflect the level of activity in the fishery, i.e., greater value for the more active permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An individual stated that all active permits should have the same value; inactive permits should be valueless.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A tribal individual's response to this question was ``economic hardship, and education.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS is proposing not to set a value for permits, but to use a sealed bid process for conducting a permit buyout. However, in no case may a buyout recipient receive benefits in excess of 75 percent of the total uninsured losses incurred for the disaster period, or $100,000, whichever is less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. What would be appropriate documentation to determine the extent of uninsured losses?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One fisherman stated that a notarized statement from the vessel's captain should be required for determining aid to deckhands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS GET BAILES TO BOLSTER STAFF  </P> <P> The Angels, continuing to add veteran pitching depth apparently in an effort to  enhance their ability to trade for a hitter, sent two farm prospects to the  Cleveland Indians Tuesday for versatile Scott Bailes.  </P> <P> Bailes, 28, a left-hander, was 5-9 with a 4.28 earned-run average in 11 starts  and 23 relief appearances with the Indians last year.  </P> <P> He had a 31-41 record in four seasons at Cleveland.  </P> <P> The Angels gave up infielder Jeff Manto, 25, who hit 23 home runs and drove in  67 runs in 127 games at Edmonton last season, and pitcher Colin Charland, 24,  who was 5-10 at Edmonton after going 17-5 at Palm Springs in 1988.  </P> <P> General Manager Mike Port said he thought that Manto and Charland both have  major league potential but doubted either would be ready in 1990. Bailes, he  said, represents immediate help as a starter or reliever and enhances a  pitching surplus that might eventually help the club land a solid hitter.  </P> <P> Since the signing of Mark Langston gave the Angels six starting pitchers, the  Angels have acquired Mike Smithson, Mark Eichhorn and Bailes, who join Bryan  Harvey, Willie Fraser, Greg Minton, Bob McClure and Rich Monteleone in creating  a bullpen logjam.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of good arms to choose from and a lot of good depth that might  bring us back the offensive player we covet," Port said, adding that the  surplus enables the Angels to investigate new trade possibilities, which he  refused to identify.

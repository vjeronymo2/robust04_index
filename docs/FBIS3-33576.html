			<p>Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was reported a short while ago from Caulatu,  Quilali, that an agreement has been reached between the  government and the rebels. As a result of this agreement,  Esteban, the brother of Jose Angel Talavera, a.k.a. El Chacal,  head of the 3-80 Northern Front, demobilized. Another important  result of this agreement is that 100 recontras will surrender on  2 March, and the last man will surrender his arms no later than  8 April.    The government has agreed to create a provisional  demilitarized zone in Caulatu and El Zungano, Esteli, and  provide food, clothing, and medicines to the rebels while they  wait for the demobilization's deadline.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Bonn coalition partners in pay row MR Jurgen Mollemann, the German economics minister, yesterday demanded a meeting of the ruling coalition parties to debate his call for a statutory limit of 5 per cent on this year's pay rise for civil servants. Speaking last night after Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, rejected his proposal and openly rebuked him for interfering, Mr Mollemann said there were precedents, including a nil pay increase in 1982, and a 2 per cent limit the following year. A coalition meeting would embroil his FDP party chairman, Mr Otto Lambsdorff and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, chairman of the CDU, in a debate which could further aggravate embarrassing tensions between the coalition partners. They are at odds over new social security proposals, environment and fiscal policy. Mr Lambsdorff yesterday sprang to Mr Mollemann's defence as his proposals drew wide criticism and mockery. Supporting statutory measures, Mr Lambsdorff said remarkable situations called for remarkable solutions. The succession of union demands for two-figure pay increases this year was 'Utopian'. Mr Seiters, a member of the CDU, had said earlier: 'The repeated public suggestions from the economics minister are neither appropriate nor helpful.' As the minister responsible for public servants' pay, he had no intention of adopting the idea. Mr Mollemann, who proposed in a newspaper article, published yesterday, a plan to enable the government as an employer to 'send a signal' to private sector pay negotiators, was attacked by trade union officials who claimed that statutory pay controls were unconstitutional. 'We are really very little interested in the rantings of Mr Mollemann,' said the 4m-member IG Metall union. The DGB trade union association remarked that no one took the minister seriously any more, adding that it had no wish to shorten his political career. White-collar unions, however, warned that Mr Mollemann was asking for strike action if he did not stay out of pay negotiations. Free collective bargaining was a constitutional right and not a football to be kicked around by a minister standing off-side, said the OTV public services union. Over the past few months, as unions representing steel, banking and public service workers have put in claims for 1992 pay increases of around 10 per cent, Mr Mollemann has repeatedly insisted that all settlements should have 'a 4 before the decimal point'. Rejecting the renewed criticism, he said last night that he would prefer to hear constructive alternatives instead.</p>

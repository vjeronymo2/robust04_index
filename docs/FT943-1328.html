			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (2): Bright promise fades away - How the UK residential market has fared this year The year had started full of promise but, as winter turned to spring, and then summer, the property market started sticking. The rise in long-term yields killed the attractive fixed-rate mortgages of January and February, taxes went up in April and the government did badly in local and European elections. As confidence waned, sales fell. The mid-September base rate increase also prompted fears that the uncertain recovery in the housing market would be checked. Negative equity probably provides a salutary reminder that, although prices are slowly improving, they still have a long way to go until they reach 1988-89 levels. The priority now, after a recession that affected the house-owning middle-classes most, is to have a home (with all the security and permanence that implies) and not a fast-profit investment vehicle. If potential sellers do not see anything to buy that they like and there is no reason to move, they are staying put. The Corporate Estate Agents Property Index of net sales (those that went through), based on about half the country's housing transactions through estate agents, peaked in February (38,126 sales) and March (40,114), but by July had fallen to 29,382 - 9.7 per cent down on July 1993. In August the figure was 29,570, 1.7 per cent down on the same month last year but up 0.6 per cent on the previous month. It is curate's egg of a market, good in parts. There are masses of would-be buyers, and the affordability of houses has hardly been better, but agents do not have enough vendors with the confidence to instruct them to sell. This stock shortage makes the market still stickier and prices, as recorded by Nationwide and Halifax, have barely moved. Turnover is low and the expected general recovery is still on the horizon. Two sectors are different. The shortage of homes for resale has boosted the lettings and new homes markets. New house prices went up sharply in August by 2.2 per cent from July, Halifax estimates. More people are becoming tenants, some for well-established reasons (job demands, divorce, widowhood, waiting to buy after selling) and some because they now prefer the flexibility - and reduced responsibilities - of renting. It is also a market of strong local variations. Prices have surged in London and for good properties within easy reach of the capital. But in other parts of the UK they are still coming down. In December 1992, Yolande Barnes, head of Savills' Residential Research, forecast rises of 10 to 15 per cent in prime central London prices by June 1994. The actual result, she computes, was 23.4 per cent, putting prices at about the level of June 1987. We shall see in January how her forecast of December 1993 - that prices would rise by 19 per cent across the country in 1994 and by 25 per cent in prime central London - has worked out. With half the year gone, the London advance has reached 11.9 per cent, showing that there has been good recovery in the capital. This is very different from what Nationwide and Halifax have been saying but, as Barnes emphasises, their figures cover the properties on which they give mortgages and therefore leave out 28 per cent of transactions - mostly at the top of the market - that do not involve mortgages. James Wilson, of buying agent Wilson &amp; Wilson, thinks a more likely figure for the 1994 increase will be 10-12 per cent and points out that London is always a different market because foreign investors help to buffer it from the domestic economy. He expects a further 10 per cent rise in 1995. Besides rich foreigners, City bonuses have been a factor, particularly in areas such as Kensington, Holland Park and Notting Hill, which showed an annualised increase for flats of 28.1 per cent and for houses of 22 per cent in the second quarter of this year. The bonuses have also affected the market in counties such as Hampshire, where owners of cottages, village houses and country houses have been obtaining the asking prices immediately. Michael Dunning, of Lane Fox in Winchester, sees many frustrated buyers chasing houses costing more than Pounds 500,000 with supply 'distinctly short'. On Savills' figures, the general rise for good country houses has been 3.8 per cent in the first half of the year, with average rises of 1.7 per cent in the north, 2.6 per cent in the east and west and 8.1 per cent in the home counties. But it is a patchy picture in which local conditions and the quality of the house both have an effect. In East Anglia, Cambridgeshire is, as usual, the first county to feel the improvement in the economy spreading out from London, thanks to its university, high-tech industries and good communications. Prices have risen about 5 per cent this year, Bidwells reports, with far easterners and Channel Islanders among the buyers. There is the support of a strong lettings market. Other parts doing well include south-east Wales, Gloucestershire, North Yorkshire and the West Midlands, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors market survey for May-July. Some selling and buying agents feel that Savills' bullish forecasts for 1994 price rises have encouraged vendors to put off decisions in the hope that they may wipe out any negative equity which they may have carried. But there cannot be any price changes without market liquidity. Finally, in spite of exceptions, there is little prospect of quick capital gain. If attitudes to buying really have changed - and property is no longer something to take a punt on - the turnover in the resale market will continue to be much less than a few years ago. That is good news for landlords and new home builders. But for estate agents it can lead only to amalgamations and reductions as there will not be enough business to keep them all going. In the meantime, buyers should sell if they can and determine how large a mortgage their salary can stand so that they can beat the competition for that ever rarer item, a period house for sale.  ------------------------------------------------ House prices  ------------------------------------------------ Average prices by area (% change over last year)  ------------------------------------------------ Greater London (Pounds 77,952)             (1.6) South East (Pounds 77,360)                 (2.2) South West (Pounds 62,210)                 (0.8) West Midlands (Pounds 61,785)             (-0.6) East Anglia (Pounds 59,455)                (1.6) Scotland (Pounds 57,897)                   (0.4) East Midlands (Pounds 55,352)              (1.1) North West (Pounds 55,345)                (-2.1) Wales (Pounds 53,525)                     (-0.6) Yorkshire and Humberside (Pounds 52,907)  (-0.5) North (Pounds 52,036)                     (-1.3) Northern Ireland (Pounds 40,557)           (6.6) United Kingdom (Pounds 63,124)             (0.6)  ------------------------------------------------ Source: Halifax  ------------------------------------------------</p>

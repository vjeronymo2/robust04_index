Also present was John Shalikashvili, chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces. [passage omitted]    Albright and Shalikashvili informed Czech representatives on  the political principles and individual aspects of the U.S.  Partnership for Peace initiative, Czech Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec said after a meeting with them today.    He stressed that the Czech Republic considered Partnership  for Peace as a project which could bring new impulses to the  creation of European security framework. The Czech Republic  intends to show its partners that it is not striving just to  acquire unilateral security guarantees, but that it is able to  assume the relevant share of responsibility, Zieleniec said.    Zieleniec called the American initiative an important step  which opened up the way for the Czech Republic to NATO. [passage  omitted]</p>

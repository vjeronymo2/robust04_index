			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / CFA-zone countries impose price controls The governments of Senegal, Ivory Coast, Benin and Burkina Faso have imposed price controls on imported goods, services and commodities to halt a sharp rise in in-flation after Tuesday's 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA franc. Governments in the CFA franc zone - created more than 40 years ago and grouping 14 Central and West African nations - say the medium-term effects on economies will be beneficial, but the devaluation sparked panic among commercial and parastatal companies earlier in the week. In Senegal the government has pegged the official price of rice, sugar, bread and other foodstuffs, electricity, transport and health services at Tuesday's level and said price rises must be officially approved. Although devaluation had been predicted for more than three years, CFA-zone governments had not prepared the public for the shock. There have been angry accusations against France for removing its support for the overvalued currency.</p>

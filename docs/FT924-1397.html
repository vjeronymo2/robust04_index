			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: DTI says costs of renewable energy are high ELECTRICITY generated by most forms of renewable energy is several times more expensive than using conventional fuels, according to a long-awaited report commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry. But the report - which was originally due in the spring and was published yesterday - calls for government intervention to help renewables become established. It argues that current prices of coal, gas and nuclear energy do not reflect start-up and environmental costs. The Renewable Energy Advisory Group argues that large offshore wave energy projects are unlikely to be uneconomic. A separate review for the DTI on the potential for wave energy, published at the same time, comes to the same conclusion for 'the short to medium term'. The advisory group, which began work in September 1991, says that with government help renewables could 'plausibly' contribute between 5 per cent and 20 per cent of 1991 levels of electricity supply by the year 2025. It estimates that this could save at least 10m tonnes a year of carbon dioxide emissions - around 5 per cent of projected emissions of the gas, which is believed to be implicated in global warming. The report makes clear that most renewable energy costs at least two to three times as much as existing sources. Costs quoted for coal, gas and nuclear energy by the energy industry are between 2.2 p and 3.5 p per kWh, although the figures are disputed by environmentalists. The report recommends the government to help investment in renewables by underwriting a minimum level of 1,500MW by the year 2000 compared with the present agreed level of 1,000MW, and by guaranteeing fixed-term electricity supply contracts of between 10 and 15 years. The report urges the government to do this through the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation which requires the regional electricity companies in England and Wales to take a specified amount of power from 'clean' energy sources. The extra cost, funded by a levy on electricity consumers, is devoted almost entirely to nuclear energy. The government would need permission from the European Commission to extend the levy beyond 1998, the present limit. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, criticised the 'short-term' approach to wave energy and the 'puny target' of 1,500MW from renewables by 2000, recommending instead a target of 3,500MW.</p>

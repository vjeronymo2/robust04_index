			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Mun Il-hyon from Beijing] </F>   [Text] On 6 June, the ROK and China signed an agreement on  establishing the ROK-PRC Industrial Cooperation Committee for  the integration of both countries' resources, technologies, and  markets and a memorandum of understanding on technological  cooperation and development in the civil aviation industry.    ROK ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae and Wang Zhongyu,  Chinese minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission  signed these agreements on behalf of each country at the Great  Hall of the People in Beijing.    Accordingly, the ROK and China will hold the first meeting  of  the ROK-PRC Industrial Cooperation Committee in Seoul from 12 to  17 June in the presence of Kim Chol-su, ROK minister of trade,  industry, and resources; and Wang Zhongyu, Chinese minister of  the State Economic and Trade Commission. In the meeting, they  will discuss and actively seek methods to strengthen industrial  cooperation between the two countries -- including technological  cooperation, joint production, and market development in such  updated industries as automobile, high-definition television,  airplane, and electric exchanger.    The ROK and China have selected the 100-passenger Asia  Airbus  as a basic model for their joint development and production of  civil passenger airliners, and decided to jointly seek markets  in the Asia-Pacific area which has a demand for more than 1,000  airliners per year.</p>

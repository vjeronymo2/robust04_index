			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Wassall/Evode The 40 per cent jump in Evode's profits raises the suspicion that it must have pulled out all the stops to fend off Wassall's bid. But since the annual results were set in ink before the predator even surfaced the more reasonable impression is that of the real recovery among some of its businesses. This may make the takeover battle more bruising than was at first imagined, although it is unlikely to preserve Evode's independence. The company's insipid trading record and precarious debt structure have left it with few friends in the City. And with the shares unchanged at 91p yesterday, the market seemed to keep the invitation open to Wassall  - especially if it digs deeper into its pockets and lifts its 80p bid. Evode's best hope of escaping Wassall's clutches must surely lie in a white knight. Logic - and the curious emergence of Wasserstein Perella on the defence team - suggests that one could come from the US, where low borrowing costs and the high dollar would add to the attractions of such a deal. Whichever way, Evode's shareholders would not lose. Rather than overpay, Wassall could walk away to stalk another prey. How Hanson must yearn for those early years when its shares were as highly rated as Wassall's and the range of targets was as great.</p>

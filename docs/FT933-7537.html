			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Air Canada offer to block reshape CANADIAN AIRLINES claims Air Canada's CDollars 200m cash offer for its international routes is intended to block a key August 27 vote on Canadian's financial restructuring, writes Robert Gibbens. Mr Rhys Eyton, chairman of Canadian and its parent PWA, said the timing of this week's offer, which includes assumption of CDollars 800m (USDollars 625m) in debt and aircraft lease obligations, comes a week before debenture holders and shareholders of Canadian vote on the restructuring. Three foreign banks have raised objections to the plan and Mr Eyton acknowledged that Air Canada's offer might sway some creditors. American Airlines's CDollars 246m cash infusion depends on creditors' acceptance and Canadian's exit from the Gemini reservation system. The Gemini issue is before the courts, but a new Canadian offer of CDollars 21.5m to withdraw and join American's Sable system has been rejected by Gemini. Air Canada says Canadian cannot withdraw under its contract until 1999.</p>

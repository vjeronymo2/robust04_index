The Ministry said in a statement that Zhirinovskiy, who arrived  here Thursday at the invitation of the tiny National Social  Union of Slovenia, had "offended public order" and "caused  consternation among part of the Slovenian public." The Ministry  call for him to leave "as quickly as possible" came after the  leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party said Slovenia should  form part of a reconstituted Yugoslavia.    Last month, Zhirinovskiy angered Bulgarian officials and was  promptly asked to leave the country after calling on the  president to step down.    At a press conference in the northwestern town of Bled  Friday, Zhirinovskiy said Slovenes, Croats and Serbs should  reunite in a single state. "Slovenes are perhaps happy to have  their own state, but if everyone followed their example it would  lead to catastrophe," he added. He stressed that he was against  the use of arms to resolve conflicts, as this would set the  stage for "a third world war," and that countries' frontiers  should be respected.    The only way to stabilize the situation in former Yugoslavia  was for United Nations troops to withdraw, he added. He warned  that if the world body approved the use of North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation air strikes in Bosnia he would personally "call on  (the Russian) parliament to vote for Russia to leave the UN."    The Ministry statement said Zhirinovskiy's entourage had  "grossly violated public order" during their stay in Bled. It  called on Russia's charge d'affaires in Ljubuljana to ensure  Zhirinovskiy and his team left Slovenia promptly. [passage  omitted]    Zhirinovskiy was due to spend Saturday and Sunday in the  Slovenian resort of Portoroz on the Adriatic coast before  leaving for Belgrade. His Belgrade host Velimir Cvetic, head of  the Social Democratic Party of Yugoslavia, earlier said  Zhirinovskiy would be invited to visit the Serb-styled Serb  republics in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina respectively.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Merger merchants SG Warburg is selling control of itself to Morgan Stanley without receiving a control premium. That would be a cynic's verdict on yesterday's announcement of merger talks which, if successful, will leave the US investment bank's shareholders owning two-thirds of the combined entity. It may be an unfair verdict, but Warburg will have to convince its shareholders that a merger advances their interests more than would a straight cash sale. At present, Warburg's holding statement merely talks about the 'uniquely complementary' nature of the two businesses. One way of reading this is that Warburg has finally reached the conclusion that, in trying to create an integrated global investment bank from its own resources, it has bitten off more than it can chew. October's profit warning rammed this home. Warburg is not merely under-capitalised compared with its larger US rivals; despite great effort and expense, it is weak in the all-important US market. Merging with Morgan Stanley will fill that hole. Morgan Stanley, which lost its competitive edge in the late-1980s, has strategic weaknesses too. Adding Warburg's expertise in the UK and some other markets will potentially enable it to achieve global reach faster and more effectively than building the business organically. So there is some theoretical logic in the tie-up. Whether a merger will pay off, in practice, is less clear. On the positive side, the combined group may be able to generate more advisory, capital-raising and fund management business by leveraging off its enhanced international reach. There should also be plenty of scope to cut costs; expensive staff could be made redundant and capital tied up in duplicate operations could be released. But successfully merging these people businesses will be hard. In hundreds of cases, it will be necessary to decide whether a Warburg or a Morgan Stanley employee is in charge of a particular operation and whether, indeed, one of the two must lose his/her job. There will also be upward pressure on Warburg salaries; though its staff are paid more than most British bankers, they are paid less than their US counterparts. While all this is happening, some of the best staff may walk. There is also a risk that the banks will be so involved with such internal matters they may take their eye off the ball of winning business. Still, if the merger succeeds, it will be a powerful force in global investment banking. The likes of Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch would then face a tougher competitor, but there will be a silver lining. The number of banks operating on a global scale will have shrunk by one. The industry could even settle down into a stable oligopoly, with large profits for all. But smaller UK merchant banks and brokers are likely to feel naked. Banks such as Schroders and Rothschild may come under pressure to team up with brokers like Cazenove and Smith New Court to create integrated houses. Meanwhile, integrated groups such as Kleinwort Benson may well conclude they too need US partners. Such restructuring may lead to the control of famous names slipping out of British hands. But if it enhances the City's position as a global financial centre, that may be a price worth paying.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Accountancy Column: Cadbury risks causing indigestion in boardrooms - Michael Lawrence explains that the report's good intentions are being translated too bureaucratically During the last year I made just two public speeches as chairman of the 100 Group of Finance Directors. Yet they have been referred to so often that many might believe we had conducted a public campaign. My statements reflected the increasing concern of our members, who are mainly the finance directors of the FTSE-100 companies, at the direction of the corporate governance debate and the development of financial reporting in the UK. My first speech was concerned with the way in which the Cadbury Report on the financial aspects of corporate governance was being applied. To counter some notable corporate failings, Cadbury was concerned with enhancing the role of non-executive directors, and with higher disclosure standards in reporting to shareholders. It is not surprising that there were specific proposals requiring boards to explain in more detail the internal controls in operation in companies and to confirm they were 'going concerns'. The basic thrust of Cadbury is to be commended. What is less useful is that the committee, as a non-statutory or formally recognised enforcement agency, had little ability to oversee the implementation of its proposals. It vaguely left it to 'the accountancy profession and preparers of accounts' to produce the necessary guidance, although there is no such recognised group. Equally, a subject such as internal control involves considerations that are much wider than Cadbury's original terms and in which the accountancy profession is not readily recognised as having the relevant expertise. Examples include the attitude of companies to environmental issues and the control of waste output or of health and safety procedures. What therefore started life with good intentions has been increasingly taken over by self-appointed committees which have been able to operate without adequate control or oversight. As members of all the committees, the 100 Group has been able to see at first hand the over-elaboration taking place, and the lack of co-ordination - especially between the accounting and the auditing guidelines. In addition, because of the informal nature of the whole process, other pressure groups and bodies began to suggest elaborations of Cadbury, such as the definition of 'independent' as applied to non-executive directors. All this has come at a time when boards were already having to grapple with some fairly radical changes to financial reporting, such as revised accounting standards, new disclosure formats, a more prescriptive approach to interim reporting, and efforts by auditors to expand their role whilst limiting their liability. One of the reasons I believe that my speech on what I have called 'corporate overload' attracts so much continuing comment is that it strikes a chord in many boardrooms. It has been publicly supported by the Confederation of British Industry, while the need for pacing change has been acknowledged by government. It has also been misrepresented in the press as an undue sensitivity by finance directors to the challenge of future reform. Our basic criticism was not the development of proper standards of corporate governance, but of achievable implementation. A major concern must be to question fundamentally whether the essentially bureaucratic nature of the disclosure proposals, illustrated by the mountain of committee and paper-work that is being produced in Cadbury's name, will lead to the desired objective. The problem is that sound companies will produce the information required in a meaningful way but at quite a high cost in management time and audit fees, whilst those which intend to abuse the system will not be deterred. Substance has to be distinguished from form. The required enforcers of the Cadbury recommendations, the London Stock Exchange and the major investing institutions, have not been represented on the committees devising the accounting and auditing guidelines being produced. We believe that Cadbury could, and can, be discredited if the proposals are not carefully considered and a substantial body of support developed to forge the way ahead. We are pleased with the response that we received to our concerns. Sir Ron Dearing, the out-going chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, called together those principally responsible for the disclosure proposals and has sought to ensure that adequate consultation takes place before implementation. We still believe that some real questioning of the underlying value of the proposals needs to take place. The 100 Group actively endorsed a proposed disclosure recommendation in company annual reports: the operating and financial review. We believe that more effective corporate governance will be achieved if the boards of listed companies are required to produce a structured discussion of their financial results, and of other matters such as Treasury operations. A statement to shareholders covering financial matters generally, as contrasted with specific statements on internal control and going concern alone, seems to us to be a much more valuable approach. Although it may be criticised as too imprecise, it gives a clear duty to the board to explain results, and to highlight any areas of potential vulnerability for the future. The issue which our other main public statement addresses is the inter-relationship of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) and the International Accounting Standards Committee. A quarter of the FTSE-100 companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and are therefore required to conform to Securities and Exchange Commission accounting and disclosure requirements for foreign registrants. Unless the UK accounting and securities bodies put their weight behind the development of truly international standards, and we persuade the US authorities to do likewise, then inevitably the corporate world will eventually adopt US standards. The need to gain access the US capital market is very important to large companies, but we do not wish the potential competitive and cost disadvantages of producing accounts in several different forms. Moreover, US standards do not always cater for our different circumstances and, in any event, are far from perfect as they reflect a substantial history of American commercial and legal experience. This issue may seem abstract, but it is likely to have some immediate effects. For example, we have worked closely with the ASB over the last two years to develop a sensible approach to accounting for goodwill. Most large companies, particularly in the service industries, find neither the immediate write-off of merger premiums nor the alternative of its subsequent amortisation to be sensible proposals. Whilst they represent current UK accounting practice, they do not produce balance sheets that reflect economic reality and can impede takeovers that are otherwise commercially sensible. Amortisation produces a double charge against earnings as most companies will spend money to maintain and enhance goodwill whilst writing it off. Despite this, my view is that larger UK companies will not support the alternative of 'ceiling tests' now being considered to avoid amortisation of goodwill unless there is evidence that other countries will follow. I believe that developing converging standards across boundaries will be a major debate during 1994. In setting standards we need to consider the 'art of the possible' and seek to achieve international consensus. Michael Lawrence is chairman of the 100 Group of Finance Directors</p>

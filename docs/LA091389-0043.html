			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. QUARANTINES DESERT AREA TO PROTECT TORTOISE  </P> <P> The federal Bureau of Land Management announced Tuesday a temporary emergency  quarantine of 37,700 acres in the western Mojave Desert to protect the area's  endangered desert tortoises.  </P> <P> The quarantine will prohibit access without bureau permission to the  18,000-acre Desert Tortoise Natural Area in Kern County, as well as desert and  mountain areas north of the tortoise habitat.  </P> <P> Bureau officials and environmental activists have said the presence of human  visitors has increased stress on the tortoises, whose population has declined  because of a respiratory disease and attacks by ravens. Federal officials  recently issued an emergency declaration temporarily designating the desert  tortoise an endangered species while studies continue on threats to the  reptile.  </P> <P> "We are facing drastic declines in desert tortoise populations in this critical  habitat," said Gerald Hillier, the bureau's California desert district manager.  "There are some indications that current activities within the area may be  raising the level of stress in the tortoises, thus making them more susceptible  to the disease."  </P> <P> The quarantine will take effect Oct. 1 and last as long as a year, officials  said. The BLM imposed the quarantine on 37,700 acres, rather than 65,000 acres  as originally proposed by an advisory group. That way, researchers can observe  how tortoises in areas that are off limits to humans are doing compared to  tortoises living in areas that are not restricted.  </P></p>

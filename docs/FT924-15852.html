			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Spanish minister accuses Moody's EUROPEAN financial tensions settled on Spain yesterday after Moody's announced a review of Madrid's credit rating amid renewed speculation about a peseta devaluation. The unrelieved strength of the D-Mark kept the peseta close to its ERM floor. The government denied rumours of another devaluation, but the peseta closed at Pta70.42 (39p), close to its ERM floor of Pta72.62. On the Madrid stock exchange investors ignored angry finance ministry rejections of Moody's decision, and drove the general index to its lowest level in six years. Mr Pedro Perez, secretary of state for the economy, said that Moody's had made an 'erroneous' appreciation of Spain's credit worthiness and that its conclusions were 'not based on reality'. On Wednesday night the US credit agency said it was reviewing a possible downgrade of the Kingdom of Spain's current AA2 rating because of the 'accumulation of imbalances' in the Spanish economy and the 'less favourable external environment'. Madrid's already depressed stock exchange tumbled yesterday and the index dropped 4.4 per cent, its biggest fall of the year, to close at 185 points. 'Moody's announcement was the last straw, all the market needed to wipe out confidence,' said Mr Peter Stephens of Barclays securities house in Madrid. The Bolsa index is now back to its August 1986 level, at the point where it stood before the market began to perform strongly on the back of Spain's entry into the EC earlier that year. Mr Perez said Moody's decision to review Spain's rating did not take account of recent moves - such as the 1993 budget which was unveiled this week - to rectify financial imbalances. 'They (Moody's) could not have analysed the budget in depth because they had not the time to do so,' he said. The 1993 budget, said by the government to be the toughest in 20 years, restricts central government spending increases to only 3.7 per cent - a fall in real terms. The tough budget is likely to push up unemployment next year by 300,000 to beyond the 3m level. The secretary of state implied that Moody's had confused Spain with Italy, whose rating was reduced by two points by the US agency last month. 'There is simply no point of comparison, in political terms or in terms of any economic ratio, between Spain and Italy,' Mr Perez said. Mr David Levey, head of Moody's sovereign risk unit, said it was not Moody's practise to debate public officials. 'We have announced a review, not a conclusion' Mr Levey said. 'We have pointed to fundamental areas of concern that are not determined by the details of a single budget.' Opening a debate in parliament yesterday on the ratification of the Maastricht treaty, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, said there was 'no cause and effect' between economic problems in Spain and the construction of Europe.</p>

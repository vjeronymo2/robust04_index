			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Kepco launch hampered by investor fatigue INVESTOR fatigue appeared to be hampering the launch yesterday of the first global bond offering by Korea Electric Power Company, South Korea's partially-privatised power utility. Lead manager Lehman Brothers said it had seen strong demand for Kepco's Dollars 1.35bn offering of 10-year global bonds following its international roadshow and that it had built up a large book of more than Dollars 1bn. However, Lehman Brothers acknowledged that other banks in the group were finding that their bond allocations were selling slowly. Syndicate managers in the group said that in some cases, investors who wanted to buy the bonds had placed their orders through Lehman Brothers. They noted that many investors had retreated to the sidelines and were reluctant to take on new investments so close to the end of the year. In addition, some investors were having to make credit decisions because of Kepco's single-A rating. As a result of the feedback from investors and the recent uncertainty in the US Treasury market, the yield spread on Kepco's bonds was set at around 90 basis points over 10-year Treasuries, up from a target of 75 to 80 basis points. The bonds are due to be priced today. If Kepco's bonds are priced at 90 basis points over US Treasuries, they will carry a coupon of about 6 1/2 per cent. Traders said this coupon should appeal to investors looking for high-yielding paper. Lehman Brothers expects about 65 per cent of the bonds to be placed in the US where Kepco is well-known as a result of its issues in the Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers. US investors tend to be more receptive than their European counterparts to borrowers with single-A ratings. The remainder of the bonds are likely to be placed equally in Europe and Asia Pacific. Elsewhere, there was a flood of new issuance in the Euroyen sector and in the Samurai market, the Japanese domestic bond market for foreign borrowers. The Bank of Greece raised Y100bn in the Samurai market through a Y40bn offering of four-year floating-rate notes and a Y60bn offering of 12-year bonds. Lead manager Nomura said the different maturities reflected funding needs. Syndicate managers at Japanese banks said they expected more yen-denominated issues to emerge before the end of the year since many borrowers believed that Japanese interest rates were close to the bottom of their cycle. A number of European sovereign borrowers are expected to tap this sector soon. The managers added that borrowers could achieve favourable terms in the yen market because Japanese investors were willing to pay a little more in order to avoid having any foreign exchange exposure.</p>

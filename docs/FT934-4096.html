			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Illumination from the past: Midland's chief executive, who will retire in March A recent cinema advertisement for a high street bank showed a Liverpudlian teenager enthusing about his job. About 43 years after Mr Brian Pearse joined Martins Bank in Liverpool as a 17-year-old he retains a similar enthusiasm for a calling that some people regard as in decline. Mr Pearse last week announced that he will retire as chief executive of Midland Bank in March. Since being brought in by the Bank of England to restore Midland's battered fortunes in March 1991 he has sometimes appeared the last advocate of an older, endangered style of high street banking. 'I would be very happy now to be appointed area manager of Kendal (in Cumbria) and be told that I had to stay there for the next 20 years. It is not because I want to be idle. It is a tremendous business with lots going on,' says the man who some expected to become Midland's chairman. It is not to be. HSBC Holdings - the company formed by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank after its takeover of Midland last year - has instead appointed Sir William Purves, its own chairman, to the post when Sir Peter Walters, the present incumbent, moves on with Mr Pearse next year. Some analysts question whether Mr Pearse's legacy is wholly safe in HSBC's hands. HSBC is known for its rigorous control of costs and use of technology. Of all Midland's assets, the Firstdirect telephone banking arm is the one that excited HSBC executives most on their first tour. Mr Pearse says telephone banking has proved far more attractive than Midland thought when in 1988 it put the whole UK market at 300,000 customers. Firstdirect alone had 400,000 customers by the middle of this year. But he remains cautious. 'It is a less personal approach than you get at a branch. You never speak to the same person twice,' he says. Such praise for branches is unfashionable as banks try to reduce the costs of their networks. But it is typical of Mr Pearse. Since his arrival from his previous post as finance director of Barclays - the bank which took over Martins - Midland has often marched in a contrary direction. This has emerged in two ways. Midland has been sceptical about using technology to replace human judgment. It has also re-established its branches as the point of contact for personal and corporate customers, while other banks have started dealing with businesses from area offices. Mr Pearse's background plays a strong part in the former. 'None of us got where we are today by just following the directions that are given to us. If you are a slavish devotee to the rules you never get anywhere. I have been trying to give people the confidence to spread their wings,' he says. In particular, Mr Pearse says that staff have to be allowed to override the impersonal scoring of credit to personal customers by computer. 'We had got to the point where someone was not allowed to turn a customer down whom the computer accepted. I mean, how daft can you get?' He reversed an earlier strategy of dividing customers between managers after an early branch visit. 'One man looked after retail, on the first floor was another who looked after small businesses, then there was another looking after large firms. They never talked to each other,' he says. This faith in rounded human judgment is not only unfashionable, it can be costly. Midland has a relatively high ratio of costs to income compared with other HSBC businesses. Mr Pearse says the way to solve this is to push more business through the network of branches and well-trained staff. He believes that this is the way to restore public faith and to woo customers. He is unhappy at the idea that service standards should be increasingly regulated under the banks' voluntary code of banking practice. 'The code is trying to define every single standard, and I think that is unfortunate. I wish we did not have one at all,' he says. 'We have got to the stage where people are saying that standards have dropped and customers should be protected, and as a banker I find that very sad.' The question for Midland is whether HSBC will maintain Mr Pearse's faith in branch banking traditions and human judgment. It could be tempted to experiment with technology in areas such as lending to small businesses, which is already centralised in its US retail banking subsidiary. Mr Pearse will have other things on his mind by then. He has earmarked youth unemployment as a project for his retirement. He says, 'I just want to stand back and see if there is any way in which I can help, because I am deeply disturbed by it.'</p>

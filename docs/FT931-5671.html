			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THIS WEEK'S strength in the stock index futures justified itself yesterday, when the underlying stock market rose sharply ahead of today's policy meeting at the Bundesbank, writes Terry Byland. The equity market did not wait for the futures to open but quickly took advantage of arbitrage opportunities later in the day. The March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index first traded at 2,912, responding to the overnight strength of Wall Street. It maintained the premium over cash at about 12 points, contrasting with the 4-point discount to the fair value calculation. Trading volume increased substantially in the March future, which saw 15,637 contracts change hands. At best, the contract touched 2,934, showing a 12-point premium against the day's high for the underlying index. This premium was held at the official close and the future made further progress in late dealings, being quoted at 2,936. Traded options were also busier, returning total volume of 35,468 lots, against 32,346. The greatest increase came in the FT-SE option, where business jumped from 4,986 to 14,726 contracts. The Euro FT-SE was also active, at 4,292 lots, with Tesco recording 2,108 contracts and Barclays, where the market is nervous ahead of the results and dividend statement, 1,995 lots. Selling of Guinness shares was reflected in activity in traded options.</p>

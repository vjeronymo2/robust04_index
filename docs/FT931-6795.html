			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Letter: Dearth of information on needs of manufacturing base Sir, May I congratulate you on starting your series on the decline of Britain's manufacturing base. It is research which is desperately needed if we are to put that decline into reverse. Unfortunately, the government does not appear to be concerned about the matter. May I refer you to the written question put down by Nigel Spearing MP (Newham South). The question was: 'To ask the president of the board of trade if he will list the manufactured products which ceased to be manufactured in the United Kingdom since 1980.' The answer from Tim Sainsbury, minister for industry, on Wednesday February 17 was: 'There are a number of sources of information on manufacturing products but none is sufficiently comprehensive to allow for an accurate answer.' Does that not say it all about this government and the president of the board of trade? They do not know how or even where to start on the vital process of rebuilding our manufacturing base. It would be laughable if it was not so tragic. Thousands of jobs are being lost in the industries which we so urgently need to rebuild Britain's wealth. Roger Lyons, general secretary, MSF, 64-66 Wandsworth Common Northside, London SW18 2SH</p>

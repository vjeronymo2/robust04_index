			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Smelly shoes get marching orders Smelly shoes will be controlled within five years under the new UK Environmental Protection Act, writes Daniel Green. The problem is not sweaty feet but solvent-based adhesives used to glue soles and uppers. The solvent escapes into the atmosphere during manufacture, contravening rules on emissions. Green alternatives have problems: hot melt adhesives require new and expensive specialised machinery, while traditional water-based glues slow the production line so the water can evaporate, and can fail when the shoe gets wet. Adhesives-maker Evode thinks it has come up with a solution. Its Aquadur footwear glue is a suspension in water rather than a solution so once it has set it resists water. A test batch of 100 dozen pairs of ladies shoes using Aquadur will go on sale at Marks and Spencer before Christmas. Evode: UK, 0785 57755.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> The German sculptor Eberhard Bosslet makes works from unaltered industrial  materials arranged with elegance and conceptual complexity. They separate from  current post modern objects intended to remind us that traditional art is dead.  On the contrary, Bosslet enlivens industrial detritus by subjecting it to the  rules of classical geometric art.  </P> <P> Bosslet arranges old file cabinet drawers so that they form three-dimensional  rectangles. Bits of blond raw wood act as physical and visual buffers between  drawers, tacky yellow industrial paint on facings acts as colored accents, and  mechanical grooves cast in the metal become pure pictorial devices. Held  together by flat metal strapping laced around drawers in equidistant bands, the  structures form Mondrian arrangements executed with a cultivated sensitivity to  chromatic and structural weights and balances.  </P> <P> He also composes tightly ordered, site specific "towers" that extend from the  gallery floor to the ceiling rafters via long metal tubes set on rough hewn  brick bases. Aping the look of weight bearing architecture, dotted with fake  bolts and fittings meticulously staged but having no function, the towers  address the myth of the machine, and force our awareness of the space they  occupy.  </P> <P> Bosslet's queer objects never escape superficial associations with totems,  sacred covenant arcs, secret maps, but at their core is a deeper interest in  the concept of ordered work in all its manifestations. Brick and metal suggest  the step by step drudgery of physical labor; file cabinets suggest bureaucratic  labor; while the labor of making art, Bosslet seems to say, involves literally  "pulling apart" the everyday and rearranging its components into some higher  order of information.

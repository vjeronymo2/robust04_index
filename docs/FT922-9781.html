			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Bruised, but back to battle for a dream - The changing fortunes of Hachette controller Jean-Luc Lagardere For someone who admitted yesterday he had suffered the worst setback in his career, the 64-year-old Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, French media and technology magnate, has bounced back surprisingly well. A visibly relieved Mr Lagardere announced that his big institutional backers had agreed to bail out Hachette, the leading French publishing group he controls, paving the way for him to realise a long-held dream: to merge Hachette with Matra, the defence, space, telecommunications and transport combine which he also controls. The merger will create a powerful FFr53bn diversified group, to be called Matra-Hachette. It will have 50,000 staff, and be among the French top 20 in turnover terms. Mr Lagardere likened it to General Electric, the US group whose interests range from aerospace to media and banking. The sales split will work out at 57 per cent from Hachette activities, and the remaining 43 per cent from Matra. There will be nine divisions: distribution, press, book publishing, audiovisual, telecommunications, defence, space, cars and transport. Mr Lagardere has persuaded his bankers to save Hachette from what must have been one of the most expensive peccadilloes in French corporate history. Moreover, he has - at a price  - gained secure control over the new group. Matra-Hachette will be controlled by a holding group, MMB Holding, which will have two managing partners: Mr Lagardere himself, plus Arjil, a family-controlled holding group managed by senior Hachette and Matra executives. Of course, he has paid heavily for the rescue. Mr Lagardere's direct and indirect stakes in the holding group will nearly halve from 19 per cent to around 10 per cent as a result of the deal. It is likely that from now on, the institutions involved will exert strong control over at least the financial management. 'They could have put Hachette into bankruptcy three months ago, so they really have strong negotiating power. Now they will want to see some repayments, and if they want that, they will have to change the way the group is managed,' says Mr Francois Langlade Demoyen, head of research at Credit Suisse First Boston France. Mr Lagardere insists that a commandite structure is quite compatible with modern demands for quoted companies to be open and transparent, and that the partners are kept under the pressure of market forces by knowing they are personally liable for all the group's debts. 'It is the only opportunity for us to remain independent,' he admits. 'But it's not a blank cheque.' Mr Lagardere, a perpetually tanned sports enthusiast, turned to a boxing metaphor to describe his position. 'I have been forced to put my knee to the ground and people have said that I am KO'd. I say 'no'. I am lifting myself up quickly to attack the 12th round, not just to finish the match, but to go on the offensive, to win.' This would, he admitted, be his final bout, but he would at least be able to pass on the fight with 'complete success'. Who the new boss will be, when Mr Lagardere hangs up his gloves, is still a mystery. Mr Lagardere made no secret yesterday of the fact that he would like to hand on to his only son, Arnaud, 30, who is currently running a small venture capital unit attached to a bank in the Lagardere empire. However, the banks will of course have a strong influence on the succession. Whether the merger will make any practical difference to the fortunes of Matra and Hachette is a matter of intense scepticism among stockbroking analysts, who do not understand how a successful company can be born by shunting together two troubled ones. Indeed, the initial reaction from brokers in Paris yesterday was that Matra would, if anything, suffer from being hitched to its cash-hungry partner, and that Hachette would benefit from tighter management imposed by the banks. Hachette, the world's fifth largest communications group and the largest newspaper distributor, lost FFr1.9bn last year - its first deficit in a decade - because of La Cinq's collapse, and will still have FFr5.8bn of debts after the refinancing. Matra, which has no debts, saw its net profits collapse from FFr605m to FFr252m in 1991. Mr Lagardere argues that together they will be stronger than alone: that cash will be able to circulate freely where needed; greater diversification will even out sharp swings in earnings; and administrative economies will be possible. The greater size and stability of the new group should also make it more appealing to foreign partners, who in recent years have been an important part of Mr Lagardere's strategy in defence and electronics. Matra's telecommunications division is, for example, within weeks of sealing an alliance with a 'leading world group', he said. So the initial picture is that Mr Lagardere's banking friends have helped him save face. Yet just how much control he personally will have over Matra-Hachette will depend on the highly sensitive negotiations between him and the banks over the next few months.</p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Monday Interview: M'learned friend's tough brief - Michael Howard, UK employment secretary In his short ministerial life, Mr Michael Howard has played many parts, all to mixed reviews. He piloted the Financial Services Bill through the Commons with great technical skill, but some think without much real feel for the task in hand. He was responsible for the poll tax legislation, about which no more need be said; and he ran water privatisation, eventually to acclaim, although at one point it looked as if his own career might not prosper as a result. Now, only eight years after becoming an MP, he is employment secretary as unemployment has crashed through the 2m barrier for the second time since the Tories took office in 1979. It is difficult to ruffle Mr Howard. He spent the years between 1970, when he failed for a second time to capture Liverpool Edge Hill, and 1983 when he won the safe-ish seat of Folkestone and Hythe, building up his reputation at the Bar. Once he has taken a brief, he does not easily yield; colleagues report that following Mrs Thatcher's demise, he remained one of the cabinet's staunchest poll tax diehards. But people say Mr Howard is a briefcase carrier rather than a gut politician; that he is clever but lacks conviction or passion and that he has never had an original political thought in his life. At the first charge, one detects a modest stirring of Welsh blood - the son of a dress-shop owner, he went to Llanelli Grammar School. 'I care deeply and passionately about people, about issues and about the future of this country,' he says. But to the second charge, he pleads guilty. 'I'm not sure you would find all that many practising politicians who can lay claim to original ideas. I think the art of politics is selecting the best of the ideas which originally were thought of by those not active in politics and making an assessment whether they will work and achieve the result you wish to achieve.' Before the interview, his office said he had written no political pamphlets; a fact which turns out not to be quite correct. He has in fact co-authored two: one about the economy with his old friend Norman Lamont - Howard was best man at the chancellor's wedding  - and the other, improbably, with Mr Julian Critchley advancing the case of the East African Asians. He is due to publish one solo this week but it is just a rehash of Central Office nostrums. It is not hard to identify the badge on Mr Howard's philosophical cap. He pays homage to Iain Macleod; but above all, remains loyal to the founders of Thatcherism. 'I think we have established the tramlines along which we intend to travel; they were established during the last 12 years,' he says. One aim of this interview is to find out whether the Thatcherite Mr Howard, surrounded by his paintings of the Battle of Blenheim, envisages any change in employment policy in the light of the change at Number 10. His straight answer to this question is an uncompromising 'No. My agenda was clearly set when I arrived here.' At the top was and is training. He has had the task of implementing the blueprint to create 82 employer-led and dominated Training and Enterprise Councils across the land. 'I can speak for a very long time about this,' he says menacingly, having already spoken for several minutes about this 'very exciting initiative'. It is indeed an important, if last-gasp attempt to smarten up Britain's bedraggled training system, by handing the task to committees led on a part-time basis by top local businessmen. He admits no doubt about the sustainability of the approach, although he says he is frequently tested in his determination to stick to the principle that the businessmen involved must be of chief operating officer grade, rather than, say, personnel directors. 'I remain of the view that it's right to stick to these demanding criteria,' he says. He is also not impressed with the other grumbles Tec chairman vent in private. He thinks the Tecs are on target to deliver their guaranteed levels of performance and that they should work through the current financial year before he considers any further change to their freedom to shift funds from one area of work to another. The Tecs, says Mr Howard, already have more financial and operating flexibility than any comparable body, something which has made them richly inventive. On the future of trades union law, he is elusive. Having suggested early in his term of office that the Thatcher decade had completed the job, he now appears to be wavering. 'We keep it under review and we must always look to see whether there's a need for further change in the law. Some recent developments, such as the episode of the NUM (the Scargill financial controversy), have clearly indicated that the law needs attention, but we haven't reached any decisions yet on what the manifesto should say.' Among the issues he has in mind are the powers of union certification officers, the penalties for improper accounting and access by members to their unions' financial affairs. The government's biggest problem in the employment area, however, continues to be excessive wage pressure during a period of disinflation. He is scornful of suggestions that some move towards a national economic assessment or co-ordinated pay bargaining might have a role, sticking to the Thatcherite dictum: 'Locally devolved pay bargaining is likely to be the most effective.' The creation of a pay review body for the teachers was, he insists, a special case. 'I don't see that as a precursor for a profusion of review bodies in other areas.' Assuming that Mr Howard continues to speak for his party on these matters, that suggests a potentially widening gap with a Labour party committed to a minimum wage, upon which subject Mr Howard adopts his most practised silk's scorn for a piece of bogus court-room evidence. He appears to harbour no fear that the public mood is moving against him in this area. Nor, however, does he have a convincing explanation as to why this attitude should not be applied to wages councils, which set minimum wages for 2.5m workers in certain sectors. 'We see no permanent place for wages councils in our system,' he says, but declines to say when the fox will be shot. He has been asked so often what it feels like to preside over another outbreak of mass unemployment that the answers are cut and tucked into sound bites; Britain still has below average unemployment in Europe etc. The government's job, he says, is to persist with the right, firm financial framework and to take the consequences. That is what he means, he says, when he talks about the relentless, practical struggle over many years to apply the chosen political philosophy. It is only when we turn to Europe that there is a sign of the Majoresque emollience. Mr Howard, like his former boss, enjoyed playing rough on Europe, once accusing Ms Vasso Papandreou, the social affairs commissioner, of bringing the Community into disrepute. On the day that Mrs Thatcher resigned, officials in Mrs Papandreou's directorate were jubilant at the thought that it might mean the end of Mr Howard. Today, however, his tone is softer. He always used to say that one third of the social charter was totally unacceptable, a third possibly negotiable and a third, mainly that pertaining to health and safety, fine. Now, he says, 'it looks as though a dozen out of 50 proposals are likely to be unacceptable', although it remains unclear which of these will be determined by qualified majority and therefore leave Britain out-voted. 'We have done quite well so far, but there's no guarantee that we shall be able to construct the necessary minority on all the proposals.' The more mellow atmosphere, he says, stems partly from a deal he struck with Ms Papandreou earlier this year, when she agreed that draft directives would be shown to member governments before publication and when she agreed to accept additional help to improve the so-called 'impact statements' evaluating the costs and consequences of proposed measures. He must, one imagines, be a formidable opponent in EC ministerial councils. He does his homework, enjoys detail and displays no self-doubt about fundamentals. He has missed only one such council, which took place at the height of the leadership election, when he was doing his lonely best to ensure that Mrs Thatcher fought on. Now she has gone, he will not say whether he thinks the party's chances of election victory have increased or diminished. Personal intimations of mortality were delivered in the recent local council elections, when Folkestone was lost to the Liberal Democrats. Indeed, he makes little of the much discussed change of style at Number 10, preferring instead to laud another of the new prime minister's qualities. 'It's determination that matters,' he says, 'battling.' Personal File 1941 Born south Wales.

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / House price fall accelerates HOUSE prices fell 4.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year following the reimposition of stamp duty on house purchases and Britain's exit from the exchange rate mechanism, Halifax Building Society said yesterday. Halifax, the UK's largest building society, said in its quarterly index that prices fell much faster in the last quarter than in the previous two. It said much of the fall came in September as buyers' confidence was damaged by the devaluation and the reimposition of stamp duty. The biggest quarterly fall came in the East Midlands, where house prices fell by 7 per cent. In the south-east, prices fell 5.9 per cent, taking the fall in the average house price in the region to Pounds 31,800 in the past three years. In the year to December, UK house prices fell 7.8 per cent on average, compared with a fall of 3.5 per cent in the same period of 1991 and a rise of 0.5 per cent in 1990. The peak of house prices nationally was in July 1989. The Halifax said house prices in East Anglia were now almost a third down on the region's peak level in the fourth quarter of 1988, while prices in the rest of the south had fallen to between 25 per cent and 30 per cent below the peak. The society said that although the housing market remained weak in the fourth quarter, there had been evidence of more interest towards the end of the year as prices became more affordable. It said the increase in interest should be reflected in higher numbers of house purchases this year, which would also be boosted by a more general increase in confidence as the economy started to grow again. It predicted that house prices would stabilise in the spring and then show some increase in the second half of the year, giving way to a sustained recovery next year. The society's Halifax Property Services estate agency subsidiary said that most agents had been 'pleasantly surprised' by business in December.</p>

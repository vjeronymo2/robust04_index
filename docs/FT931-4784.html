			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / NTT shares soar on call rate hopes NIPPON Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) saw its share price surge by more than 10 per cent yesterday on comments made by a Posts and Telecommunications official suggesting that the telecommunications group may be allowed to increase rates charged for calls from public telephones. Mr Futoshi Shirai, director general of the telecommunications bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, said yesterday that it would be easier for the ministry to accept an increase in public call-box charges as these could be considered separately from other telephone rates. The comments added to a recent surge of interest in NTT shares which has lifted the issue's price by 28.5 per cent in the past eight trading days. The issue has been actively pursued after NTT announced plans to propose call charge increases to the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry. Yesterday NTT closed Y75,000 higher at Y780,000 (Pounds 4,600). Mr Shirai indicated that the ministry would consider favourably NTT's planned application for the increase in call-box rates for two specific reasons. First, unlike the situation in most other countries, public call-box rates in Japan are the same as those charged for calls made from the home. Secondly, NTT has been covering the loss it makes on public telephone calls with sales of telephone cards but this is expected to fall in the future as the market for telephone cards becomes saturated. The increase is likely to take the form of a shorter call time for each Y10 coin used.</p>

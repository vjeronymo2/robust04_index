			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH NO.1 SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> For the first half of its game against Santa Monica College, the Glendale  basketball team was clinging to Coach Brian Beauchemin's maxim -- a young,  inexperienced team can upset a better team.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros are all first-year players. Santa Monica has seven returning  players from a team that was 27-8 last season.  </P> <P> But as evidenced by his play Wednesday night, Santa Monica forward Keith  Amerson does not subscribe to Beauchemin's theory.  </P> <P> Amerson scored 12 of his career-high 28 points in the second half as the  Corsairs overcame a one-point halftime deficit to win, 85-71, at Glendale.  </P> <P> "They are just too strong," Beauchemin said of Santa Monica (26-3, 11-0), which  has won 14 consecutive games and is ranked No. 1 in the state. "And we didn't  do ourselves any favors by not executing what we were supposed to do."  </P> <P> What the Vaqueros were supposed to do was surgically dismantle Santa Monica's  full-court press. At times, however, it looked as though the Vaqueros' hands  had been surgically removed.  </P> <P> Glendale had little difficulty handling the Corsairs' halfcourt defense, but  when Santa Monica ran the 2-1-2 press the Vaqueros needed 911.  </P> <P> And Amerson wasted little time in capitalizing on Glendale's miscues. He had  three steals in the first five minutes and scored 10 of Santa Monica's first 14  points.  </P> <P> Trailing, 27-20, with five minutes to play in the half, the Vaqueros mounted a  12-4 rally that was sparked by three-point baskets by Dave Swanson and Gary  Fowler. Bruce Heicke made two free throws with two seconds to play, giving  Glendale a 32-31 lead at intermission.  </P> <P> At which point Amerson and teammate DeShawn Pullard held a conversation.  </P> <P> "He told me that whenever he saw a guy on my back he'd bounce it to me so I  could take it to the hole," said Amerson, who lives with Pullard. "He knows how  I play and I know him, so that's a plus."  </P> <P> Pullard was true to his word and fed Amerson in the paint for six points in a  row to open the second half. The Corsairs, who earlier had missed several easy  shots in the key, began to click and outscored Glendale, 22-6, in the first  eight minutes of the second half. Santa Monica led, 63-44, with 8:31 to play  and was long gone.  </P> <P> Fowler led Glendale with 15 points. Heicke added 11 and Swanson, Alex Berry and  Tony Lopez each scored 10.  </P> <P> "Hopefully this won't happen next year," Beauchemin said. "Because right now  I'm miserable."  </P></p>

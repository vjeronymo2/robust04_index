Russia Intends To Enlist the  Support of All Parties to the Karabakh Conflict"]    [Text] On 12 January, Ambassador at Large Vladimir  Kazimirov, the Russian Federation president's special envoy,  ended his two-day talks in Baku; he discussed with the  Azerbaijan leadership the situation in the Armenian-Azerbaijan  conflict area and the prospects for continuing Moscow's  mediation efforts. The republic's presidential press service  said that the meeting between the Russian diplomat and President  Geydar Aliyev was held behind closed doors. It is noteworthy  that in the run-up to the visit to Baku, Kazimirov went to  Tehran where he sought to enlist the support of President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani over the issue of Russia's peacemaking  mission in the region.    At the same time, no attempts are forthcoming from Moscow to  coordinate its steps in resolving the Karabakh crisis with  Ankara. This suggests that the Russian Federation leadership is  aware of Iran's growing role in the region. Characteristically,  at present Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia are seeking close  cooperation with Tehran. Yerevan has not abandoned hope that  the Armenian-Azerbaijan talks on the construction of a gas  pipeline, which have been going on for more than one year now,  will be concluded by this spring with the signing of a protocol  whereby the Iranian side will begin deliveries of natural gas to  Armenia.    On the other hand, the administration of President Geydar  Aliyev warns Tehran against such a step because after resolving  its energy problems, Armenia may intensify its military pressure  on Azerbaijan. Baku avoids any rash moves that could complicate  its relations with Tehran. This apparently accounts for  Aliyev's refusal to approve the proposal by the Russia border  troops command on stationing Russian border guards on the border  with Iran. Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, who  visited Tehran, assured the Iranian leadership that Azerbaijan  is opposed to the construction of an "iron curtain" on the  border with Iran. The absence of a common border between  Azerbaijan and the Nakhichevan autonomous area also makes the  republic dependent on Iran. In a recent offensive by the  Azerbaijan Army in the south the strategic and transportation  center of Goradiz was captured, and now it has again become  possible to use Iranian territory to ship major cargoes from  Azerbaijan to Nakhichevan.    Russia's interest in cooperation with Iran on the issue of  peacemaking efforts in the Transcaucasus is most likely linked  with its aspiration to prevent a possible intervention by Tehran  in the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict and thus to prevent that  war's internationalization. It cannot be ruled out that  Kazimirov has sought to obtain clarifications from the Iranian  side as to whether the Afghan mujahidin have really been  recently transferred across Iranian territory to Azerbaijan.  Baku, as is known, categorically denies this information.    The severe fighting that is going on today between Armenian  and Azerbaijan formations occurs mostly in direct proximity to  the Iranian border. The Azerbaijan Defense Ministry has  announced that approximately 40 km of the Azerbaijan-Iran border  has been won back from the Armenian side. The Armenian side  therefore now controls some 120 km of territory.    The Azerbaijan side so far refrains from continuing  offensive  operations, but reports from military sources leave no doubt  that in the next few days an attempt will be made to liberate  the districts of Dzhebrail, Agdam, Fizuli, and Kelbadzhar,  occupied by Armenia. Geydar Aliyev has entrusted the preparation  of this operation to Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Bayramov, who  has been appointed the defense minister's aide on combat  operations. So far, according to the same sources, the Armenian  Defense Ministry is hastily moving additional forces to the area  to create a second defense echelon.</p>

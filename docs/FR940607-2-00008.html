Petitioner filed supplements to the petition on May 23 and 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, petitioner alleges that imports of disposable pocket lighters from the PRC and Thailand are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that such imports are materially injuring, or threatening material injury to, a U.S. industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner states that it has standing to file the petition because the BIC Corporation is an interested party, as defined under section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and it is the sole domestic producer of disposable pocket lighters. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, it should file a written notification with the assistant Secretary for Import Administration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Products covered by these investigations are disposable pocket lighters, whether or not liquefied hydrocarbon, or a mixture containing any of these, whose vapor pressure at 75 degrees fahrenheit (24 degrees celsius) exceeds a gage pressure of 15 pounds per square inch. Non-refillable pocket lighters are imported under subheading 9613.10.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). Refillable, disposable pocket lighters would be imported under subheading 9613.20.0000. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written descriptions of the scope of these proceedings are dispositive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price and Foreign Market Value_The People's Republic of China <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner based United States Price (``USP'') on a 1994 sale made on a packed, c.i.f., duty-paid, delivered basis to a U.S. purchaser of disposable pocket lighters from the PRC. Petitioner deducted ocean freight, marine insurance, commission, harbor maintenance fee, and customs processing fee from this price to arrive at an f.o.b. value for the imports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner contends that the foreign market value (``FMV'') of disposable pocket lighters subject to this investigation must be determined in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, which concerns non-market economy (``MNE'') countries. The Department has determined the PRC to be an NME, within the meaning of section 771(18)(A) of the Act, in previous cases ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sebacic Acid from the PRC, May 31, 1994 (59 FR 28053)). In accordance with 771(18)(C) of the Act, that determination continues to apply for purposes of this initiation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the course of this investigation, parties will have the opportunity to address this NME determination and provide relevant information and argument on this issue. In addition, parties will have the opportunity in this investigation to submit comments on whether FMV should be based on prices or costs in the PRC consistent with section 773(c)(1)(B) of the Act ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Amendment to Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Amendment to Antidumping Duty Order: Chrome-Plated Lug Nuts from the People's Republic of China, 57 FR 15052 (April 24, 1992)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this case, petitioner provided two alternative approaches for determining FMV. In the first approach, in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, petitioner attempted to base FMV on the NME producers' factors of production valued in a market economy country at a comparable level of economic development. Petitioner, however, was unable to obtain information on the factors of production in the PRC. Therefore, petitioner used its own factors of production. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In valuing the factors or production, petitioner used India and Pakistan as surrogate countries. For purposes of this invitation, we have accepted India and Pakistan as surrogates because their economies are at a level of development comparable to the PRC's. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Memorandum to David L. Binder, Director-Division II, Office of Antidumping Investigations from David P. Mueller, Director, Office of Policy, dated August 1993, regarding non-market economy status and surrogate country selection, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the Department of Commerce.) Also, there is evidence on the record that India is a producer of comparable merchandise, as required by section 773(c)(4) of the Act. When cost information was not available in either of these countries, petitioner valued the factor using its own costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 773(c)(1)(B) of the Act, petitioner's FMV consisted of the sum of values assigned to materials, labor, energy, and overhead. Petitioner adjusted certain factor values for inflation. Pursuant to section 773(e)(1) of the Act, petitioner added to the labor and material costs, and general expenses, the statutory minimum of eight percent for profit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

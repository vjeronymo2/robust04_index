			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 8 Feb (AFP) -- The Council of  State, Colombia's highest administrative litigation court, this  Tuesday asked the House investigative commission and the  Attorney General's Office to investigate President Cesar Gaviria  concerning the presence of U.S. troops in the country.    The Court's believes that the head of state could have  violated the Constitution by authorizing the arrival of foreign  soldiers in Colombian territory without consulting the Council  of State or the Senate, so it requested an investigation.    The issue refers to the 5 January arrival of 150 U.S.  military engineers in Juanchaco on Colombia's Pacific coast with  the declared purpose of building a school and health center and  renovating some roads.    The presence of U.S. soldiers in this area and in Meta  Department, where radar installations were erected, as well as  the constant passage of vessels and military aircraft through  Colombian territory gave rise to a heated debate and heightened  arguments among candidates during the electoral campaign.    In light of the situation, the Council of State asked for an  explanation from the president, who last week submitted an  extensive document, based on which the Court issued the  following pronouncement adopted unanimously following a  five-hour session:    "1. The government has at no point asked for an opinion to  permit the transit and permanence of foreign troops as well as  foreign vessels and aircraft in the national territory in  accordance with the provisions of Articles 189 and 237 of the  Political Constitution.    ``2. In light of the Constitution, it does not find  convincing the explanations given by the government on the  decisions it has made concerning this matter, because the  interpretation of the text of the same and the treaties and  agreements signed by Colombia is opposed to the letter and the  spirit of the Political Constitution and violates national  sovereignty.    ``3. From the same explanations, it can be deducted that the  Senate did not grant the permission established by Article 173  of the Constitution.    ``4. Given the situation that has arisen, it believes that  U.S. military troops, vessels, and aircraft are in Colombian  territory without fulfilling with the requisites set forth in  the Constitution.    ``5. According to Article 9 of the Constitution, the  president of the Republic is responsible for the foreign  relations of the Colombian State with absolute respect for  national sovereignty.    ``Consequently, it is unusual that the president says that  the minister of defense gave the authorization without his  previous knowledge when the memorandum of understanding signed  by said minister with the U.S. ambassador on 29 October 1993  establishes that they are acting with 'due authorization from  their respective governments'.''    It should be noted that the last Colombian president  investigated by the House was former General Gustavo Rojas  Pinilla in 1958. Rojas had assumed power in a coup d'etat five  years earlier.</p>

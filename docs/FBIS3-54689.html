The matters concerning the ways of Azeri and, in prospect,  Kazakhstani oil to Europe has yet to be considered. Russia  suggests that oil should be shipped to the Black Sea's port of  Novorossiysk and then by tankers to Europe. However, Turkey  disagrees saying that this variant is oecologically dangerous.    "We can not put at stake ten-million Stambul city", said the  Ambassador Karamanoglu.    Turkey as well as a number of the countries suggest that  Azeri oil should be shipped to the port of Iskenderun  (Mediterranean Sea) through the oil pipe-line and then by  tankers to Europe. Azerbaijan insists on laying the pipe-line  through Iran, Nakhichevan and Turkey.</p>

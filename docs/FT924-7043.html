			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Earnings at Larsen and Toubro surge ahead PROFITS of Larsen and Toubro, India's largest engineering company, surged in the first half, contrary to the trend of falling corporate profits among other Indian companies. Net profits advanced to Rs566m (Dollars 19.9m) for the six months to the end of September, from Rs490.4m a year earlier, on sales one fifth ahead at Rs9.4bn compared with Rs7.89bn. The group, which manufactures plant and equipment for anything from dairies to the nuclear power industry, said it was swamped with orders as Indian companies rushed to buy locally manufactured plant which became cheaper than imports after devaluation of the rupee in February. Larsen and Toubro's order book rose in the past 12 months by 70 per cent to Rs15.36bn from Rs9.05bn. The orders include building, for the first time in the country's history, four well platforms costing Rs4bn for the Oil and Natural Gas Commission, the Indian state-owned oil corporation, as well as widening the state highway in Orissa, a dairy plant in Gujarat, a hospital in Sikkim and upgrading a hydro-electric project in Nepal. Looking to the rest of the year, the directors said: 'The company expects to produce good results,' though they did not forecast any figures. The group expects to invest at least Rs30bn over the next five years, including Rs16.5bn on the first phase of an alumina project in the eastern state of Orissa. It also plans to triple cement output from 2.2m tonnes to more than 6.0m tonnes within three years. The company was started in Bombay by two enterprising Danes, Mr Holk Larsen and Mr Soren Toubro, during the second world war.</p>

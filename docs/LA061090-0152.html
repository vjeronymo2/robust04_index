			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERCHANT IVORY: THERE'S ROOM FOR THEIR VIEW  </P> <P> The films of Indian producer Ismail Merchant, California-born director James  Ivory and their writer, the German-born novelist Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, are  almost invariably literary adaptations, witty and intimate, and reflect their  own cross-cultural sensibilities.  </P> <P> The partners are indeed expert at deceptively gentle depictions of cultural  confrontations that reverberate quietly with implications. Most of their best  films have been made in India, yet their most popular picture, the 1986  adaptation of E.M. Forster's "A Room With a View," was made in England and  Florence. Their company has had a few failures, but its many successes are  marked by an uncommon sophistication, civility and intelligence.  </P> <P> In 1961, Merchant and Ivory contacted Jhabvala in Delhi with the hope of  persuading her to let them make a film of her novel "The Householder." Not only  did she agree but adapted it to the screen herself, thus marking the beginning  of a writing-producing-directing team that endures to this day. Preceding the  June 29 opening of their latest picture, the detective comedy "The Perfect  Murder," the Monica 4-Plex will present a two-week retrospective of 14 Merchant  Ivory films (not all of which were written by Jhabvala or directed by Ivory).  </P> <P> The retrospective commences with "The Europeans" (Friday), their exquisite 1979  film of the Henry James novel that concerns the impact of Europeans and  Americans of the mid-19th Century upon each other. A gallant and radiant Lee  Remick stars as a determined husband hunter. "Quartet" (Saturday), their 1982  film of Jean Rhys' delicately wrought 1928 novel, captures well the brittle,  intense atmosphere of Rhys' Bohemian, cafe society of the '20s and much of her  insight, if not quite a full measure of her rigor. Elegant and wry, it is an  embittered, impassioned expression of a woman (Isabelle Adjani) at the mercy of  her emotions and impoverished state.  </P> <P> Their 1987 "Maurice" (next Sunday) is a well-nigh flawless account of a  conventional upper-middle-class young man (James Wilby, wonderfully unaffected)  coming to terms with his homosexuality in Edwardian England. It is based on  E.M. Forster's posthumously published 1913 novel.  </P> <P> In bringing John Masters's novel "The Deceivers" (June 18) to the screen for  Merchant Ivory, director Nicholas Meyer and writer Michael Hirst took an  all-too-reverent approach to this old-fashioned adventure, which finds Pierce  Brosnan going native to expose the murderous thuggee cult in 1820s India.  </P> <P> Merchant Ivory's 1965 "Shakespeare Wallah" (June 19) helped establish their  international reputation. It's a charming tale in which a playboy (Shashi  Kapoor) becomes caught between his mistress, an exotic idol of the Indian  cinema (Madhur Jaffrey), and an English actress (Felicity Kendal) who tours  India with her parents' seedy Shakespearean company. In the 1971 "Bombay  Talkie" (June 20), another key early film, Ivory and Jhabvala delineate with  thoroughness and compassion the ill-fated meeting of a hard-edged, tempestuous  best-selling novelist (Jennifer Kendal) and a Bombay movie star (Kapoor), whose  popularity is beginning to slip.  </P> <P> For his first American film, Ivory forsook the distinctive delicacy of his  Indian films to create in the 1973 "Savages" (June 21) a thunderingly tedious  allegory about how thin the veneer of civilization can be; the setting is a  bizarre house party between the World Wars. It's not unlike the current "The  Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover."  </P> <P> Ivory's latest release, the 1989 "Slaves of New York" (June 22), which Tama  Janowitz adapted from her book of trendy, slight short stories, is also  peculiar: a shallow, boring business about arty loft-living lowlifes in which  Janowitz's messy, unfettered savagery tends to overwhelm Ivory. A miscast  Bernadette Peters stars.  </P> <P> The airy, delectable 1986 Merchant-Ivory-Jhabvala adaptation of "A Room With a  View" (June 23) is perfection itself, a virtually irresistible tale of the  flowering of a deceptively demure Edwardian young lady (Helena Bonham-Carter)  whose transformation begins in Florence when she witnesses a bloody and random  act of violence. Daniel Day-Lewis is a hoot as Bonham-Carter's insufferably  priggish fiance.  </P> <P> The 1983 "Heat and Dust" (June 24) draws us into a treacherous, precarious  world of vanished splendor, that of royal India under British rule during the  '20s. Our pretty, witty heroine (captivating Greta Scacchi, then a newcomer),  however, is not the typical colonial wife, for she possesses a dangerous streak  of recklessness. Merchant-Ivory-Jhabvala have weighed down their story  needlessly but not fatally with a present-day framing story that has Julie  Christie coming to India to discover what she can about Scacchi, who had been  her scandalously romantic great-aunt.  </P> <P> The troubled-plagued "Wild Party" (June 25) seemed a garbled, garish variation  on the Fatty Arbuckle legend when released by American International in 1975.  Starring James Coco, Raquel Welch and Perry King, it now will be presented for  the first time in Merchant Ivory's uncut version. "The Bostonians" (June 26) is  a splendid adaptation of the Henry James novel in which a rich, starchy Vanessa  Redgrave takes in tow lovely Madeleine Potter, enlisting her in the struggle  for women's suffrage but unexpectedly confronted by a suitor (Christopher  Reeve) in ardent pursuit of her ward.  </P> <P> The delightful 1977 "Roseland" (June 27) is composed of three vignettes set in  Manhattan's venerable ballroom of that name; the Roseland of the film is a  magnet for all generations of lonely people. In the large cast are Teresa  Wright, Geraldine Chaplin and Christopher Walken.  </P> <P> Concluding the series is the very first Merchant-Ivory-Jhabvala collaboration,  "The Householder" (June 28). It's a modest 1963 domestic comedy involving an an  ineffectual, underpaid schoolteacher (Kapoor), his rebellious bride (Leela  Naidu) and his self-pitying mother (Durga Khote). For showtimes: (213)  394-9741.  </P></p>

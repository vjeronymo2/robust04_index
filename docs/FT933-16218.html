			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: The new Gas man cometh The impending retirement of Mr Robert Evans leaves British Gas looking for a new chairman at a difficult time. No one is likely to accept the post while the company is in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's star chamber. But, assuming that British Gas survives more or less intact, the matter cannot be left much longer. At present the company has not said whether it is looking for a non-executive figurehead or someone to take a more active role, though the appointment of Mr Cedric Brown as chief executive implies the former. Mr Brown is an able engineer who seems to realise that the company's sleepy culture must change, and he is tackling the excessive cost base of the company. It was also unfortunate that he has had to take over at such a difficult time. Yet the company's response to the MMC inquiry has been for the most part reactive and unfocused. It has given little impression of the kind of company it would like to be, save that its critics are wrong and it should be left as it stands. British Gas needs a more coherent vision of its future and its priorities. It also needs an advocate who is able to explain that strategy clearly. A strong chairman from outside the gas industry might bring these skills, particularly if he were to work with Mr Brown on a full-time basis. That might also help blow some more fresh air through the company's still-musty corridors. Given his breezy approach, experience in the oil industry and the City, and now that his labours at Eurotunnel are almost over, perhaps Sir Alistair Morton might be persuaded to take the chair?</p>

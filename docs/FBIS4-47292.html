Vavilov''; UDC 535.317.6]    [Abstract] Retouch of surfaces for compensation of  aberrations in real optical systems producing a diffractional  image is considered, the r.m.s. error of residual wavefront  aberrations at some point of the field being serving as the  criterion of compensation quality at that point. The problem is  to minimize the functional &PSgr;= (1/m)_s_[RMS](i)[.sup]2[/]  (i= 1,...,m) representing the integral compensation quality  criterion. The problem is solved for an objective with wave  aberrations W[.sub]i[/](x,y) at points i= 1,...,m and their  decrement _D_W[.sub]i[/](x,y) as a result of retouch at these  points in the (x,y) plane. For simplicity but without loss of  generality, all mean aberrations and their mean decrements are  assumed to be zero in the pupil. The retouch profile is  represented by a set of analytical functions, preferably  polynomial power functions with coefficients  _a_[.sub]1,...,n[/]. An exact numerical solution is very  laborious, especially so because the light rays must be tracked  through a system with nonaxisymmetric errors of surface  treatment. Applying the theory of small perturbations is shown  to simplify the problem and an ``approximate optimization'' in  accordance with that theory is proposed, the necessary condition  for functional &PSgr; to be zero being that its all its partial  derivatives with respect to coefficients _a_[.sub]j[/] (j=  1,...,n) be zero. This condition &PSgr;/_a_[.sub]j[/] (j=   1,...,n) yields a system of m integrodifferential equations, a  zero sum of m surface integrals, which is solved by seeking  _D_W[.sub]0[/] as a series in linearly-independent function  _ps_[.sub]k[/] (k= 1,...n. The algorithms of  compensation by retouch calculations according to this method  have been programmed for an IBM -PC/AT computer, the RETOUCH  program consisting of five steps: 1) calculating the profile of  axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric retouch, 2) representing the  results in the form of tables and on graphs, 3) evaluating and  analyzing the residual aberrations, 4) prediction of the  contrast at all points where interferograms have been processed  and estimating the effectiveness of retouch, 5) filing the  retouch profile in the form of a two-dimensional power  polynomial in the INTERF program format. The procedure is  demonstrated on a high-resolution objective. Figures 1; tables  1; references 3.</p>

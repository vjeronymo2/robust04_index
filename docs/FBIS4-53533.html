			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Far-Fetched Argument for Sinister Purpose" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The North side in recent  telephone messages respectfully requested the South Korean Red  Cross to immediately send back to the North Kim In-so and Ham  Se-hwan, prisoners of war and unconverted long-term prisoners,  and take measures to allow the children of Kim Pyong-chu, an  unconverted prisoner who died a few years ago, including the  eldest daughter Kim Chi-hyon suffering from a serious disease,  to come to the North to receive medical treatment and be  protected in their livelihood.    The South side, however, has taken no positive measure for  the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, arguing that they  do not belong to the category of prisoners of war, and blindly  turns down the request as regards Kim Chi-hyon.    It is self-evident that this is a far-fetched argument for a  sinister purpose, directed by the South Korean authorities  behind the scene, says NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today.    The news analyst says:    The argument that Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan do not fall  under  the category of prisoners of war is a sheer distortion of fact.  They are prisoners of war who were arrested by a warring party  while active as guerrillas (militiamen) during the last war.  The South side's argument is a violation of international law  on humanitarianism and a far-fetched one.    What the South side argues about "acquirement of  nationality"  is also absurd. Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan have long since  wished to return to the North and asked International Red Cross  organisations to help them in their repatriation. It is  unreasonable to try to keep them in South Korea for the reason  of their "acquirement of (South Korean) nationality."    Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan are not "killers of innocent  people" as described by the South side but patriots who fought  with arms in hand against foreign aggressors and the traitors of  South Korea who plunged the innocent people into the scourge of  war.    The South side is rejecting our hand of relief while failing  to look after sick Kim Chi-hyon and give her medical treatment.    This is an act which can be done only by those devoid of  humanism and national conscience.    Either in view of the requirement of international law or in  view of the Red Cross idea of humanitarianism, it is only too  natural that the prisoners of war should be repatriated and  fellow countrymen suffering from poverty and illness be rescued.  The South side must send them to the North as soon as possible.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst demands that the South Korean Red  Cross meet the North's just demand with the original attitude of  Red Cross.</p>

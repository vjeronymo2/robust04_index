			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Skandia to boycott Swedish state bonds Concern about Sweden's shaky public finances yesterday rose as Skandia, one of the country's top two insurance groups, said it had stopped buying government bonds in protest at the continuing rise in state debt. The announcement by Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia's chief executive, jolted Stockholm's financial markets, already in bearish mood. Five-year bond yields moved up sharply to almost 10 per cent, the Swedish krona fell against leading currencies and the Stockholm stock exchange fell 2 per cent. 'Skandia will not buy Swedish (state) bonds until such time as the politicians, in a credible way, begin to take seriously the accelerating state debt,' Mr Wolrath said. 'I really do not feel that I have a mandate from (Skandia's) owners to go in and buy Swedish bonds, considering the big risk that implies today.' Sweden has the fastest growing debt among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries - fuelled by a budget deficit that reached 13 per cent of gross national product last year. State debt stood at SKr1,132bn (Pounds 96bn), or about 80 per cent of GNP, at the end of 1993, and is still rising, despite a return to economic growth this year. The Skandia group holds about SKr50bn in state bonds, about one third of those held by the insurance sector, which in turn held almost 12 per cent of state debt at the end of last year. Executives said Skandia would sell some of its portfolio. Senior officials at the Finance Ministry said they did not expect any short-term problems for the government in meeting its financing needs as a result of Skandia's move. Two rival insurance groups, Trygg Hansa and Folksam, said they would continue to trade in government bonds. But the Skandia boycott coincided with new figures showing foreign investors were net sellers of Swedish bonds to the tune of SKr10.6bn in May. Stockholm County Council also said it was withdrawing from the market. Mr Carl Bildt, premier, issued a statement which came close to endorsing Skandia's move. He sought to shift the onus on to the opposition Social Democrats, whose loyalty to the welfare state has raised market fears that they would duck necessary cuts in the public sector if they returned to power. Last night, Mr Goran Persson, economic spokesman for the Social Democrats, called for a special session of parliament's finance committee to discuss the issue.</p>

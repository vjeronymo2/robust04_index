			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Technology: Detecting images through the smoke - Worth Watching A thermal imaging sensor, which could help firemen to find casualties in burning buildings, has won the Prince of Wales Award for Innovation for GEC-Marconi Avionics. Thermal imagers produce a picture by measuring radiation in the infra-red, rather than the visible light spectrum and so can 'see' through dense smoke. The GEC-Marconi breakthrough was to develop a detector which did not need cooling. The company uses a ceramic detector chip. The sensor can be built into a camera or the visor of a fire-fighter's helmet. Gec-Marconi: UK, 0634 827332.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Henrique </F> Cardoso]    [Text] The passing of the fiscal adjustment program is in  the hands of Congress. This is a decision of paramount  importance in order that Brazil might begin 1994 with the hope  that public finances will be set in order and the national  budget balanced and, at the same time, so that there might be a  good chance of success in curbing inflation. We would thus be  able to consolidate sustained economic growth and strengthen our  path toward achieving stability and social justice.    Are there alternatives to this option? I do not rule out the  possibility of alternatives; the government does not believe it  owns the truth. True to the most genuine democratic spirit, and  perfectly aware of the importance of power-sharing between the  three branches of government, the government has always been  open to dialogue and to negotiations with Congress. We welcome  any proposal that seeks to establish a strict budget balance,  such as the one we have submitted through the constitutional  amendment. The only thing that we cannot relinquish is the zero  budget deficit. Without this, the root cause of inflation would  continue unabated. In that eventuality, because the government  would be unable to cover its expenditures with the revenues it  had at its disposal, it would either have to continue placing  government securities on the market, or pass the hat around at  banks to collect funds. And all this would take place at the  expense of higher interest rates and even worse runaway  inflation.    Those who criticize the government's proposal keep insisting  that the increase in taxes will exact a great sacrifice from the  people, and yet they seem to overlook that our objective is to  put an end to the most unfair and cruelest tax of all, a tax  that weighs heavily on all Brazilians. A 5-percent increase in  the federal income tax bracket (or in other words, whoever pays  10 percent will now pay 10.5 percent income tax) is a light  burden to shoulder, if one considers that everybody has to  contribute according to his abilities in the effort to stabilize  the economy.    There are also those who reacted against the proposal to  establish the Social Emergency Fund, arguing that states and  municipalities would stand to lose from it. They did not seem  to realize that this fund is a simple accounting device which,  by bypassing the constitutional rigidity arising from the system  that provides that government revenues should be tied to  appropriations, would be instrumental in balancing the budget.  Besides the fact that appropriations for states and  municipalities would in real terms be kept at the same level as  in 1993, the resources from this fund would return to federal  agencies to be earmarked for social programs.    A little goodwill and national solidarity is all that is  needed to understand that the government's budget proposal is by  no means perfidious or Machiavellian. It is a solution tailored  to the country's needs and possibilities. Furthermore, it has  above all the advantage of opening up new horizons, as it would  enable us to sail through 1994 with balanced public accounts and  -- which necessarily follows -- with the economic stabilization  measures under way. Thus the year that is about to begin -- a  presidential year, which is likely to be fraught with many  anxieties and expectations -- would not force us to sail into  uncharted waters.    Without fiscal adjustment the country can expect nothing  but hyperinflation, recession, higher unemployment, widespread  hunger, and abject squalor. We must put an end to the perverse  cycle of the crisis we are steeped in. The government headed by  President Itamar Franco -- whose term in office comes to an end  in a year's time -- has all the political excuses it needs to  limit itself to a policy of the status quo. It could have  simply continued with the routine tasks of the state apparatus  and government programs, while waiting for the elections in  order to hand over power. Why did it not want to do this?  Simply because in light of the anguish and privations that  Brazilians are suffering the government cannot afford to waste  one single minute. It would be an utter irresponsibility to sit  back and do nothing. We must prepare the ground so that we  finish our long journey in an atmosphere of social harmony and  renewed trust in institutions and in the country's future.    This is the path we have followed. Despite all the problems  we have had the country resumed growth in 1993, and will  continue to grow in 1994 if we keep on the same course. There  are no strikes going on at present in our country. The  purchasing power of wages has been enhanced. Exports and  imports have grown. Our reserves are at an all-time high. We  have rescheduled our external debt. The private sector --  industries, agriculture, services -- has streamlined and updated  its methods so as to be in a position to lead the great leap  forward in the economy that the country is about to make.  Everything has come together to successfully push forward this  modernization process the Brazilian economy is undertaking, and  which will enable us to compete in an increasingly active and  efficient way on the international market. I have no doubt  whatsoever that once we settle the fiscal problem and curb  inflation, there will be a significant inflow of resources to  our country. The world economy has at present good liquidity,  and Brazil cannot miss the opportunity of taking advantage of  this.    Nevertheless, in order to do so we must first fully restore  the soundness of the economy and stamp out inflation. This is  why, in my capacity as finance minister, I am in a position to  say that once Congress passes the fiscal adjustment, I am going  to propose to the president of the Republic that he implement  the Real Value Unit, the URV, which will be the economy's new  leading reference index and will contribute to end creeping  inflation. I will venture to take this step as soon as we have  achieved a balance in our public accounts, because I believe  that the mainstream of our society wants to definitely clobber  inflation. The URV will enable us to pave the way for the final  stage of the stabilization program, which will entail the  creation of a new national currency. The change we are  envisaging is sure to be opposed by profiteers, speculators, tax  evaders, or those who close their eyes to the social iniquity  brought about by inflation. But I am sure that it will be  welcomed by those Brazilians who work, produce, and believe in  the country's destiny.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / State of the Art: The verbiage of creativity that is. . .mad, bad and dangerous to use - New Music, the shock of the old THE trouble started more than a century ago with Wagner. Those opening bars of Tristan and Isolde, groping towards any feeling of a key, were unlocking a Pandora's Box that within 40 years had led the composers of the Second Viennese School, Schoenberg, Berg and Webern, towards music in which the sense of key was totally abandoned. Debussy, Stravinsky and Bartok all added their own threads to modernism and for almost all of the 20th century, tonality has been under attack. It was a battle that it lost for almost 60 years; while atonalism and its progeny serialism reigned, only gifted individualists such as Britten, Tippett and Shostakovich, were able to demonstrate the continued power of tonality. But it is only in the last two decades that tonal music has been able to come-out again, sheltering under a banner that has been called post-modernism. Now, though, there is freedom of choice: composers can select their own label. They can choose to become neo-romantics, minimalists, post-minimalists, neo-expressionists, or polystylisticists, and all of them, inasmuch as they can be pinned down at all, can be shoved into the drawer of musical history labelled post-modernism. The range of music produced under these headings is already vast. but what it all has in common is a rejection of the main evolutionary thread that can be traced through the music of this century from Wagner through the Second Viennese School and the other modernists, to the post-1945 avant-garde of Boulez, Stockhausen and Berio. Some gifted composers articulate this urge to regress in impeccable historical terms; Nicholas Maw, who started as a serial composer and now falls more or less into the neo-romantic school, talks of remaking the link with the late romantics, with Brahms, Wolf and Wagner, and recovering the contact between composers and their public which he maintains was sundered by Schoenberg and his followers. By returning to the harmonies of 100 years ago Maw has fashioned for himself a highly expressive and individual language. But all these strands involved regressions or historical short-circuits, even if the old is sometimes treated with the ironic detachment that often seems the single unifying character of the 57 varieties of post-modernism. There is even an argument for viewing later Stravinsky as one of the first post-modern composers; in neoclassical works such as the opera The Rake's Progress, the conventions of classical opera are appropriated and gently subverted, traditional usages are contradicted, even if the irony is never overtly humorous or satirical. Stravinsky, though, was very special. As the 20th century starts to take stock of itself his genius, along with that of Alban Berg, another composer able to move forwards without ever rejecting his past, seem increasingly the most vital and significant musical figures. The contemporary composers who stand history on its head seem less reverential in their treatment of the past, less certain of what it has to to teach them. Minimalism, the most pernicious and self-serving of all recent trends, uses the simplest melodic and rhythmic shapes and the most elementary harmonic contrasts to build ramshackle musical structures; when used by a composer of genuine wit and perception such as Steve Reich the results can be genuinely musical and intriguing, but in the 1980s, a minimalist background became simply the jumping-off for high-profile international careers. In their much hyped operas Philip Glass and John Adams have both grafted old-fashioned rhetoric onto this ill-defined musical stock so that the minimalist techniques now just fill the gaps between the cliches; post-minimalism has been born. However, the meditational music of Arvo Part is minimalist in a very different way, disarms with its naive sincerity, while a piece such as John Tavener's Protecting Veil, a huge commercial success on disc in Britain, makes just as few intellectual demands; it is as reassuring as the cosiest form of religion, a comfort blanket woven from uncomplicated melody and sweet-toothed harmonies. If contemporary music seems too threatening then listeners can bury their heads under the blanket with Tavener. The appeal of Alfred Shnitke is harder to categorise. For Shnitke's use and abuse of 'old-fashioned' material serves a genuinely ironic, authentically post-modern, purpose; he aims at musical subversion of a sometimes overwhelming kind, and any object is grist to that mill. Shnitke's 'polystylicisticism' - horrible word for music that can be inescapably beautiful - is an uncertain thing. Perhaps that goes with the territory; the musical risks have to be taken before the reward can be secured, but there is no doubt that Shnitke's best music touches a chord with contemporary audiences that few other living composers of comparable sophistication manage to reach. Which should indicate that not everything in the post-modern musical world is commercially driven or meretricious. There are composers who have exploited the expressive freedom of choice of the last quarter century for the best possible musical ends. The German composer Wolfgang Rihm has produced a stream of pieces hard to classify, yet pull the listener into their world with great power. Judith Weir is another who can switch styles and perspectives in a way that is at the same time identifiably post-modern yet coherent and effective. For once then the musical world is mirroring the real thing - still coming to terms with the new freedom and still feeling lost without the old certainties, whether they were good or bad.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Munk puts his faith in a property revival at Trizec - The background to Horsham's CDollars 600m investment in the Canadian group Mr Peter Munk makes a habit of doing business with panache. The Hungarian-born Canadian runs his companies from a stylish townhouse in a Toronto neighbourhood better known for expensive shops and restaurants than corporate head offices. Each winter, however, he manages to mix business with pleasure by setting up an office in the Swiss ski resort of Klosters. Munk's eye for the unorthodox was again in evidence this week with a conditional offer by Horsham, his main holding company, to invest CDollars 600m (USDollars 447.7m) in Trizec, one of North America's biggest office and shopping-mall developers. Horsham would end up with a 43 per cent controlling stake. Trizec is by no means an obvious takeover candidate. Crippled by the long slump in North American property, the Calgary-based company is conducting tough negotiations to restructure part of its CDollars 4.8bn debt. Even as the agreement with Horsham was announced on Monday, a group of unpaid senior debenture holders reaffirmed their determination to seize their security. A court hearing is scheduled for tomorrow. The threat posed by the disgruntled creditors to Trizec's survival appears to have motivated the developer's approach to Horsham last January. According to Ms Leanne Baker, analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York, Horsham's investment is 'not simply a positive call on a sector, but represents an opportunistic acquisition made possible by a singularly distressed company'. A similar description might apply to several of Mr Munk's deals over the past two decades. A few have soured, but enough have succeeded to make Peter Munk and his companies a force to be reckoned with. It was only a decade ago that prominent Canadian securities dealers shied away from helping Mr Munk raise money for an ailing gold and energy producer he had recently acquired. That company, American Barrick Resources, now has a market capitalisation of CDollars 10.2bn, making it the third most valuable company listed on the Toronto stock exchange. Horsham has a 20 per cent stake in Barrick, whose fast-rising earnings from the Goldstrike mine in Nevada have made it the jewel in Mr Munk's crown. Barrick contributed USDollars 41.5m to Horsham last year, which was more than the parent company's total earnings of Dollars 40.1m. Horsham's other significant investment is a 100 per cent interest in Clark Refining and Marketing, an oil refiner and distributor based in St Louis, Missouri. Clark has had an up-and-down history since Horsham bought control in 1988. It posted a small profit last year, with slim refining margins offset by a management shake-up and tight cost controls. Clark is on the verge of an expansion. It is in talks to buy a 177,000 barrels per day refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, from Chevron. The refinery, expected to cost USDollars 150m-Dollars 200m, will more than double Clark's capacity and substantially extend its operating area. Mr Todd Bergman, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said recently the refinery 'will increase Clark's refining exposure at a very low incremental cost.' He predicts that Horsham's earnings will jump to 70 cents a share this year from 42 cents in 1993, due partly to higher refining margins and productivity improvements at Clark. An attempt by Horsham to spin off part of its stake in Clark to the public was aborted last year when market conditions suddenly deteriorated. But a public offering is still in the wings, and could be imminent. The planned investment in Trizec would not be Mr Munk's first foray into property. During the 1970s, he invested in a chain of South Pacific hotels, and came close to building a resort in the shadow of the Pyramids in Egypt. Horsham recently bought 600 acres of farmland on the outskirts of Berlin which it is developing into a business park. The project is now self-financing, but the downturn in the German economy has been a disappointment. Like many of his other deals, the proposed stake in Trizec is a long-term bet. Property markets in several North American cities have shown signs of life recently. If Trizec can stave off its creditors, it would be an obvious beneficiary of any sustained improvement. Should the investment in Trizec prove to be a dud, Mr Munk will at least have the excuse that some high-powered names backed his instincts. Horsham has an unusually star-studded board of directors, including Mr Karl-Otto Pohl, former president of the German Bundesbank, and Mr Brian Mulroney, the former Canadian prime minister. They appear to share Mr Munk's confidence that a full recovery in North American real estate, and in Trizec's fortunes, is just a matter of time.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (9): Afraid of a flutter - Germans are timid investors Germans are impressive savers but unexciting investors. Not for them the ups and downs of stocks and shares, even though long-term gains on these outpace other types of investment. The average German will put safety first almost every time, choosing reliable fixed interest returns over potential gains from equities. However, the real story is rather more complex. First, investors' attitudes are changing, though not with great speed. Second, the unavoidable pressure on individuals to make more provision themselves for their future pension and health needs will accentuate the change. And third, the recollection of world wars and inflation, and the resulting dislike of risk, will be replaced in the minds of many younger people by the opportunities opening up in the rapidly evolving international capital markets. The present statistics look fairly dismal for proponents of the equity culture. Only 5 per cent of German households' total financial assets of DM4,000bn consist of equities. Of the money going into investment funds, over two-thirds is directed towards those specialising in bonds. The number of listed stocks is dwarfed by those in other countries; Germany's 665 compare with 1,900 in the UK, 1,300 in Japan and 6,500 in the US. On the other hand, Germans saved more than 13 per cent of their incomes last year, well above the level in France, the UK and the US. Why does more of that money not go into shares? In the view of Mr Gerhard Liener, a director of the Daimler-Benz vehicle and aerospace group, efforts to win over the investors of the future will have to be made now if they are to be persuaded to go more enthusiastically into equities. If households' property ownership is added in, their total assets amount to around DM10,000bn. As much as DM2,000bn could be passed on to the next generation up to 2000, he told an investment conference in Dusseldorf. The average value of an inheritance would be about DM300,000. Mr Liener had several answers to the above question. One was the existence of a financial and accounting system which favoured creditors rather than shareholders. Savers deposit funds with banks which lend them to companies. Shareholders' interests are often neglected. Nor is it easy to obtain a clear financial picture from many corporate accounts, since high levels of tax-free reserves stand in the way of full profit disclosures. Daimler-Benz started chipping away at such obstacles when it agreed to produce a separate, and more open, set of accounts for its US share listing last year. Other companies are reluctant to follow, but may have to if they want to tap world markets for cheaper sources of finance. One reason for the government's efforts to help develop the financial infrastructure was the sheer size of future capital-raising needs. Not only is the public sector itself a heavy borrower, but German state and private companies are also expected to come to the market in increasing volumes. As Mr Liener pointed out, the partial privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the state telephone company, is expected to raise some DM15bn. This will only be the first tranche. Daimler itself raised DM3bn this year. 'The German capital market is over-stretched with sums of this type,' he said. 'Thus large companies will increasingly turn to other capital markets, above all to the US, the most productive in the world.' If German companies are to take advantage of this - Deutsche Telekom hopes eventually to obtain a US listing - they will have to adapt to Anglo-Saxon methods. US institutions have a huge volume of funds for investment; by next year, they will have Dollars 100bn invested abroad. To be tempted more heavily into German stocks, they will need more transparent accounts, evidence that companies really do care about the price of their shares, and a wider spread of issues. If this occurs in the next few years, the outlook for German investors will also improve. Some progress is already discernible. Investment funds (the equivalent of UK unit trusts) attract a growing volume of funds. Bundesbank figures show that every seventh D-Mark invested now ends up in a managed fund compared with every 13th in the 1980s and only every 30th in the 1970s. The central bank said unit purchases by private and institutional investors had undergone 'a powerful upturn' after being overshadowed by other forms of investment before the mid-1980s. Foreign bankers also pay tribute to the efforts of investment funds, some owned by the big banks, to win over investors and provide a wide range of domestic, foreign, and hedging funds. Although most German investors still prefer bond-based funds, their tastes are changing, says Mr Christian Strenger, head of DWS, Deutsche Bank's fund management operation. 'The proportion of money being invested in our equity funds has been rising strongly. For DWS, it is now 20 per cent. It ought to go to 35 per cent.' This could happen in two to four years - 'hopefully before the end of the millennium'. By putting a Mr Smiley face on some of its brochures, DWS has tried to catch savers' attention. Mixing fun and finance is fairly un-German, but DWS hopes to appeal to investors of all temperaments. Also adopting a novel approach, Berentzen, a drinks company, put details of its recent share issue on the backs of schnapps bottles. Another innovation is the DM5 nominal share, now allowed by law and aimed at making shares more affordable by dividing them into smaller units. The first such issue, by the Fielmann optical company in September, was an immediate success.</p>

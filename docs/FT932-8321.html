			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: US energy group sues bid rival PARKER &amp; Parsley, the US energy group which last week agreed to pay Dollars 448m for Prudential Securities' troubled energy investment partnerships, is suing Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas, a rival US energy company which has submitted a higher bid for the partnerships, for attempting to interfere in the transaction. Graham Royalty, a firm which was a general partner in the loss-making partnerships along with Prudential, is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit filed in Texas. Parker claims that Dreyfus 'maliciously interfered' with the merger agreement between Parker and Prudential and that Graham Royalty breached the merger agreement and committed conspiracy and fraud by negotiating with Dreyfus. The lawsuit follows a series of confusing events. On Monday Prudential agreed to sell its partnerships to Parker for Dollars 448m but a few days later, under pressure from investors in the partnerships, it was forced to reveal that a counter-offer worth Dollars 510m had already been made by Dreyfus. At the time, Prudential said that it did not accept the higher offer because there was not enough information in the bid for it to be evaluated properly. Prudential has since said it will consider the bid once Dreyfus has provided a full financing commitment for its offer, which Dreyfus said it will provide in the next week. The affair is being watched closely by investors in the Prudential energy partnerships. After the partnerships racked up big losses in the late 1980s because of a slump in the domestic energy and property businesses, the investors sued Prudential for misleading them over the risks involved in buying into the partnerships.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Support for MP's medicine proposals A LABOUR MP's attempt to increase the information available on the safety of medicines received a fillip yesterday when the government indicated some support for his proposals. Mr Giles Radice's Medicines Information Bill - opposed by the pharmaceutical industry - would give patients and doctors rights to information given to licensing authorities by drug companies. The bill is intended to stop drugs being withdrawn or suspended without patients' having access to the results of safety tests. It will be debated by MPs on January 15. In a deliberately conciliatory response, the Department of Health said: 'The department understands the objectives of the bill but this is a complex area of policy concerning a number of issues and the matter is under consideration.' Mr Radice, MP for Durham North, regards his bill as a test for Mr William Waldegrave, public-service minister, who is reviewing secrecy rules across Whitehall, including those affecting drugs, and who is understood to be sympathetic to his proposals. Support for Mr Radice's proposal has also come from Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs as well as from the Campaign for Freedom of Information, the National Consumer Council and the Consumers' Association. Bills introduced by backbench MPs are easily blocked and rarely become law unless backed by the government, but Mr Radice may be able to reach a compromise deal with the government. One difficulty is the cost of compiling a fresh register on drug information. However, Mr Peter Lumley, director of public affairs at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said Mr Radice's bill could cause 'substantial damage . . . because the vast amount of information that the pharmaceutical companies produce in order to support an application - the intellectual property and the time and the money - is going to be jeopardised.' Mr Radice has tried to overcome such objections by limiting access to information to people with no links with the pharmaceutical industry. A similar rule is used by the Ministry of Agriculture for information about pesticides. But the ABPI remains unhappy.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Media Futures: Managers who fear the office technology gap Wanted: senior executive. Must have above average management skills and perform competently in front of the television cameras New technologies, such as electronic mail and video conferencing, can bring dramatic improvements to an organisation's internal communications - at a price. Problems include middle managers feeling they are being undermined, as senior managers communicate directly with all employees, and tensions arising from a generation gap between technologically illiterate managers and computer literate staff. These are among the findings of a study by Smythe Dorward Lambert, a London-based consultancy specialising in internal communications. It argues there is a powerful need for guidelines to ensure that the power of the new technologies is not abused. 'Areas covered' it says 'should include frequency, targeting, matching media to audience, building in two-way response mechanisms, the continuing importance of face-to-face communications, the right to privacy for employees and the internal security of information'. The study says the technologies which will see the greatest increase in use in the next five years will be electronic mail, personal digital assistants and video conferencing. Telephone conferencing, seen as a poor substitute for face-to-face meetings,may disappear with the spread of desk top video telephones. Voice mail, however, is not proving universally popular: the oil company Texaco reported that only a few of their staff liked it. Staff have to be trained to use voice mail as IBM UK discovered: 'We went too far in removing human contact too quickly' said Mr Nick Temple, the company's chairman: 'Unless all the workforce is attuned, it becomes an obstacle'. The new skills that managers will need will include a good presence on screen. . They can no longer expect to be shielded from the direct gaze of their employees because video techniques will increasingly put them in the spotlight. Managers with better televisual skills could prosper over colleagues who may be equally gifted in other aspects of management: 'At least one major technology company is now recruiting senior managers with televisual skills as a key competency' Smythe Dorward says. However, the study concludes that technological push is still driving the use of communications technology rather than clear business benefits.

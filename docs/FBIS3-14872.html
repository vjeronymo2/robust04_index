			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>   [Text] United Nations, 1 Mar -- Bosnian Muslims are  against the deployment of Russian troops in Sarajevo and are  appealing to the UN Security Council to "postpone" the  deployment of an additional Russian contingent in Bosnia. This  is stated in a letter from Alia Izetbegovic, the Bosnian  president, which was forwarded to the current president of the  UN Security Council on Monday [28 February]. This document,  which has not been officially issued yet, was obtained by an  Itar-Tass correspondent.    "The behavior of the Russian soldiers after their arrival in  Sarajevo has annoyed UN [words indistinct] in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since their arrival they have displayed  their support for the aggressor. Attitudes which remind us of  certain episodes in the past have been strongly demonstrated.  Our people regard this as a provocation which could cause an  incident," Izetbegovic pointed out.    "We do not endorse the arrival of additional Russian forces  in Bosnia-Herzegovina," he stressed. "We believe that any such  decision should be put off."</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average settles below the 21,000 level INVESTORS remained on the sidelines ahead of the release of the Bank of Japan's tankan, or quarterly report on business sentiment, and share prices lost ground on profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average shed 98.71 to 20,962.10, falling below the 21,000 level for the first time in three trading days. The index opened at the day's high of 21,065.81 and fell to a low of 20,880.19 just before the close. Some financial institutions were seen reshuffling their share portfolios, while the downside was supported by index-linked buying by investment trusts. Volume came to 250m shares, against Monday's 247m. Many foreign buyers were absent following the US holiday on Monday. Declines outpaced gains by 703 to 280, with 198 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 7.13 to 1,689.78, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.66 to 1,291.53. Investors failed to react to local press reports which forecast a reduction in the official discount rate next week. Instead, some market participants were discouraged by denials by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, of a second supplementary package suggested in a leading daily newspaper. However, some analysts believe that further talk of another economic package will support share prices. 'We will see an inevitable process of consensus building towards a new fiscal package,' wrote Mr Jason James of James Capel in a recent report. Trading concentrated on the clearing of earlier positions. Retailers, which strengthened on earlier hopes of deregulation, lost ground on profit-taking, as did foods, which were higher on Monday ahead of the medical and bio-technology conferences. Ito-Yokado, the supermarket chain, receded Y50 to Y4,960 and Seiyu lost Y50 to Y1,420. Ajinomoto, the foods manufacturer, dipped Y10 to Y1,460 and Kikkoman, the soy sauce maker, eased Y10 to Y1,010. Telecommunication infra-structure-related issues, which have been hit by profit-taking recently, were higher. Oki Electric Industry, the most active issue of the day, put on Y10 at Y555, while Fujitsu gained Y3 at Y839. However, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y8,000 to Y941,000 on rumours that interest among foreign investors had shifted to DDI, the long distance telecom company recently listed on the second section of the Tokyo stock exchange. In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 142.14 to 22,918.23 in volume of 27m shares. The index lost ground for the first time in four days on small-lot profit-taking. Roundup A FIRM mood took hold in many of the Pacific Basin markets. AUSTRALIA saw a flurry of late buying which left the All Ordinaries index 5.3 higher at 1,967.8. Commonwealth Bank forged ahead 35 cents to ADollars 9.95 after posting an 8.4 per cent rise in annual net profits to ADollars 443.1m. National Australia Bank was 20 higher at ADollars 11.52. Among media stocks, Nine Network climbed 32 cents to ADollars 4.25 in response to its announcement of a 16.4 per cent increase in annual net profits. NEW ZEALAND picked up from early lows to finish slightly firmer on the day, assisted by gains in Carter Holt Harvey, Telecom and Lion Nathan. The NZSE-40 capital index was ahead 1.98 at 1995.79, after an early dip to 1.987.36. SEOUL turned sharply higher after a flurry of late buying by individual investors, actively hunting bargains in the vehicle, steel and high technology sectors. The composite index advanced 15.18 to 690.95. HONG KONG closed firmer, but off morning highs, in thin trade, inhibited by current high price levels. The Hang Seng index was finally 27.05 up at 7,546.71, after 7,563.49. TAIWAN rebounded strongly after recent falls, although brokers cautioned that underlying investor confidence and the corporate profits outlook remained weak. The weighted index was lifted 58.49, or 1.5 per cent, to 3,874.03 by a wave of late buying in speculative and government-related stocks. Turnover expanded to TDollars 13.49bn. KUALA LUMPUR continued to focus its attention on rumour-driven stocks and the composite index added 1.30 at 849.70. Union Paper, hit hard by allegations of insider trading, recouped 85 cents to MDollars 6.85 after Monday's MDollars 6.20 drop as the shares resumed trading after a two-month suspension. BOMBAY finished sharply lower after the exchange authorities announced a ban on short sales. The BSE 30-share index ended 87.67, or 3.3 per cent, down at 2,533.53 after a low of 2,515.50 at midsession. The ban was intended to counter expected heavy sell-ing pressure after the income tax authorities confiscated hundreds of thousands of shares held by proxies of broker Mr Harshad Mehta in nine companies.</p>

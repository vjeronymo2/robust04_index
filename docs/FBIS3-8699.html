This was stated by Gabor Kuncze, faction  leader and prime minister candidate of the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ], at a news conference on 10 March where he  reported on the three-member party delegation's visit to Romania  which had ended on 9 March.    At the talks with the SZDSZ's delegation, general secretary  of the Bucharest government Viorel Hrebenciuc, who is considered  to be President Iliescu's most influential adviser, held out the  possibility of reassessing the clemency applications of the  condemned people. A promise was also made about opening two  more border crossing points in 1994, and Senate chairman Oliviu  Gherman admitted that it was advisable to expedite the  ratification of the already signed bilateral agreements on  investment protection and the avoidance of dual taxation. The  SZDSZ delegation explained to its hosts that a general  improvement in bilateral relations could be achieved together  with settling the national minority issue. In reply to MAGYAR  HIRLAP's question, Kuncze said that according to the original  program, they should have met Prime Minister Vacaroiu but the  Romanian side canceled the meeting due to the government  reshuffle in Bucharest. During the talks with the leaders of  the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in  Romanian] and the mayors of Harghita and Covasna counties, the  Free Democrats said that, if their party becomes a governmental  factor, they would continue to keep the issue of the Hungarians  in Romania on the agenda in an institutionalized form and in  terms of standards, but they would certainly not wish to  influence the RMDSZ's political line. Kuncze also said that the  mayor of Marcelhaza [Marcelova] had to cancel Kuncze's planned  visit on 15 March because of the conflicts between the Hungarian  organizations in Slovakia.    Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, parliamentary deputy of the SZDSZ who  was also part of the delegation, said to MAGYAR HIRLAP that all  the RMDSZ leaders agree with the concept according to which the  Free Democrats handle the system of relations with Romania. He  added that the classical legal theory of liberalism was indeed  solely based on individual rights. However, the modern liberal  view has reached the point of recognizing that certain rights  can only be guaranteed if they are linked to some community.  Therefore, in the SZDSZ, the view now prevails that, in the  issue of the minorities over the border, progress has to be made  toward making collective rights recognized. Szent-Ivanyi  admitted that his Bucharest negotiating partners touched upon  the unresolved situation of the parliamentary representation of  national minorities in Hungary. However, the SZDSZ delegation  explained that further talks are being held in Hungary on this  issue and, on the other hand, the legal provisions that have  been enacted in Hungary -- mainly the law on national minorities  -- are still to be achieved by the parliaments of the  neighboring countries.</p>

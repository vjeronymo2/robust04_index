			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARY FOCUSES ON REFORMING THE NUTRITIONAL HABITS OF ITS CITIZENS;  </P> <P> HEALTH: THE EAST BLOC COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS INCLUDE HIGH RATES OF ALCOHOLISM,  SUICIDE AND MORBIDITY.  </P> <P> Victims of the 1956 Revolution may get more press, but poor nutrition has  killed more Hungarians than tyrants ever will, say health experts who are  growing increasingly alarmed about Magyar eating habits.  </P> <P> Dietary reform is difficult in a country that has long prided itself on a  cuisine rich with cream sauces, refined sugar and pork fat. Add to this the  fact that lean meats are priced beyond most budgets -- one in five Hungarians  live below the poverty line -- and you get a deadly recipe for widespread  cardiovascular disease.  </P> <P> "Hungarian morbidity rates are catastrophic and worsening," says Peter Makara,  a spokesman for the Hungarian Institute for Health Promotion. "Since 1963, the  life expectancy of men in Hungary is decreasing, which is absolutely unheard of  in a peaceful country."  </P> <P> The East Bloc has never been a Pritikin paradise of course. But Hungary's  health problems are unique, even among its Warsaw Pact allies: Its alcoholism  and suicide rates rank among the world's highest, and Hungary, along with the  Soviet Union, shares the lowest life expectancy of any developed country,  according to an April, 1989, World Health Organization report (69.7 years  versus 75.5 years in the United States and 79.1 years in Japan.)  </P> <P> Clearly, nutrition wasn't a priority under the old regime; even former  Communist leader Janos Kadar -- who died earlier this year -- enjoyed his bread  drenched in bacon drippings. But today, as Hungary opens up to the West, there  is mounting interest in reforming diet as well as politics.  </P> <P> "I sense a distinct change in attitude," says Dr. Sushma Palmer, who sits on  the food and nutrition board of the National Academy of Sciences. She just  spent a year helping the government draw up nutritional guidelines and teaching  courses for educators and health professionals.  </P> <P> But Palmer, who is also the wife of the former U.S. Ambassador to Hungary, says  that although the government readily acknowledges the problem, it has been slow  to act.  </P> <P> Nutrition isn't taught in school, for instance, so students who know Madonna's  songs by heart can't recite the four basic food groups. Hungarian produce  overflows from supermarket shelves, but Budapest's salad bars can be counted on  one hand. Words like fiber and cholesterol haven't entered the vernacular.  </P> <P> Makara admits he is sometimes embarrassed when colleagues from the World Health  Organization visit him to help plan a European nutrition conference that  Hungary is expected to host in 1990.  </P> <P> When dinner time rolls around, Makara says he and his guests must comb the  streets of Budapest for newly opened private eateries where fried food isn't  the dominant culinary motif.  </P> <P> "Healthful foods are very difficult to find. . . . In a normal Hungarian  restaurant there are no good choices," says Makara, a portly man of 43 who  drops four sugar cubes into each demitasse of espresso.  </P> <P> But there are some portents of change, especially among the more well-to-do and  educated classes.  </P> <P> "It's a new trend among the intelligentsia to invite you to their home and  serve a variety of salads," Makara says.  </P> <P> And of course, restaurants at Western-style hotels offer everything from Cobb  salads to grilled chicken breasts. This summer Budapest's elegant Forum Hotel  -- a streamlined Western facility perched on the banks of the Danube -- began  offering a menu of "Hungarian nouvelle cuisine" featuring traditional Hungarian  ingredients cooked into upscale offerings. Perch is served in a Champagne sauce  instead of a cream-based sauce; hearty squab soup becomes a consomme, and veal  medallions are braised and served with zucchini instead of languishing in sour  cream.  </P> <P> "We try to make them eat more vegetables and we don't use fats. For the  Hungarian people, this is a new thing," says Ervin Ungar, manager of the  Forum's swank Silhouettes restaurant, where dinner runs at least $25 per  person.  </P> <P> But the average Hungarian factory worker is more likely to visit the moon than  blow a month's wages on a pricey dinner for his family. Besides, in certain  circles, such food is considered an insult.  </P> <P> "If you go into a village they don't offer you salad. It's an offense. If they  want to honor you they bring out some good fatty meat and fatty soup," says Dr.  Sandor Eckhardt, a director of Hungary's Oncological Institute.  </P> <P> Dr. Sandor Bardach, who teaches at Pesti Barnabi High School in Budapest, which  teaches food production, says many of his students remain ignorant of the  connection between diet and cardiovascular disease.  </P> <P> "I myself know very well the connection. I have to go to the doctor for  cholesterol," Bardach says. At his school however, "we don't deal with it in  the proper way. It is a problem of the future."  </P> <P> Hungarian health experts say the recent lifting of travel restrictions to the  West will expose more of their countrymen to good nutrition. But they want  dietary classes taught in all schools. They want TV commercials that tout the  health benefits of boiled lard scrapped. And they want the state to take the  initiative.  </P> <P> Instead, competing government programs often sabotage efforts.  </P> <P> Makara, of the state Institute for Health Promotion, complains that his plans  for an anti-cholesterol campaign were nixed because another state agency had  invested heavily in egg factories and thus wanted Hungarians to eat more, not  fewer, eggs.  </P> <P> Ditto with refined sugar. "We are constructing two new sugar processing  factories, which absolutely excludes the possibility of an anti-sugar  campaign," Makara says.  </P> <P> Those pushing nutritional perestroika say economics also plays a major role.  Many Hungarian jobs involve heavy physical labor, which requires a consumption  of many calories. So wives on limited budgets stuff their husbands with bread,  lard and potatoes.  </P> <P> "The unhealthy food like fat and carbohydrates are very cheap in our country  but vegetables and lean meat are relatively expensive," Eckhardt says.  </P> <P> And scientists cite a study showing that Hungarian consumption of vegetables  and fruit actually declined by 5% between 1960 and 1982, an alarming trend that  nutritionists blame partly on rising prices.  </P> <P> Ironically, the Hungarian diet was once rich in leaner meat and fish. In the  last century, Hungary was three times as large as it is now and included the  forested province of Transylvania, which it was forced to cede to Romania by  the Trianon Treaty after World War I. In those days, wild game was popular and  plentiful, as were fish caught fresh from the banks of the Danube, Makara says.  </P> <P> No longer. Today, game dishes such as haunch of deer Eszterhazy and roast  breast of pheasant prowl mainly on expensive tourist menus.  </P> <P> And the government discourages people from eating fish caught in the Danube,  which is now brown from the industrial wastes that are discharged into its  currents. The once pristine river is now so polluted that a man who recently  drank a glass of Danube water as a publicity stunt was featured for his daring  stupidity on the evening news.  </P> <P> But there are signs that Hungary is becoming more aware of organic, health and  specialty foods. An organic grocery store on Kristina Korut in the  upper-income, residential hills of Buda does a thriving business.  </P> <P> Earlier this fall, between legalizing opposition parties and declaring itself a  republic, the Hungarian Parliament approved a national health awareness and  disease prevention program.  </P> <P> And the American-Hungarian Friendship Forum, a private, U.S. foundation that  Palmer helped found, plans an extensive program to train Hungarian  nutritionists in the United States.  </P> <P> Still, the average Andras may look askance at any attempts to exile his  favorite dishes to gastronomic Siberia. "I tried to serve my husband salad for  dinner," one Hungarian journalist complained with a sigh. "He got angry with me  and said, 'What is this, rabbit food? Bring me an old-fashioned Hungarian meal  like my mother used to make.' "  </P></p>

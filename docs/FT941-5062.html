			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei fails to sustain early rally as Manila rebounds A fall in government bond prices eroded early equity gains to leave the market lower, although foreign investors continued to provide support, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average relinquished 154.12 at 19,811.88 on arbitrage linked selling and profit-taking by institutional investors. The index hit a high for the day of 20,279.13 and fell to a low of 19,768.68 in the afternoon. Active demand from foreign investors and arbitrage buying supported shares in the morning session, but most domestic investors remained inactive ahead of the March stock futures and options settlements on Friday. A fall in the bond market triggered heavy arbitrage selling based on the Topix index in the afternoon. Traders said that while investors have been rolling over their positions in the Nikkei 225 futures, much of the Topix positions had been liquidated. Volume totalled 340m shares, down from 414m. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 14.19 to 1,608.10 and the Nikkei 300 shed 2.83 to 296.47. Declines led rises by 678 to 366, with 141 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.44 to 1,336.16. Profit-taking hit Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, pushing the issue down Y10,000 to Y948,000. Financials, heavily weighted in the Topix index, lost ground. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y60 to Y3,250, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y40 to Y1,930 and Nomura Securities Y30 to Y2,260. Real estate companies were lower on profit-taking. Mitsui Fudosan retreated Y60 to Y1,190 and Mitsubishi Estate Y30 to Y1,020. Growing concern over the current rice shortage supported rice traders. Although foreign rice has been imported to fill the gap, reports of shoppers fighting for bags of rice prompted buying of Yamatane, which gained Y60 at Y1,040. Bakeries and flour millers drew buying on expectations of a rise in demand for bread due to the lack of rice on the shop shelves. Yamazaki Baking rose Y50 to Y2,140 and Nitto Flour Milling Y65 to Y540. Motor shares were firm on foreign buying. Toyota Motor climbed Y40 to Y2,080 and Nissan Motor Y11 to Y884. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 116.95 to 21,952.21 in volume of 61.1m shares. Aoki International, the men's suit retailer, put on Y140 at Y3,540 on bargain hunting. Roundup The region saw mixed performances, while trading volume was thin in many centres. MANILA rebounded after more than a week of steep declines, although low turnover suggested that the market was still testing a new base. The composite index moved forward 47.46, or 1.8 per cent, to 2,654.28 as PLDT added 45 pesos at 1,910 pesos. HONG KONG strengthened, the Hang Seng index adding 143.36, or 1.5 per cent, at 10,061.55, although thin volume of HKDollars 4.48bn indicated that there were still nagging doubts about the market's direction. AUSTRALIA mustered a firm performance, moving the All Industrials index up 42.1 to 3,299.5. Futures helped the underlying market benefit from consolidation, and the majority of the leading stocks were able to enjoy the upward journey. BHP rose 20 cents to ADollars 17.42, News Corp put on 23 cents at ADollars 9.97 and CRA gained 34 cents at ADollars 17.30. SINGAPORE failed to sustain an early rebound as investors remained cautious pending clearer directions in US interest rates. The Straits Times Industrial index lost a net 4.89 at 2,243.74 after an intraday peak of 2,275.89. SEOUL saw widespread selling in the year's lowest volume on a full trading day and the composite index declined 7.15 to 895.62. Volume amounted to 17.15m shares, against 13.20m in Saturday's half-day session. KUALA LUMPUR fell 1.7 per cent as investors liquidated positions amid worries about the direction of overseas markets and US interest rates. Fears of trade retaliation by Britain also discouraged buying interest and the composite index shed 18.62 to 1,045.72. NEW ZEALAND ended with moderate buoyancy after a session beset by confusion over how the readjustment of Telecom's shares affected the NZSE-40 index. The index was quoted 13.4 higher at 2,195.34 following an upward adjustment of 24 points, after the market closed. THAILAND saw a retreat of the bears as concern over rising interest rates and political uncertainty began to ebb. The SET Index finished 17.43, or 1.3 per cent, better at 1,376.68 in moderate turnover of Bt7.6bn. TAIWAN's weighted index receded 23.87 to 5,647.59, with Saturday's confirmation that the authorities were raising the ceiling on foreign investment already discounted. JAKARTA encountered foreign selling, although domestic investors gave some support, making for a mixed day's trading. The official index edged up 0.99 to 522.37. BOMBAY weakened in nervous trade in a continuation of the downward movement which left the market with a drop of 11.3 per cent last week in the wake of the budget statement. The BSE 30-share index closed 56.99 lower at 3,744.61.</p>

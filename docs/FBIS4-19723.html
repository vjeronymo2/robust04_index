			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Lubbers Calls For Strong Action </F> Against Serbs"]    [Text] The Hague -- Prime Minister Lubbers feels that the  international community must show that it is determined to end  the war in Bosnia. He said this yesterday upon his departure  from the Bulgarian capital of Sofia.    Foreign Minister Kooijmans, who accompanied Lubbers, noted  that the chances for calling a halt to the war have dropped in  the last two weeks. He also talked of a "common front," which  must make it clear that the flagrant violations of the UN  resolutions will no longer be tolerated.    The Netherlands had raised some questions about the request  to NATO made by the UN secretary general to carry out air  strikes around the "safe areas" in Bosnia. In a letter to the  Second Chamber, Kooijmans said that "there must be better  coordination with other countries that are supplying troops.  There must also be a sufficient number of troops present in the  "safe areas."</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / TV-am investors seek better luck with Crockfords Plc MR GARRY NESBITT was trained as a tap dancer by his show business parents but it was business he was interested in, so he took a gamble and applied for a job at Crockfords when it opened as London's first legal casino in 1961. As a gaming room valet dressed in 18th century breeches, he smoothed the green baize of the tables and served chocolates to the ladies playing chemin de fer. Yesterday Mr Nesbitt, chairman of Crockfords, was looking forward to being chairman of Crockfords Plc when the company is listed on the London Stock Exchange on September 1. It follows yesterday's reverse takeover by TV-am, the commercial breakfast television company that gambled and lost in 1991's auction for new ITV licences. The deal will make Mr Nesbitt, who along the way ran casinos for Mecca and created and sold the Our Price record chain to WH Smith for Pounds 46m, as rich as many of the international gamblers to come to Crockfords in the heart of London's Mayfair. In Crockfords, under the Robert Adam ceilings of a house built in 1760, it is possible to lose a great deal of money in the most pleasant of surroundings and some do - Pounds 500,000 or even Pounds 1m in a single night. The smallest bet you can place at Crockfords is Pounds 5 on a single number at roulette, although the Pounds 600 limit gives a better idea of what goes on. 'You can bet more by private arrangement,' says Mr Nesbitt who then unlocks the door of the salon privee, where the really high rollers can go if they want solitude and silence to win or lose enormous sums. Here, surrounded by prints and pictures, the minimum bet on the roulette wheel is Pounds 1,000. When Mr Nesbitt bought Crockfords in 1990 from Brent Walker for Pounds 50m it was a huge gamble. 'It was a mid-market casino,' he says. 'It was virtually a downmarket casino. People were playing for Pounds 2. It was ridiculous.' His aim has been to take Crockfords up market. Over the past three years, 10 'exceptional' players have accounted for 50 per cent of profits, which rose to almost Pounds 20m in 1992. One gambler in his 60s accounted for no less than 40 per cent of last year's profits. Institutions which backed TV-am and are staying to see how their luck holds at the gaming tables must be hoping his health holds. 'London is still the gaming capital of the world,' Mr Nesbitt insists, although Middle Eastern clients have given way in large part to the rich of Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan. 'The British don't come. This is a 98 per cent export business. We should get a Queen's award for exports,' says Mr Nesbitt, who hopes to buy other casinos in London and take the Crockfords way of doing business to other countries. While the recession may be barely over in London casino business is starting to boom, probably helped by sterling's devaluation. Last year turnover at London's casinos reached Pounds 1.2bn. This year as much as Pounds 1.44bn in chips could be put at risk on the smooth green baize. Taking a gamble, Page 8 Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Prospects rise for truce in Bosnia Bosnian Serb and United Nations commanders yesterday adjourned talks on a proposed four-month ceasefire agreement but remained confident the truce would be signed before the deadline on Sunday. On the political front, Bosnian Serb deputies last night made a cautious endorsement of a peace plan brokered on December 19 by Mr Jimmy Carter, former US president. Bosnian Serb leaders had promised to restart peace talks on the basis of the five-nation Contact Group plan to divide Bosnia roughly in half. 'The parliament informs the Contact Group and the international community of the readiness on the part of Republika Srpska to enter peace negotiations on the basis of the agreement with Carter.' The lukewarm statement, issued in the Serb mountain stronghold of Pale, fell far short of accepting the map which would call on Serbs to hand over a third of the 70 per cent of Bosnia they currently control. Serb leaders still reject the maps, whereas the Moslem-led government had insisted that the proposed division remains the same. But earlier Mr Alija Izetbegovic, President of Bosnia, appeared to soften his position. Speaking in his capacity as leader of Bosnia's main Moslem party, he said: 'We think that the resumption of the war is a bigger injustice than an unjust peace.' After meeting Serb military and political leaders in Pale, General Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, said: 'There is goodwill on both sides. I hope we are going to get some conclusion by the weekend. 'Today it might be a little too soon (for the signing) because we were not expecting it before January 1 and we still have two days to go.' General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, added: 'I agree with what General Rose has just said. I hope the parties to the conflict will sort details out.' Bosnian Serbs and Moslems recently endorsed a temporary truce in order to gain time to hammer out the details of a four-month cessation of hostilities throughout Bosnia under the agreement brokered by Mr Carter. Fighting near the northwestern Bihac enclave yesterday raised fears that even the provisional truce would not take hold. Serb forces are encircling Bihac. They used tanks, artillery and mortars to push back their Moslem foes in nearby Bosanska Krupa, said UN officials. The Bosnian government yesterday reiterated warnings that it would refuse to sign the four-month ceasefire if Serb forces, backed by troops loyal to Mr Fikret Abdic, the Moslem renegade leader, kept up their assault on Bihac. Gen Rose on Wednesday won conditional support for a truce from Mr Abdic, but the maverick chief refused to accept any deadlines.</p>

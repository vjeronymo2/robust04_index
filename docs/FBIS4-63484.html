The most tough, extreme  measures will be taken against violators of the state border and  territorial integrity of Ukraine," Ukrainian Defence Minister  Vitaliy Radetskyy told the NTV Russian independent television  today, speaking of the Crimean issue.    "We will not reckon with something or somebody. The Crimea  is an integral part of Ukraine, and we will give it to nobody at  any cost. This must be known by everyone. The persons who  provoked this situation will be the first to carry full  responsibility," said the minister.</p>

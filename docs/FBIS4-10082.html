			<p>BFN     [Text] The president of the Republic demands that all  Chilean public employees respect the people and exhibit flawless  professional behavior.    In a note distributed to mayors and governors, President  Frei  warns that "administrative integrity implies putting public  interests above personal ones." It adds: "Corruption implies  taking advantage of a situation for personal benefit."    The note exhorts officials to look after public property and  resources by making good use of them, to have a social life in  accordance with the dignity of their positions, to avoid  intervening in a situation in which personal interests are  involved, and not to engage in influence peddling or handle  privileged information and to prevent others from doing it. Tax  collectors are warned that they should not solicit, commit  others to grant them, or accept donations, advantages, or any  other sort of privilege. They must promptly report to the courts  crimes they are aware of, as well as report all irregularities  to the appropriate authorities. They are also requested to  strictly control the use of fiscal revenues. The note also  reminds public employees that the administration is subjected to  multiple controls, therefore they should not hinder or delay  this control. Another part of the note adds that no fees should  be charged for tasks performed by government members unless  legal provisions establish otherwise.    The president of the Republic also requests that public  administration employees comply with the objectives of each  government institution and that, on their own initiative,  employees seek to better fulfill their obligations and place the  public administration at the service of citizens.    Another provision is that civil servants meet community  requests, charges, or complaints that are respectfully and  appropriately presented. The public tasks must be fulfilled in  thorough compliance with the terms of the Constitution, the  laws, and established norms. They also are required to be  diligent, not to create false expectations about the extent of  government actions, to be efficient, to simplify red tape, to  make use of the available means, and not to overwhelm society  with excessive rules. Obsolete or useless norms must be  expressly eliminated, and the language used in guidelines and  norms must be simple and understandable to all.    They are told to exercise authority in a reasonable and not  arbitrary manner, to do it in a respectful and diligent way, and  to ensure that their action goes beyond the interests of  individuals or groups.    The president of the Republic points out in the note: "Our  rule of law guarantees absolute equality before the law.  Therefore, I will not allow people, groups, interests, or  authorities to be favored.    "I demand that you appoint people who have full knowledge of  matters in his area in positions of direct service to the  population. I want them to carry out their duties with  dedication and courtesy. Everyone has the right to be treated  well. I want special respect for the poor, the handicapped, and  elderly people. I want clarity. I want the people to see what  you are doing. Do not deny access to the information or reviews  of administrative documents. I want people who respect our  population's different cultures, who can make sound decisions,  who can resolve problems by listening to those affected. I want  people who will adopt all necessary measures to guarantee  security, good service, and the protection of users' rights. I  want the areas where people wait or where they are heard to be  accessible and dignified. Users should receive all the  information necessary concerning administrative proceedings so  they clearly know where to go, which documents to take with  them, and when they will be served.</p>

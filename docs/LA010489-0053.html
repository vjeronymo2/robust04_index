			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SETON HALL KNOCKS OFF GEORGETOWN, 94-86  </P> <P> After living by its man-to-man defense this season, Seton Hall unveiled an  aggressive zone defense against No. 5-ranked Georgetown in a Big East game  Tuesday night at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> "It was the first time all year we went zone," forward Daryll Walker said after  No. 10 Seton Hall rallied from 9 points back to beat previously unbeaten  Georgetown, 94-86. "I think we matched up pretty well and took (Alonzo)  Mourning out of the game with it."  </P> <P> The Pirates went to the 3-2 zone with about 12 minutes to play and Georgetown  clinging to a 63-60 lead.  </P> <P> "The timing of going to the zone was good," Georgetown Coach John Thompson  said. "It was a smart thing on their art to do that."  </P> <P> Gerald Greene hit a 3-point shot to ignite a 19-9 burst late in the second half  that carried Seton Hall (13-0) to victory over Georgetown (9-1) before the  largest crowd ever to watch a college basketball game in Brendan Byrne Arena.  </P> <P> The battle between the two Big East Conference unbeaten teams drew 19,761,  breaking both the regular-season arena mark of 18,116 for the North  Carolina-Kentucky game on Dec. 26, 1981 and the postseason mark of 19,633 for  the 1988 NCAA East Regional final when Duke beat Temple.  </P> <P> Mourning finished with 18 points, 8 rebounds and 8 blocked shots against Seton  Hall. The 8 blocks give him 60 for the season. The NCAA record is 207 by Navy's  David Robinson in 35 games in 1985-86.  </P> <P> "I don't go out and look for blocked shots," said Mourning who once blocked 25  shots in an AAU tournament game. "If it's there I go get it. As I've said  before blocking shots is a God-given talent. Larry Bird and Michael Jordan have  exceptional all-around games and that's God-given talent. Blocking shots is the  God-given talent to me."  </P> <P> Kansas 115, Brown 45 -- Milt Newton scored 23 points as the 18th-ranked  Jayhawks broke a 76-year-old record for largest margin of victory by beating  the Bruins in a non-conference game at Lawrence, Kan.  </P> <P> Kansas' largest previous victory was 68-8 over Washington University of St.  Louis in 1913.  </P> <P> Kansas (11-1) led by as many as 74 points.  </P> <P> "We didn't think we were going to cream them," Milt Newton said. "We were just  trying to execute the things we need to do to beat the good teams."  </P> <P> Brown (4-6) made just 18 of 67 shots.  </P> <P> Duke 87, Washington 61 -- John Smith scored 17 points as the top-ranked Blue  Devils defeated the Huskies at Seattle for their ninth consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Danny Ferry scored 16 points for Duke, and Chris Laettner added 13.  </P> <P> Eldridge Recasner and Dion Brown scored 15 each for Washington (3-7), which  lost its fifth straight. West scored 13.  </P> <P> Duke took a 17-6 lead behind a 13-2 spurt over 3:31 of the first half. The Blue  Devils led, 19-12, when Brown was charged with his third foul with 8:18 gone.  </P> <P> The unbeaten Blue Devils then stretched their lead to 31-17 with 6:53 left in  the half. The Huskies closed to 35-30 and 37-32 before Ferry's 3-pointer at the  first-half buzzer gave Duke a 40-32 lead.  </P> <P> Providence 98, St. John's 69 -- Matt Palazzi scored 19 points as the unbeaten  Friars overwhelmed the Redmen in a Big East game at Providence, R.I.  </P> <P> The Friars (11-0 overall and 2-0 in the league) never trailed in the game. St.  Johns is 7-4 overall and 0-2 in the Big East.  </P> <P> Notre Dame 60, Penn 55 -- Joe Fredrick scored 20 points, and the Fighting Irish  beat the Quakers at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Jamere Jackson added 19 points for the Irish (5-1) including 6 straight free  throws in the last 2 minutes to help hold off the Quakers.  </P> <P> Tyrone Gilliams had 18 points and Hassan Duncombe added 16 for Penn (3-5).  </P> <P> Oklahoma 111, Sam Houston St. 66 -- Tony Martin scored a career-high 40 points  at Norman, Okla., as the fourth-ranked Sooners went over 100 points for the  ninth straight time.  </P> <P> Martin, whose previous high was 19 last week against Texas, also had 17  rebounds.  </P> <P> Stacey King missed his third straight game for the Sooners (11-1). He has an  injured finger.  </P> <P> Northwestern 83, Navy 60 -- Walker Lambiotte scored 21 points, and reserve Jeff  Grose scored 13 of his 16 points in the first half, and the Wildcats downed the  Middies at Evanston, Ill.  </P> <P> Brian Schwabe scored 16 points for Northwestern (7-3) off to its best start  under third-year coach Bill Foster.  </P> <P> Navy (3-6) got 20 points from Eddie Reddick.  </P> <P> Army 95, Cornell 79 -- Derrick Canada scored 22 points in the Cadets' win at  West Point, N.Y.  </P> <P> Army (5-5) never trailed after breaking a 24-24 tie midway through the first  half.  </P></p>

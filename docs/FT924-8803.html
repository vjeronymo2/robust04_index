			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Resilient economy helps EVN climb to Sch181m ENERGIE-Versorgung Niedersterreich (EVN), the Austrian electricity and gas utility, reported a 5.9 per cent rise in net profit to Sch181m (Dollars 16.2m) for the year to end-August, thanks mainly to the resilience of the Austrian economy. EVN, which operates in the province of Lower Austria surrounding Vienna, said revenues rose 6.1 per cent to Sch9.85bn and operating profit gained 13.2 per cent to Sch677m. Pre-tax profits were Sch712m, up 0.7 per cent. 'Even in these difficult times of global economic slowdown, our company's performance was satisfactory,' Mr Rudolf Gruber, chairman, said. The directors have recommended a 5.6 per cent rise in the dividend to Sch19 per share. Revenues from electricity rose 10.2 per cent to Sch6.7bn but gas revenues eased 3.5 per cent to Sch2.8bn. Demand from gas-fired power stations declined because hydro stations were more productive.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan and the United States Should Stop Going </F> Round in Circles and Start Constructive Discussions"]    [Text] No progress whatsoever has been achieved in the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks no matter how many times  meetings have been held. The Clinton administration of the  United States wants to introduce numerical targets, but Japan  argues that this would lead to managed trade. Japan offers  counterarguments but does not come up with anything to break the  deadlock. It seems that both sides have been bogged down right  at the beginning of the talks. If such a confrontation  persists, there will be chaos in the post-cold war world  economy. Now is the time to transcend such theoretical debate  of free trade or managed trade, and get right on to more  constructive discussions from a global viewpoint.    Japan and the United States are supposed to reach agreement  in the areas of automobiles and auto parts, insurance, and  government procurement before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting on  11 February. Yet, U.S. negotiators claim that the talks "have  not moved one inch forward" (according to Under Secretary of  Commerce Jeffrey Garten). Japanese negotiators also admit that  both sides are merely repeating the points they have made at the  beginning. Have the two countries come to a dead end?    The perception gap between Japan and the United States seems  to be growing all the time. The Clinton administration is  apparently under the impression that "Japan, Inc.," with  politicians, bureaucrats, and businesses all cooperating  closely, still exists and functions. This can be seen from the  U.S. attempt to set an import target for automobiles and auto  parts, and rely on the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry's administrative guidance [gyosei shido] to make the  automobile industry comply. However, in Japan today, the  validity of administrative guidance itself is being questioned.  If the Clinton administration's demand is accommodated, this  will run counter to the Hosokawa administration's policy of  reforming the economic system into a more transparent one.    On the other hand, since the Clinton administration came to  power, there has been a stronger tie between the U.S. Government  and the businesses. It seems that a "United States, Inc." is  being created through the government's industrial policy. Under  the new administration, a reversal in economic systems in Japan  and the United States is taking place.  <H5>  "Mistaken Notions" and "Overconfidence" </H5>   Just as the Clinton administration holds on to its mistaken  notions, the Hosokawa administration clings to its amae. Japan  is facing its worst economic recession in the postwar years. It  also has to deal with political reform. Moreover, Prime  Minister Hosokawa's personal relationship with President Clinton  is good. It seems that the Hosokawa administration has the  easygoing notion that even if it is not able to work on  negotiations with the United States amid the difficult domestic  situation, the United States would understand.    However, the Clinton administration is trying to add  momentum  to its foreign economic strategy. After enacting the North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and concluding the GATT  multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round), it is now  focusing on results in the Japan-U.S. framework talks.    Another factor in the growing perception gap between the two  countries is that, since the end of the cold war, the Western  countries have lost the impelling reason to unite under the free  economy ideology, and short-term economic interests of  individual countries have come into serious conflict. Compared  to the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative talks, the  framework talks have evidently been a venue for much greater  assertiveness on both sides.    This in itself is a sign that the negotiations are being  conducted in the Western style. The problems is: While  negotiations between the United States and the European  countries, no matter how intense they may become, are still  conducted with the tacit understanding that this is a game in a  ring of shared values, the United Staes feels that negotiating  with Japan is an entirely alien game. At this point,  Kasumigaseki [the bureaucracy] is beginning to get tough,  asserting "if there should be a breakdown in the negotiations,  this cannot be helped." Behind this is the overconfident  assumption that Japan-U.S. relations have matured to a degree  comparable to U.S.-European relations.    Negotiators on both side also have to take some of the  responsibility. We are disappointed that Under Secretary of the  Treasury Lawrence H. Summers and Under Secretary of State Joan  E. Spero, who have been quite popular among the Japanese  economic circles as believers in free trade, insisted on setting  numerical targets. The U.S. trade strategy, the idea of  numerical targets, is being opposed by all major U.S.  economists, including Professor William R. Cline, Nobel Prize  winner for economics. Numerical targets are undoubtedly  incompatible with the economists' theories.    The defensive stance on the part of Japanese officials,  which  irritates U.S. negotiators so much, is also at fault. While  Japanese officials in charge of economic affairs are  sufficiently trained to argue back at their negotiating  partners, they have not thought about the serious consequences a  deadlock in the negotiations may bring on post-cold war  Japan-U.S. relations as a whole.    First, negotiators on both sides should go back to the  agreement made between Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and  President Clinton in July 1993. While some say this was an  11th-hour compromise made during the last days of the Liberal  Democratic Party regime, it has to be respected, in any case,  because an agreement is an agreement. That agreement says that  Japan should aim at "fully meaningful" reduction of its current  accounts surplus, and set certain "objective criteria" to gauge  market opening in specific sectors.    With regard to "objective criteria," the United States  demands that the share of foreign products in the Japanese  market should be comparable to their share in the other G-7  nations. It claims that this is not a target, but a basis for  gauging the openness of the market. However, Japan, from its  bitter experience with the Japan- U.S. semiconductor agreement,  where market share percentages became the numerical target,  remains suspicious. It continues to resist the setting of any  criteria that may lead to numerical targets.  <H5>  Global Perspective Needed </H5>   This is not a time for Japan to just keep on saying "no." If  it thinks U.S. demands will lead to managed trade, it has to  come up with concrete proposals to open the market which will  not lead to managed trade. Now is the time to use our heads to  come up not only with counterarguments, but also  counterproposals.    We also hope that the United States will modify its stance  of  being preoccupied with numbers. It should not be impatient to  see immediate "results," but should seek more long-term results.  It is also important that U.S. demands should be in line with  efforts to make the Japanese economic system more transparent,  and more open. The U.S. attempt to take advantage of Japanese  administrative guidance in the automobile sector, and its demand  in the insurance sector which virtually goes against the trend  of liberalization are quite illogical.    It is also questionable that the Clinton administration  should allude to the revival of the Super 301 provision in  connection with the framework talks. This runs counter to the  agreement reached at the Uruguay Round to do away with  unilateral trade measures.    What is important for both Japan and the United States is to  see things from the perspective of how the G-2 (Japan and the  United States) should rehabilitate the post-cold war world  economy. In a global economy where national boundaries do not  exist for goods, money, and information, there is growing  interdependence between companies of various nations, while,  similarly, conficts tend to be more acute. There can be no  stability in the world economy as long as the Japanese and U.S.  Governments continue their confrontation. Japan and the United  States have to transcend bilateralism to jointly manage the new  post-Uruguay Round world economic system.    This is not a time for confrontation and talking round in  circles. It is high time to reconstruct a globally oriented  Japan- U.S. relationship.</p>

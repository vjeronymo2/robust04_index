If a national referendum on EU membership  were to be organized now, 38 percent of all Finns would vote for  membership and 41 percent against membership. Last April the  configuration was the other way round: Forty-three percent would  have voted for and 40 percent against it.    The same polling institute conducted the interviews for the  Eurobarometer and the HS [HELSINGIN SANOMAT]-Gallup poll, and  the number of persons interviewed was almost the same, but the  questions differed from one another. The gap between supporters  and opponents is so small in both polls that in reality their  number may be the same, about 40 percent. On the basis of all  the polls, however, the change in support for membership in the  EU is unmistakable: Within a year and a half support for it has  dropped by 20 percentage points.    Eurobarometer polls have been conducted in Finland since the  spring of 1992.    The Economic Commission, the Economic Information Office,  and  the Foreign Ministry pay for Finland's Eurobarometer. The same  poll is conducted with the same questions twice a year in the EU  member countries, commissioned by the European Commission.    The November interviews were conducted between 11 and 26  November in Finland. The number of people interviewed was 995.  The sampling represents the population of Finland 15 years of  age or older. The designation European Community (EC) was still  used for the European Union in the questions.    When the different countries' polls are compared, it becomes  evident that the way Finns feel about European integration and  more extensive cooperation with the EU is similar to the way the  English and the Danes feel: on average more critical and more  negative.    They have not yet had time to summarize the results in  Sweden  and Norway. On the basis of an opinion poll published in  Stockholm on Thursday, Swedes clearly feel more negative than  Finns about their country's membership in the EU. Twenty-six  percent now support it in Sweden and nearly 45 percent oppose it.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2. Simplified LDR Notification Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Comments on LDR notification requirements at the roundtable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranged from suggestions that EPA should eliminate notifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> altogether to suggestions that EPA modify or delete data items on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the notification. In response, EPA proposed to eliminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement at 40 CFR 268.7(a)(1)(ii) and at 268.9(d)(1) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification include treatment standards or references to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. It was argued that such a simplification makes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular sense in conjunction with EPA's proposal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidate the treatment standard tables. Commenters on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue all supported this proposed simplification. EPA is thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dropping the treatment standard or reference to the treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard from the LDR notification in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's action does not eliminate the existing requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to identify the constituents in F001&hyph;F005 spent solvent wastes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F039 wastes, or the underlying hazardous constituents in D001,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D002, and in TC organic wastes, unless the generator/treater is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> going to monitor for all hazardous constituents in the waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the regulatory language is made clearer, and there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer any requirement that the corresponding constituent level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be included with the constituents identified on the LDR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification for these wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> IV. Treatment Standards for Toxicity Characteristic Waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> A. Introduction_Content and Scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EPA is promulgating treatment standards for the newly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified toxicity characteristic (TC) organic wastes (D018&hyph; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D043) as proposed. These are identical to the UTS in today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. The UTS apply to the underlying hazardous constituents in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the TC waste as well as the individual constituent responsible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the TC designation. Underlying hazardous constituents are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any constituents in &sect;268.48 which are reasonably expected to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present at levels above the UTS at the point of generation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TC waste. (See definition at &sect;268.2(i).) Although the intent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's regulations is to require treating all underlying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous constituents present plus the TC constituent, today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule calls for generators to monitor only the TC constituent and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those underlying hazardous constituents ``reasonably expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be present'' in their waste at its point of generation. Today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule is promulgating the compliance monitoring provisions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were proposed. Section X of this preamble (Compliance Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Notification) discusses them in detail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested that EPA promulgate alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards of incineration (INCIN), fuel substitution (FSUBS) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery of organics (RORGS) for these wastes. These commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pointed to the Interim Final Rule of May 24, 1993 (58 FR 29867)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where EPA extended the use of these methods of treatment to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D001 wastes disposed outside CWA or CWA-equivalent impoundments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or Safe Drinking Water Act regulated Class I underground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injection wells. EPA is not adopting this approach in today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule for TC organic wastes. First, EPA does not believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods of treatment intended to address organic constituents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will always adequately address any underlying metal constituents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present in these wastes. In addition, the Agency has not yet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been able to completely evaluate the appropriateness of requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified treatment technologies for TC wastes and other wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 1. Waste Management Systems Affected by Today's Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In terms of waste management systems, today's rule applies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to those TC wastes which are managed in systems other than: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater treatment systems which include surface impoundments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose ultimate discharge is subject to the Clean Water Act (CWA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) zero dischargers who, before permanent land disposal of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater, treat the wastewaters in a CWA-equivalent wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment system; or, (3) Class I underground injection wells  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Underground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Injection Control (UIC) program. CWA-equivalent treatment means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological treatment for organics, reduction of hexavalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chromium, precipitation/sedimentation for metals, alkaline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chlorination or ferrous sulfate precipitation of cyanide (to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent these constituents are present in the untreated influent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to wastewater treatment systems), or treatment that the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can show performs as well or better than these enumerated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies. See &sect;268.37(a), 58 FR at 29885 (May 24, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organic TC wastes managed in these types of systems will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated in the next LDR rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, ``decharacterizing'' the TC wastes regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under this rule by rendering them noncharacteristic does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remove them from the scope of these regulations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chemical Waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  EPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 976 F. 2d at 14&hyph;15. Consequently today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule will apply to some injection practices, in particular,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those involving Class V injection wells. These typically are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wells injecting nonhazardous wastes above or into underground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources of drinking water. (If, however, the TC wastes injected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into non-Class I wells were to be treated by CWA-equivalent means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before injection, today's treatment standards would not apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is an example of the type of zero discharger referred to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

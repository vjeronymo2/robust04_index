			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: ML back in the black with Pounds 2m ML Holdings, the aerospace, defence and electronics group which launched a Pounds 14.3m rescue rights issue in January, returned to the black in the six months to September 30. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 2.1m, compared with losses of Pounds 1.5m. Mr Howard Grant, chief executive, said the figures - 'the first meaningful set of results since the rights issue' - confirmed the group's recovery. But the board deferred a decision on a dividend until the end of the financial year. Turnover improved by 7 per cent, from Pounds 40.2m to Pounds 43.1m. The group has cut almost 190 jobs compared with the previous half, so that sales per employee were ahead 24 per cent. Mr Grant said progress had been made in all three divisions. Aerospace and marine boosted operating profits by 81 per cent to Pounds 1.41m on flat turnover of Pounds 17.8m. Group borrowings, at Pounds 14.9m, were marginally higher than at the year end, reflecting the timing of some big contract payments, mainly for aircraft. The electronic component distribution division lifted operating profits 70 per cent to Pounds 1.18m, while the aircraft and cargo handling division returned to the black with a contribution of Pounds 120,000 (Pounds 157,000 loss). Gearing stood at 60 per cent at the end of the half, compared with 125 per cent. Earnings per share were 1.1p (2.6p loss).</p>

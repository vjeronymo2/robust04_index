			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the Respondent fails either to request a hearing or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit evidence in lieu of a hearing, he would be in default  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 113(d)(3) of the Act. That section states that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty assessed by the field citation becomes final where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent fails to request a hearing within the time required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the implementing regulation. In the case of a Respondent's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> default by failure to request a hearing, Agency counsel is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required under this proposal to file, within ten days, a written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justification for the penalty imposed by the field citation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At any time prior to final Agency action, a disputed field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citation may be settled by a consent order. The consent order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may conclude the citation in whole or in part, and may contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions. Upon service, the consent order constitutes a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order that is not appealable. Additionally, the field citation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be revoked by the Agency, in whole or in part and without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prejudice, prior to payment of the penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed part 59 procedures, the prehearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conference is optional. The purposes of the conference, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be held no later than thirty days after the Respondent's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response, are to simplify issues and to attempt to reach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stipulations of fact. The Presiding Officer may also set the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time and place for the hearing and schedule an information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchange during the prehearing conference. Within twenty days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following the prehearing conference, the Presiding Officer may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue a written prehearing order to memorialize the rulings made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the conference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each party has the authority to require that the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide it with certain information. The information that may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchanged is limited to: (1) Documents intended to be introduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the hearing that have not already been filed with the Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clerk; (2) witness lists, qualifications of expert witnesses and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the subject matter of intended witness testimony; and (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information known to the Respondent relating to the Respondent's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inability to pay a civil penalty, economic benefit of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance; and good faith efforts to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable Clean Air Act requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hearings on field citations will be conducted by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impartial Presiding Officer who, in most cases, will be the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Judicial Officer or the Regional Judicial Officer. Such Judicial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer will be an Agency employee who may perform other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions within the Agency, but who has no prior connection with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case being presided over.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Presiding Officer and other officials involved in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deciding the case are prohibited under today's rule from engaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in ex parte contacts with interested parties both inside and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside of the Agency. The prohibition applies to the Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator as well as to his advisors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Presiding Officer is required to schedule a hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expeditiously. An extension of time for scheduling the hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is only authorized for good cause and if no prejudice results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hearing procedures provide that the Respondent may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represented by counsel. The Agency representative initiates the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing by introducing into evidence the field citation and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant material supporting its issuance. The Respondent or his  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counsel may then provide facts, statements, arguments, documents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testimony and other exculpatory evidence responding to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence presented. Although the Presiding Officer may limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of witnesses and determine the appropriate form of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testimony, either party has the right to cross-examine a witness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who has provided direct testimony. The opportunity for rebuttal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and response to rebuttal, falls within the Presiding Officer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the informal nature of the proceedings, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer is not bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Presiding Officer is, however, authorized to take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative notice of pertinent matters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 113(e) of the Act contains criteria that must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in assessing whether the field citation penalty is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. Under today's proposal, the Presiding Officer is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to consider these criteria when reviewing the assessed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty. Those criteria include: The size of the business; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impact of the penalty on the business; the Respondent's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full compliance history; the Respondent's good faith efforts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply; the duration of the violation as established by any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credible evidence; payment by the Respondent of penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously assessed for the same violation; the economic benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of noncompliance; the seriousness of the violation; and such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other factors as justice may require. Some or all of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria may be relevant to the issues presented in the case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the Presiding Officer. The burden of proof with respect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to these criteria is assigned to the party with access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information concerning the particular factor. Consequently, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency must provide evidence regarding the duration and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seriousness of the violation, and the Respondent must provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence regarding the other criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is considering adopting a similar approach where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty assessment becomes final under section 113(d)(3) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act because a respondent fails either to request a hearing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit evidence in lieu of a hearing within the time required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulations. When such a default occurs, the penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed by the field citation becomes final by operation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 113(d)(3). As previously discussed, under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, Agency counsel would then submit a written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justification for the record concerning the amount of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed penalty. EPA is considering adopting a regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumption that in cases of such default the penalty assessed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the field citation would be presumed to be appropriate with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to those penalty assessment criteria where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations would place the burden of going forward on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondent if a hearing had been requested. The purpose of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumption would be to clarify the requirements of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 113(e) in such a default situation, and at the same time, reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the authority of the agency to establish reasonable presumptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the circumstances of a case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hearing will normally be tape recorded, unless the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties decide otherwise in the interests of preventing a serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delay in the proceedings. Tape recording the proceedings is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desirable to develop a clear administrative record for later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review. Transcription of the proceedings is not required, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be made by a party, at its own expense, or may be ordered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Presiding Officer. Any party causing a transcript to be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must provide copies to the other party and to the Presiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer. The transcript then becomes a part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The parties are permitted to submit a written statement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Presiding Officer's consideration within a reasonable time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the hearing. The written statements, which may only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address matters raised at the hearing, may be in the form of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As soon as practicable after the hearing, the Presiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer is required to prepare a recommended decision in the case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on substantial evidence in the administrative record as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whole. The recommended decision will recommend either that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> field citation be affirmed, modified or withdrawn. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended decision must be filed with the Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator. Within a reasonable time after receipt of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended decision, the Regional Administrator may either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affirm, reverse, modify or remand the case to the Presiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer for further proceedings. The Regional Administrator may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compromise, modify, or remit the penalty assessed by the field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citation, with or without conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

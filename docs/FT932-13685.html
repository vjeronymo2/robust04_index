			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Leading Article: Wage follies AFTER THE breaching of the Berlin Wall 3 1/2 years ago, a minority of observers predicted unification would spell East Germany's industrial doomsday. The scale of the manufacturing collapse in a state once regarded as the jewel in Comecon's rusted crown has, however, exceeded all expectations. In view of competition with the west, and the shrinking of Comecon markets, a large decline was inevitable. It has however been magnified by the misguided post-unity drive to align wages in both parts of Germany, which has eliminated many east German companies' survival chances. German employers are thus right to describe as 'economic suicide' the attempt by IG Metall, the engineering union, to force through a plan for further large wage rises. Strike ballots will be held next week to determine whether from May 3 eastern Germany will witness its first full-scale industrial conflict for 60 years. IG Metall wants to sustain a 1991 accord for a 26 per cent wage rise in the electrical and metal sectors. Employers say they cannot afford a rise beyond east Germany's 9 per cent inflation rate. IG Metall, probably rightly, fears employers' success in rewriting the 1991 deal would encourage them to unravel job-protecting aspects of west German collective bargaining agreements. Large German companies, hit by the D-Mark's appreciation and excessive pay increases, are already intensifying efforts to cut western manufacturing costs. The dispute has repercussions beyond Germany's borders. By promising east Germans speedy accession to western living standards, west German politicians and industrialists hoped to keep east Germans sufficiently quiescent to limit westwards migration. The ensuing large fiscal transfers to east Germany have however stoked inflationary pressures. And these have driven the Bundesbank into interest rate policies which have caused or prolonged recession in much of Europe. Even if IG Metall won a confrontation with employers, the fruits of victory for its dwindling east German membership would be bitter. Unrealistic wage increases would spur more plant closures, increase unemployment, and encourage more companies to opt out of the centralised wage agreements the union wants so fiercely to keep intact. Germany needs the social consensus that trade unions have helped foster since the second world war. But Germany also needs more economic flexibility to allow companies, organisations and workers to adjust to the nation's strained circumstances. Hastening industrial destruction in an area representing the European Community's largest depressed region is the wrong way either to maintain German trade unions' standing in society, or to achieve the wider objective of making unification a success. There is still time for a face-saving compromise. But it is fast running out.</p>

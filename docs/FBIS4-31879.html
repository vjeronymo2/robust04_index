			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 15 (CTK) -- Czech arms exports last  year totalled $167 million, the Czech daily TELEGRAF writes  today, quoting Bretislav Gregr, director of Special Materials  Department at the Ministry of Industry and Trade. This year has  seen a rise in the number of trade licences, the paper says.    Gregr's department, dealing with imports and exports of  arms,  processes licence applications which are required for each  individual deal. The ministry issued 258 licences in 1993 for  exports valued at $167 million and 108 licences for imports  worth $42 million involving 52 trading partners from across the  world. Thirty five Czech companies trade arms at present.    Almost three-quarters of the trade last year were made up of  aircraft, including spare parts, and one-tenth of the total was  made up by surplus army vehicles. Guns accounted for about  three percent of the trade, with pistols for the Turkish police  being the largest single delivery.    Imports consisted largely of spare parts, while special  small  arms for the Interior Ministry were also an important purchase.    This year the ministry has issued more licences than in the  same period a year ago but this is no indication of a growing  volume of trade since some of the deals may fall through. But  expectations are that export will grow this year with aircraft,  aircraft spare parts and surplus army vehicles remaining the  main contributors. Licencing is subject to approval by the  Foreign Ministry.</p>

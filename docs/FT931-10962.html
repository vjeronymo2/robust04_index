			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Barclays to shed further 450 jobs BARCLAYS BANK is to shed 450 jobs in order to centralise processing of cheques and credit at its Northampton clearing centre, John Gapper writes. The jobs form part of the 9,000 total the bank expects to lose over the next three years. The bank also said it would cut 1,000 jobs in London with the closure of its clearing centre there, but would create an additional 450 posts in Northampton. The move to Northampton will take place over the next four years. Barclays said it could not rule out some compulsory redundancies. The move was described as 'a bitter blow' by the Bifu banking union.</p>

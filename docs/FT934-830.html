			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Caution on plan for Gas The market registered its displeasure over the government's moves to remove British Gas's monopoly in the domestic gas market and to impose a split of the company's trading and transportation divisions. British Gas shares, which reached an all-time high of 360p only last week, came under increasingly intense pressure yesterday, sliding to a day's low of 346p before stabilising and closing a net 10 off at 347p. Turnover of 10m shares was well above the stock's usual levels of activity. Energy specialists said the real disappointment for the market came with news that competition in the domestic gas market will hit British Gas much sooner than the industry and the City had expected. 'Competition is coming early; British Gas now faces a progressive attack on the most profitable segments of its business; the shares remain a sell,' said the oil and gas team at Nomura. The curtain came down on the interim results season from the utilities sectors with a top of the range interim payment from Wessex Water. But not even a 9.6 per cent increase in the dividend could prevent Wessex shares mirroring a broad retreat by the utilities following publication of the government's proposals for British Gas. Wessex shares opened higher at 722p, buoyed by the dividend news, but quickly fell away to end the session a net 3 down at 714p. Increases in dividends announced by the water companies in recent weeks have averaged around 8 per cent. Market worries about increased regulatory vigilance now focus on the water regulator's periodic review time-table, which next summer will see Ofwat announce the companies' individual 'K factors', their regulatory pricing formulae. The FT-SE 100 constituents showed falls of 14 common to Anglian Water, 592p, and Severn Trent, 604p, while Thames dropped 16 to 580p and North West 11 to 581p. The power generators, however, held up well as the market continued to adopt the view that a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is still avoidable if PowerGen and National Power can reach agreement on prices and power station sales to help increase competition. National Power settled a shade higher at 475p and PowerGen eased 4 to 535p. The regional electricity companies performed badly, similarly affected by fears that Offer, the electricity regulator, will harden its attitude on K factors. Southern, the only rec in the FT-SE 100, lost 7 at 700p. A negative note from NatWest Securities triggered renewed weakness in Enterprise Oil, which retreated 12 to 454p. NatWest cast doubts on the security of Enterprise's dividend 'if oil prices stabilise below Dollars 16 a barrel', and said Enterprise is currently trading at 'a huge 52 per cent premium to our asset value of 305p based on Dollars 16 real oil prices; and even at a 19 per cent premium to our Dollars 18 asset value of 391p'. Conglomerate Hanson eased 3 to 273 1/2 p after reports that it was considering a possible bid of up to Dollars 3bn for all, or part of, Borden, the US food and chemicals group. Internationally traded pharmaceutical issues were weak again in response to a lacklustre New York market. Glaxo slipped 4 to 703p and Zeneca 6 to 795p. The bid talk that had previously given some relief to troubled Fisons was not in evidence and the shares receded 3 to 112p. The first of what is expected to be a rush of property groups seeking market listings was provided by Chelsfield. The shares made their debut at 155p and finished at 180p. Several other private companies are in the process of preparing for flotation, taking advantage of investor appetite for the sector and raising valuable investment funds in the process. The potential market value of the companies is in excess of Pounds 1bn. A tumble by the Hong Kong market, plus news that an inquiry into the Bombay stock market scandal had called for severe punishments to be imposed on the four international banks involved, put Standard Chartered shares under pressure. They dropped to 1062p early in the session, before rallying to end 15 off at 1179p. Turnover reached an above average 1.5m shares. Bank of Scotland was active and lost 6 at 225p, with James Capel thought to have adopted a more cautious stance on the stock. Profit-taking lowered TSB 4 to 253p, with turnover expanding to 3.2m shares. However, there was always good underlying support for the shares, according to dealers, with persistent bid stories underscored by expectations of a good set of preliminary figures when the bank reports in mid-January. A Kleinwort Benson buy recommendation was responsible for driving housebuilder Wilson Connolly 14 ahead to a year's best of 213p - within 10 of the stock's all-time high reached in July 1987. The beleaguered food retail sector's recent good run came to an end on rumours that a renewed price initiative was being kept under wraps for the new year by one of the leading supermarket groups. Tesco was the worst hit, retreating 9 to 211p. J. Sainsbury slid 13 1/2 to 435p, while Argyll Group fell 8 to 280p. Among food manufacturers, an upbeat trading message by the chairman of Berisford International helped the shares climb 5 to 111p. Elsewhere, the sector steadied in the face of a weak market. Both Unilever and United Biscuits trod water, while Northern Foods was squeezed up 6 to 217p and Cadbury-Schweppes added 7 at 513p. NatWest Securities was said to be pointing out the merits of Hillsdown Holdings, ahead 3 at 160p. Profit-takers were out in force in the drinks sector. Grand Metropolitan was one of the few to escape, the shares catching up from their recent subdued run and rallying 6 1/2 to 466p. Greenalls' good form continued, adding 5 at 455p. British Aerospace gained 5 at 406p, with dealers citing the recent recommendation from SG Warburg. Rolls-Royce shed 3 1/2 to 163p as one broker, believed to be NatWest Securities, was telling clients to sell the stock down to 155p. Powerscreen International, which recently rebuffed allegations of a tax probe that had undermined the shares, continued its recovery, putting on 5 at 308p. Simon Engineering rose 5 to 121p following comment on the recent sale of TR Oil Services. Weir Group firmed 8 to 291p, with Credit Lyonnais Laing said to be recommending the stock.</p>

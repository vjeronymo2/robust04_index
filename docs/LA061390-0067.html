			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURVEY TO TAKE THE MEASURE OF L.A.'S ARTISTIC TASTES;  </P> <P> ARTS: THE STUDY WILL BE USED TO SHAPE LOS ANGELES' CULTURAL MASTERPLAN.  </P> <P> The U.S. Census Bureau isn't the only organization that's got your number. If  you're on the mailing list of any arts organization in L.A. County, you may  receive a detailed survey this week asking questions about your theatergoing  experiences, what prevents you from attending art exhibits, and where you like  to go to see arts events.  </P> <P> The 40-question survey -- 5,000 of which have been sent out to artists and  audience members throughout the county -- is part of a study that will be used  to shape Los Angeles' five-year Cultural Masterplan. An additional 2,000  surveys will be mailed next week to arts organizations throughout the county.  </P> <P> "It's a really important survey because it's an opportunity to collect  information about all of the arts community," said Moira Adams, project manager  for Morris McNeill, the L.A. research firm conducting the study. "The study  will be used to set the goals and plans for arts spending for the next five  years."  </P> <P> Adams said the 5,000 artists and arts goers who have been sent the study were  chosen from 200,000 names compiled from nearly 100 mailing lists from diverse  arts organizations such as the Music Center, the Korean Cultural Center and  Plaza de la Raza. Those receiving the survey were chosen so as to reflect  artists and audience members from all disciplines and ethnic groups, she said.  </P> <P> "In the audience survey, we ask questions about their general opinions,  questions like what they want to see funded, where they want to see arts  presented, what disciplines they're interested in, how often they attend, and  what they think the purpose of art is," Adams said. "This will give us general  opinion information as to how people perceive the arts and whether they think  it is important for Los Angeles to be a major arts center."  </P> <P> Adams explained that the survey's results will also be used for a Nexus Study  that is required before the Percent for Art program -- which allocates 1% of  the cost of private commercial developments to the city's arts fund -- can be  put into effect. The latter study is the result of a new state law which  requires that cities show a connection between fees on developments and what  the revenues will be spent on.  </P> <P> "We have to show a link between commercial development and increased cultural  facilities, and we're hoping through this survey to get information on which to  base that connection," Adams said. "What we want to show is that increased  development brings more people into the area, which brings an increased burden  on the cultural services. . . . (But) we expect some of the developers might  challenge that connection in court, so our research has to be very sound so it  stands up. . . . The response to this survey is very critical."  </P> <P> Adams added that the artists' survey will ask questions about work spaces,  demographics, funding and other areas in an attempt to "really get a sense of  what their needs are . . . in all the disciplines and in all ethnic groups."  </P></p>

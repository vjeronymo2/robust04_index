			<p>BFN     [Text] In a message to the local and international  community published on 16 May 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF] chairman, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, denounced the clique  of politicians and Army officers who have plunged the country  into bloodshed that is unprecedented in this country. The RPF  chairman prays for those who have lost their loved ones in this  bloodshed and commends the efforts and sacrifices of the RPF  youth in their endeavors to liberate our country.    The RPF chairman said that the Republican National Movement  for Democracy and Development [MRND] political party, in  conjunction with small political parties opposed to the Arusha  peace agreements, are responsible for the bloodshed in Rwanda.  They killed politicians who were fighting the truth, they shed  the blood of innocent people. These political parties ignored  the process of setting up a government that respects the rule of  law and ignored the respect of human rights. These political  parties violated multiparty democracy and went against the  spirit of ethnic tolerance.    The RPF chairman said that the RPF cannot accept any  negotiations with this clique of politicians who staged a coup  against the Arusha peace agreements. The RPF chairman said that  negotiating a settlement with these killers would be the same as  endorsing the atrocities that the clique has been committing.  The RPF chairman said that the RPF has made a concession and  agreed to talk with the Rwandan Government forces. These talks  are being arranged and the RPF fully supports them.    The RPF chairman said that the UN secretary general special  representative to Rwanda, Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, has been  biased against the RPF and has also been giving false reports  concerning the situation in Rwanda. And as such, the RPF does  not want to have anything to do with Dr. Jacques-Roger  Booh-Booh. The RPF chairman said that Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh  has failed to be a mediator and has been working with the  killers openly. Jacques- Roger Booh-Booh has been working with  the dictatorship in Rwanda and with the Coalition for the  Defense of the Republic political party. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh  has also been working with the current illegitimate government  in Rwanda which he helped to install.    Concerning the deployment of UN forces to Rwanda, the RPF  chairman said that the RPF would accept in principle the  deployment of the UN forces to Rwanda with a humanitarian  mission. The RPF chairman said that the RPF is currently  engaged in the following priorities: 1) to assist people who  have survived the massacres, 2) to fight and neutralize the  clique of Rwandan Government forces who are responsible for the  genocide in Rwanda and to restore peace in the country, and 3)  to call upon the international community to set up a commission  of inquiry to investigate the massacres in Rwanda so that those  responsible can be brought to justice. This set of priorities  will soon be realized. The RPF has already liberated more than  half of the country. RPF civilian cadets are now organizing the  displaced people so as to facilitate the administration and  distribution of humanitarian aid and to enable the people to  return to their homes.    The RPF has established some administrative structures in  areas that have been liberated, and peace and tranquillity have  returned to these areas. People have returned to their homes  and have started growing their crops in order to benefit from  the current rains. The RPF chairman is therefore calling upon  those who have been displaced to return to their homes in the  RPF-controlled area so that they can take advantage of the rains  to grow their crops. The RPF chairman said that even the members  of the Interahamwe [MRND militias] who are ready to put down  their arms and stop their barbaric acts may return to their  homes and start normal life.    The RPF chairman appealed to the people of Rwanda that  madness and barbaric acts should be replaced with sanity.  Ethnic discrimination and ethnic supremacy should be replaced  with the rule of law, unity, and equality among Rwandan  citizens. The RPF chairman therefore appealed to all the  Rwandan citizens, and particularly the members of the RPF, to  calm down and desist from vengeance-based violence.    The RPF chairman said that the fundamental principles of the  RPF have not changed. We are still committed to national unity,  democracy, and security of persons and property. The RPF still  supports the principles enshrined in the Arusha peace  agreements: rule of law, respect of human rights, multiparty  democracy, the principle of power-sharing and formation of a  single national Army. The RPF chairman called upon the people of  Rwanda to support the above principles because this is the only  remedy to Rwanda's problems. All of us together shall win, said  the chairman of the RPF, Col. Alexis Kanyarengwe.</p>

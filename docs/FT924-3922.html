			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Gas groups warm to Argentine sell-off ARGENTINA'S state-owned gas industry has been sold to private investors in a sale valuing it at Dollars 4.2bn, almost double the anticipated value. The results of Argentina's largest privatisation will mean Dollars 680m of cash flowing to the Argentine Treasury and the cancellation of almost Dollars 3.6bn face value of government debt, with a market value of Dollars 1.7bn. The sale - the largest energy privatisation outside the UK - has meant splitting the state monopoly, Gas del Estado, into two transportation companies and eight distribution companies. Between 60 and 90 per cent of these companies are being sold to operators in the privatisation. Bidding groups led by Enron of the US and Nova Corporation of Canada secured the transportation companies, while two Italian companies - Italgas and Camuzzi - were prominent bidders for distribution companies. Three distribution companies went to a second round of bidding, including the two largest based in Buenos Aires. British Gas was said to be well positioned to win a significant stake in at least one of the two companies in the capital. The success of the gas sale - assuming the promised payments are made - will bolster the economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, whose economic programme has over the past two months faced significant pressure. The government hopes the signing, beginning on Sunday, of a debt relief deal with international banks should further aid the programme. The size of the response to the privatisation appeared to reflect enthusiasm by international gas companies over a rare opportunity to take a significant stake in an important gas utility and also to operate the company. Mr Carlo da Molo, chairman of Italgas, the Italian state-controlled gas distribution group which won two concessions, said that in spite of continuing economic difficulties, 'Argentina is a country with great potential, in which a process of reorganisation and development is now taking place. But our commitment is cushioned by a sense of caution based on adequate profitability criteria'. Italgas said its engineers believed its two companies had the highest growth potential of any of the gas distribution areas put up for tender. Though the company holds only 25 per cent of the winning consortium, with the remainder held by the Argentine Sideco group, it will be the technical operator for distributing gas in the two regions. Gas del Estado's 1992 sales are expected to reach Dollars 1.5bn, and next year local natural gas demand is expected to rise to gross Dollars 2bn. The privatisation, the advisers to which were NM Rothschild of the UK and Goldman, Sachs of New York, entails initial tariff reductions for industries and businesses of about 18 per cent and a rise in rates for residential consumers of about 8 per cent. In addition to the cash and debt offered, the new operators will have to buy the Dollars 157m of working capital held by the companies and take on Dollars 790m of debts. An initial public offering of minority stakes in the larger companies will follow in the international and domestic markets. Ten per cent of each will be held in trust for employees. The aim of the government, which has been advised by the World Bank, has been to privatise and deregulate the industry at the same time. The new system, combining elements of US and UK industry regulation, allows for the free bidding by distributors for gas supplies at the well-head, but has regulated the costs for the transportation of gas, limiting yearly price increases to less than the rate of inflation through the so-called 'RPI minus x' formula.</p>

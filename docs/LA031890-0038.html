			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> THREATENED COLOMBIANS DEAL WITH ANXIETY, ISOLATION  </P> <P> For Colombians battling the drug establishment, life is lived in a sealed,  guarded box. Breaking out can mean death at the hands of terrorists waiting  patiently outside.  </P> <P> Jaime Pardo Leal, the leftist Union Patriotic Party leader, ventured out in  1987, only to be assassinated as he drove near his farm west of Bogota.  </P> <P> So stifling had his box become that Pardo "said that life was ending for him,"  said a friend, Bogota criminal court Judge Consuelo Herrera.  </P> <P> "He couldn't go to public places. He felt his intimacy with his family was  being destroyed by the presence of bodyguards and security measures. Finally he  couldn't take it anymore and broke out."  </P> <P> A normal reaction, psychologists say, for the politicians, journalists, judges  and others living under death threats from the cocaine cartels.  </P> <P> Often, a deadly one.  </P> <P> Herrera said Pardo had begun to drive with his family to their farm without  first telling the national intelligence police, who had been providing  bodyguards for him.  </P> <P> "He was killed because he did not have the necessary protection. He always said  that he was not important enough for anyone to try to kill him," Herrera said  in an interview.  </P> <P> So alarmed is the nation over death threats -- and the threat of threats --  that executives have become accustomed to traveling with bodyguards carrying  submachine guns. Private guards wearing bulletproof vests and dark glasses can  often be seen standing outside chic restaurants while their charges dine.  </P> <P> Although Herrera said she has not been threatened, other judges have.  Thirty-six have been assassinated over the last 12 years.  </P> <P> "The first response by many people who have received a threat is to try to put  it out of their mind," Bogota psychologist Leonidas Castro said in a recent  interview.  </P> <P> "It is most important that people at risk take an active role in protecting  themselves, that they avoid the image of themselves as helpless targets," said  Castro, who specializes in treating the stress and anxiety of high-risk  officials. "That feeling of helplessness is the source for anxiety that can be  as bad or worse than the threat itself."  </P> <P> Many threatened Colombians, Herrera said, "feel alone and won't talk about the  problem, but I've seen their worry and fear affect their families like a  poison."  </P> <P> One journalist who received several threats said that, at first, he felt the  problem was not "radical enough" to cause him to change his life style.  </P> <P> Later, though, he relayed the threats to the intelligence police, who said they  had evidence that a contract had been put out on his life. He left the country.  </P> <P> Judges do not usually have that option.  </P> <P> "For judges, leaving the country or installing a home security system is rarely  an option," said Herrera, "We will often have to fight a major battle just to  get an extra government bodyguard for a threatened judge."  </P> <P> Indeed, even affording psychological help can be difficult for judges, who earn  an average of $380 a month but who would have to pay $25 to $100 an hour, by  Castro's estimate, to see a psychologist.  </P> <P> Although judges handling drug cases should take threats seriously, Colombians  not directly involved with the cartels need not live in fear, Castro said.  </P> <P> "A Colombian bank president who has not received any specific threat can lead a  perfectly normal life," the psychologist said.  </P></p>

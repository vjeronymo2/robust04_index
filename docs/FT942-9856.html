			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Observer: White wash job The mood at the Bank of Spain is distinctly glum these days. Ex-governor Mariano Rubio, is on remand in clink on suspicion of tax offences, and other names from the bank have been indirectly linked to the controversy. The present governor, Luis Angel Rojo, placed investments with the same firm as Rubio (although he has made clear he did so only for a short time and declared everything). So did a previous deputy governor and another previous governor. Visitors will therefore not be surprised to find the bank hidden under a veil whilst workers try and clean it up in time for the annual IMF and World Bank meeting in Madrid in October. When they have finished the familiar grey stone facade should be whiter than white.</p>

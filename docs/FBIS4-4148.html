			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai has become a  center for international airlines with direct flights to 27  cities in 16 countries and regions in the world.    At present, one in every five airplanes leaving Shanghai,  one  of the most rapidly developing areas in the world, flies outside  China. In 1993, the airport handled 11,913 international  flights, an increase of 42 percent over the same period of the  previous year, 26 percent higher than the growth rate of  domestic flights.    Both Chinese and foreign air companies have shown great  interest in the market, which had its first international  flight, from Dhaka to Shanghai via Guangzhou, on April 29, 1964.    Over the past 30 years, Shanghai's international air  services  have developed rapidly.    At the beginning of air service between China and Japan,  Shanghai had only four flights every week with less than 400  passengers. Now it has 30 Tokyo-bound flights every week. Air  China, China Eastern Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Japan  Airlines, Northwest Airlines and United Airlines all have  business in Shanghai.    In 1993, Philippine Airlines, Thai Airways and Lufthansa  Airlines opened international flights to Shanghai, pushing the  number of air companies in Shanghai up to thirteen.    Of the 30 international flights originating in Shanghai, the  longest ends in Madrid of Spain, via a dozen or so countries.  The total distance is 14,326 km and the flight lasts 19 hours.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (5): Foreigners find favour - Japan / Wayne Aponte sees the industry look abroad THE Japanese pension fund industry remains only partly open to international fund managers, who have struggled to compete with Japanese managers and their networks of corporate and public sector relationships Even after three years of financial reform and in spite of the huge sums that must be managed in Japan, few foreigners have made money in the pension fund business. But there are shifts in the market. Japan Securities Dealers Employees Pension Fund, which manages Y330bn, hired recently Frank Russell Japan, a subsidiary of the US performance evaluation company, to select foreign money managers. The fund then selected Invesco MIM Asset management, Baring International Investment Management and JP Morgan Trust Bank to administer 9 per cent, or Y2.5bn each, of its new fund starting this fiscal year. All Japan Surveying Enterprises Combined Employers Pension Fund, which manages Y52bn, hired Wyatt, a US consulting firm. After extensive meetings, the fund subsequently decided to turn over Y1bn to Capital International KK, a subsidiary of Capital Group in the US, from this month. These accounts are thin when compared to the nation's more than 1,500 funds totalling about Y25,000bn of employee pension assets in the last financial year. They represent, however, the first time Japanese pension funds have used money-management consultants to choose companies. Foreign advisers are confident that these will hardly be the last cases. Japan's corporate pension fund market has always been dominated by trust banks and life insurance companies. Investment advisory companies gained remarkably limited access to the management of corporate pension funds during April 1990, when the law was eased. The reforms allowed foreign advisers to manage employee pension funds, but only new money at least eight years old. About 143 officially-approved advisory companies were allowed into the business, 38 of which were foreign. According to the Japan Securities Investment Association, these advisory management companies administered only about 1.1 per cent of all funds at the fiscal year-end in March. The vast majority of accounts won by foreign advisers have been mostly from the government. The more lucrative pension fund accounts at private Japanese corporations generally have gone to domestic fund managers at banks linked to the company. Potentially enormous opportunities await the foreign manager, but access to funds will remain limited by government regulations and the strategic ties between companies and financial institutions. By 2010 about 18 per cent of the Japanese workforce is projected to be 65 or older, compared to only 11 per cent in 1990. Coupled with this increase in the nation's ageing society, is a substantial growth in the sum total of the nation's pension fund assets, expected to climb to Y250,000bn by the year 2000, from Y150,000bn in 1990, according to the Pension Fund Association. But the freedom of investment choice is limited. Japanese companies must place at least 50 per cent of their assets in fixed income instruments, up to 30 per cent in foreign-currency assets, 30 per cent in stocks and 20 per cent in real estate. Pension funds are accounted on book value, the amount paid for them, rather then their market value. Also, domestic fund managers are expected to reach a set realised rate of return each year at 5.5 per cent. Mr Tak Wakasugi, professor of finance at the University of Tokyo and co-director of the University of Michigan's Mitsui Life Financial Research Center, said Japan's pension fund system rewards the fund manager who takes the least amount of risk. He added that changes in these regulations are necessary for the investment behaviour of fund managers to change. 'Under the present regulations, fund managers cannot move,' said Mr Wakasugi, who chaired a recent committee sponsored by the ministry of finance on investment performance evaluation. The committee conducted an 18-month study that ended last year. The drive to measure the nation's pension funds by their performance is currently in a deadlock, said Mr Wakasugi, because the participants in the industry fail to agree on how to implement the tool. Even an immediate adoption of performance evaluation will hardly liberalise the pension fund industry. 'The change of one factor will not be enough,' Mr Wakasugi added. The decline of Tokyo's stock market from its peak of 38,915 in 1989 to its six-year low of about 14,309 last August pressurised the pension fund managers, and resulted in capital losses on the portfolios of institutional investors. However, in recent weeks, equity trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange has rallied about 20 per cent from the beginning of this calendar year. Government fund buying through public funds fuelled the advance in March. Stock market analysts expect the advance to continue into the summer, when early signs of an economic recovery are expected. This direction will be followed by profit-taking before the end of the calendar year. The fund of Y1,900bn run by the Japan Pension Fund Association (PFA), the nation's largest corporate pension fund holder chaired by Mr Noboru Terada, had net unrealised losses of 11 per cent at the end of the last financial year. The unrealised losses on stocks were more than 30 per cent, according to the organisation. The yield on PFA funds was 3.84 per cent in the fiscal 1991, down from 6 per cent the year earlier. This decline represented the first time the association failed to achieve its annual target of 5.5 per cent since 1967, when it was established. Mr Tsuyoshi Igarashi, assistant manager of general planning section in the Pension Trust Department at Sumitomo Trust and Banking, said declining stock prices prompted the use of some foreign managers to help administer billions of yen in pension fund assets. Foreign managers are seen to have more experience in their own markets and the ability to generate higher performance and lower risk on assets. Japanese institutions, in contrast, have lacked competition, which resulted in lower returns, particularly when the stock market declined. Mr Tadaharu Goto, director of the corporate pension plans division at the ministry of health and welfare agreed. He said he expects extended use of foreign managers in the futures due to the need by domestic institutions to obtain better returns. Mr Yugi Kudo, the president of Schroder Investment Management Japan, speculates that the ministry of finance took a step in that direction when it allowed foreign asset managers to place up to 70 per cent of their pension fund assets in foreign currency assets - a much higher percentage than domestic managers. But Mr Kudo added that general conditions for foreign investors are restrictive at best. Foreign managers who entered the market early may ultimately benefit from a further opening of Japan's pension fund market. But it is unlikely that the cozy relationships between the nation's life insurance companies, trust banks and government will change in the short-term. In the end, the ageing society has created a pressure of its own. Because Japan has the highest life expectancy in the world, higher yields on assets are desperately needed to offset future liabilities as the average age of the workforce increases.</p>

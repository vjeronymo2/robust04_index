			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: The Gap falls 24% to Dollars 28.7m THE GAP, the fashion store group which until last summer was one of the most promising companies in the US retail sector, yesterday revealed that after-tax profits plunged by 24 per cent, to Dollars 28.7m, in the second quarter of the current financial year. Total sales in the three months to end-July increased by 13 per cent, to Dollars 693m. However, this was due largely to expansion: at the end of the quarter, The Gap was running 1,350 stores - including 286 GapKids outlets and 170 Banana Republic shops - compared with 1,265 last year. The San Francisco-based company said that same-store sales rose by just 1 per cent for the quarter. The latest results leave The Gap posting after-tax profits of Dollars 70.2m in the first six months, down from Dollars 83m at the same stage last year. Sales for the first half were Dollars 916.6m, compared with Dollars 792.5m. Mr Donald Fisher, chairman, blamed a difficult retailing environment, and said that lower merchandise margins and higher occupancy costs were largely responsible for the decline in profits. He added, however, that The Gap had been trying to rein in expenses and stocks, noting that the company was holding 8 per cent less merchandise at the end of the quarter compared with a year ago.</p>

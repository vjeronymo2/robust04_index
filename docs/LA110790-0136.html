			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. VOTERS APPROVING TRANSPORTATION TAX;  </P> <P> MEASURE M: COUNTY'S FIRST SELF-IMPOSED TAX INCREASE IN ROUGHLY 30 YEARS APPEARS  TO BE WINNING.  </P> <P> Orange County voters were approving early today a sweeping package of highway  and transit projects, financed by a half-cent sales tax. If would be the first  self-imposed tax increase here in roughly 30 years.  </P> <P> Measure M backers were trying for the third time in six years to aid the  county's bedraggled motorists, who endure some of the state's most congested  highways.  </P> <P> Late Tuesday, after continually trailing with only a fourth of the precincts  counted, Measure M opponents conceded defeat.  </P> <P> "I can't for the life of me believe that they did this," said Bill Ward, a  spokesman for Drivers for Highway Safety, which opposed the measure. "They  managed to target the right people this time. . . . I think it would take  something miraculous to turn it around. I think it's clear 'M' has passed."  </P> <P> Board of Supervisors Chairman Don R. Roth said: "This is the No. 1 surprise of  the whole election in Orange County. What's happened is that every day 99% of  us are sitting in traffic jams realizing that something has to happen."  </P> <P> Passage of the measure would mean the half-cent sales tax would be imposed here  to raise $3.1 billion over a 20-year period. Money would go for freeway  improvements, reconstruction of the El Toro Y, for regional and local street  projects, as well as for commuter rail and other transit programs.  </P> <P> The plan would cost each Orange County resident $50 to $75 a year.  </P> <P> Voters in the state's other urban counties -- including all of the counties  bordering Orange County -- already have approved such sales tax hikes for  transportation.  </P> <P> The campaign for Measure M marked the third time in six years that Orange  County voters had considered such a tax. Last year a nearly identical proposal  lost by about 14,000 votes -- 53% to 47%. A 1-cent increase was soundly  defeated in 1984, 70% to 30%.  </P> <P> Reed Royalty, a Pacific Bell executive who chaired the pro-M campaign, said the  lead gave him confidence. "We did of course have a strong drive to vote by  mail," Royalty said, "and that's where these votes are from. . . . I hope it  means we're going to win."  </P> <P> Royalty, who was joined by about 15 supporters at the Measure M campaign office  in Santa Ana, said that momentum in the past few days shifted in favor of the  ballot measure. "We have tracked the trend with polls. . . . The last one we  took was less than a week ago (Saturday) and it showed that with no information  about the measure being given, 51% of the respondents would vote for it. When  they were simply read the language that was on the ballot, the figure rose to  62% -- a bit of a rise from what we had been seeing earlier."  </P> <P> Proponents of Measure M mounted a $1.1-million campaign that included telephone  calls to voters and computer-generated mail that resembled personal letters  from a resident of each community to neighbors, and missives from the  Automobile Club of Southern California.  </P> <P> The measure included something for everyone -- growth controls, a citizens'  oversight committee, and a broad mix of projects to appeal to partisans of  freeways, commuter trains and neighborhood streets.  </P> <P> Most of the campaign dollars came from developers and the construction  industry, out of concern that worsening traffic congestion would hurt business  and prompt a decline in Orange County's quality of life.  </P> <P> But the campaign was low-key, with the mail not reaching voters until the final  week before Tuesday's balloting. Also, the proponents, led by Royalty, spent  far less than the $2.4 million consumed in last year's losing effort.  </P> <P> The opponents, an unlikely coalition of anti-tax and slow-growth activists,  said they spent less than $1,000, held one press conference, and appeared in  one televised debate on a station with a limited audience.  </P> <P> The opponents split, with some arguing against any tax hike and others claiming  that it would promote new growth, thus canceling any gains in commute times.  Still others said that Measure M's funding for car-pool lanes and increased  commuter rail service lacks merit.  </P></p>

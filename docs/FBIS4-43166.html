			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Rising Tension in Korea"] </F>   [Text] The laconic announcement by Beijing on Friday 10  June that China carried out a nuclear test must be seen in the  light of the Korean crisis, which started a little over a year  ago when Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. Beijing is thus adding an element of  tension to a situation which has been taking on worrying  dimensions over the last couple of weeks.    The -- hitherto "soft" -- handling of the situation has  partly concealed the increasing dangers on the peninsula. Over  the past months, the greater part of the international community  has adopted a moderate attitude toward the regime of Kim  Il-song. It only vaguely threatened sanctions if Pyongyang  persisted in refusing to allow inspections of some of its  installations which were considered essential by the UN  International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA.    This episode has not yet come to an end, because it is now  certain that North Korea has discharged the core of its  Yongbyong reactor without the obligatory controls to which it is  subjected. Thus, it will no longer be possible to evade the  proposal for sanctions which the UN Security Council is  preparing and which will probably be debated next week. But  this episode, which is still at the diplomatic stage, is fraught  with difficulties and threats.    Difficulties: For different reasons, neither China nor  Russia, both permanent members of the Security Council with a  right of veto, favor the use of force. Threats: Kim Il-song's  regime is raising its voice by stating that sanctions would be  regarded and treated as a "declaration of war."    Clearly it is Beijing's position which has to be observed  with the utmost attention from now on. It is caught in a  dilemma, much to the confusion of its partners in the  international community. First, it wants to succeed in its  spectacular economic breakthrough by pushing its integration in  the West's free market economy, and it cannot ignore that this  implies obligations, in particular with regard to the  recognition of the vital importance of nonproliferation for  mankind.    Beijing, however, does not -- or almost not -- intend to  give  in on two points: first, on what it considers to be its  "interior domain" (the form of its regime and the way it treats  its opponents); and second, on its status of great power, in  particular by refusing to accept U.S. world leadership.    So, will diplomats be able to find a solution which would  allow China to "let down," without losing face, an old ally for  whom, moreover, 1 million Chinese died during the Korean War?  On the answer to this question will depend the tranquility of  Asia and, maybe, world peace.</p>

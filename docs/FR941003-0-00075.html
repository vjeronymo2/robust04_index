			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the ``applicant submitting the first application'' is the applicant that submits an application that is both substantially complete and contains a certification that the patent was invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed prior to the submission of any other application for the same listed drug that is both substantially complete and contains the same certification. A ``substantially complete'' application must contain the results of any required bioequivalence studies, or, if applicable, a request for a waiver of such studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if FDA concludes that the applicant submitting the first application is not actively pursuing approval of its abbreviated application, FDA will make the approval of subsequent abbreviated applications immediately effective if they are otherwise eligible for an immediately effective approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the applicant submitting the first application shall, if sued for patent infringement, notify FDA of the date that it commences commercial marketing of its drug product. Commercial marketing commences with the first date of introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce outside the control of the manufacturer of a drug product, except for investigational use under part 312 of this chapter, but does not include transfer of the drug product for reasons other than sale within the control of the manufacturer or application holder. If an applicant does not promptly notify FDA of such date, the effective date of approval shall be deemed to be the date of the commencement of first commercial marketing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Delay due to exclusivity.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency will also delay the effective date of the approval of an abbreviated new drug application under section 505(j) of the act or a 505(b)(2) application if delay is required by the exclusivity provisions in &sect;314.108. When the effective date of an application is delayed under both this section and &sect;314.108, the effective date will be the later of the 2 days specified under this section and &sect;314.108.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Court actions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) References to actions of ``the court'' in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are to the court that enters final judgment from which no appeal can be or has been taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For purposes of establishing the effective date of approval based on a court judgment, the following dates shall be deemed to be the date of the final decision of the court on the patent issues:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) If the district court enters a decision that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, and the decision is not appealed, the date on which the right to appeal lapses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the district court enters a decision that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, and the decision is appealed, the date of the first decision or order by a higher court holding or affirming the decision of the district court that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If the district court enters a decision that the patent is infringed, and the decision is appealed, the date on which the district court enters a judgment that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed pursuant to a mandate issued by a court of appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The applicant shall submit a copy of the entry of the order or judgment to the Office of Generic Drugs (HFD&hyph;600), or to the appropriate division in the Office of Drug Evaluation I (HFD&hyph;100) or Office of Drug Evaluation II (HFD&hyph;500), whichever is applicable, within 10 working days of a final judgment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Computation of 45-day time clock.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The 45-day clock described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section begins on the day after the date of receipt of the applicant's notice of certification by the patent owner or its representative, and by the approved application holder. When the 45th day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, the 45th day will be the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The abbreviated new drug applicant or the 505(b)(2) applicant shall notify FDA immediately of the filing of any legal action filed within 45 days of receipt of the notice of certification. If the applicant submitting the abbreviated new drug application or the 505(b)(2) application or patent owner or its representative does not notify FDA in writing before the expiration of the 45-day time period or the completion of the agency's review of the application, whichever occurs later, that a legal action for patent infringement was filed within 45 days of receipt of the notice of certification, approval of the abbreviated new drug application or the 505(b)(2) application will be made effective immediately upon expiration of the 45 days or upon completion of the agency's review and approval of the application, whichever is later. The notification to FDA of the legal action shall include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

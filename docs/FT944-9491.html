			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Sweden welcomes EU poll Nordic markets put in mostly positive performances in response to Sweden's vote to join the European Union in Sunday's referendum. The Swedish markets had already discounted the result, although some investors had become increasingly nervous when polls, 10 days before the vote, suggested that opponents to EU membership might be gaining the upper hand. In Stockholm, the Affarsvarlden index advanced 34.90 to 1,499.20 as investors demonstrated relief and optimism at the outcome. The real estate and construction sub-index was the best performer, gaining 5.8 per cent, supported by lower rates and expectations of increased domestic infrastructure investment. Skanska 'B' rose SKr10.50 to SKr171.50. Oslo, facing its own EU referendum on November 28, pushed higher in a positive, but highly restrained, reaction to the outcome of the Swedish poll. The All-share index was up 2.85 at 600.99 as the market hoped that the Swedish experience might dilute opposition to Norwegian membership. Norsk Hydro firmed NKr0.5 to NKr247. Copenhagen rose across most of the board in line with bonds, and the KFX index was ahead 0.69 at 93.97. Helsinki was unable to make progress as foreign investors focused on Stockholm. The Hex index softened 0.27 to 1,931.47.</p>

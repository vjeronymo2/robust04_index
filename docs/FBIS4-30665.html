			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking to reporters prior to his departure for  Vietnam today, Admiral Prachet Siridet said during his official  visit he would call on commanders of the Vietnamese armed forces  and the defense minister and hold consultations on several  issues. In particular, he said, the fishing problem will be  raised. He noted that it is the duty of the navy to ensure the  safety and proper treatment of Thai fishing trawlers in the  international waters off Indonesia and in the South Pacific when  they sail home through the specific economic zones of  neighboring countries. They should not be left to face any act  of bullying or harassment on their way home.    Asked about the Cambodian Government's attempt to outlaw the  Khmer Rouge, the navy commander said this is a rather tough  issue but Thailand does not interfere in internal affairs of  Cambodia. However, it will affect Thailand because the Khmer  Rouge is one of the factions that will always engage in  fighting. If the fighting takes place near the border,  Cambodian people will again flee to Thailand and this will cause  problems to the Thai people. The world wants to see national  reconciliation in Cambodia. In practice, it is not that easy.  Meanwhile, Thailand will try to persuade the Cambodian factions  to compromise.</p>

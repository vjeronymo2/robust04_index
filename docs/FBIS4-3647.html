			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The deployment of  Pakistani troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be possible by the  end of June, said a Foreign Office spokesman here today.    Pakistan has decided to provide 3,000 troops for deployment  in Bosnia-Herzegovina in response to U.N. Security Council  Resolution 836 designed to protect six safe areas there.    The Pakistani troops, whose equipment supply is arranged by  the United Nations from Germany, will be deployed in Bosnia  under U.N. auspices.    Speaking at the weekly press briefing, the spokesman also  informed journalists that Pakistan has moved a resolution in the  U.N. Security Council seeking use of air strikes against Serbian  artillery shelling on Gorazde.    The resolution also demands the withdrawal of the Serbian  forces behind the line drawn when Gorazde was declared safe area  and lifting of arms embargo against Bosnian forces, he said.    "The resolution was moved in light of Serbian aggression  against the safe area of Gorazde," he added.</p>

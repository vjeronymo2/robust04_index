			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Arts: Guillaume Tell and Les Contes d'Hoffmann - Opera revivals Rossini's final operatic masterpiece made its return to the Royal Opera two years ago, after a gap of a century. The wait for its first revival has been considerably less protracted: this being the composer's bicentenary year, Tell now forms one of the house's two big celebratory events (the new Viaggio a Reims follows in July). This time, the celebration is not in name only. A hugely rewarding evening of French Grand Opera is on offer: an inspired but demanding work given with a sufficient degree of impassioned commitment to set the conflagration roaring. In 1990 the carefully considered naturalism of John Cox's production (plain old-fashioned, to some) and the somewhat sedate warmth of Michel Plasson's conducting were attributes one respected rather than admired; there was a tentative air about the first performance that prevented even the most ardent of the opera's fans from recording unconditional pleasure in its return. On the evidence of Monday's performance, the staging now rises nobly to the occasion. The opera shows itself a mighty arched span of linked themes and destinies, grand not merely in generic description but in spirit, sound and dramatic purpose. Singing, not just impassioned but supple in moulding, is in short supply, and there still seems a touch of the bargain-basement about some of the costumes. Sometimes one notes unevennesses in the ensemble; sometimes the orchestral underpinning is less dramatically charged than it can be. But Plasson's overflowing love for the work seems to infect the whole cast and (much improved) chorus: the opera's final paean to liberty - sublime passage] - sweeps into the theatre with a fervour that is obviously unfeigned. The transformation in the original cast-members proves no less impressive. Gregory Yurisich in the title role is a firebrand, vocally rough-hewn and dramatically electrifying. Chris Merritt has learnt to use his astonishing tenor instrument for more than just isolated effects: in spite of momentary pitch-lapses, his Arnold affords a proud sample of heroic bel canto, and a fully-felt account of the character that makes one tolerant of his shortcomings as an actor. There are precise, distinctive contributions from Linda Kitchen (a lovely, unaffectedly boyish Jemmy), Ian Caley (Rodolphe), Roderick Earle (Leuthold) and a bald-pated Stafford Dean as the villain Gesler. Jane Eaglen, the new Mathilde, boldly unleashes her gleaming dramatic soprano - the subtler points of style may want polishing but the overall impact is formidable. Patricia Bardon's rich-toned Hedwige, also new, adds lustre to every scene in which she takes part. This is a long, slowly-unfolding opera of cumulative magnificence, an opera that matters. Meanwhile, Les Contes d'Hoffmann is coming towards the end of its glittering run of per-formances. Since this production was new in 1980, there have been tales to tell of the various star singers who have shone in its multiple roles and this revival has been no exception, thanks to an almost ideal initial trio of leading ladies. In the last few performances, however, it is the men who have claimed attention. Last week Patrick Power took over as Hoffmann. It was an appearance made at short notice when the expected tenor (Neil Shicoff) fell ill, but carried out with no loss of dramatic involvement in the opera as a whole. What Mr Power lacks in vocal weight, he gains in elegance; what he lacks in charisma as the youthful Hoffmann, he made up in the scenes of grizzled and drunken despair. For charisma one had to turn instead to his adversary, played in all his guises at these last performances by Samuel Ramey. He makes the most of this quadruple role to give us more vividly coloured character-playing than he sometimes manages, especially as the satanic Dr Miracle, while still singing with the marvellous focus to the voice that has always been his hallmark. The last performance is on Saturday. Highly recommended.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Bund prices recover as Bonn closes withholding tax legal loophole GERMAN government bond prices fell on confusion over who would be affected by the government's plans to extend its withholding tax on interest income. However, bund prices recovered once it became clear Bonn was closing a legal loophole by extending its 30 per cent withholding tax on investment income to include earnings received in Germany from foreign funds. The move was seen as part of the 'solidarity pact' to finance the reconstruction of eastern Germany. The Liffe March futures contact fell to a low of 93.02 when the tax news hit the screens, but recovered to stand virtually unchanged on the day at 93.20 in volume of 55,445 lots. News that Treuhandanstalt, the agency charged with privatising industry in eastern Germany, was to launch a new bond on January 26 had little impact on the market. There was speculation the new issue would be in the 10-year area and could raise up to DM10bn. UK government bond prices bounced back from their lows after the Bank of England revealed its forthcoming gilt auction would be smaller than had initially been expected. The gilt market closed higher on the day as a result, with the Liffe gilt future contract rising from its opening of 99.17 to trade at 99.25 by late afternoon. The Bank said it would auction Pounds 2.5bn of the 8 1/2 per cent gilt due 2007 on January 27. The auction stock will be partly paid, with 30 per cent due on February 22 and the final 30 per cent payable on April 15. The government has forecast a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement of Pounds 37bn for 1992-93, but estimates of the amount of funding that remains to be done this year vary according to calculations concerning the Bank's intervention to support sterling. Mr Ifty Islam, economist with BZW, estimates only Pounds 500m of funding remains to be done in 1992-93 taking the forthcoming auction into account and using an intervention figure of Pounds 12bn. DUTCH government bonds closed unchanged after a 10 basis-point cut in the special advances rate to 8.40 per cent, made possible by the guilder's strength and the country's inflation rate. The Ministry of Finance closed the tap on its new 7 per cent state bond due 2003, having raised a total of Fl 10bn, in line with market expectations. SPANISH government bonds recovered from a bout of profit-taking to end little changed as interest rate cuts in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Portugal fanned hopes of a similar reduction at home. The yield on the 10.3 per cent bond of 2002 fell from a high of 12.12 per cent to trade almost unchanged at 12.08 per cent in late afternoon. PORTUGUESE bonds closed higher after the Bank of Portugal cut its intervention rate for the third consecutive week, by 25 basis points to 13 per cent. The benchmark 1997 13.0 per cent bond rose Es40 to Es10,200. US TREASURY prices posted solid gains at the long end of the maturity spectrum yesterday, with sentiment buoyed by reports that President-elect Bill Clinton is considering only a modest fiscal stimulus package to aid the economy. In late trading,the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/8 at 103 7/8 , yielding 7.298 per cent. The short end of the market, however, was in a sluggish mood, with the two-year note down  3/32 at 100 15/32 , to yield 4.353 per cent. The market received an early boost from newspaper reports that the incoming Clinton administration is planning to inject Dollars 20bn into the economy via a programme of fiscal stimulus and that the package would be linked to deficit-reduction measures later in the new president's term.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIFEGUARDS GIVEN POWER OVER ANGLERS  </P> <P> The City Council has voted unanimously to give Seal Beach lifeguards the power  to regulate fishing activities on the city's pier and beaches.  </P> <P> Council members decided that their action would help lifeguards provide better  safety for swimmers and surfers in the area.  </P> <P> Overhead casting is allowed from the beach; only underhand and side-casting  from the pier.  </P> <P> Lifeguards would be expected to prevent such legal activities as casting only  when the beaches and waters are crowded and when injuries are deemed likely. At  that time, fishermen will be asked to move to a less-crowded area of the beach.  </P></p>

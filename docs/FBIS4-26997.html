			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] An unexpected difficulty is threatening a  Sino-British agreement on financing plans for the new airport,  which officials had hoped to wind up tomorrow. This emerged  during yesterday's talks between experts under the Joint Liaison  Group [JLG].    The problems follow Britain's refusal to include a specific  undertaking in the agreement stating that $23 billion of  borrowing for the project would be treated as corporate debt for  which the post-1997 government would have no liability.    Britain refused to agree that the JLG airport committee  monitor the administration and expenditure of the future airport  authority -- a compromise offered by China after its earlier  proposal for an independent cost-control body to be set up for  this purpose.    Britain said such an idea would be against the spirit of the  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which does not contain such a  provision.    British negotiators proposed that the government provide  more  information to the airport committee, instead of giving the  monitoring powers to the committee.    These problems emerged after experts from both sides began  to  draft the "basic agreement" after last Friday's airport  committee meeting.    Both sides have agreed "in principle" to the government's  latest financing proposals, which would allow the injection of  government equity of $60.3bn and $23bn corporate borrowing by  the future airport authority and the Mass Transit Railway  Corporation [MTRC].    It is believed Britain had previously assured China that  only  the airport authority and the MTRC would be responsible for the  repayment of debt.    Britain has agreed that the basic agreement should be  specific about a timetable indicating when the borrowing should  be repaid by the two corporations.    Britain informed China earlier this week that it preferred  not to be specific in the basic agreement about who should be  responsible for the borrowing, leaving what China views as a  grey area in the agreement. China promptly rejected this.    Under the basic agreement, there are two appendices about  financial support for the airport authority and the MTRC which  have been approved by China.    The amount of debt and the Special Administrative Region's  responsibility for any borrowing has been China's main concern.    Hugh Davies, the head of the British negotiating team, said  yesterday: "The Chinese take the view that the MOU's references  to debt include debt entered into by the two corporations. That  is not our view."</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VERDICT IN NORTH'S IRAN-CONTRA TRIAL  </P> <P> Philip Lacovara presents an intellectually seductive review of history and the  law in support of his thesis that Judge Gesell was remiss in seeming to  overlook the special rules that exempt members of the military from having to  examine too closely the legality of orders from their commanders ("A Case of  Missing Prologues," Editorial Page, May 6). Unfortunately, Lacovara's argument  fails to take the facts of the situation into account.  </P> <P> North, albeit a member of the Marine Corps, did not find himself on a  battlefield facing enemy fire when he so willingly set up a shadow government  run from the White House basement. Neither his life nor that of anyone around  him was in immediate danger when he agreed to lie to Congress. No split-second  decisions were needed in taking on the Reagan-Casey mandate to subvert the  Boland Amendment.  </P> <P> North certainly had enough time, at the outset or any other point in his  zealous operations, to reflect, consult others and obtain advice as to the  legality or even just the advisability of his international machinations.  Lacovara has done a serious disservice in assuming that the very knotty problem  of morality and ethics in wartime applies to North in Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> EVELYN STERN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

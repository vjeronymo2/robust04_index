			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses in decline as holidays subdue trading MOST BOURSES declined yesterday, as holidays in London and Tokyo kept trading thin, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was marked down in thin trading in the absence of UK investors. Domestic investors were also hesitant before Thursday's Ascension Day holiday. The DAX index lost 7.85 to 1,623.99 while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, fell 2.29 to 691.29. Volume slipped to DM3.6bn from DM5.3bn. BASF, the chemical group, fell DM4.50 to DM250.20 after reporting that its first-quarter group pretax profit had dipped 25 per cent, slightly more than expected. Bucking the trend was Metallgesellschaft, which rose DM3 to DM546 following news over the weekend that it was involved in a DM1bn project to clean up and modernise one of the largest and most polluted areas of east Germany. MILAN saw an early but unsustained leap in Fiat on the back of an article in an Italian business paper, which quoted company sources as saying that the dividend would be maintained in 1990. There have been fears that the pay-out would be cut. Fiat ordinary shares were officially set L195 higher at L5,446, but fell back to L5,375 after hours, taking the market with them. The Comit index lost 0.34 to 585.90 in thin volume estimated at L120bn after Friday's L145bn. Dealers said that while the market was getting some support from corporate groups before various rights issues, nervousness over the political situation remained. News of a net outflow of L83bn in equity funds in April after a net inflow of L120bn in March could weigh on share values today, they added. Generali was weak, slipping to L36,900 after being officially set at L37,050, down L550. PARIS eased as hopes of a cut in interest rates were thwarted. The CAC 40 index ended 3.54 down at 1,828.77, recovering from a day's low of 1,816.58, and turnover fell to about half Friday's FFr2.1bn. Michelin continued to attract interest, rising FFr1.65 to FFr97.85 on volume of 432,050 shares. The stock has gained 16.3 per cent in the six sessions since some brokers raised their forecasts. The tyremaker told shareholders that Mr Edouard Michelin, son of the current chairman, would be nominated next month for the post of associate director. One of the day's big movers was Immobiliere Phenix, the property company, which jumped FFr8.90 or 4.7 per cent to FFr198.90. MADRID was one the few bourses to rise. The general index edged up 0.29 to 278.68, recovering from an early fall, in turnover slightly down on Friday's Pta12.5bn. The banking and construction sectors produced most of the interest. Banco Exterior rose Pta65 to Pta3,580 on the news that it is to be integrated with other state-controlled banks in a new company, Corporacion Bancaria de Espana. A block of 601,200 shares or about 6 per cent of the share capital of Petromed, a Banesto unit, was traded at Pta7,390 a share, up Pta30. OSLO also ignored the gloom elsewhere and rose in moderate trading, as optimism about the economy continued to improve, following cuts in interest rates in the past couple of months. The all-share index gained 4.77 to 488.83 in turnover of NKr302m. COPENHAGEN edged higher in quiet trading. The bourse index gained 1.28 to 349.31. Den Danske Bank rose DKr1 to DKr324 in turnover of DKr73m, on foreign demand following its recent European roadshow. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index fell 7.5 to 1,042.9 in light turnover of SKr222m. Ericsson accounted for SKr44m of that, as its free B shares eased SKr2 to SKr191 before its first-quarter earnings report, due today. BRUSSELS slipped at the end of the two-week account on the forward market. The Bel20 index lost 7.8 to 1,177.27. Petrofina, the oil group, was active; its shares ended above a day's low of BFr11,375 at BFr11,450, down BFr50. Yesterday was the last day to trade Petrofina's warrant which expires on May 20; the warrant fell BFr25 to BFr2,775. AMSTERDAM fell in dull trading. The CBS tendency index ended 0.3 down at the day's low of 95.1. HBG and Volker Stevin, the builders, were suspended before an announcement that HBG would purchase Volker Stevin's dredging business and shed its 60 per cent stake in the latter. ZURICH declined, with the Credit Suisse index off 5.8 at 545.6. Unigestion was suspended at the request of its leading shareholder, Swiss Bank, pending news of a reorganisation. ISTANBUL slumped 4.9 per cent on fears of further selling. The index fell 189.47 to 3,691.71, down 7.4 per cent since Thursday. ATHENS was led lower by the banking sector. The general index dropped 49.65 or 4.4 per cent to 1,093.23. The Eurotrack 100 index was not available owing to the closure of the London Stock Exchange.</p>

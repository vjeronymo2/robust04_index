			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Nationwide and banks help fund housing deal A Pounds 135m (Dollars 232.2m) loan package to finance a transfer of council properties to housing association ownership was signed this week in the largest 'block transfer' of council housing stock yet completed in the UK. Broomleigh Housing Association, a non-profit making trust set up by housing officials of Bromley Council in Kent, is buying 12,400 properties from the council. The houses and flats will be let to existing tenants but under new ownership. The biggest provider of funds for the transaction is Nationwide Building Society, which has committed Pounds 45m. An additional Pounds 90m in three facilities has been provided by a small syndicate of banks led by National Westminster. Other syndicate members are Bank of Scotland, Scotia Bank, Banque Paribas, National Australia Bank and United Bank of Kuwait. The syndicated facilities comprise two term loans to fund the initial purchase, with an underlying revolving credit facility to meet future funding needs. The long-term committed funding is costing Broomleigh 1.5 per cent over the London interbank offered rate. Fees are undisclosed, although the housing association has paid bankers and lawyers a total of Pounds 4.7m in fees. The loans are long-term and complex because the housing association is committed to charging low rents. For example, it has undertaken to raise rents by no more than 2 per cent above inflation for the first four years. Hence rental income will not cover interest and maintainence costs for several years. Borrowings should peak at Pounds 135m in the seventh year of the deal, while the housing association is paying the council an initial Pounds 116.9m for the properties. Mr Keith Exford, Broomleigh chief executive, said the association was seeking an extra Pounds 15m funding to cover a development programme.</p>

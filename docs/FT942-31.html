			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (3): A taste of their own medicine  -Japanese feel the pressures of competition Life used to be straightforward for Japan's luxury car makers. Merely by making highly reliable cars that exuded wealth they could keep their wealthy customers happy and eager to order replacements every few years. But as the Japanese car market has matured, and economic and social changes have affected customer tastes and market conditions, the environment for the country's executive car makers has become considerably more demanding. 'In the past, a luxury car was known as the danna's, or master's, car,' explains Mr Hajime Nanno, head of the domestic market forecast group at Toyota. 'People who ordered executive cars just wanted the very best and would buy the most expensive car from a catalogue without even seeing it. They would just say give me the best car you have. 'Nowadays, people are more demanding,' Mr Nanno says. Rather than being attracted simply by the trappings of wealth, such as leather-bound seats, buyers of luxury cars in Japan are looking for a wider range of qualities such as safety, comfort and ease of driving. At the same time, Japanese consumers are becoming more demanding in terms of price, forcing luxury car makers to rethink their pricing strategy. The luxury car maket has not been unaffected by the cost-consciousness that has pervaded buying habits in Japan since the years of asset inflation came abruptly to an end. Unlike the days when manufacturers could safely raise prices significantly every year, in today's low-growth economy 'prices will have to be reasonably set because incomes won't rise that much any more,' Mr Nanno says. On both fronts, Japanese car makers face greater competition at home from foreign car makers, which have started to become a growing force in Japan's once protected domestic market. Japanese car makers, which differentiated their luxury cars from those of many western competitors by offering high quality luxury cars at lower prices, are finding their strategy unravelling in the face of the high yen and the aggressive pricing strategies of competitors in the sector. German luxury car makers, for example, are able to appeal to Japanese consumers' growing preference for cars which offer ease of driving, safety and comfort due to their strong reputation for just those qualities. Their prices, meanwhile, are falling to levels that bring them more directly into competition with the luxury cars of domestic companies such as Toyota and Nissan, due largely to the yen's rise. Many foreign car makers have also adopted a strategy of taking advantage of Japan's low interest environment to offer lower-interest loans. 'A new development in the luxury car market is the popularity of imported cars due to the yen's rise,' Mr Nanno notes. Neither is the challenge restricted to the home market. In the US, where Japanese car makers made tremendous efforts to build up the image of their luxury car lines as providing superior quality over established cars but at lower prices, the yen's rise has dealt a significant blow. As a result of the yen's rise, coupled with the German car makers' strategy of lowering prices, a typical car from Toyota's luxury Lexus channel has gone from Dollars 40,000 in the US to Dollars 50,000, while a comparable BMW or Mercedes has gone the other way - from Dollars 60,000 or Dollars 70,000 to Dollars 50,000, Toyota says. Japanese luxury car makers are full-line manufacturers which set out to win over the owner-driver in search of a high quality car at a reasonable price, rather than to target niche luxury markets. 'Our executives don't want to focus on high-profit low- volume cars. We don't think of ourselves as competing directly with Mercedes-Benz or BMW,' says Mr Nanno. But he admits, that as market conditions have changed, 'in effect . . . we have to compete with them'. The road ahead may seem bleak for Japan's luxury car makers. However, the industry is confident that there are still great opportunities. For one thing, while demand for luxury cars has declined amid Japan's car market slump, the fall for luxury cars has not been particularly sharp when compared with that for cars overall. The monthly average has fallen from a peak of 124,000 in 1990 to 95,000 last year but remains well above the 75,000 average in 1987. Moreover, the market share of luxury and large cars has grown steadily over the past decade, from 28 per cent of the entire car market in the early 1980s to a peak of about 35 per cent in 1990, falling only moderately last year to 33 per cent. Toyota's Mr Nanno explains that people who buy executive cars in Japan tend to be self-employed executives of companies who can charge the cost to corporate expenses. Whereas corporations and self-employed executives make up only about a quarter of the entire car market customer base, as a group they comprise 55 per cent of the luxury car market, he points out. As Japanese society ages, and as people come to expect a higher standard of living, the chances are that the luxury car market will grow, rather than shrink. 'More people will want to drive large cars that are spacious and safe,' Mr Nanno says. That may very well be the case. But it is also certain that competition for a slice of that growing cake will be heated as more foreign car makers target the Japanese market. Both Mercedes-Benz and BMW are building their dealer networks in Japan, while US car companies are also showing a greater eagerness than ever to penetrate the Japanese market. At the same time, Japanese luxury car makers face a difficult environment overseas as the yen's strong rise has weakened the cost advantage that they had in the US. In order to maintain their reputation for offering high quality luxury cars at reasonable prices, they will have to put greater efforts into reducing the costs of the vehicles they manufacture in Japan, where labour costs are among the highest in the world.</p>

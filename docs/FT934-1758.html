			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Building societies urged to merge Medium-size building societies face the choice of merging with each other or being taken over and - probably - eliminated. That is the message of a study published today by Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, which says that medium-size building societies need to achieve cost savings and to form their own regional branch networks to enable them to compete more effectively with the banks. The report also argues that larger societies need to concentrate on selling services and products to their savers rather than to borrowers, where the emphasis has been so far. The paper comes against the background of the abandonment in October of the merger plans of the Leeds Permanent building society, the fifth largest, and the National &amp; Provincial, the eighth largest. It highlights the effectiveness for larger societies of mergers, where they take over a small society and close its head office and most branches, over combinations between the largest societies. While banks have cut their staff numbers by 10 per cent since 1989, societies' staff numbers have risen by 6 per cent, and the falls in societies' cost-to-income ratios have come largely from higher income rather than lower costs. When serious competition from the retail banks intensifies, societies will be unable to rely on wider margins to maintain profits at an acceptable level, and will need to cut costs, the paper says. But whereas banks can cut branches and transfer business to an alternative convenient for the customer, an individual society will almost certainly not be in that position - in total, societies have only half the number of branches that banks have. On savings, the study recognises societies' concern that they may be 'cannibalising' the retail savings base they need to support their mortgage lending, by selling their investors other products such as Peps or unit trusts. It argues, however, that unless they offer such services, savers will seek them elsewhere, and societies will find they are excluded from a growing area of the market. It is particularly important for a society to own the supplier, rather than acting as agent for another institution, which can then build its own relationship with the investor.

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Mobilfunk partners to increase holdings The commercial partners in Mannesmann Mobilfunk, the mobile telephone concern, are to increase their holdings with the purchase of a 10.35 per cent stake currently held by the Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, DG Bank. No information was available yesterday on the terms of the deal, although the Mannesmann group, which owns 51 per cent of the business, said the stake was expected to be shared among the partners in proportion to their existing holdings. This would give the German consortium leader a further 6.45 per cent. AirTouch of San Francisco would take 3.3 per cent with the balance of about 0.6 per cent going to Cable &amp; Wireless. Mobilfunk is the leading private mobile phone company in Germany. After making its first profits in the first half of this year, it now has well over 700,000 subscribers, and according to some estimates could have 1m customers by Christmas. The agreement coincided with confirmation that the German government will press European Union partners to fix a date for free competition on European networks at a joint meeting of industry and telecommunications ministers in Brussels on September 28. If there was still no agreement at a meeting of post and telecoms ministers booked for November 11, the German group would consider going it alone, according to a joint statement from Bonn's research, post and economics ministries. Mr Wolfgang Botsch, post minister, has said Germany might liberalise its network on January 1, 1998, the date set for deregulating EU services. The government has been convinced by private sector lobbyists that open competition in data and telephone communications networks will provide thousands of urgently-needed jobs.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING / DAN STANTON;  </P> <P> SPORTKING SKIPPER WAS HOOKED ON THE SPORT FROM TIME HE WAS 10  </P> <P> Jim Peterson of San Pedro was only 10 when he started ocean sportfishing.  </P> <P> Peterson, now 41, said he scrubbed decks and did any work required to go out  fishing with one of the local captains.  </P> <P> In 1959, he became a full-time deck hand under Captain Don McLean aboard the  Pierpoint Landing boat Sea Angler.  </P> <P> According to McLean, Peterson's fishing savvy and expert boat handling was  evident at a young age.  </P> <P> Peterson said he knew at age 16 that he wanted to some day own and operate his  own sportfishing boat.  </P> <P> In 1968 Peterson got his captains license and was hired as a relief captain at  Pierpoint Landing to run the half-day boat Matt Walsh.  </P> <P> That winter he was given the first nighttime sand dab run to Catalina Island on  the boat Pierpoint.  </P> <P> He said the nightly sand dab trips were excellent throughout the 1970s.  </P> <P> Peterson continued to work relief on all the Pierpoint boats until he took a  job aboard the boat Freedom. He ran it for six years, fishing Catalina and San  Clemente islands until Pierpoint Landing in Long Beach closed down.  </P> <P> Again being without a boat to run, he became a relief captain working out of  San Pedro. The boats went to Morro Bay to fish for albacore.  </P> <P> In 1975, Peterson bought the 65-foot Sportking that he runs out of Ports O'  Call Landing.  </P> <P> In 1982 Peterson obtained the lease on the L.A. Harbor Sportfishing Landing.  </P> <P> In 1985 he had one of largest one-day catches aboard the Sportking when anglers  decked 85 albacore and a 130-pound marlin on a special albacore trip.  </P> <P> Peterson trained two of his deck hands, Marc Pisano and Paul Strasser of San  Pedro, who are now professional sportfishing skippers and own the half-day boat  Monte Carlo that operates out of 22nd Street Landing.  </P> <P> The Sportking is a three-quarter day boat that Peterson runs Monday through  Friday.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Charles Phlugh of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Toronado  off of Catalina, caught the whopper of the week, a 27-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Scott McLeavy of Palos Verdes, fishing at Cherry Bank aboard the Blackjack,  caught a 26-pound cow cod.  </P> <P> Tami Sawa of Culver City, fishing at the deep hole aboard the Sumo, caught a  21-pound white sea bass.  </P> <P> Frank Crowin of Palos Verdes, fishing off of Catalina aboard the Outerlimits,  caught a 21-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Fish Reports: Several days of unsettled weather slowed the action.  </P> <P> Boats that did get out landed a variety of species.  </P> <P> At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished the bay and anglers caught  150 sculpin and four halibut. The Betty O fished the shallow rocks and anglers  sacked 101 rock cod and a lingcod.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing: The City of Redondo, on a half-day trip, returned with  110 rockfish and 18 sand bass.  </P> <P> At 22nd St. Landing: The New Image trip to Santa Barbara Island resulted in a  catch of 117 whitefish, 57 calico bass and 41 sculpin.  </P> <P> At L.A. Harbor Spotfishing: The Matt Walsh, on a half-day trip, returned with  33 calico bass, 21 sculpin and three sheephead.  </P></p>

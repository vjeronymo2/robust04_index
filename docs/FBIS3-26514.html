These outstanding  achievements included: We continued to deepen reform and open  up wider to the outside world; foreign trade, exports, and  imports continued to grow rapidly; the utilization of foreign  capital continued to develop; and we made new progress in  foreign economic affairs.    Last year, Zhejiang's total output value of exports and  imports reached $6.111 billion, up 31.3 percent over last year.  Exports reached $4.439 billion, surpassing the target set by  the provincial planning commission and the provincial people's  congress and 19.9 percent more than last year. We maintained  stronger momentum for development in this area. Of these,  exports of individually run enterprises increased 43.1 percent;  exports of foreign-funded enterprises increased 64.5 percent;  and, under a situation in which exports nationwide grew slowly,  general exports of our province increased 14.2 percent over last  year, making Zhejiang one of the top provinces in exports.    Thus far, 34 counties (cities) in Zhejiang have been  designated coastal open economic areas. We have two coastal open  cities, eight national development zones and development  projects of various types involving whole tracts of land, and 37  provincial development zones and agricultural development zones.  An initial development structure for multilevel and all-round  opening up has been established. By the end of last November, a  total of 5,963 projects were introduced into our national and  provincial development zones; among them, 953 are  foreign-invested projects with contracted foreign capital  totaling $2.564 billion, accounting for one-third of the entire  province's contracted foreign capital. Development zones have  become an important "window" for opening up and utilizing  foreign funds.    Our provincial economic and trade systems continue to regard  the utilization of foreign capital as a focus of their work,  strengthening overall guidance, delegating examination and  approval authority to lower administrative levels, improving  service quality, and enhancing administrative efficiency. Last  year, Zhejiang approved 4,487 new foreign-funded enterprises, up  91.9 percent over the previous year; contracted foreign capital  reached $3.746 billion, up 28.8 percent; and utilized foreign  capital totaled $1.033 billion, up 251 percent. The number of  newly established foreign-funded enterprises and their  contracted foreign capital and utilized foreign capital exceeded  the total amount accumulated in the past 14 years since reform  and opening up, setting a record.    According to statistics, last year Zhejiang signed contracts  worth $91.62 million for construction projects and labor service  in foreign countries, up 21.4 percent over the previous year.  By the end of last year, Zhejiang had set up 175 overseas  enterprises with investments of 158 million.</p>

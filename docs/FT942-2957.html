			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Shareholders hail freed Schneider chief's return 'I am very, very happy to be here,' Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, head of France's Groupe Schneider electrical engineering group, told a packed shareholders' meeting yesterday in the Automobile Club in Paris. Two weeks ago, he was in rather different circumstances - an inmate in Brussels' Forest prison, facing charges of fraud relating to two Belgian subsidiaries. Last week, after 12 days in prison, he was released on bail of FFr2.5m (Pounds 290,000). However, Mr Valentino Foti, an Italian businessman being investigated on the same charges, is still held after his appeal yesterday was rejected. A round of applause greeted Mr Pineau-Valencienne's arrival on stage, and shareholders expressed support for their chairman. The reception was less warm for one Belgian minority shareholder, who was booed after his complaint about a lack of information concerning offshore companies in the group. For his part, Mr Pineau-Valencienne sought to reassure investors that the group would not be damaged by the affair and sought to rebuff the Belgian allegations. He denied that Schneider had acted against the interests of minority shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines, two financial subsidiaries at the centre of the investigation. He also rejected charges that dividends paid by offshore companies had not been distributed equally among shareholders in the subsidiaries and denied that funds totalling BFr3bn (Pounds 580m) had been diverted from the two companies to the benefit of their parent company. He said he was appointing an outside auditor with a view to clearing himself and the group of the charges. The stock market responded positively. Schneider shares, which have lost 16 per cent of their value since the chairman was detained, bucked the trend in the depressed Paris bourse and rose 2.3 per cent to close at FFr356.9.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: PUBLIC FORUMS BRING OUT IDEAS FOR SAN DIEGO PLAZAS;  </P> <P> DIEGO COUNTY  </P> <P> Some of San Diego's wisest urban planners aren't urban planners at all, just  San Diegans with a sincere concern for their city.  </P> <P> Many of them turned out last week for two forums on public spaces led by San  Diego City Architect Mike Stepner and organized by various civic and  professional groups.  </P> <P> Thursday night, a group of about 200 gathered at the Casa del Prado Theater in  Balboa Park for a "town meeting" on the subject of public squares.  </P> <P> The evening began with a slide lecture on the Pioneer Courthouse Square, a  lively downtown plaza in Portland, Ore., that covers an entire city block. A  thoughtful discussion followed, with comments from both the audience and a  panel whose members ranged from Tim Chambers of San Diego Espresso Company to  developer Ernest Hahn, artist Mario Lara and the city's Commission for Arts and  Culture public arts coordinator Gail Goldman.  </P> <P> Friday morning, many of the same faces returned to Balboa Park to see how  lessons learned the night before might apply to three San Diego public spaces  in dire need of attention: Horton Plaza Park, the Community Concourse, both  downtown, and the Plaza de Panama in front of the San Diego Museum of Art in  Balboa Park.  </P> <P> David Porter, who manages Pioneer Courthouse Square and organizes its events,  was the featured guest at both meetings.  </P> <P> But the real star of the discussions wasn't a participant. The name of  pioneering urban planner William Whyte surfaced often at both meetings. His  1988 book "City: Rediscovering the Center" has become something of a bible to  anyone with an interest in a vital public spaces. It seems even the general  public now knows about him.  </P> <P> Whyte spent years in New York City researching what makes public spaces come  alive. Many of his recommendations are simple, but it's surprising how seldom  they are followed.  </P> <P> People need places to sit, Whyte says. They need plenty to do and see: art,  retail shops with their wares in full view, street performers, food vendors.  </P> <P> Pioneer Courthouse Square puts these ideas to work. It gives Portland the kind  of public heart downtown San Diego has never had. People from a variety of  socioeconomic groups mingle peacefully.  </P> <P> According to Porter, the success of Pioneer Courthouse Square is attributable  to six concepts: simplicity, location, history, ownership, activity and  neutrality.  </P> <P> Pioneer Courthouse Square has a clean, functional design, yet plenty of whimsy.  </P> <P> Portland dreamed up a way to give citizens a stake in the project: 65,000  bricks were sold for $15 to $30 and used to pave the square, each with the  donor's name on them.  </P> <P> The square has action galore: a travel bookstore, four food vendors, a  restaurant, interactive art pieces and such events as an annual "Festival of  Flowers" and noontime "Peanut Butter and Jam" concerts.  </P> <P> A weather machine gives the forecast, accompanied by a fanfare of trumpets,  sprays of water and flashing temperature lights.  </P> <P> In San Diego, Horton Plaza Park is a prime candidate for such improvements.  </P> <P> Frustrated by the city's lack of initiative in finding ways to reclaim the park  from downtown's street people, the Central City Assn., an organization  representing downtown businesses, has proposed to the city council to replace  the grass with flower beds. It is even ready to pay to do so, but hasn't gotten  the council's approval yet.  </P> <P> This might help keep the transients away, but it still wouldn't make the park a  great place for a cross section of the public to gather and mingle.  </P> <P> Most of the 50 or so planners, artists, business people and others who met with  Stepner and Porter Friday agreed that the long range goal should be to replace  the landscaping around the 1910 Irving Gill fountain with hardscaping -- bricks  or another paving material. An open, paved park would offer people places to  congregate and allow for a variety of uses, while plans dominated by grass  and/or flower beds have limited possibilities.  </P> <P> Attorney Leo Sullivan is a partner in a law firm with offices across Fourth  Avenue from Horton Plaza Park. He is also co-owner of Reidy O'Neil's restaurant  on the ground floor of the building, which has a view of the troubled park.  </P> <P> In making his pitch, Sullivan cited Whyte. He suggested replacing straight  benches with round, backless ones more suited to group conversations. He  proposed an entertainment stage, a food stand and night lights that would play  on the park from adjacent buildings.  </P> <P> These ideas aren't in the Central City Assn.'s plan, and Stepner endorsed the  association's flower beds as a short-term solution. In fact, the hardscaping,  which seems like an excellent idea, may never happen. Posts and chains  bordering the grass are period pieces, and historic preservationists strongly  oppose their removal.  </P> <P> Whyte-like ideas also flowed during Friday's discussion of the Community  Concourse. Ernesto Guerrero, director of the Centro Cultural de la Raza who was  also on the panel, proposed a radical solution to the plaza's hostile, windy  environment: destroy some of the sterile buildings around it.  </P> <P> More realistic suggestions included a city commitment to managing the space  (including new art and events), food and retail outlets, a new downtown library  at the plaza's edge, more seating and a landscaping plan that would open better  lines of sight.  </P> <P> Porter believes the Community Concourse desperately needs public art that  acknowledges local history and adds a taste of San Diego's broad cultural  heritage. History and broad-based art could help make the space appealing to  more San Diegans.  </P> <P> The city has commissioned a community concourse reuse study, and Stepner  promised to forward several of these ideas.  </P> <P> In Balboa Park, the Plaza de Panama was converted this summer from a parking  lot while it was occupied by a touring Frank Lloyd Wright house. Long-range,  the city plans to replace the parking lot with a plaza. Landscape architect  Steve Estrada, a consultant hired by the city to draft a detailed plan for the  heart of the park, proposes a fountain in the middle of the Plaza de Panama,  palms around its fringes and a large, hardscaped surface where people can  gather.  </P> <P> Ideas proposed for the Plaza de Panama weren't as interesting as suggestions  made for the other two public spaces. A major portion of the debate focused on  whether automobiles should be allowed to cross the edge of the plaza, and where  new parking lots might be built in the park.  </P></p>

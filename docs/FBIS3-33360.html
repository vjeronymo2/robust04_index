			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Response to Prosecutor General De Greiff's letter from the </F> SEMANA editorial staff]    [Text] With regard to the first information, related to the  differences between the national government and the Prosecutor  General's Office regarding the surrender of persons linked to  the Cali cartel, those differences are part of the public domain  and have been reported by various communications media. In the  recent past, even high-level government sources from the  Prosecutor General's Office itself have described in detail to  this magazine discrepancies of this sort with the government  regarding the case of the Cali cartel. In addition, the week  before last this disagreement was confirmed once again to SEMANA  by a high-level source from President Gaviria's cabinet. With  respect to the reports on differences between the Colombian  Prosecutor General and his counterpart in the United States,  these reports have been confirmed both by sources in the U.S.  Government and by Colombian cabinet ministers. Thus, Mr.  Prosecutor General, it is not a question of either inventions,  or feverish imaginations, or irresponsible journalism.</p>

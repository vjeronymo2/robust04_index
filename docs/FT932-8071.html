			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Market disappointed with CU first quarter COMMERCIAL Union, the most successful UK composite insurer in recent years, yesterday disappointed the markets with poorer first quarter figures than had been expected. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.2m for the first three months of 1993 compared with a loss of Pounds 19.2m, providing further evidence of the recovery in the UK general insurance market. However, the market was disappointed at the scale of the improvement, clipping the shares 6p to 594p. 'It is a good result but the improvement is not as marked as the rest of the sector,' commented Mr Stephen Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, the securities house. Mr Bird pointed to a deterioration in the group's London market operations - where underwriting losses rose from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 23.5m - - as a cause for concern. CU stressed the improvement in the UK where, like its rivals General Accident and Royal Insurance, it had been helped by increased premium rates and lower expenses. UK underwriting losses fell from Pounds 54.1m to Pounds 34.7m. With its solvency strengthened by the Pounds 428m rights issue in February, CU has also continued to increase premium income, especially in UK motor, home and life markets, although the pace of growth declined compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Overall life premium income rose to Pounds 518.5m (Pounds 454.4m) and general insurance premiums to Pounds 1.09bn (Pounds 830.3m). Investment income of Pounds 84.1m (Pounds 64.3m) was offset by an underwriting loss of Pounds 99.8m (Pounds 113.6m). Earnings from associated undertakings amounted to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 3.1m). A non-life operating loss of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 46.2m) was offset by life profits of Pounds 29.8m (Pounds 27m). Mr Tony Brend, chief executive, said that losses from the Bishopsgate bomb last month would feed through into the group's figures in the second quarter. 'Information on possible losses is still incomplete but current indications are that the effect, after reinsurance, is unlikely to exceed Pounds 25m,' said Mr Brend.</p>

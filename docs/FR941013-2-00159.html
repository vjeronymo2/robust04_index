			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Conduct a program of research that addresses the issues identified above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Identify specific strategies and procedures that will be investigated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Carry out the research within a conceptual framework, based on previous research or theory, that provides a basis for the strategies and procedures to be studied, the research methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and instrumentation that will be used, and the specific target populations and settings that will be studied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Collect, analyze, and report a variety of descriptive and outcome data, including (1) specific information on the settings, the service providers, the children and families targeted by the Institute (e.g., age, disability, level of functioning and membership in a special population, if appropriate); (2) multiple, functional outcome data for the children and families who are the focus of the strategies and procedures; and (3) multiple outcome data for the teachers, administrators, and other school staff involved in the research.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Conduct the research in typical school settings, including settings that are, or will be, implementing different combinations of the successful practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Conduct the research using methodological procedures that are designed to produce unambiguous findings regarding the effects of the strategies and procedures, as well as any findings on interaction effects between particular strategies or procedures and particular characteristics of participants or settings. These findings will be rendered through appropriate sample selection and adequate sample size to permit use of the findings in policy analyses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Design all activities in a manner that is likely to lead to improved services for children with disabilities and their families, including those who are members of cultural, linguistic, or racial minority groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Develop, field test, and disseminate a variety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products that can be used for training and technical assistance activities with policy makers, administrators, school board members, parents, and service providers and that are likely to facilitate the implementation of the successful practices in early elementary school settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Coordinate research and dissemination activities with other relevant efforts sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, including other research institutes, technical assistance entities, and information clearinghouses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Provide research training and experience for at least 10 graduate students annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining whether to continue the Institute for the fourth and fifth years of the project period, in addition to considering factors in 34 CFR 75.253(a), the Secretary considers the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The timeliness and effectiveness with which all requirements of the negotiated cooperative agreement have been or are being met by the Institute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The degree to which the Institute's research designs and methodological procedures demonstrate the potential for producing significant new knowledge and products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to apply for funding for years four and five, the Institute must set aside in its budget for the second year, funds to cover costs associated with the services to be performed by the review team appointed by the Secretary to evaluate the project in the second year. These funds are estimated to be approximately $4,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> For Further Information Contact: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Gail Houle, U.S. Department of Education, Room 4613, Switzer Building, 600 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C., 20202&hyph;2644.

In creating Part G of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Congress expressed the intent that the projects and centers funded under that part should be primarily for the purpose of enhancing research and development advances and efforts being undertaken by the public or private sector, and to provide necessary linkages to make more efficient and effective the flow from research and development to application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary gives an absolute preference to applications that meet the following priority. The Secretary will fund under this competition only applications that meet this absolute priority:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Absolute Priority_Collaborative Research on Technology, Media, and Materials for Children and Youth With Disabilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Background: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In 1993 an agenda was developed for the Technology, Educational Media, and Materials for Individuals with Disabilities Program which set forth four program commitments. These four commitments were derived from broad-based input from the field, and together they represent the means by which the Office of Special Education Programs intends to advance the use of technology, media, and materials with students with disabilities. They are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Enable the Learner Across Environments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This means fostering instructional environments, both in and out of school, that use technology, educational media, and materials to enable students with disabilities to access knowledge, develop skills and problem-solving strategies, and engage in educational experiences necessary for their success as adults.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / New applicants to give up the neutrality habit AUSTRIA, Sweden and Finland said yesterday they would sign up to Maastricht treaty goals of a common European foreign and defence policy, as their negotiations to join the European Community opened formally in Brussels. Attempting to dispel EC concerns that their traditions of neutrality would make them a brake on Europe's ambitions to develop a collective foreign and defence identity, foreign ministers of the three applicants emphasised unequivocal commitment to the treaty. 'Our security is indissolubly linked to the security of the continent,' said Mr Alois Mock, Austria's foreign minister, adding that his country was 'fully committed to the treaty on European union,' and to the common foreign and security policy. Mr Ulf Dinkelspiel, Sweden's minister of European affairs, said 'we wish to participate fully in the common foreign and security policy'. He added that while the Swedish parliament had recently restated that Sweden could not participate in military alliances, his government recognised the goal of a common defence policy 'which in time might lead to a common defence,' and would not hamper it. Mr Pertti Salolainen, the Finnish foreign trade minister, said his government was 'ready to contribute to the construction of a common European defence'. The Maastricht treaty calls for a common foreign and security policy, developed largely on intergovernmental co-operation between EC member states, and posits a future defence identity, which is unlikely to start taking shape until the EC's next constitutional review in 1996. If Austria, Sweden and Finland join the EC by 1995, as they and EC negotiators now expect, they would have a voice in that review. Member states such as France and Spain are therefore determined that they should sign up in advance to the so-called 'potentiality' of Maastricht - even though the treaty remains to be ratified by Denmark and the UK. The three countries also emphasised that they would be bringing wealth and high social and environmental standards to the Community, along with a tradition of open government consonant with the EC's promise to bring decision-making closer to the citizen. The opening of negotiations was televised, before detailed discussions kick off today. The proceedings were suffused with irony as the current Danish presidency of the EC reeled off a list of membership requirements so intimidating that few existing member states would apply - and several of which, such as foreign and defence policy, Denmark itself got opt-outs from at December's Edinburgh summit. Though the three applicants have already accepted most existing EC obligations by signing the European Economic Area treaty between the Community and the European Free Trade Association, few Brussels diplomats believe the foreign and defence issue will be as easy to resolve as it was before yesterday's cameras. Romania and the EC yesterday signed an association agreement. It is similar to those signed previously with Poland, Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia.</p>

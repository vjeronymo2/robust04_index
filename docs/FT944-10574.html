			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Sotheby's sale raises Dollars 26m Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art in New York on Tuesday night brought in Dollars 25.9m and was almost 78 per cent sold by value. All the important works on offer, including one of Modigliani's last portraits, of his mistress Jeanne Hebuterne, found buyers, but there was little interest in the second rate. Seventeen of the 46 lots were unsold. The Modigliani sold for Dollars 5.94m, just under its estimate. 'Femme dans la nuit', painted in 1945 by Joan Mro, was also slightly below forecast, selling for Dollars 3.03m. In 1986 Sotheby's sold the same painting for Dollars 2.5m. A drawing by Van Gogh, 'Wheat Field with Sheaves', copied from one of his oils, was just on target at Dollars 2.09m. There was little interest in Picasso, with only two of six paintings by him finding buyers.</p>

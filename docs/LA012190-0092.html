Perelman, chairman and chief executive  officer of the cosmetics firm, said: "The Revlon grant will help expedite the  vital and exciting research under way at the UCLA School of Medicine.  </P> <P> Breast and ovarian cancers take a tragic toll in human mortality and suffering.  I hope this grant will speed the day when these devastating cancers can be  controlled and eliminated."  </P> <P> Breast and ovarian cancers account for one-third of all cancers in women, a  UCLA spokesman said.  </P> <P> The money, which will be given to UCLA over three years, will provide  fellowships for postdoctoral fellows and seed grants for innovative research  related to women's cancer.  </P> <P> UCLA faculty member Dennis Slamon will head the program's research team.  </P></p>

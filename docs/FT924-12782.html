			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Observer: Ruler of the roost Among the wise old owls of business, Lord Kadoorie of Kowloon now retiring from the chairmanship of Hong Kong's China Light &amp; Power, is on a perch of his own. Compared with him at 93, there's a callow look about other family patriarchs such as Gianni Agnelli and Lord Forte, who have likewise scheduled themselves for retirement. The Kadoories have always been different from the other members of Hong Kong's ruling elite. For a start, the 93-year-old's father, Elly, was a Jewish merchant from Baghdad instead of a clansman from a Scottish lowlands. Moreover, unlike many of the other local Taipans, the Kadoorie family has long preferred to live in the colony than London, and concentrate its philanthropy on the Near and Far East. It has helped them adapt better than most to the changes in China. Whereas Jardine, Matheson opened in Canton in 1832 and the Swires set up in Shanghai in 1867 and started the China Navigation Company in 1872, the Kadoories did not really get going in China until the early part of this century. True, like the others, they have had to rebuild their fortunes on several occasions and to repel hungry predators from their quoted businesses, which include a controlling stake in the famous Peninsula Hotel. But despite criticism that they were not moving with the times, their conservative approach has paid dividends. If Forbes magazine is to be believed, the Kadoorie family has a net worth of Dollars 3bn, or Dollars 1bn more than the Swire brothers and roughly 10 times the estimated worth of the Keswicks, who run Jardine, Matheson. So it would seem that the battered humpty-dumpty doll - which the retiring Lord keeps in his office to remind him of the consequences of losing your balance - has served him well.</p>

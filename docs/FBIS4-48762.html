			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 24 SAPA -- The government of national  unity would prepare a white paper setting out the details of the  Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP], Minister Without  Portfolio Mr Jay Naidoo told a media briefing in Cape Town on  Tuesday. Mr Naidoo and Finance Deputy Minister Alec Erwin were  providing details of the RDP announced by President Nelson  Mandela in his state of the nation address to the opening of  Parliament.    Mr Naidoo said the white paper would differ from the RDP set  out by the African National Congress during its election  campaign. The ANC said then its RDP would cost R[Rand]39-billion.    Asked whether the RDP agreed to by the cabinet of the  government of national unity differed from the ANC's plan, Mr  Naidoo replied: "Absolutely".    In his speech to Parliament, Mr Mandela said the cabinet had  reached consensus "on many elements of a plan broadly based on  that (the ANC's) Programme for Reconstruction and Development".    Mr Erwin explained that the RDP had been discussed with a  wide variety of stakeholders and changes had been introduced.  The new plan would be set out in the white paper.    Mr Naidoo said he would be responsible for the white paper  in  conjunction with the Departments of Finance and State  Expenditure.    As a "kickstart" to the RDP, Mr Mandela announced that  R2.5-billion had been set aside. The fund would be increased by  R2.5-billion a year for five years.    The initial R2.5bn was derived from redirecting government  spending priorities.    However, increased economic growth could boost the fund to  well beyond the R12.5-billion total at the end of the five-year  period, Mr Erwin said.    The fund would not be used like the Independent Development  Trust Fund in which individual projects were financed.    Mr Naidoo's office would be responsible for programmes and  budgeting.</p>

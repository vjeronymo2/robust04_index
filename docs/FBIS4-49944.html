			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tan Hongkai: "State Services Still Require Support"] </F>   [Text] A major step in the current wave of government  reform is to wean nonadministrative establishments from state  agencies and "socialize" their service functions.    As a result, many government-sponsored state agencies in  charge of nonexecutive issues are told to earn their own money.    For some, however, it is very hard to make profits, at least  for the time being.    Management involved with subsidization of plant protection,  water and soil conservation, pest control, and technology  promotion fall into such a category, said Li Zhensheng, former  vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.    With these people struggling to eke out a living, "few  bother  about their proper duties," he said.    Much of the damage caused by insect pests and crop diseases  in recent years Li attributes to the crippled state agencies in  charge of rural technical promotion.    Many participants to the 1994 session of the Chinese  People's  Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) criticized a tendency  in some local authorities to shirk responsibility in the name of  reform.    Agrotechnology -- the application of science to farming  problems -- was neglected by cadres who were misinterpreting the  reform message as profits and good-looking financial accounts.    Agrotechnology promotion agencies should be retained and  strengthened, they contended, to support agriculture -- the most  important and fragile industry in China.    "Although we've been affiliated to the state, we are only  responsible for technological promotion. Such nonexecutive  agencies as ours should go public in the long run. But there  should be a process," said Zhang Yaozong, director of the  National Centre for Agrotechnology Promotion (NCAP), in an  interview with CHINA DAILY.    "Though this time reforms are targeted at reducing the  government's direct involvement in economic activities, many  local governments gave priority to reducing financial burdens,"  said Xu Weisheng, deputy director of NCAP.    The problem is that some local farm authorities have  deserted  their responsibilities instead of diversifying management to  ensure main duties.    With some agriculture-related agencies at the county level  being dismembered or merged, some funds earmarked for  agrotechnological promotion have been diverted to balance the  books and make up for financial deficits, Nie Chuang, a division  chief with NCAP, pointed out.    NCAP officials are disappointed the Law on Promotion of  Agrotechnologies has not been well implemented.    The 1993 law urges local governments to ensure setting up  county level farm management with personnel and financial  support.    NCAP's opinions are echoed by researchers at the Institute  of  Political Science (IOPS) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.    "A latent motive behind the initial call for government  reforms was mounting financial pressure," said Chen Hui, IOPS  researcher. "That is why burden reduction receives priority over  functional transfer."    Chen and his fellows, in consensus with the NCAP, appealed  for a step-by-step procedure while stressing the necessity of  current reforms.    The government should not relinquish its control before a  socialized service system is set up, according to Bai Gang, a  senior IOPS expert in charge of county-level research programmes.    Closing government agencies and diverting their staff have  been repeated several times in China's governmental reforms.  But each round was followed by an even more cumbersome  administrative body.    Zhang Dongchang, also an IOPS researcher, insisted that mere  simplification cannot solve all the problems at county level.    "This approach excelled mostly because of its immediate  effects in poverty-stricken counties," he said. "Since local  finance can see rapid improvements after streamlining the  payroll, the results are of course conspicuous.    "But excessive publicity has made this a model for all  areas."    Placing emphasis on the peculiar situation of the transition  from a planned economy to a market one, they appealed for an  even stronger role for the government.    "The most important factor that has enabled sustained  prosperity in many other nations is sophisticated control by the  government," Chen said.    The most basic functions of any county government is the  development of its agriculture, they said.    "The central government must reinforce its intervention  during the transitional period to ensure a smooth and  well-coordinated transfer," Bai said.    The embarrassment of agrotechnical departments, in their  eyes, exposes local governments' indifference to agriculture.    Emphasis on numerical criteria in official accounts also  explains local cadres' eagerness to neglect the basics.    Work performance evaluations generally emphasize output  value  and tax-profits turnover. Agriculture, however, always needs  government subsidies.    "The government's role in such fields as rural education,  health care, family planning, and technical services should not  be weakened for the time being," Bai said. "Otherwise, there  will only be chaos."    But Wang Qinfeng, with the General Office of the Central  Organization and Establishment Committee, sees a brighter  picture.    Difficulties of rural technical agencies are just like the  throes of childbirth, painful but temporary, according to Wang.    "If people knew more about local conditions, they would draw  a different conclusion," he said.    He stressed that pilot reforms were carried out not only in  poor regions but also involved economically-advanced areas. His  committee has never asked local governments to follow any  identical model.    "Our policy is to encourage early separation of nonexecutive  branches from the chains of government offices in localities  where conditions are ripe, instead of making it compulsory  everywhere," he said. "And there should be a process."    Problems do exist in the course of reforms, he noted, but  most derive from policy distortion and practical implementation.  Current problems can only be solved through further reforms.    Misuse of funds, for example, has little to do with the  reforms themselves, he said.    "So far as I know, the experiments are generally  successful,"  he said.    Qin's optimism is based on the focus of debates that it is  not whether but how the nation should push forward reforms.    Difficulties of agrotechnical service agencies are not  peculiar in such comprehensive reforms in a populous country  like China.    Losses of vested interests are inevitable in the transition  from the old to the new mechanism. As long as reforms are still  on the right track, the agony is worthwhile.    The most essential task now seems to be how to ensure reform  measures that are not misinterpreted.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (2): Small charities may have to pool their resources - The new Act will bring important changes THE CHARITIES Act could be the cue for a radical shake-out of the industry. Many of the charities covered by the Official Custodian are so small that they may not find it worthwhile to manage their own investments. Rather than fail in their duty to help their causes as much as possible, it seems likely that many will opt to merge. According to John Harrison, charities director of Lazards Investors, less than one third of the 40,000 charities managed by the Official Custodian have an income of more than Pounds 1,000 a year. Charities this size will not welcome the extra administrative burden; some kind of pooling of resources could be necessary. Several other City fund managers believe mergers are likely. However, charity mergers are traumatic for trustees, as they can seem to involve dilution of the original aims of the charity. Sharing and streamlining of administration seems more likely. Mr Pesh Framjee, senior charity consultant with accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn, says: 'There's a point where you have a critical mass and it doesn't make sense to be on your own. You have got really small charities which are handled by trustees. If they get a little larger it's better for them to have a full-time administrator. But that administrator could administer five or six charities. It's become easier, under the Act, to do that, and before that it was a bureaucratic nightmare. But I still think there's going to be a grass roots resistance to this merger trend.' Mr Framjee points to the growth of umbrella organisations such as the National Federation of Community Organisations, and the Charity Finance Directors Group which has 400 members. These directors will need to plan carefully in the face of the recession, as charitable donations - particularly of the directly solicited 'flag day' type - are vulnerable to a downturn. Falling house prices can also be expected to dent bequests, which would hurt another vital source of charity revenue. Mr Framjee says legacy income for charities fell by 1 per cent last year, and suggests that executors' delay in selling a house because of the depressed market could also cause cash flow problems. Mr Andrew Hind, chairman of the Charity Finance Directors Group and finance director for Barnados, points out that privatisations and redundancies seriously affect pay-roll giving through the tax-efficient 'give-as-you-earn' scheme. Charities have built close links with large companies, and will not find it easy to adjust if these companies then split up. Significantly, the smaller charities seem more vulnerable than larger, well-established charities which have become effective trading organisations, such as Oxfam (which saw its income rise from Pounds 91.56m to Pounds 99.92m last year) and Save the Children. If the smaller charities want to survive, Mr Adrian Randall, finance director of the Cancer Research Campaign, says: 'More and more of them will start to get more involved in other activities than straightforward donations and gift-giving. They'll just have to come up with more and more innovative schemes for raising money.' The new philosophy is to justify to donors that their money is being used as efficiently and effectively as possible in helping the cause for which it was given. That, says Mr Hind, means building long-term relationships with donors, and keeping them informed. Regular, committed donors will regard charitable giving as one of their most important items of expenditure, and will therefore be less likely to surrender it in the teeth of the recession. The new disclosure rules for charities in the Charities Act, which bring charities closer to the kind of standards already expected of quoted companies, should also encourage this philosophy. Mr Randall says the Act will 'bring charity accounts into the 20th century, if not into the 1990s'. However, he is not alone in expressing concern that the Act may not have been well drafted. In particular, the exemption from many requirements for charities which are also limited companies could be used as a loophole, as many charities are companies limited by guarantee. The danger, according to Mr Hind, is that unscrupulous charities could hide behind the Companies Act, and avoid the rigorous disclosure requirements intended for them. Moreover, the Charities Act will also require a substantial shift in attitudes by charitable trustees. Many of them should soon be uncomfortably aware of their onerous responsibilities. Mr John Thornton, of Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow-based fund managers, points to a report on trustees by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, which suggests that many trustees do not understand the massive responsibilities they have taken on. For more than half of the organisations the NCVO contacted, it was necessary to explain what a trustee was, showing the difficulties which will also be experienced by businesses in trying to make contact. Only one in three of the trustees contacted actually knew that they were a trustee. As few as one in eight had received personal training for their position as a trustee. As the position carries with it potentially unlimited liability, this suggests that charities still have a way to go before they can command the same respect as the corporate sector. As the charity sector badly needs to expand into the trading arena, it is not surprising that accountants, consultants and solicitors, as well as fund managers, now see opportunities in helping the sector fulfil the role which the government has now allotted to it in the provision of services for the UK.</p>

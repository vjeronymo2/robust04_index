			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Quayle warns EC on Gatt talks: Failure to liberalise trade could encourage US to pull troops out of Nato MR DAN QUAYLE, US vice-president, issued a scarcely-veiled warning to the European Community yesterday about the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade trade liberalisation talks. He said that, if the Gatt talks failed, it would fuel protectionism in the US and encourage those wanting to pull all US troops out of Nato. He did not specifically link the Gatt talks and the Nato debate. However, a series of top US politicians and defence specialists did, in a debate on the future of the Atlantic alliance at the annual Munich Security Conference, which brings together defence experts from all Nato countries. The barrage of US warnings, and pleas for Europe to make concessions so that the US can maintain its commitment to Nato, encountered concern and some exasperation on the EC side. For the US side, Senator Richard Lugard, in particular, warned of the looming dangers of a transatlantic conflict with far wider security implications. 'We are headed towards a precipice, and the Europeans don't see it, or if they do, they don't really care,' he said. 'It is a potential tragedy in the making, which really needs to be avoided.' Senator Bill Cohen, another leading defence expert, warned that Congress was likely to go well beyond the troop cuts in Europe proposed by President George Bush. Instead of agreeing to leave 150,000 men, Congress was looking at figures of 100,000 or even 75,000, he said. 'The attitude is spreading in the US that Nato is no longer necessary or affordable,' Mr Cohen said. 'Few are willing to pay for what they perceive to be another's security.' Mr Lugard said that the compromise proposals for a deal in the Uruguay round of Gatt negotiations, drafted by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt secretary-general, 'have not found favour with almost any lobby in Congress'. As for the EC, it had 'found even less favour with the agriculture section, and we find a growing gap. It is further away from the US than ever'. Mr Lugard said: 'That is very disturbing. It clearly will undermine all that we are talking about in terms of the US and Nato. The US will become preoccupied with domestic issues . . . if we are rebuffed too often in terms of international trade issues.' Mr Quayle launched into the debate with a lengthy departure from his prepared speech, to urge the critical importance of the Gatt negotiations. 'This is absolutely critical,' he said. 'It is critical to the security of Europe, to the security of the US and to the security of Asia. 'We have got to continue this Uruguay round, and finalise it. If we don't, we have got the Cold War behind us . . . and yet we have no comprehensive understanding of how we are going to conduct trade relations, other than to respond in our own countries with the lowest political denominator. 'That means more subsidies, more spending, more fiscal irresponsibility.' While he insisted that talk of protectionism in the US was exaggerated, he admitted that 'perhaps protectionism may be advantageous in some electoral districts'. He said Mr Bush would not use the issue in his campaigning for president. 'Isolationism and protectionism are dead end streets,' he said. But he closed with an implied linkage of the issues: 'Effective national and international security does have to have co-ordination between political, military and economic security.' Later Mr Quayle, meeting Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, in Oggersheim near the French border, spoke of 'undercurrents of challenges' which need to be resolved in American-German relations. Mr Kohl acknowledged that 'there are differences. That is normal.' However he commended the US troop presence which defended European security. Mr Hans van den Broek, Dutch foreign minister, said the Netherlands had put all its efforts into reaching a deal in the Gatt round last year. It was up to all sides to make compromises. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said the US presence in Europe was essential. Space-based defences back in favour, Page 2 Editorial comment, Page 12</p>

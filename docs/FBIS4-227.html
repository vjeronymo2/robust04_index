			<p>BFN     [Text] Kampala, April 5 (AFP) -- Tempers flared here on  Tuesday [5 April] between northern and southern Sudanese  delegations during a debate on the situation in Sudan at the  six-day seventh Pan-African Congress.    Tempers soared after Sudanese delegate Abu Zaidi, who  introduced himself as representative of the Sudanese  non-governmental Friendship Council for Sudan, accused the rebel  Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) of betraying the cause of  pan-Africanism by accepting sponsorship from "imperialists".    Some 30 SPLA delegates shot to their feet and complained to  the congress chairman Colonel Kahinda Otafire that Zaidi, whom  they accused of being "a planted agent of the Sudanese  government", was insulting their organisation.    But Otafire, director of Uganda's External Security  Organisation, instead called in the police to remove the  protesting SPLA men from the congress floor, a decision that  enraged them and their supporters from other countries,  particularly the Caribbean. The SPLA group immediately embarked  on a protest within the hall, pulling out placards, one of which  read: "We demand an independent state of Southern Sudan".    The protest, which lasted 30 minutes, brought the congress  to  a standstill, until some delegates persuaded the SPLA group to  sit down to allow business to resume.    In his address to the congress the previous night, SPLA  leader John Garang blamed the Sudanese problem on the domination  of the mainly Christian and animist south by the Islamic,  Arabised north.    Garang stressed that the proposal by the Sudanese government  that southerners would be exempted from the Sharia law "was  unacceptable, as it reduced non-Moslems to second class  citizens".    "We propose a confederal Sudan as a temporary measure to end  the war, but the talk that they will crush the SPLA cannot work.  I assure you fellow pan-Africanists that we will not be  crushed, we are there to stay", Garang declared.</p>

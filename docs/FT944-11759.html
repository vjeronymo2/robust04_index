			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Theory squeezes economic ideas into a mathematical straitjacket Sir, Many of those who read Professor Barro's Personal View (November 1) would have been surprised to discover that the essence of 'endogenous growth theory' is the proposition that commercial research and development leads to the discovery and adoption of new technologies and new products, and that this 'theoretical advance' had been made in California in the late 1980s. They may have thought that this idea was a fairly commonplace one, which has become familiar since its propagation by Schumpeter more than 50 years ago. What the proponents of 'endogenous growth theory' have done is to try to squeeze some of the ideas of earlier economists into the straitjacket of a set of mathematical equations. Few people would believe that the evolution of modern market economies can usefully be represented by a set of equations which focus on linear relationships between quantifiable 'variables', to the exclusion of the more subtle but more important connections between social, political and subjective factors. In this connection, Professor Barro's statement that 'Overall, the new theory and empirical work on economic growth supports the general thrust of . . . economic policies such as privatisation and deregulation . . .' is misleading. While one would expect 'empirical work' to support the notion that privatisation and deregulation are beneficial to economic growth in advanced economies, this has nothing to do with endogenous growth theory, which does not count such measures as privatisation or deregulation among the 'variables' of its equations. Britain's chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, and others are right to be sceptical of intellectual games which subtract from, rather than add to, our understanding of the process of economic growth. Their only practical function appears to be to provide catch-phrases for those politicians who do not understand them.

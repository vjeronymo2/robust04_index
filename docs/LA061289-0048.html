			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASY GOER MIGHT MAKE HAY WHILE SUN SHINES;  </P> <P> IF SUNDAY SILENCE TAKES SUMMER OFF, BELMONT CHAMPION COULD WIN DIVISION  </P> <P> Thanks to that $1-million bonus he clinched by running second in Saturday's  Belmont Stakes, Sunday Silence has earned about $700,000 more than Easy Goer.  </P> <P> But Easy Goer, the toast of New York after he atoned for his Kentucky Derby and  Preakness sins with a smashing victory in the Belmont, could catch up quickly  if he doesn't have to hook up with Sunday Silence soon.  </P> <P> Easy Goer will continue to run in the East while Sunday Silence returns to  trainer Charlie Whittingham's barn at Hollywood Park for a rest. With Easy Goer  and Sunday Silence dominating the 3-year-old division, both will be heavy  favorites wherever they run, as long as they're not in the same race.  </P> <P> Other than the Big Two, only Hawkster ran in all of the Triple Crown races, and  his handlers should be considering other options after what is believed to be  an unprecedented three consecutive fifth-place finishes. Hawkster was beaten by  a total of 35 1/2 lengths in the Derby, Preakness and Belmont.  </P> <P> The only fresh horse to run against Easy Goer and Sunday Silence in the Belmont  was Le Voyageur, a French-raced son of Seattle Slew who ran one of the fastest  opening miles in stakes history, then hung on to finish third, a length behind  Sunday Silence. Le Voyageur is headed back to France and probably won't race in  the United States until the Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream Park in November.  </P> <P> Whittingham, whose colt beat Easy Goer by 2 1/2 lengths in the Derby and by a  nose in the Preakness before losing the $5-million Triple Crown by eight  lengths in the Belmont, plans to give his colt the equivalent of a month off  before regrouping for the rest of the 1989 campaign.  </P> <P> Easy Goer is headed for the $1-million Travers at Saratoga on Aug. 19, with the  $500,000 Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park on July 29 to serve as a prep.  </P> <P> The Travers is 1 1/4 miles, the same distance as the Derby, but Whittingham  isn't saying whether the Travers will be considered. After the Belmont, Arthur  Hancock III, Sunday Silence's principal owner, was talking more about the  $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 4 than he was the Travers. If Sunday  Silence skips the Travers, he probably would prep for the Breeders' Cup with a  race during Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting in October.  </P> <P> There are no major races on dirt for 3-year-olds in California during the  summer. A race that might tempt Whittingham is the $1-million Super Derby at  Louisiana Downs on Sept. 24.  </P> <P> In 1986, Whittingham finished third in the Belmont with Ferdinand after the  colt won the Derby and ran second in the Preakness. Ferdinand, who had minor  physical problems, was given the rest of the year off. The next year, as a  4-year-old, Ferdinand was raced extensively early in the year and got a  two-month breather before he won a stake at Santa Anita in November, won the  Breeders' Cup Classic two weeks later and then was voted horse of the year.  </P> <P> Observers foresee the 76-year-old trainer doing the same thing this year with  Sunday Silence -- giving him time off until the fall and then running him in  the Breeders' Cup.  </P> <P> Horses who win the first two legs of the Triple Crown but lose the Belmont  still usually win the 3-year-old championship. Of the 11 horses who lost the  Belmont after winning the first two races, seven were voted the title. Two of  the Triple Crown spoilers, Stage Door Johnny in 1968 and Arts and Letters in  1969, were voted top 3-year-old colt, and Arts and Letters also won horse of  the year.  </P> <P> After Kauai King won the Derby and Preakness in 1966 and then ran fourth as  Amberoid won the Belmont, Buckpasser won the division title and was also voted  horse of the year. Buckpasser didn't run in the Triple Crown, but won the  Travers and also beat older horses in the Woodward and the Jockey Club Gold  Cup.  </P> <P> Buckpasser was raced by Ogden Phipps, the owner of Easy Goer, and the  80-year-old investment banker says that Easy Goer could be even better. Some  horsemen say that he already is, having recovered from the disappointments in  the Derby and Preakness to run one of the strongest Belmonts.  </P> <P> Nine horses won the Belmont by larger margins, but Easy Goer's time of 2:26  ranks behind only Secretariat's 2:24 when he won the Triple Crown in 1973.  </P> <P> Because of his tour de force Saturday, Easy Goer may be considered the nominal  leader of the division until he and Sunday Silence meet again. If the rematch  is in the Breeders' Cup, the distance will be 1 1/4 miles.  </P> <P> "When we get back to 1 1/8 and 1 1/4 miles, the result might be the same as the  Derby and the Preakness," Whittingham said.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Here's the breakdown on how the $1-million bonus was divided among Sunday  Silence's camp: Principal owner Arthur Hanock III received $385,000; partner  Ernest Gaillard, $192,500; Charlie Whittingham, as minority owner and trainer,  $292,500; jockey Pat Valenzuela, $100,000; and the barn help -- exercise rider,  groom, et al -- $30,000 each. Imaginative minds painted the scenario that  Calumet Farm, which owns Le Voyageur, brought the colt from France to run in  the Belmont so he could burn out Sunday Silence with his speed and enable Easy  Goer to win. Easy Goer is a son of Alydar, who stands at stud at Calumet in  Lexington, Ky. But Patrick Biancone, Le Voyageur's trainer, said that he had  been planning to run in the Belmont since March. . . . The Valenzuela riding  family has now failed to win the Triple Crown with three horses that failed in  the Belmont. Milo Valenzuela couldn't win the Belmont after taking the Derby  and Preakness with Tim Tam (1958) and Forward Pass (1968). Pat Valenzuela is  Milo's nephew.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATWATCH: THOMAS INCLUDES FEW TURNOVERS WITH FAVORITE DISHES  </P> <P> Coaches at Nevada Las Vegas have compared Taft High's Dedan Thomas to former  Runnin' Rebel star Mark Wade, who set school records for assists. Wade's  hallmark as a point guard was that no matter what kind of defensive pressure he  faced, he dished the ball to the right man at the right place at the right  time.  </P> <P> Thomas, a 5-foot-10 senior who will attend UNLV in the fall, did likewise all  season.  </P> <P> Thomas averaged 9.1 assists despite playing for a team that played a  slow-paced, halfcourt offense. And despite being Taft's only solid ballhandler,  Thomas turned the ball over only 63 times in 22 games (2.9 a game).  </P> <P> Thomas also averaged 5.3 steals and carried the team scoring load, averaging  18.5 points. He made 146 of 300 field-goal attempts (48.6%).  </P> <P> Final countdown: El Camino Real senior forward Brent Lofton is arguably the  best basketball player in school history. Last year, he was named All-City and  appears a cinch to repeat after averaging 23.7 points and 12.2 rebounds this  season. In his 2 1/2-year, 50-game varsity career, Lofton scored 1,009 points  (20.2 average) and had 556 rebounds (11.1). This season, he made 184 of 315  field-goal attempts (58.4%) and 83 of 116 free throws (71.5%). Lofton's career  point total is a school record and only 1987 graduate Sean Davis (651) has more  career rebounds.  </P> <P> Mr. All-around: Oakwood senior swingman Mitchell Butler averaged 29.6 points,  16.2 rebounds, 4.6 assists, 4.5 steals and 2.0 blocks, team highs in all  categories.  </P> <P> Iron man: Crespi guard Chris McGee played every minute of the Celts' last 16  games and all but a combined 16 minutes of 22 games. The last time McGee  watched from the bench was against Glendale in the Beverly Hills tournament  Dec. 15.  </P> <P> Shooting percentages: Hart's Brett Wilson shot a team-high 55% (172 of 313)  from the field. Wilson also made 69% (195 of 282) of his free throws.  </P> <P> Notre Dame's Brian Jones shot 52% from the field, 47% from three-point range,  and 77% from the free-throw line. Teammate Ken Hicks shot 49% from the field,  48% from three-point range, and 76% from the free-throw line.  </P> <P> Three Birmingham starters shot better than 50% from the field: Tyrone Craig  (54.8), Glenn Sucich (53.9) and Jason Wallace (52.9). Sucich made 79.3% of his  free throws.  </P> <P> Harvard's Brian Domyan shot 54% (116 of 214) from the field and teammate Mike  Beckwith shot 53% (128 of 240). Harvard's Rick Osterloh made 100 of 123 (81%)  free throws. Crescenta Valley's Raffie Eskandarian made 140 of 183 free throws  (77%).  </P> <P> Soccer: Matt Freedman leads the Agoura boys' team with 26 goals and Dominic  Zapata has 22 goals and 19 assists. Heidi Walters leads the Agoura girls' team'  with 29 goals.  </P></p>

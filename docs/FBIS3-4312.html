Court officers personally visited the deputies to the  Municipal People's Congress and People's Political Consultative  Conference, asking them to choose one of three descriptions of  Yu: "well-meaning peasant", "generally good but with small  faults", or "ignorant village moneybags".    "More than 80 per cent of the delegates chose `ignorant  village moneybags' (tuchan zhu)," a source said. "This proved  to the court that nobody would protest against a stiff sentence."    Yu had been the head of the inordinately wealthy Daqiuzhuang  village near Tianjin. Unconfirmed reports at the time of his  sentencing suggested that Yu's case was taken all the way to the  Politburo because lower-level legal functionaries believed that  Yu had the personal protection of a senior Chinese leader.    The main reason for the delay in sentencing Yu was  uncertainty about the popular response to throwing the book at  the once-praised peasant hero, the source said. But the poll  dispelled all doubts.    "This gave them confidence that the sentence would not be  contentious as were many of those passed after June 4," he said,  referring to harsh sentences dished out to Tianjin students  after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, which had caused  resentment in the city.    Yu was sentenced to 10 years for bribery, six years for  harbouring criminals, three years for obstructing justice and a  total of six years for unlawful detention and control of others  in a case involving the beating to death of a village worker in  December 1992. Some of the terms will be served concurrently.    In publicity surrounding his trial, mainland media  repeatedly  criticised Yu and the 25 village henchmen sentenced along with  him for their disrespect for and ignorance of the law.    Two weeks ago, China's procurator general, Zhang Siqing,  mentioned Yu's case in his national work report as an example of  "the small number of judicial officials and grass roots cadres  who abuse their authority and detain people unlawfully."    However, the Daqiuzhuang issue remains a sensitive political  topic in Tianjin, where officials have already quashed a  proposal from the city's agricultural research institute to  launch a study on "the Yu Zuomin Phenomenon in China". "It was  believed this would go against Beijing's policy that Yu Zuomin  should be treated as an isolated case which does not invalidate  the economic achievements of many other rich villages whose  leaders have a boldness of vision," a government researcher in  the city said.    Yu is understood to be under tight guard at a rural Tianjin  jail, where he complains about a lack of birds nest soup and  Yunnan cigarettes. While under detention, Yu was accused of  offering "tens of thousands of yuan" to bribe a court official  to reveal details of the investigation.    Meanwhile, sources said Daqiuzhuang has been reopened to  foreign visitors after a one-year off-limits policy. "The clan  atmosphere has been done away with following the appointment of  outsiders to take over," the source said. "Tianjin leaders feel  it is safe to open it again." Experienced cadres from Jinghai  county, which includes Daqiuzhuang, have been brought in to take  over.    The government and party posts have been split to prevent a  recurrence of the autocratic style of rule of Yu Zuomin, who was  concurrently party secretary, village head and general manager  of its main enterprise holding company. Ou Binju, former deputy  director of Jinghai's foreign trade bureau, is the new mayor,  while Wei Zongjing, former assistant county head of Jinghai, is  the new party secretary.    Daqiuzhuang was promoted from a village to a town in  November, giving it more access to public infrastructure  spending, the source said. The village's economy, meanwhile, is  showing signs of recovery from the incident, which idled many of  its 300 factories in the first half of last year.    Ou told the People's Daily last month that residual problems  caused by the factory shutdowns had been resolved by July or  August last year. "But the greatest change in Daqiuzhuang is  among the people," he said. "When the people meet with the  business leaders of the village no longer do they meet the  arrogant manner of the past."    The town aimed to increase its total output by 34 percent to  7.5 billion renminbi in 1994, Ou said.</p>

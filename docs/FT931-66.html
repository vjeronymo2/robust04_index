			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Everything to play for in China's Tarim basin - Tony Walker explains why the oil majors are lining up despite past disappointments WHEN registrations close in Beijing today for what may prove to be one of the world's last great oil basins, dozens of international oil companies will have signed up for seismic data gleaned from sketchy surveys of China's remote far western region. Mr Liu Song Wei, President of the China National Petroleum Corporation International, said in an interview that the response from the oil industry to the opening of new onshore areas had been 'very encouraging'. Among oil majors that had shown strong interest, he said, were Shell, Amoco, Arco, Unico and BP, among several others. After years of hesitation, China is at last inviting bids to explore its Tarim basin, located in the Central Asian Xinjiang region; and while foreign companies are wary because of the region's inaccessibility - a Tarim basin pipeline would need to be longer than the Alaska one - they feel bound to pursue the opportunity. 'The question is not whether we can afford to be involved, but whether we can afford not to be involved,' said the Beijing representative of a large European oil company. Wariness among foreign oil companies in China is understandable, given the disappointments many suffered in their search for oil offshore. BP, for example, spent about UDollars 200m drilling dry well after dry well in the 1980s in the Yellow Sea and Pearl River Delta, and it was far from alone in its singular lack of success in Chinese waters. China's offshore areas had, incidentally been billed as one of the world's last great 'oil plays,' hence nervousness among oil explorers when similar hyperbole is used to describe prospects in the Tarim basin whose reserves, based on fairly flimsy evidence, are being likened to those of Saudi Arabia. When Dr Wang Tao, President of China National Petroleum Corporation, announced in February that China was opening 12 additional onshore areas in the north of the country to foreign exploration, including the prized Tarim basin, it marked a substantial and belated turnaround in policy, not only for China, but also for Dr Wang himself. Above all, the decision represented a painful admission that China, which is expected to become a net importer of oil by the mid 1990s, simply did not have the capital or expertise to develop a region of the Tarim basin's dimensions, remoteness and technical difficulty. The spiralling demand for energy generated by China's booming economy - economic growth neared 13 per cent last year - almost certainly spurred the change of heart. Mr Liu admitted as much when he said that 'since China's economy is growing so fast we need more energy resources, and if we don't make a big discovery maybe we will have to import. We need foreign investment to speed up activity.' The reality for China is that even if a foreign company strikes it rich immediately, oil would not be flowing from the Tarim basin into the country's pipeline grid much before the end of the century. The Chinese, therefore, are in for a painful few years coping with an oil shortfall. China's current output is about 2.8m b/d, and exports are running at about 400,000 b/d, down from a peak of 600,000 b/d in 1985. Oil production limped upwards by about 1.6 per cent last year, but only after substantial investment in recovery enhancement for the mature Daqing oilfield in the North East, which accounts for 40 per cent of China's oil, and whose reserves are rapidly diminishing. China's success in drawing foreign explorers into the search for onshore oil has been patchy. Since, 1985 when the foreigners were first given access to 11 southern provinces - foreign companies regard these areas as marginal - from Jiangsu in the north to Hainan island in the south, some five exploration agreements were concluded, none of which have yielded a commercial find. Mr Liu said delays in opening the Tarim basin were explained by the time needed by the Chinese side to conduct preliminary surveys and to prepare basic infrastructure such as airports and trunk roads to enable foreign companies to gain access to the region. 'You have to remember,' he said, 'that China itself did not start exploring in the Tarim basin until 1978.' The Chinese official was cautious about prospects in the Tarim basin, but he noted that preliminary studies indicated that reserves might be 'very promising'. China itself did not have a firm estimate of possible recoverable reserves, but he said that a figure of about 10bn tonnes did not seem unreasonable, based on initial studies. China, Mr Liu noted, had found oil near the five blocks covering 72,730 square kilometres being offered for exploration in the southern Tarim basin. It produced about 100,000 tonnes from these small-scale efforts last year. He revealed that design work had begun on a pipeline to carry the oil some 3,700 kilometres from the Tarim basin to Luoyang in central Henan province where it would enter the country's national grid to be pumped to coastal loading terminals such as Qingdao, or to be used domestically. Mr Liu estimated that it would take 3-5 years for the pipeline to be built, but speed of construction would depend on the 'size of the reservoirs' discovered by foreign explorers. CNPC, would participate in the financing of the pipeline, but would also be looking to foreign companies for contributions. In recognition of the costs associated with exploring in such an inhospitable region and moving oil thousands of kilometres from China's vast hinterland, the authorities were reviewing financial conditions. China was 'prepared to do more to improve the investment environment for foreign oil companies' in difficult locales such as the Tarim basin, Mr Liu said. Later this year, State Council or cabinet would probably approve separate regulations from those applying to offshore exploration later this year. This might involve an extension of the exploration period, and greater flexibility in the formula used to calculate both the cost recovery component of oil sold and also profit share.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Disposal helps Union Discount return to black with Pounds 11.3m UNION DISCOUNT, one of the City's leading discount houses, returned to profit in the first half of 1993, largely due to its sale of Winterflood Securities, the small companies marketmaking specialist. The group announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.3m for the six months ending June 30 1993, after reporting pre-tax losses of Pounds 14.8m last time. Discontinued operations produced an operating profit of Pounds 3.7m, while disposals accounted for a further Pounds 6.5m. Operating profits on continuing operations amounted to just Pounds 1.1m, a substantial improvement on the Pounds 12.1m loss in the comparable period last year. However, there is no interim dividend. Mr George Blunden, chief executive, said the board wanted to see greater consistency in the company's performance before restoring dividend payments, and would concentrate on developing fee earning businesses. But he added: 'It's my target that we should restore dividend payments by the end of the year,' assuming the company's improved performance is maintained. Mr Blunden said that the first priority in restoring profitability was to extricate the discount house from its disastrous foray into leasing, undertaken in the 1980s. He hopes that no further provisions will be needed and that the remaining leasing businesses will be sold off or run down by the end of the year. Union Discount shares have been trading at a substantial discount to their net asset value, because of concern about its leasing businesses. The news that Sabre Leasing, the largest leasing business, continued to make a small profit even though the asset financing group lost Pounds 1m, 'has to be encouraging,' according to Mr Martin Green, an analyst at Smith New Court, 'but the market is still sceptical about any company involved in leasing'. The share price rallied 7p to 158p yesterday, still well below net asset value of 220p. The results were in line with analysts' expectations. Looking ahead, Mr Blunden said that the discount house would concentrate on developing existing businesses, including the traditional discount house business, jobbing, asset management and futures broking. The capital released by winding down the leasing side will be used to develop the group's capital markets operations in areas such as derivatives and arbitrage trading. Since the end of the first half, the group has acquired a majority stake in Guildhall, a consultancy which advises financial institutions on risk management. Earnings per share, stripping out disposals and discontinued operations, worked through at 3.78p, against losses of 87.8p. See Lex</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> Tests Find Heavy Metal Content </F>   [TEXT]Duesseldorf. The Elbe is supposed to be made  clean again. According to new tests, the river has actually been  spared much pollution since the [political changes in 1989], but  over the years high levels of heavy metals and organic  contaminants have collected in the sediment of the Elbe and its  tributaries.    At 1,165 km in length and up to nine km in width [in some  places] with a average current of 710 m[.sup]3[/] of water  per second, the Elbe is one of the largest rivers in Europe. But  at the same time, it is also one of the dirtiest: the Elbe is  highly polluted and in some stretches ecologically destroyed.  Around 7.6 million people in the nine German states either  permanently or for long periods of time receive drinking water  which does not meet the requirements of the European Union (EU)  and the drinking water regulations.    Germany, the Czech Republic and the EU under the roof of the  International Commission for the Protection of the Elbe (IKSE)  already joined together years ago to save the Elbe. By 1995  pollution of the Elbe and her tributaries is supposed to be  substantially reduced, and a clear improvement in the water  quality up to grade II ("moderately polluted") is supposed to  have been reached.    Moreover, the Ministry of Research and Technology has also  taken on the Elbe and her tributaries with its "Elbe 2000"  project. The goal: to win back stretches of the river as  renaturalized river meadows left to nature. By the year 2000 the  pollution of the Elbe should have been reduced to such an extent  that, according to the BMFT, "the basis [will have been created]  for a water system which can be used in an ecologically  balanced, sensible manner in harmony with nature." The BMFT has  made 61 million German marks available, and all investigations  by the "Elbe Research" working group of the International  Commission for the Protection of the Elbe (IKSE) are being  coordinated.    The numerous factory shut-downs after the political upheaval  have done the Elbe good. She carried less ammonium and mercury  in 1993 than in 1985, but more chlorinated hydrocarbons.  According to tests by the Elbe's water quality station in  Schnackenberg, the amount of ammonium sank from 54,000 metric  tons in 1985 to 7,700 metric tons in 1992 and to 6,900 metric  tons in 1993. The amount of mercury dropped from 28 metric tons  in 1985 to 4.2 in 1992 and 1.9 in 1993.    In contrast, pollution of the Elbe from chlorinated  hydrocarbons climbed in 1993 to 1985 levels. Last year the  concentrations of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, a waste product in  the production of the insecticide Lindane, were at 110 kg far  higher than the 1985 level of 85 kg. According to Hamburg's  senator for the environment Fritz Vahrenholt, it is suspected  that the pollution can be traced back to illegal dumping.    In the meantime the first results of the joint "Elbe  Tributaries" project are available. They show "that a persistent  improvement in the Elbe's water quality is only possible if at  least the large main tributaries are included in the clean-up  measures," since it is through them that much of the pollution  gets into the river, especially the heavy metals.    Scientists are particularly directing their attention to the  heavy metal contamination of the sediment, since this can be  determined not only at certain points but can also be followed  along downstream. Sediment provides a "long-term memory" which  mirrors for a longer period of time the accumulation of  suspended materials.    The fine grain fraction with a granulation of up to 0.02 mm  is being studied, because it corresponds to the suspended  material transported in water which, because of its grain  fineness, has a high bonding cability with heavy metals and  numerous organic pollutants, and [thus] accumulates them. The  natural (geologic) heavy metal concentration is used as a  reference base: values at the level of this geologic  concentration correspond to class zero ("unpolluted"), and each  doubling of the values means a move to a new classification.    The analyses show that the sediment in the basin near  Leipzig  is "heavily polluted" (class four) with cadmium. The scientists  also found arsenic and lead in high concentrations: in Muenzbach  near Freiberg sediment was sampled which contained a class seven  (extremely polluted) level of arsenic concentration. The  researchers trace this back to the steel and iron industry  there, which is also responsible for the high levels of lead.  Nickel was found in the sediment beneath the Aue nickel plant at  levels up to class five ("heavily to excessively polluted").    At the lower reaches of the Joint Basin east of Bitterfeld  lies the man-made Muldenstein lake which at the beginning of the  sixties was laid out in a former brown coal opencast mining  area. As it turned out, the [lake] forms a sediment trap, as the  sediment brought in from the basin had accumulated here in a  layer averaging about 30 cm high. In all, the researchers  calculated that about 25,000 metric tons per year accumulate in  the sediment of the artificial lake, or about 400,000 metric  tons since its flooding. It contains about 1,030 metric tons of  zinc, 114 metric tons of lead, 101 metric tons arsenic, 98  metric tons copper, 71 metric tons chromium, 43 metric tons  nickel, 32 metric tons cadmium and about 1 metric ton of  mercury. The uranium level is estimated to be 50 to 70 metric  tons. Accumulation in the basin constitutes a serious potential  danger, since if it is stirred up again and comes in contact  with oxygen, the highly toxic cadmium in particular can become  mobilized and pass into the food chain or the ground water.    Keeping the public's drinking water safe is, according to  the  BMFT, an urgent goal, since the nine German states, which in  great part constitute areas of water shortage, will even in the  future not be able to dispense with obtaining drinking water  from the bank filtrate of the Elbe. Therefore, four pilot or  demonstration facilities for obtaining drinking water from bank  filtrate or from the ground water in the Elbe's drainage area  have been being funded since 1990. It is also being studied here  whether using activated carbon filters can make it easier to  obtain drinking water from heavily polluted bank filtrate.  <H5>  Photo Caption </H5>   1. p 27: Measurement takers obtaining water and sediment  samples are now a common sight along the Elbe and her  tributaries. It is still a long way off before the pollution of  the rivers is reduced to acceptable levels.</p>

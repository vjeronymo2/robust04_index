			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rise sharply at long end US TREASURY prices rose sharply at the long end of the maturity range yesterday after a successful three-year auction and the latest economic news buoyed investor sentiment. In late trading the benchmark 30-year bond was up  15/32 at 108, yielding 7.326 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged, however, at 100 1/4 , to carry a yield of 4.099 per cent. The long end received a modest boost early on from overseas buyers, but there was a conspicuous lack of strong domestic demand. Most investors were waiting for the afternoon sale of Dollars 15bn in three-year notes, which is the first leg of the Treasury's latest Dollars 36bn refunding programme. Despite investor caution, most analysts predicted that the auction would be completed successfully. Those predictions subsequently proved accurate. The issue was awarded a yield of 4.65 per cent, as expected, and demand for the new securities was solid. THE combination of sterling weakness and fears of higher interest rates pushed UK government bond prices lower yesterday morning, but gilts recouped some of their losses later, following the release of producer prices data. News that the Skipton Building Society was raising interest rates on mortgages by half a percentage point depressed gilt prices, leading to fears of a base rate hike. Gilt prices later recovered some of their early losses after the release of the producer prices figures for July showing output prices rose by 3.4 per cent in the year to July, against 3.5 per cent in the year to June. Sterling started on a weak note, but later strengthened slightly against the D-Mark as central bank intervention to support the dollar helped ease tensions in the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system. The Liffe gilt future contract opened at 96.30 - down from Monday's close of 97.04 - and fell to a low of 96.22 before trading at 97.01 by late afternoon. In the cash market, the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003-07 fell from its opening of 115 7/32 to 115, yielding 9.45 per cent. JAPANESE government bonds rallied as yesterday's drop in the Nikkei stock index to below 15,000 sparked hopes of a further easing in interest rates. The Nikkei stock index dropped 243.78 points to close at 14,822.56, its lowest level since March 1986. The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.00 per cent and moved to 4.96 per cent in Tokyo trading before closing at 4.99 per cent and trading in London at around 4.965 per cent.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: Court finds French synthetic fibre aid broke notice rules - European Court The European Court of Justice last week overturned the European Commission's refusal to examine regional aid granted by France to Allied Signal, a synthetic fibre producer, for the building of a polyester fibre plant in the French region of Longwy. Judicial review proceedings were brought against the Commission by the Paris-based International Synthetic Fibres Association and the chemical companies, Akzo, Hoechst, ICI and SNIA Fibre. The case concerned the state aid regime applicable to the synthetic fibre sector in the context of the regional aid rules. By a 1985 decision (85/18/EEC) the Commission had authorised the grant of regional aid to certain regions including Longwy. However, that decision was without prejudice to existing or future specific sectoral aid rules. In a letter sent to EC states in 1977 the Commission had established a special aid regime for the synthetic fibres sector. The system of pre-notification established was intended to prohibit aid that would increase capacity. Regional aid was expressly included. The regime, never challenged by EC states, was extended every two years; a communication of July 8 1989 being the extension at the time of the proceedings. This said the Commission disapproved in advance any aid that would increase capacity regardless of the type of product or end-use (textile or industrial). France granted Allied Signal regional aid to build a plant in Longwy to make polyester fibre for industrial use, namely the supply of European tyre makers. In June 1990 the applicants asked the Commission to intervene. The Commission replied that the aid was granted in accordance with regional aid rules and had been announced before the last extension of the synthetic fibres regime. Consequently there was no obligation to notify the aid prior to its grant. The court rejected the Commission's arguments that the synthetic fibres regime was intended only to apply to textile use and had been modified to exclude industrial use by an inconsistent 1988 decision approving aid granted to a German producer. Neither the facts nor the texts of the relevant measures supported this interpretation. The ECJ ruled that the aid was subject to the pre-notification requirement. C-313/90, CIRFS v Commission, ECJ 5CH, March 24 1993. International Labour Organisation Chemical Safety Convention. At the request of the Commission the ECJ has delivered an opinion under its Treaty powers in the context of international agreements on ILO Convention 170 concerning safety in the use of chemicals at work. The ECJ considered whether the ILO Convention falls within the scope of the Community's competence and, if so, whether the Community's competence is exclusive. Applying its previous decisions in this area the Court ruled that the ILO Convention 170 falls within the joint competence of the Community and the member states. The Court emphasised it was not only where Community rules had been adopted within the framework of a common policy that the member states cannot, outside the framework of the Community institutions, assume obligations that might affect those rules or alter their scope. Concurrent powers of the member states were restricted in all areas where Community rules have been adopted for the attainment of the Treaty's objectives. The ECJ found the Community has internal legislative competence in safety in the use of chemicals at work overlapping the scope of the Convention. However, to the extent that the power of EC states to apply stricter measures than any directives adopted meant there was no conflict with equivalent provisions in the convention, Community competence was not exclusive. Where EC rules such as those relating to classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances were more than minimum requirement, commitments arising from the convention could affect the Community rules. Member states must not undertake such commitments outside the framework of Community institutions. Opinion 2/91, ECJ FC, March 19 1993. BRICK COURT CHAMBERS, BRUSSELS</p>

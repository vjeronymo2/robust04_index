			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Unlicensed but determined to thrill - Thames TV is planning its new future MORE THAN five months after the fateful fax that ended Thames Television's life within the ITV network the future of the company is beginning to take shape. Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames, outbid by Carlton Communications in the competitive tenders for new franchises, estimates that the new Thames will employ 235 people. That compares with an historic high of 2,600 and a total of 1,400 at the end of last year. The phased pattern of redundancies is continuing and by the time Thames hands over to Carlton Television at the end of this year what was the largest ITV company will have shrunk to having fewer than 500 staff. 'One thousand two hundred men and women are losing their livelihoods on a poker play. Long-established and experienced teams are being broken up for ever,' was how Mr Dunn described the process last week at a Financial Times conference. It was the first time the Thames chief executive had spoken publicly since the day the franchise was lost. As people leave and departments are closed, or reduced to a skeleton staff, Thames has also cut its output of regional programming to the minimum allowed and been given a substantial cut by the rest of ITV in this year's network expenditure. For staff every day brings a new 'salami' cut in services. Yesterday's memo was about a reduction in the department that deals with viewer correspondence. The in-house music library has closed and the newspaper cuttings department now only cuts the tabloid newspapers not the broadsheets. 'We expect to be strongly cash positive in 1992 and 1993 as the cost base reduces radically, working capital unwinds and asset disposals are made,' said Mr Dunn, adding that the interests of shareholders would come first. The company is 58-per cent owned by Thorn EMI, the music and rentals group. Although a wide range of options for the future are still being considered the preferred route forward is as an independent producer selling programmes to the ITV network, while remaining a publicly quoted company. An ITV sub-committee, which includes Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive of London Weekend Television and chairman of the ITV Association, is negotiating to buy Thames programmes. The package being talked about includes programmes such as The Bill, This Is Your Life, Minder, Strike It Lucky, Des O'Connor and Wish You Were Here? The negotiations are centring on price and the length of contract. Thames is trying to hold out for two-year deals. Thames is also discussing a number of new programme ideas with the BBC and drawing up plans to exploit a 10,000 programme library. It is also looking for 15 per cent stakes in a number of ITV companies or competing channels to help to build up secondary markets for its programmes. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act 15 per cent investments are the maximum allowed to independents if they want to retain access to the 25 per cent quota set aside for independent production on UK television. Only if the independent production route is blocked is Thames likely to dust down Plan B - using the Astra satellite system to launch a 24-hours a day channel as early as the end of this year. Another possibility is taking part in a bid for the new Channel 5 and also broadcasting the channel on satellite. But Mr Dunn is still extremely cautious about Channel 5. 'I still find it difficult to decide whether it is an opportunity or a threat' is how he described it. The Dunn blueprint envisages a UK production staff for Thames, including its Euston Films subsidiary, of only 40 by the middle of next year. A further 35 will work in international programme distribution. Together they will make up the core of the new business. Some 50 staff are expected to survive, after 80 redundancies at Cosgrove Hall, the Thames cartoon production company now making a Noddy cartoon series for the BBC. In the US there will be 50 jobs at Reeves Entertainment, the American acquisition. 'With production based in London, New York and Hollywood we aim to be a natural highway for co-production finance, especially between the United States and Europe,' Mr Dunn hoped. The Thames group management to look after investments in SES, the Astra satellite company, Independent Television News, Oracle, the teletext company and Childrens Channel will number less than 20. A further 40 will service Teddington Studios which will offer its facilities to both the independent production sector and the BBC. 'It will either market its services successfully enough to recover its costs or this aspect of our operations will close,' warned Mr Dunn. The same could probably said of all of Thames operations after 1993 in the harsh world of commercial television without a broadcasting licence.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NEW AGE IN KOSHER FOODS;  </P> <P> RETAILING: A DECADE AGO, THERE WERE 1,000 KOSHER PRODUCTS, CONSUMED MOSTLY BY  ORTHODOX JEWS. TODAY, THERE ARE 18,000 PRODUCTS, WITH $30 BILLION IN GROSS  SALES.  </P> <P> In Craig Winchell's business, security is of the essence.  </P> <P> His Sebastopol, Calif., complex is surrounded by an eight-foot fence that's  topped with a twist of razor-sharp barbed wire. Employees are carefully  screened. Specifications are exacting. A team of inspectors could drop in at  any time.  </P> <P> Winchell is not an engineer with a defense contracting firm, but rather an  Orthodox Jew who makes premium kosher wines -- Gewurtztraminers, Chardonnays,  Cabernet Sauvignons. His Gan Eden winery is part of a growing crop of certified  kosher specialty food makers reaching out to an clientele beyond the nation's  devout.  </P> <P> The security measures, Winchell says, are to keep "unauthorized people out" of  his winery. To maintain the strict kosher standards, all workers must be  observant Jews.  </P> <P> "The kosher market is much smaller than the California wine market in general,"  Winchell says. "In the kosher market, we're dealing with the perception that  European wines are better than California wines. . . . Luckily, we sell all we  make to the general market."  </P> <P> Kosher foods were formerly only available in mainstream grocery stores during  High Holidays, and, even then, consumers were lucky if they found much more  than a box or two of matzo and some gefilte fish.  </P> <P> A decade ago, there were 1,000 kosher products, and their consumers were  generally the same group that made them: Orthodox Jews. Today, about 18,000  kosher products, from Chardonnay to Cajun-style chicken, Pepperidge Farm baked  goods to Slim-Fast diet aids, are available year-round. Industry watchers peg  the kosher market at about $30 billion in gross sales for 1989.  </P> <P> Winchell was one of 80 kosher food manufacturers from around the country who  gathered Friday at the Los Angeles Convention Center for the International  Jewish Festival '89.  </P> <P> "The growth in kosher foods over the last 10 years has been absolutely  phenomenal," said Rabbi Menachem Genack, rabbinic administrator for the New  York-based Orthodox Union, the leading kosher certifier. "The number of  companies that have come under the OU's supervision has nearly tripled in size  from about 450 companies to about 1,250 or so."  </P> <P> Newcomers include Hiram Walker, Slim-Fast, the Sioux Honey Assn. and Pepperidge  Farm; longtime kosher companies include Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes  everything from kosher cake mixes to kosher laundry and dish detergents.  </P> <P> Kashrut, the Jewish dietary code, is complex and largely based on Old Testament  teachings. For example, meat and poultry must be raised on natural feed and be  slaughtered according to Jewish ritual.  </P> <P> Only part of the renewed vigor of the age-old industry is due to Jews who are  returning to religious orthodoxy, said Menachem Lubinsky, president of Lubicom,  the New York-based marketing firm that organized the trade show.  </P> <P> Consumption of kosher foods is often associated with America's 4.3 million  Jews, he said, but market studies show that there are 6 million Americans who  specifically buy kosher products.  </P> <P> Some are Seventh Day Adventists and Muslims, who adhere to similarly strict  dietary codes. Others simply "believe that kosher products are healthier and of  better quality," Lubinsky said.  </P> <P> Many of the 80 food manufacturers who gathered Friday are the first to admit  that they're using that perception as a strong marketing point for the general  consumer. On the West Coast, Season Products Corp. sells most of its fish  products -- like low-sodium sardines -- in natural food stores.  </P> <P> "Natural food people look at kosher certification for the wholesomeness," says  Alan M. Kahan, food broker for Season Products. Then there's Bruce Y. Prince,  executive vice president of Giamboi Kosher Food International, who was in Los  Angeles Friday pushing his premium Italian food: pricey tomato sauces, pastas  and extra virgin olive oil.  </P> <P> "We came up with a product that the public would buy that wouldn't be stuck in  the aisle with the gefilte fish," said Price. "For the first time, you're  getting a kosher gourmet pasta sauce in a microwaveable bottle. It sells  itself."  </P></p>

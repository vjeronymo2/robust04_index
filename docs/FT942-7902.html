			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / German judge who defies the laws of politics: President Roman Herzog is both a hardliner and a liberal Mr Roman Herzog, who last night emerged victorious as Germany's new federal president, is a man of surprising contrasts. For a start, as president of the constitutional court in Karlsruhe - and therefore the country's most senior judge - he is neither ponderous nor humourless. Although he sometimes looks alarmingly fierce in his photographs, he is noted far more for his homely wisecracks and capacity for self-mockery. He came to the court from Baden-Wurttemberg, where he had enjoyed the reputation of a hardline conservative as minister of the interior - and promptly put his signature on a string of liberal constitutional judgments. He is in many ways a typical bluff Bavarian, born in the heart of the fiercely independent 'free state' at Landshut 59 years ago. Yet he belongs to the minority Protestant church there, not the dominant Roman Catholic majority. His southern German style could hardly have made him more of a contrast to his principal opponent in the presidential race, Mr Johannes Rau, the former Social Democratic party (SPD) leader and populist premier of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. For all his popular touch, the latter tends to be a lofty moralist, a protestant preacher. As for Mr Herzog, for all his lofty legal position, he tends to present himself as one of the lads, as capable of falling by the wayside as any fellow citizen. His tastes appear to be thoroughly popular. He allowed himself to be photographed in Bild Zeitung, the mass circulation newspaper, doing the washing up (he does not own a dishwasher). Yet he is both a classical scholar who can converse in Latin, and an expert in early Medieval history. His nomination as presidential candidate by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, could scarcely have been less fortunate, or more bungled. Mr Kohl's first attempt was to promote an east German candidate, the unfortunate Mr Steffen Heitmann, the justice minister of Saxony, who proceeded to demonstrate such political naivete and latent conservatism that he frightened off many of his potential supporters. Only when he was forced to withdraw did the CSU put forward Mr Herzog - without apparently consulting Mr Kohl. The result was continuing confusion in the ranks of the coalition, before the judge was finally confirmed as a common candidate. Through all of this, Mr Herzog appeared unperturbed. Like Mr Kohl himself, he does not seem to need to be loved. But he was also perfectly clear that he was only prepared to stand if he had solid backing from his supporters. He began his career as a lecturer in constitutional law at the Free University in Berlin, where he was a professor during the turbulent years around the 1968 student revolt. He was certainly no revolutionary. He proved his academic credentials as co-author of the standard commentary on the German constitution. Mr Herzog fled Berlin for the calmer waters of the national college of administration in Speyer. It was there that he first came to the attention of Mr Kohl, who was then state premier of the Rhineland-Palatinate, and appointed this earthy but competent professor as his permanent representative in Bonn in 1973. From there it was a natural progression to becoming a full minister in neighbouring Baden-Wurttemberg. When he was nominated in 1983 to become a member of the constitutional court, the liberals were alarmed and the conservatives delighted. He had gained his hard-line reputation as state interior minister by ordering demonstrators (against the deployment of US Pershing missiles) to pay for the cost of policing their own demonstrations, and ordering the police to use CS gas. Yet he proved a surprisingly liberal judge, in a series of decisions on the rights of tenants, artistic freedom, and even the right to demonstrate. As the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote disapprovingly, the reputation of his court has become almost 'progressive'. As a federal president, Mr Herzog will undoubtedly create his own style. The Bavarian touch is unlikely to go down quite as easily in the international community as the aristocratic elegance of President Richard von Weizsacker. The greatest challenge he faces is to make himself president not just of the west Germans, in whose traditions and constitution he is so clearly expert, but also of the unsettled easterners. But even if his election was the product of a typical bout of party-political haggling, his career suggests that he will not be answerable to anyone. He will bring the independence of the constitutional court to the federal presidency, with a touch of the common man.</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / New York's 42nd Street names desire New York's 42nd Street may see a return of the streetcars that disappeared half a century ago. The city has started public consultations on a Dollars 75m regeneration scheme including building a 2.2-mile line running the length of the street from one side of Manhattan island to the other. Years ago the street was famous for the shows that put it at the heart of New York's night life, but now much of it is run-down and sleazy, and lined with pornography shops. The 1933 film musical, in which the leading lady in a Broadway show is indisposed and a chorus becomes a star, made the street famous around the world. The 42nd Street Development Corporation, a non-profit-making group that has been working with the city to restore the street to its former glory, believes the tram line might play an important part in improving the street's image. New York's Department of Transportation is backing the scheme because it believes the trams would provide an attractive and environmentally friendly means of shifting the many people who travel along 42nd Street each day. The Port Authority Bus Terminal and Grand Central Station lie along the route. At present most people use buses or the subway. The city planners believe the project will be self-financing and can be built by the private sector at no cost to the taxpayer. Four consortiums have pre-qualified for the competition to design, build, operate and maintain the line. The trams may start running in 1996 if the project survives the public consultation. But many fear that it will prove an expensive white elephant.</p>

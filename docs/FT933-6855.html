			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: BT gains veto powers over MCI activities BRITISH Telecommunications has succeeded in gaining wide-ranging veto powers over MCI's business activities as part of its deal to buy a 20 per cent stake in the US long-distance telecommunications operator. Details released yesterday on the terms of the Dollars 4.3bn (Pounds 2.88bn) deal, agreed in principle in June, give BT a veto on any purchase by MCI of a business worth more than 20 per cent of its market capitalisation, and on any purchase of a non-core business worth more than 5 per cent. BT has also secured the right to veto the sale of any MCI assets worth more than 15 per cent of its market value. Although such restrictions are not uncommon in the US, they reflect BT's concern at the vulnerability of its investment should MCI wish to change its strategy, which hitherto has centred on building itself up as a powerful long-distance and overseas competitor to AT&amp;T in the telecommunications business.</p>

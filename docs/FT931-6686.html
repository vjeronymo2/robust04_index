			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Motoring: Help for the careful driver ONE OF motoring's minor scandals is the way some drivers use a breakdown scheme as a substitute for servicing their cars or even keeping them in safe running order. According to Tony Dunlop, managing director of one of the leading operators, Europ Assistance, genuine roadside breakdowns are quite rare. He says many demands for help are from the kind of people who call out motoring organisations two or three times each year because of flat batteries, flat tyres or empty tanks. This puts up membership costs for responsible subscribers who check their tyres now and again and do not ignore a low fuel warning light. 'Many considerate drivers feel they are subsidising other motorists' negligence and not getting value for money,' Dunlop adds. Coincidentally, the AA has just put out breakdown recovery statistics confirming the point made by its Europ Assistance rival. Almost 9 per cent of AA breakdown call-outs are due to faulty batteries. This does not include batteries that went flat because lights had been left on and could be recharged; they account for another 6 per cent. At fault are batteries so far gone that the only answer is a new one. Every AA and RAC patrolman has stories of members calling them out to start cars with flat batteries and then, as an encore, expecting the equivalent of a free 15,000-mile service. And, for some time, the motoring organisations have black-listed members who make totally unreasonable demands on their services. This week, Europ Assistance has bitten the bullet and introduced Select, a breakdown service for responsible motorists who do not run neglected cars with dud batteries, almost-empty tanks, and tyres that have lost most of the tread. Europ Assistance says Select is only one-third of the price of the average motoring organisation's breakdown service. For Pounds 35 a year (or Pounds 65 for two years, Pounds 95 for three) it provides round-the-clock comprehensive breakdown cover including hotel expenses, car hire and so on. One or two extra cars can be covered for only Pounds 35 a car for three years. If Select subscribers do run out of fuel or lock themselves out of their cars, all is not lost. Europ Assistance still rides to the rescue but charges the motorist 'at cost' according to nationally-agreed rates. Another breakdown scheme for the thinking car-owner is offered by the Guild of Experienced Motorists. For Pounds 17.95 a year (plus Pounds 12 annual membership), GEM covers the full cost of breakdown recovery or roadside repair, including up to Pounds 35 spent on getting a car going at a member's home. Members pay the bill and then claim on GEM, which works through 1,500 approved garages linked to a 24-hour help-line. but do not call if your driving licence has been endorsed for a serious motoring offence. GEM is heavily into road safety and wants only caring, conscientious motorists as members. An independent survey revealed this week that the law requiring tyres to have 1.6mm pattern depth continuously round 75 per cent of the tread width is being treated with contempt. Up to two-thirds of tyres removed for replacement are worn beyond this limit. Fifteen per cent are damaged so badly that they are blow-outs waiting to happen.

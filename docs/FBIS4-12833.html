			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] During the past few months, the clerical regime  has again limited border transactions in the Iranian-Iraqi  border areas and regime officials in the various cities of  Kordestan are alleging that this directive has been issued by  the National Security Council and should be seriously [words  [indistinct].    When the residents in Iranian and Iraqi Kurdistan can meet  their needs through such local transactions, the closing of  routes and borders in this way is considered incorrect, a kind  of hostility by the Islamic Republic against the people of Iraqi  Kurdistan.    The clerical regime has not closed the border routes to  everyone and every type of transaction. It has encouraged some  of its own people and profiteering entrepreneurs to disregard  the closure of the borders and go to Iraqi Kurdistan to continue  the regime's old policy of plundering and pillaging national  assets and destroying the economic basis of the region.  [passage omitted]    A glance at this antipopular attitude shows the depth of the  regime's hostility toward the Kurdish people on both sides of  the border. It also shows that by plundering and pillaging  Iraqi Kurdistan it wants to destroy the livelihood of the people  in this area and that it is determined to resort to violence  toward the people in Iranian Kordestan to keep them impoverished.    The Islamic Republic is doing its best to upset things in  Iraqi Kurdistan and it stops at no plot or unsuitable act in  this direction. The clergymen are constantly trying to  coordinate their policy and acts with Ankara and Damascus  against the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan.    Clearly, the Islamic Republic is not satisfied with this  and,  by persistently trying to export narcotics and terrorist  elements in a bid to spread corruption and insecurity in Iraqi  Kurdistan, it is daily increasing the hostility it shows toward  the Kurdish people in Iraqi Kurdistan. Undoubtedly, the people  in Iraqi Kurdistan have realized the hostile nature of the  clerical regime and know of its tension seeking policies. They  know how hostile the Islamic Republic is toward the Kurdish  people in general and how dissatisfied it is with things in  Iraqi Kurdistan in particular. The people's hatred and aversion  toward the Islamic Republic of Iran grow daily and the regime is  regarded as the sworn enemy of the Kurds.</p>

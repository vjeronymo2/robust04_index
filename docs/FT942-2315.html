			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Dissidents seek sale of subsidiaries - Kmart Kmart shareholders are anxiously awaiting the outcome of tomorrow's board meeting amid expectations that Mr Joseph Antonini, the embattled chairman and chief executive, will push for the approval of a restructuring proposal. Mr Antonini is convening the session a fortnight after the discount store group's annual meeting, when disgruntled investors soundly rejected his plan to create new shares linked to the performance of four profitable specialty chains. The sale of the stock would have generated much needed cash while allowing Kmart to retain control of the businesses. The defeated proposal - centrepiece of a strategy to revive the company's fortunes after years of decline - represented a stunning personal defeat for Kmart's boss. It was a triumph for institutional investors seeking more control of corporate decision-making. The dissidents are pressing Kmart to opt for the outright sale of the four chains - OfficeMax, Borders-Waldenbooks, The Sports Authority and Builders Square. This amounts to asking Mr Antonini to repudiate a decade-long effort to diversify. Instead, they want management to concentrate on recapturing market share lost to Wal-Mart and other rival discount department stores.</p>

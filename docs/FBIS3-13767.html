			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Is It the Truth or an Israeli Trap?"] </F>   [Text] I have no idea whether this morning's newspaper  reports attributed to Israeli radio are the truth or a  premeditated Zionist trap to drive more wedges into existing  relations between the United States and the Arab and Islamic  countries. These newspapers published a statement by President  Clinton declaring that the unified Jerusalem is the capital of  Israel.    If this statement is true, then it means there has been a  radical change in the U.S. stand on the Jerusalem issue and it  also represents a real catastrophe for all the Arab and Islamic  countries and the PLO too.    We know that the official U.S. stand on the Jerusalem issue  regards East Jerusalem (the Arab part) as an occupied territory  to which all the UN resolutions, including Resolution 242, are  applicable in the same way they are applicable to all the other  occupied territories. But in view of the sensitivity of the  status of Jerusalem, both its Arab and Jewish sectors, for the  followers of the three major religions -- Muslims, Christians,  and Jews -- and its special sensitivity for Israel and in view  of Israel's topographical and demographic changes to Jerusalem,  the U.S. stand has been that the future of Jerusalem should be  decided during the final stages of the negotiations. And this  does not mean that they deny the fact that East Jerusalem is  occupied territory. In view of this stand, the United States  has so far refused to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to  Jerusalem.    Hence, this provocative statement attributed to President  Clinton worries the Arabs and Muslims in general and the  Palestinians in particular. In our view, if this statement is  true then it is hundreds of times more serious than the  al-Ibrahmi Mosque massacre because it slaughters our Jerusalem  itself and presents it as an offering to Israel.    But it is our duty to wait before being overcome by emotions  and first ask the U.S. Administration for a clarification of  this grave stand, because I discern in it the involvement of  Zionism, which is well versed in the art of driving wedges and  laying traps.    It is clear from the report published by AL-AHRAM that  Clinton did not say this directly to the conference of the  American-Israeli Political Action Committee [AIPAC], the largest  of the Jewish-American organizations, but to Steven Grossman,  the AIPAC chairman, who cited the U.S. President at the  conference. Radio Israel said that the U.S. President told the  AIPAC leaders that the United States regards the unified  Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The radio added that  Clinton said this in reply to a question from an AIPAC member on  the possibility that the Security Council will pass a resolution  on the Hebron massacre that will include a reference to  Jerusalem as part of the occupied territories. The radio added  that Clinton is keen not to let Jerusalem be mentioned in the  Council's resolution and designated as part of the occupied  territories.    The fact of the matter, as reported by the news agencies and  all other media, is that Clinton's objection to any mention of  Jerusalem does not stem from his ideas about it being occupied  territory but from his desire not to raise it in negotiations  until the final stage of the peace process. There is a big  difference between these two concerns. The new stand would mean  that the United States has unilaterally decided the fate of all  Jerusalem in favor of Israel. The old stand means that the fate  of Jerusalem remains subject to negotiations; and this in fact  is the U.S. stand known to everyone.    It is spurious to note here, as the AIPAC chairman did, that  Clinton never mentioned Jerusalem during his election campaign,  because the circumstances of the elections are one thing and the  official U.S. stand is something else. Why couldn't we say, for  example, that Clinton's silence over deciding the fate of  Jerusalem in favor of Israel during the elections campaign --  that is, when he most needed the Jewish votes and the Zionist  lobby's support -- is proof that Grossman's statements on Radio  Israel are a mere media fabrication or an intentional propaganda  ploy meant to embarrass the Arabs and divert any U.S. attempt to  force more flexible negotiating stances on Israel?    I therefore advise that we wait and be cautious and also  that  we seek clarification of the issue from those who have authority  to define such stands before we take any action on this very  grave affair.</p>

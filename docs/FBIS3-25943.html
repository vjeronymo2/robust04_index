			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Stability is a most important task was the main  topic of the speech made by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the  provincial party committee, at the provincial judicial,  procuratorial, and court work conference that ended on 31  January.    In his speech, Cheng Weigao set forth: The current economic  and political situation of Hebei Province is comparatively good.  However, this does not mean that there aren't any problems or  difficulties. We know that many unstable factors and prominent  security problems persist regarding political and social  stability. Thus, we must strengthen our sense of adversity in  this state of contentment. That is, we should ensure that we  keep an eye out for danger when we are content, subjugation when  we have stability, and disorder when we have good order. He  stressed:    [Begin Cheng Weigao recording] Reform is the motivation,  development is the purpose, and stability is the guarantee.  Without the deepening of reform, there will be no foundation  for development and stability in the situation and it will be  impossible for social stability to last for very long. However,  without a stable social environment, there will be no success in  reform, it will be impossible to make development, and nothing  will be accomplished. [end recording]    Cheng Weigao urged: Party committees at various levels  should go all out to grasp the work of safeguarding stability  just as they do to grasp economic construction. We should  strengthen the forecast before the issuance of reform measures;  actively strengthen propaganda, education, and persuasion; adopt  appropriate measures in a timely manner; and solve problems at  their bud and at the grass roots-level in a timely manner. We  should constantly grasp the initiative in safeguarding political  and social stability and create a good social environment to  ensure smooth progress in reform, opening up, and economic  construction.    Cheng Weigao pointed out that this year, we should focus the  judicial, procuratorial, and court work on dissolving a lot of  contradictions between the people at the very grass roots,  positively and deeply wage the struggle against economic crimes  with the focus on corruption and bribery, and sternly dealing  blows to serious criminal offenders. He said:    [Begin recording] The party committees and governments at  various levels should have the certificates of responsibility,  strictly implement the system of responsibility for guaranteeing  the peace of the designated area, actually form a situation of  making concerted efforts to comprehensively improve social  order, and implement the measures for safeguarding stability  among relevant departments and grass-roots units. The leaders  at various levels should pay attention to listening to the  opinions and voices of the masses, be concerned with their woes,  help them eliminate worries and difficulties, try all possible  means to solve the problems that the masses [words indistinct],  and do more good and real deeds for narrowing the relationship  between the party and the masses. [end recording]    In regard to the issue of strengthening the leadership over  the judicial, procuratorial, and court work, Cheng Weigao said:  The party and government leaders at various levels should  regard the judicial, procuratorial, and court work as an  extremely important work of the party committees and governments  and put it in a prominent position. We should further support  the departments of political science and laws to strictly  enforce laws. We must neither replace the laws by words nor use  power to prevail over laws. The nation will be powerful when  its judicial, procuratorial, and court work has been  strengthened. The nation will become weak when its judicial,  procuratorial, and court work has been weakened. The commissions  for political science and laws should realistically assume  responsibility, make efforts to be advisers and assistants to  party committees, and make fruitful achievements to embody their  important positions and functions.</p>

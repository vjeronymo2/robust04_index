			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILD GEESE  </P> <P> I miss the visual beauty and wonderful sound of the ducks and wild geese that  used to come in such numbers to the Sepulveda Basin -- what has happened? Is it  too early yet, lack of water or lack of open space?  </P> <P> I know in the world of endless real problems facing us daily -- drugs, crime,  the hungry and homeless, poor education, pollution of air, water and food,  crowded freeways, AIDS, the number of illegals, takeovers by big business, loss  of ethics and morality and good old-fashioned honesty and foreign investors  (the degree of) in every area of American life -- that the seasonal birds being  missed by at least one person is a small, small concern. But things, especially  of nature, that feed the soul and contribute to peace and tranquility, even  momentarily, are indeed necessary.  </P> <P> CORA OMENS, Encino  </P></p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hopes of rate cut boosts equities A SESSION expected to be nothing more than a winding down period for the Bank Holiday weekend provided plenty of thrills and spills and saw the Footsie index stage another strong, but ultimately unsuccessful, dash at the market's all-time peak. A buoyant performance by equities rounded off a week that included Lloyds Bank's considered Pounds 3.7bn counter offer to the agreed merger between Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking, plus a series of big placings and a successful outcome to the UK's biggest ever auction of gilts. The trigger for the latest in a series of impressive showings by equities was a growing belief in the market that the Treasury had rubber-stamped a cut in UK domestic interest rates and that such a move would probably take place on Tuesday morning. A reduction of a quarter of a point was confidently predicted while many observers said a cut of a half point was quite feasible. Gilt-edged stocks bounded ahead, with the authorities sufficently encouraged to issue a further Pounds 1.1bn-worth of stock, comprising Pounds 900m of tap stocks and Pounds 200m in index-linked stock. Longer dated issues closed around a half point higher. The equity market began the session some 6 points up at 2,660.1, on the interest rate cut story and also in sympathy with the firm performance by Wall Street on Thursday evening. With no immediate indications that a rate cut was imminent, the equity market fell back to show a near four-point decline within an hour of the opening, before embarking on a determined upward move. This was accompanied by keen demand for the footsie future, which pushed confidently through the 2,700 mark. At its best level of the day, 2,672.7, the underlying index was some seven points off its all-time closing high, reached last September. Thereafter, footsie buying interest, and the general level of business began to tail off as marketmakers awaited what was expected to be a twitchy opening by Wall Street in the wake of the devastation caused by the riots on the west coast. London's caution was well founded with the Dow Jones Average down more than 25 points as the footsie ended the session 5.7 off at 2,659.8, although 16.8 higher over the week. Turnover reached 663.8m shares, heavily boosted by the placing of a block of 24m shares in Kalon, carried out jointly by Smith New Court and James Capel. Retail, or customer business, in London continued at high levels this week amid hopes that the economy is emerging from recession.</p>

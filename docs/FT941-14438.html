			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Competing for market shares / A look at two new business information providers When the London Stock Exchange decided it would no longer be a provider of information to the markets, it opened up new vistas for commercial providers to step into the breach. For years, the Exchange's Topic service was the sole provider of live Stock Exchange prices and the first to unveil corporate announcements from companies whose shares it listed. But Reuters Holdings, the business information service, challenged the Exchange's right to operate a monopoly on that information and the Exchange was forced for the first time to compete. Since then, the Exchange has decided that it cannot compete commercially and has formed partnerships with two information providers; Telekurs, a securities database operator owned jointly by a consortium of Swiss banks, and ICV, a privately owned company providing real-time data services to professional financial companies throughout Europe. Topic is intended to cease at the end of this year. Today, Telekurs formally launches its Topic Plus and Topicline Plus services, intended to succeed the Stock Exchange's service, and says it already has orders for more than 500 screens at 40 financial institutions. Earlier this week, ICV launched its Market-Eye service, intended to replace Topic, and says it has orders for more than 1,000 screens. Reuters is already operating its Equity Focus product. Officially, Telekurs and ICV state that there is no competition between them. Telekurs has developed a product that it says is aimed at large banks and securities houses while the ICV product is aimed at private client stockbrokers and small fund management firms. 'We are aiming at the more professional end of the market,' said Mr Tudor Morgan, Telekurs managing director. 'Competition with Reuters is the big thing.' Fund managers, stockbrokers and salesmen say that the three firms are competing fiercely with each other for market share in a sector which is expected to grow exponentially. 'There are 9,000 Topic users,' Mr Morgan said. 'We'd like to think that 50 per cent of them will be Telekurs customers by the end of this year.' There is much more at stake than just the Topic business. The provider with the greatest market share has the greatest opportunity to sell other services and effectively piggyback on the screens already in place. The differences between the services are not great, but users say that even the small differences will make a great difference in their final choice. The prices for the basic service are much of a muchness; Telekurs charges Pounds 2,800 a year for its basic service, with significant discounts for orders of 10 screens or more. ICV charges Pounds 2,500 per terminal, and users say Reuters' rates are in line with those. The differences are in the ease with which users can access the information and the quantity and method of display. Both Reuters and Telekurs use a 'Windows' format and users hold a mouse to flip between pages. By April, Telekurs will be able to offer its users feeds from other stock exchanges besides London, one of the key attractions now offered only by Reuters. It also offers other unusual features such as the ability to scan the front pages of leading UK newspapers. Also, up until late last year, Reuters had been resisting demands from potential clients that it modify its system to allow them to receive direct feeds of data from some leading stockbroking firms which offer closed-end systems themselves. This resistance was said to be driving some fund managers into the arms of the competition, particularly Telekurs. However, last November Reuters changed its tune, users say, and is now offering to pay those stockbroking firms for the costs of rewriting their programmes to be compatible with its own system. But market users say that the ICV system offers the greatest comfort because it most closely replicates the Topic system that many brokers, now in their 40s and 50s, have grown up with. 'Users are not interested in learning how to drive a new car,' said an official at one integrated securities firm which will need some 35 to 70 new screens. Like Topic, the ICV system relies on a keypad to help users find information, and users say it is quick and reliable. 'Reuters is not easy to use; it does not have the same look and feel of Topic,' he said.</p>

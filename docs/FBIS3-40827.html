			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Finance Minister Mohamed Sagou on Tuesday submitted  the 1994 finance bill to Parliament. It was contained in an  extended written speech, interspersed with some verbal  exchanges. Regardless of the fact that the bill is being  submitted to the Parliament more than one and one-half months  after the expiry of the legal limit and in view of the short  time available to the Parliament to debate it, we hasten to say  that the bill is characterized by its being essentially based on  an old and antiquated concept. It provides no clear or  harmonious answers to questions relating to the present reality,  although it consists of some procedural matters.    Reading the finance bill will, at the first instance, show  that it stems from the desire to resolve its inherent  contradiction with the reality and with its requirements, by  absorbing this contradiction within its own form, structure, and  procedures.    What is actually needed is to ease the heavy tax burden on  the economy, particularly income tax, and to realize some kind  of tax compatibility that would generate competition in the  economic field, particularly with the aim of redirecting private  investment and creating conditions suitable for financing the  economy and removing the obstacles that created bottlenecks in  the past two years. The aim is also to find satisfactory  solutions for the public debt arrears that accumulated during  the past years, while maintaining social stability based on  acceptable balances, and to fulfill promises that have  repeatedly been made but never fulfilled.    But the finance bill has done what can be described as  short-circuiting all that in one way or another. It does so by  adopting mathematical equations ranging between plus and minus  so that the official rhetoric on the bill may be able to find  something to say about and to justify things, without revealing  the fact that the bill is essentially a choice of programs for  the new government, which promised that the bill would be an  embodiment of its programs, following a featureless statement.    Evidently the bill wants first and foremost to reach a  figure, which is 1.5 percent. The aim is to confine the treasury  deficit within the constraints of this figure and to make it  compatible with the GDP. Nobody objects to showing interest in  the financial balances or minimizing their significance on both  the domestic and foreign relations level. This is contrary to  what the minister argued in vain. Focusing on a particular  figure could be suitable for an academic hypothesis, but  insisting on it as a precondition will not allow them to make a  choice that is a compromise between the balances and realities,  a choice which the various factions of the society are calling  for and which acts as a sound arbiter among them. This is  regardless of whether or not the figures relevant to it can be  realized and the extent to which they will be adhered to.    Perhaps it was setting this ceiling for the bill that gives  it a particular mathematical character and takes away from it  the qualities of a serious bill resulting from integrated  economic and social policies with broad vistas.    It is apparent from the various figures of the bill that it  is a settlement between figures, balancing figures with one  another on paper, and playing with figures within the  constraints of a very low ceiling.    Servicing the public debt is increasing, growing, and  becoming heavy. It exposes the failure to solve the problem last  year. In fact it has gotten worse 1983 and 1993. It has  increased several fold since the beginning of the structural  evaluation and the rescheduling of debts. The calculations first  and foremost address servicing the foreign debt. The debt  increased from 15.475280905 dirhams to 17.513564480 dirhams [as  published] (that is about $1.86 billion). That is an increase of  13.17 percent. Keeping in mind that rescheduling private and  public debt is no longer possible to do in the old-fashioned  way. The Paris and London clubs have decided to end the debt  rescheduling soap opera.    Given the pressure of the 1.5 percent ceiling set for the  total treasury deficit, the calculations based on servicing the  debt leave no room for financial options that would help  economic revival and the relaunching of the social policies  after a long period of stagnation.    The finance bill options in this case have been put between  pincers' jaws, leaving no room for the balance sheet other than  maintaining control, with the balance sheet itself becoming an  option. The problem lies here. And because the World Bank has  its directives, these have been endorsed by what seemed to be a  parallel parliament that was recently convened in Casablanca. It  was necessary for these directives to be integrated with the  accounts, as has customarily been done since the eighties.    And because these directives primarily revolve around the  private sector, they have been partially absorbed in them,  within the limits allowed between the pincers' jaws. Within this  framework, the corporation tax has been reduced to 37 percent,  although the World Bank recommends that it should not exceed 35  percent on average. This is followed by reducing the highest  average of public tax on income to 47 percent, followed by  reducing the value added tax levied on bank interest, by  subjecting the government treasury bonds to a partial tax, and  by reducing the import tax on building material 10 percent while  raising it 15 percent with respect to most other imports.    These tax measures constitute the proposed basic laws of the  finance bill as a whole, while anything else remains marginal.    If these measures are viewed in light of the aforementioned  World Bank directives, coupled with the measures relevant to  them, such as increasing the portion exempt from public tax from  15,000 dirhams to 18,000 dirhams. Here we immediately discover  that these measures carry inherent contradictions, to which we  referred at the beginning, as long as they constitute a partial  step toward responding to the World Bank directives rather than  fully responding to them. They partially respond to demands put  forward by the private, sector but do not respond to them  fully...et cetera [as published], because the pincers' jaws in  question continue to exert pressure.    There has been demand that steps should be taken to restore  to the state its rational economic role on the ground that this  is one of the basic and urgent conditions for reviving the  economy after two years of general economic recession and  reduced growth. Therefore, the government has increased the  investment budget to 3.99 billion dirhams (the equivalent of  $423.6 million) compared with 1993 (15.1 billion dirhams  compared with approximately 19 billion dirhams) [as published].  This is to show that there is an increase. Regardless of how  closely the investment budgets are adhered to and how they are  disposed of, that increase remains an increase on paper. In the  end it is a mathematical result, and the fact that it is limited  in scope shows that the will to revive the economy is  nonexistent. We need not recall that public investment has an  impact on the national economy and on national investment which  has been weak since record-keeping was started. This also  affects the contracting sector, such as public works and  construction.    As for the social policy promised by the government in a  loosely worded statement, the balance sheets that governed  drafting the finance law have failed to bring it into effect.  Rather, the pincers have pressed hard. Despite the fact that the  number of jobs expected to be created has been set at 25,000  jobs, and regardless of whether they will really be created or  remain in storage, they realize no real progress in the field of  absorbing a large number of unemployed, particularly those with  higher education diplomas, that has reached more than 150,000.  The funds allocated to revive employment are vaguely defined so  far in terms of goals, means of financing, ways of expenditure,  and trusteeship...et cetera. [as published] It must be pointed  out in this regard that the proposed granting of loans to  persons engaged in economic revival has failed. The contractual  retraining program has made no progress. Both projects did not  really absorb unemployed people nor did they open new vistas in  the employment field. Allocating a special fund for job creation  under the supervision of the ministry of finance does not mean  that it will succeed or achieve objectives that were not  achieved previously, notwithstanding the allocation of one  billion dirhams to the fund.    Increasing the tax-free portion of income to 18,000 dirhams  does not result in a real increase in the income of people with  limited or middle income. Rather this is yet another joke that  is the subject of mockery and bitterness.    The government continues to adhere to its unintelligent  method of responding to the demands submitted by the unions  representing the working factions in the field of wages and  salaries. The value of these salaries and wages has been frozen;  they lost much of their real value, resulting in a major drop in  the purchasing power of the majority population in the face of  the increasing inflation. This has also resulted in a drop in  consumption and in the shrinkage of the domestic market, with  all its economic effects. The drop in consumption is a major  cause of economic stagnation in the past years as well as for  the crisis in the contracting market.    On the social level, the budget of the national ministry of  education, which increased only by 5.06 percent, and of the  ministry of health, which increased only by 9.76 percent, and  the expected limited investments in the two budgets show that  the government makes no provisions for real social investments,  considering the acute shortage in education and medical  facilities and staffs. It also gives no consideration to the  workers' conditions.    Clearly these limited increases are a far cry from the  bombastic speeches about the will to carry out reforms in the  social field. Meanwhile certain problems are left to rot,  including those of education in the countryside and health care  in towns and villages and other such issues.    The same thing can be said about the housing situation that  calls for a determined policy and mobilization of all available  resources, particularly resources of the social reserve funds.  It is known that at no time was the management of these funds  socially oriented. Instead, deductions from wages and salaries  have been blatantly used to increase the wealth of a few people.    The government, given the data available to it, should be  more certain than anybody else that the social policy cannot be  left to market forces; for in no country, however liberal it may  be, are socioeconomic factors laissez-faire, because leaving  them unchecked means subjecting them to savagery. Social  problems are far too difficult to be left to the market for  resolution. Above all, the government is called upon to channel  revenues from income taxes and from national resources  exploitation into the social arena in order to improve social  conditions and the standard of living, not just because this  falls within the jurisdiction of government, but also because it  is what makes a government legitimate, given that governmental  legitimacy is based on seeking acceptable social balances, as  the experience of peoples and countries has confirmed.</p>

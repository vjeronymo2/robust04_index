			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Property still a problem for restructured Miskin A SHARP cut in interest payable and lower exceptional charges helped Miskin Group, the USM-quoted construction company, report much-reduced annual losses for the 12 months to July 31. Losses before tax were Pounds 2.19m, against Pounds 7.36m in the previous 18 month period, struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 532,000 (Pounds 4.62m) relating to property write-downs. Interest payable was Pounds 709,000 (Pounds 1.81m). Turnover, reflecting the sale of Laing Demolition and Nirimba Roofing &amp; Insulation, dropped from Pounds 19.6m to Pounds 10.6m. The two businesses incurred losses of Pounds 961,562 and Pounds 59,083 respectively over the year. Mr Jeffrey Goodman, chairman, said the main core business had returned a modest profit of Pounds 4,812 pre-tax against losses of Pounds 1.04m last time, while the tool hire side, now reorganised, turned a deficit of Pounds 44,623 into pre-tax profits of Pounds 9,299. The group's property assets, however, were proving difficult to sell, he said. 'The reduction of the stock of properties is currently a priority, as without this involvement and costs thereof, the trading subsidiaries would appear able to bring the group back into profit.' There is again no dividend; the last payment was in 1990.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / KLM plunges as Northwest falls and warns of heavy final losses KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday announced a large increase in third-quarter net losses and warned of likely substantial losses for the full year. The announcement contributed to continued nervousness and uncertainty on the Dutch stock exchange in a business week that has seen the financial collapse of DAF, the truck maker now in receivership, and a further worsening in the liquidity of Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer. In addition to its third-quarter losses KLM separately announced a decision to defer acceptance of two aircraft and cancellation of its options on two Boeing 737s, worth a total Fl 750m. At the same time, it revealed plans to lay off a further 500 employees. The increase in KLM's third-quarter losses to Fl 437.8m (Pounds 162m) from Fl 8.6m, which greatly exceeded analysts' expectations, was largely caused by operating losses suffered by its US partner, Northwest, amid the American fare price war. But it also reflects fierce competition, weakening margins, and sluggish economic activity worldwide. KLM has taken a substantial third-quarter extraordinary charge of Fl 305m, thus writing down the remaining book value of its 20 per cent stake in Wings Holdings, Northwest Airline's parent company, after a total investment of Dollars 400m since 1989. KLM's share of Northwest's third-quarter losses were Fl 49.9m, down from Fl 87m. Following the writedown, KLM said that further Northwest losses will no longer affect its results. The two airlines will continue with their co-operation pact, announced last December after KLM contributed Dollars 50m of a Dollars 250m bridging loan to the financially troubled Northwest. In Europe, negotiations were continuing between KLM, SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines, aimed at forming a closer relationship. For the nine months ending December 1992 KLM posted a net loss of Fl 229.3m, against a profit of Fl 319.8m last time. Interest costs swelled to Fl 265.4m from Fl 174.5m. KLM's traffic increased 30 per cent, but revenues in the third quarter remained stagnant. Northwest deficit, Page 19</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Producer index fall blunts inflation fears Low prices for new cars helped US producer prices to fall last month by 0.5 per cent, blunting fears of rising inflation. The Labour Department said the drop in the producer price index in the month of October, following another 0.5 per cent fall in September, left the change in prices over the past 12 months at just 1.0 per cent. Part of the decline in October was attributed to the fact that prices for new model year cars rose less than anticipated by the Labour Department's seasonal adjustments. But even without the drop in car prices, the index still fell by 0.1 per cent in October. The department's index of core wholesale inflation, excluding the often volatile food and energy prices, also fell by 0.5 per cent, leaving a year-on-year increase of 1.8 per cent. Some economists pointed out that prices for intermediate goods rose by 0.3 per cent in October and by 3.0 per cent over the last 12 months, while crude goods, excluding energy and food, rose in price by 0.9 per cent last month and by 13.1 per cent over the year. Nevertheless, a majority of economists viewed the producer price data as good news for US inflation. Statistics published earlier this week showed that unit labour costs in the US have risen by only 0.9 per cent over the past year and that manufacturing unit labour costs have fallen by 3.8 per cent during the same period, and this lack of wage increases was expected to limit the upward pressure on prices caused by rising US commodity prices. While financial markets remain firmly convinced that the Federal Reserve must raise interest rates at the meeting of its Federal Open Markets Committee next week, the evidence that wholesale inflation remains subdued may take the edge off mounting expectations in the markets that the Fed might add as much as a full percentage point to interest rates. The Fed has preferred to adjust its monetary policy in smaller increments, because of the difficulty of readjusting policy if its forecasts should prove to be wrong. But bond market dealers have become increasingly fretful that the Fed is 'behind the curve' in its actions to control any future inflationary threat, and even a half percentage point increase - the most probable outcome of next Tuesday's FOMC meeting - could prove disappointing to the markets.</p>

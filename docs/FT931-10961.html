			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / VAT 'risk to 20% of local papers' A FIFTH of Britain's regional newspaper titles might be forced to close with a total loss of nearly 2,500 jobs if the government imposed value added tax on their cover prices, a report commissioned by the Newspaper Society said yesterday. The impact of a 17.5 per cent tax on newspapers was described as 'catastrophic' by consultants Price Waterhouse in the report for the society, which represents most regional and local newspapers. The study forecasts that the imposition of VAT in one of this year's Budgets would reduce the circulation of paid-for regional and local newspapers by more than 1m from the current 13.24m. Many newspaper groups would be pushed into loss after two years of the tax, the study says. A survey of newspaper publishers has found that they would close 20 per cent of their titles if VAT was introduced. That would mean the closure of 245 regional and local newspapers out of a total of 1,265.</p>

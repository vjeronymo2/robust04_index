			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Arbitration fails to resolve McCain dispute An arbitrator has failed to resolve the three-year succession dispute between Harrison and Wallace McCain, the brothers who control McCain Foods, the multinational frozen-foods group based in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. Though the mediator declared invalid a resolution passed by the McCain board which sought to remove Mr Wallace McCain as joint chief executive, he made no finding on the brothers' disagreement over who should succeed them. Mr Wallace McCain favours his son Michael, while Mr Harrison McCain prefers Mr Allison McCain, who holds a senior position in the group's UK subsidiary.</p>

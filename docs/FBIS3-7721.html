			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Knin, 25 Feb (TANJUG) -- Due to the full blockade of  western Slavonia, which is still in progress, protest meetings  were held in the republic of Serb Krajina today where citizens  and young people expressed displeasure and indignation over  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] behavior.    Several thousand citizens of Knin spontaneously rallied in  the square in front of the railway station in the Krajina  capital this morning. The rally was addressed by members of the  Citizens' Protest committee and representatives of other  citizens' and youth organizations.    "Our freedom is being threatened, world powers wish to  transform us into a camp," this is only one of the messages that  were voiced at this rally.    The attitude of the citizens of Krajina is best reflected in  placards carried by young citizens of Knin: "We cannot give up  western Slavonia," "Protection yes, occupation no," "UNPROFOR,  go to the Croatian border."    Similar messages were voiced at other rallies in Krajina, in  Vojnic, Benkovac, and other towns where strong support was  voiced for Milan Martic, the president of the republic of Serb  Krajina, to defend Krajina's sovereignty in talks with UN  special envoy Yasushi Akashi today.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Inveresk expects Pounds 75m float value INVERESK, the Scotland-based speciality paper maker whose shares are to be quoted on the Stock Exchange early next month, says it expects to grow by developing new markets, increasing output from existing plants and acquiring other speciality paper companies. The company is coming to the market through a placing and intermediaries offer. It owns three mills in eastern Scotland and one in Somerset, and was the subject of a Pounds 31m management buy-out in 1990 from Georgia-Pacific of the US. The pathfinder prospectus, released yesterday by Inveresk's merchant bank Schroders, does not give full details of the offer. But it is expected to raise about Pounds 30m and value the company at more than Pounds 75m. It is expected that after the flotation about 40 per cent of the company will end up in the hands of the institutions which backed the MBO - Morgan Grenfell, County NatWest Ventures and 3i. Between 35 and 40 per cent is likely to be held by the management team under Mr Stefan Kay, the managing director, with new shareholders holding the rest. In the year to November 28 1992 Inveresk made an operating profit of Pounds 8.57m (Pounds 8.7m) on continuing activities. Turnover fell from Pounds 91.4m to Pounds 87.8m. Earnings per share were 11.5p on the existing 44.6m shares. The company regards its performance as creditable in the face of recession in the UK and its markets in continental Europe. It says that results for the first four months of the current financial year were ahead of those for the same period last year. There is no profits forecast. The full prospectus will be published on May 20. Trading begins on June 2. James Capel is broker to the issue.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / France holds six more Islamists Six more suspected Islamist militants were detained by French police yesterday as part of the nationwide anti-terrorism clampdown. They were arrested in the morning in Paris, Lille, Lyons and Marseilles, following a series of swoops and spot-checks on vehicles and individuals by French police since last week's terrorist attack by militant Moslem fundamentalists on a French embassy housing compound in Algiers. More than 110 people have been held for questioning in France in the current clampdown. The Algerian authorities yesterday claimed to have identified the ringleader of last week's attack as Mr Djamel Zitouni. They claimed that the 26-year-old Mr Zitouni, said to be a member of the banned Islamic Salvation Front, was also responsible for the recent murders of two French people and two nationals from the former Yugoslavia. They did not say whether he had yet been arrested.</p>

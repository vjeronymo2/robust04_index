			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UNION CHIEF WILL BOYCOTT OCTD EXCELLENCE BRUNCH  </P> <P> The leader of the union representing the Orange County Transit District's 700  bus drivers says she will personally boycott OCTD's motivational Drive for  Excellence program, featuring Rams Head Coach John Robinson, claiming that it  is a waste of taxpayers' money.  </P> <P> Julie Smith, general chair of Tustin-based United Transportation Union Local  19, said that the one-day brunch program scheduled for March 5 at the Red Lion  Inn in Costa Mesa is "an absurd expenditure" of taxpayers' money. "I have no  intention of attending and most of the drivers I've talked to won't attend  either," she said.  </P> <P> An OCTD official strongly defended the "Drive for Excellence" program, saying  that union members participated in developing it.  </P> <P> Smith said the expenditure for the program, which OCTD officials said is  intended to help improve communication and boost morale, is an "insult" to  drivers because the money would be better spent on cost-of-living adjustments  in bus drivers' paychecks.  </P> <P> "This is typical of OCTD," Smith said. "They would rather spend money on fluff  like this than take care of drivers' real needs."  </P> <P> Drivers currently have no cost-of-living adjustment provisions in their  contract with OCTD. Talks for a new contract are at least a year away.  </P> <P> Claudia Keith, an OCTD public information officer, said the one-day program is  expected to cost $20,000, including Robinson's $4,000 speaking fee. She said  the program will involve follow-up activities to be planned and budgeted later.  </P> <P> "It's really an effort to show coach operators that we want them to be our  front-line sales force with the public, and we're willing to help them with  whatever they need to be good at it."  </P> <P> Keith said that only about 150 drivers had made reservations for the brunch,  with another 50 to 100 expected to attend.  </P></p>

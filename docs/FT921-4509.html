			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / 'Big bang' BR sale dropped: Denationalisation of the railways could stretch into the next decade MINISTERS have formally agreed to abandon plans to privatise British Rail in one 'big bang' within the lifetime of the next parliament. Instead, the Conservative party election manifesto will pave the way for a creeping denationalisation of the railways which could stretch beyond the end of the decade. The turnabout appears to have resulted from a recognition of the overwhelming practical difficulties facing any of the suggested options for breaking up BR and selling it outright. It is likely to be seen as a victory for Sir Bob Reid, whose short career as BR's chairman had seemed destined to culminate in the break-up and abolition of the corporation within the next five years. It will also feed the belief among some observers that privatisation plans have been undermined by a reluctance among Department of Transport officials to see their power base eroded. Under the new plan, privatisation - or denationalisation, as transport ministers are now calling it - will be a gradual process. The first step will be to remove BR's statutory monopoly and open the tracks to anyone who wants to operate trains. This will mean setting up a regulatory authority to ensure all operators have equal access to tracks and stations. The next step will be to sell Railfreight, BR's freight division, to the private sector. This can be done quickly because the division has good profits potential and its trains do not carry voters. Finally, the government will seek a slow and cautious transfer of BR's passenger services - but not its tracks - to the private sector. Services, or groups of services, which deliver returns high enough to satisfy the private sector could be sold outright. Loss-making but socially necessary services could be franchised out to operators requiring the lowest subsidies. Eventually, when all Britain's train services are being operated by the private sector, BR could be left as a residuary body, owning just the tracks. But the scale of investment needed to bring some services to profitability means this stage is unlikely to be reached until well into the next decade. A high priority for ministers has been the need to allay voters' fears that a 'big bang' privatisation could mean higher fares and service cuts. The plans appear to differ markedly from those Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, advocated last year, but Mr Rifkind has thrown his weight behind them, letting it be known that he is 'delighted'.

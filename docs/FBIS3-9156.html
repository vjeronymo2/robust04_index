			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [MEDIAFAX interview with Lieutenant General Marin Pancea, </F> secretary of the country's Supreme Defense Council, counselor of  President Ion Iliescu; place and date not given: "General Marin  Pancea Believes That the Attacks of the Press Are Actually  Directed Against the Presidential Institution"]    [Text] [MEDIAFAX] Mr. General, in your opinion, what is  the source of the information alleging that you are an agent of  the French secret service?    [Pancea] The source on which the article published by  [daily] EVENIMENTUL ZILEI relies intends, in my opinion, to  mislead, rather than correctly inform public opinion. Probably  we have to deal with certain circles that are interested in  circulating information that can deceive and especially mislead  public opinion in Romania. As a matter of fact EVENIMENTUL  ZILEI is known as a daily that, rather unfortunately, instead of  following a line that could lend it a note of seriousness in the  way it discusses the approached issues, has for a very long time  proved to be rather a scandal paper, a sensation paper, and it  still seems to be following that line, in its usual style.    [MEDIAFAX] Still, who do you think offered them that piece  of information?    [Pancea] I do not merely think, but I am also certain that  all this information has been forged by someone who uses it to  cause a sensation. It may not be the daily itself, but rather  certain circles that are interested in such a thing; I do not  wish to name anyone, because I do not have absolute evidence  about the existence of such enemies. That is life, I think that  one may have friends as well as foes, but sometimes it is very  difficult for one, in the middle of this flood of information,  to spot the persons who might be envious of one.    [MEDIAFAX] Have you or have you not been transferred to  reserve duty by President Iliescu?    [Pancea] I have no knowledge of that. I did not discuss  that issue with the president, either before he left or after he  returned home [from his tour of Lithuania, South Korea, and  China]. Of course, the president knows about my intention to  retire, considering my advanced age compared to the [retirement  age] currently existing in the armed forces. I am almost 66, so  you realize that, in the army, I am considered one of the oldest  officers, even among the generals. As it is known, according to  both the currently valid status of military cadres and to the  one that is being discussed in parliament, the maximum age is 62  years. This means that I already exceeded that limit by four  years.    [MEDIAFAX] Have you spoken to the president about your  problem? What is his opinion?    [Pancea] I have not spoken with the president because -- and  you will have to agree -- his agenda is full of other issues,  far more important ones than my problem, and if he were to deal  personally with everything that is published by the press, he  would not have enough time to deal with the issues he, as the  country's president, is expected to solve.    [MEDIAFAX] The item that accused you of espionage also  claimed that you have been recruited by Tudor Anescu. What are  your relations with that person and, of course, with the other  two: Lucian Cornescu and Radu Petrica Popa?    [Pancea] If we also take into consideration the things  published by other papers (EXPRES MAGAZIN and TINERAMA),  initially I was a KGB agent who was recruited, as TINERAMA  claimed last year, by some KGB agents in the old days, while I  was a military attache in Paris. What do I see now? Probably  because they did not achieve their goal by claiming that I was a  KGB agent, they changed course and called me an agent of the  French secret service recruited by Mr. Anescu. As far as I  could understand from the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI item, they claim  that I recruited Anescu, and later on, he, as a double agent,  managed to exploit me for intelligence purposes; I am mentioning  all this in order to be correct and to refer exactly to the  things published by EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. They are all aberrations  and imaginary assertions made by a person who is not in his  right mind, lest I should call him insane. In connection with  Lucian Cornescu, I can tell you that during my service in Paris  I had contacts, but not with him, but rather with many other  French companies, with the purpose of purchasing military  technology and equipment needed by the Romanian army. Of course  not all those deals were eventually concluded with French  companies. I can give you one example of a deal that was  concluded and I can also tell you that nothing came out of the  ones [mediated by] of Cornescu, because he did not offer terms  and items that were of any interest to the Romanian army.  Contrary to him, other companies were successful, such as the  Alouette-3-type helicopter, for which, initially, we imported  spare parts, after which we imported the whole manufacturing  technology.    [MEDIAFAX] Do you mean that their connecting Lucian  Cornescu's name with this issue was purely accidental?    [Pancea] That is right, he has no connection with this.  That was merely business. The allegations in the  aforementioned item are mere hallucinations. Radu Petrica Popa  is the person who swindled my son of $30,000, in the sense that  he promised to obtain an apartment for him and requested an  advance payment; besides my son, other persons were swindled in  the same way and their cases were reported by the press. Radu  Petrica Popa is a notorious, or a professional, crook; I have  never seen him and I talked to him just once, over the phone.  What actually happened was that he began to blackmail my son,  threatening that if he would not withdraw the complaint he filed  with the police requesting his money back, "your father will be  kicked out of Cotroceni" [presidential headquarters].    [MEDIAFAX] Is he really such an influential person?    [Pancea] I do not think so. However, I think that he was  manipulated by other influential persons who were interested not  so much in discrediting me personally or my son, but rather in  discrediting me, the Pancea who works for the presidency, that  is, their attacks were actually directed against the  presidential institution and the president, personally.    [MEDIAFAX] Do you think that you are standing in someone's  way?    [Pancea] Personally, I cannot think of any elements from  which I could draw the conclusion that I am standing in  someone's way, I mean, in the way of some other physical person.  I believe that here we have to deal with the interests of  certain circles or forces that are very interested in weakening  certain structures of the Romanian state, including the council  or the secretary of the Supreme Defense Council, which, after  all, is one of the principal bodies of the defense structures of  this country, considering the issues it is expected to discuss  during its sessions and the decisions it is expected to take  regarding national security. I do not think that I, as a  person, could be standing in someone's way; the institution I  represent could, perhaps.    [MEDIAFAX] Do you think that they are the same circles I  referred to in my first questions?    [Pancea] I believe they are the same circles, because the  events were connected among themselves in such a way so as to  turn an incident between two individuals into an attack against  an institution, namely the presidential one. Their attempt to  try to deal a blow, not against the place where the events  actually took place, but rather way up, against the presidential  institution is quite obvious.    [MEDIAFAX] Is it true that during one of the sessions of the  Supreme Defense Council it was suggested to the president that  he should renounce his visit in France precisely because of the  problem with you?    [Pancea] That is a totally wild aberration, which has  absolutely no connection with reality. Besides, during the  sessions of the Supreme Defense Council, we do not discuss the  visits of the president. That is the task of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, our embassies, and the presidency, and not at  all that of the Supreme Defense Council, which has no authority  in such issues.    [MEDIAFAX] You are a French agent, Mr. Adrian Nastase  [speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and executive chairman of  the ruling party] is a CIA agent (according to Corneliu Vadim  Tudor); how do you account for their "silence" about the  possible KGB agents?    [Pancea] Actually we should not talk about the "silence,"  but rather try to assess this "rain of agents" in the press and  handle it according to what it deserves. I, as an expert in  this field, can tell you that it does not deserve any attention.  The fact that such things are published by the press, in my  opinion, is a consequence of our not having an appropriate bill  on the press, on the basis of which one could seriously call to  account all the persons who circulate such concocted things  lacking all real grounds. Being an agent is a very grave thing,  it is high treason against one's homeland, and agents do not  deserve to remain among society, they ought to be shot or  isolated in prisons.    [MEDIAFAX] Many personalities have been accused of spying  for Western powers [reference to Greater Romania Party leader  Corneliu Vadim Tudor's open letter claiming that top government,  presidential officials are working for Western intelligence  agencies]. How do you account for the fact that, over the past  four years, very few people have been accused of working for the  KGB? Do people's minds and imagination not work in that  direction as well, in that of [the officials'] cooperation with  the KGB?    [Pancea] As an expert in this field, I can tell you that all  intelligence services, regardless of the state they belong to,  have to establish the goals of their intelligence activity in  such a way so as to best serve the interests of their state, be  they military interests -- which currently are not quite  plausible, especially after the dissolution of the Warsaw Treaty  -- or be they scientific or economic interests, on the one hand,  or in the field of arms and drugs trafficking and terrorist  activity, because currently these are the fields of major  interest at the international level, and therefore the majority  of the intelligence services of various developed states, which  do have such specialized structures, are principally targeted in  these directions. This does not mean that they neglect military  aspects. If we take just the military part of the intelligence  work, beginning with Napoleon's time, all military attaches had  the task to gather military information with the purpose of  preventing the adversary from taking one by surprise in case of  a possible crisis.</p>

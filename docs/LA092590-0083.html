			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S.F. OFFICIALS WANT QUAKE-RAVAGED FREEWAY TORN DOWN  </P> <P> After months of often bitter debate, a deeply divided Board of Supervisors  voted Monday that the earthquake-ravaged Embarcadero Freeway should be torn  down and replaced.  </P> <P> "I congratulate the board," an exultant Mayor Art Agnos told a hastily called  news conference.  </P> <P> He said he hopes there is enough state and federal money available to replace  the controversial elevated roadway with a surface or sub-surface artery from  the Bay Bridge to Chinatown and North Beach.  </P> <P> The Oct. 17, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake shook up and damaged the freeway's  underpinnings so badly that the 1 1/2-mile roadway, Interstate 480, was quickly  closed to all traffic -- including traffic under the devastated slab.  </P></p>

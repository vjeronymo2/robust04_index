			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Nil pay-out for D&amp;N shareholders SHAREHOLDERS in Davies &amp; Newman will get nothing from yesterday's sale of the company's Dan-Air subsidiary to BA. Nor will they get to vote on the deal, even though they stumped up Pounds 49.3m in a rights issue a year ago to try to keep the group afloat. Davies &amp; Newman secured Stock Exchange approval to avoid the need for shareholder approval 'on the basis of time constraints and the fact that the proposed transaction represents the sole alternative to receivership'. Shareholders could band together to call an extraordinary general meeting. Fund managers contacted yesterday said they had not yet decided whether to do this. Provided the deal goes ahead, the board of Davies &amp; Newman will propose that the company be wound up. Creditors will fare far better than shareholders: all will have their bills paid. That includes Pounds 43m for trade creditors such as caterers and fuel companies, Pounds 12m-Pounds 13m of bank loans and Pounds 17m-Pounds 18m for loans secured on Davies &amp; Newman's assets. As well as paying off these liabilities, British Airways will take on the costs of rationalisation. These include redundancy payments for all but the 400-600 of Dan-Air's 1,990 permanent employees. It also employs 400 temporary staff. BA will offer jobs at reduced salaries to the staff it keeps. It will also pay any penalties associated with the early return of four leased British Aerospace 146 aircraft and write-off the value of seven obsolete Boeing 727 aircraft. 'The (inefficient) 727s were the cause of very significant erosion of margins,' said Mr David James, the company doctor in charge of Dan-Air, yesterday. 'Their disposal is a hit on the balance sheet which Dan-Air could not have afforded.' BA estimates that it will have to make a provision of about Pounds 35m in the second half of its 1992 accounts to cover the costs of the acquisition. This figure would have been higher if the deal had been struck at almost any other time of the year because in October airlines are flush with cash from the busy summer season. In return for the Pounds 35m, BA acquires 12 relatively new Boeing 737s and the business of the largest airline operator at Gatwick airport. It will close the charter services, switching stranded passengers to other flights. Of Dan-Air's scheduled services to 28 destinations in western Europe only 12 will be retained by BA. Tickets will be honoured by other airlines. BA will be able to trim costs by servicing some of the remaining aircraft with BA engineering staff. BA says the rump of Dan-Air will continue to lose money through the winter season. Late next financial year the dealwill show significant benefits to BA, said Sir Colin Marshall, its chief executive.</p>

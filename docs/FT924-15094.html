			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: RHM in the toaster Hanson's buccaneering spirit is evidently not entirely dead. Whatever its stated intentions for RHM, it is difficult to square yesterday's Pounds 780m bid with the reformed Hanson that is supposedly concentrating on organic growth in its established businesses. RHM looks rather more like a victim of Hanson's old opportunistic style: an undervalued company with a sense of drift. Sales last year were lower than in 1987, earnings did not quite match those of 1988. Moreover, Hanson has chosen to swoop when there is at last a faint prospect of higher bread prices. In RHM's record, there is hardly a crumb of comfort. Its management has manifestly failed to reward the loyalty of shareholders at the time of the 465p Goodman Fielder Wattie bid in 1988. There has undoubtedly been rationalisation, but acquisition accounting would create scope for Hanson to take out more costs. By going for margin rather than market share it could turn RHM's milling and baking division into a cash generative business similar to tobacco. Admittedly, the supermarkets have a large say in the bread price, but the benefits of reduced capacity in the baking industry were not lost on ABF yesterday. It was the only FT-SE stock to rise. That still leaves the question of whether Hanson is offering a fair price. On consensus expectations for this year it amounts to a prospective multiple of less than 12. Hanson could conceivably recoup the bulk of its outlay through disposals of the non-bakery business. So shareholders might be tempted to hold out for a little more. But it is not clear where a rival bidder would come from. Nor is victory for Hanson a matter of strategic necessity. RHM is a good deal smaller than some of the other victims it has digested. Though the acquisition would reduce the burden of unrelieved ACT, it would add less than 10 per cent to pre-tax profits.</p>

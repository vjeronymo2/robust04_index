			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: SA synthetic fuel producer ahead 9% in tough market SASOL, the South African synthetic fuel and chemicals producer, overcame difficult trading conditions to lift attributable profits by 9 per cent to R584m (Dollars 194m) in the six months to December 25. Turnover rose to R4.08bn from R3.96bn, but tighter margins saw operating income fall by 5.4 per cent to R822.3m from R868.8m. Lower interest payments of R64.1m, against R119.4m, and a lower tax charge of R158.7m, compared with R208.7m, helped increase attributable earnings. The company said the operating environment had been 'extremely depressed', with the prices of chemical products declining and lower refining margins. Mr Russell Kennedy, general manager, said that, in a trading environment where prices were flat or falling, the only option before the group was to control costs and stabilise production at the highest possible level. Sasol had, therefore, embarked on an extensive cost-cutting campaign. Its benefits would be apparent for a number of years. Mr Kennedy said conditions in export markets had been worse than in South Africa. Although export volumes had been maintained, prices had in some cases been lower. Earnings per share rose by 4.7 per cent to 99 cents, and the dividend was lifted by 4.1 per cent to 38 cents. The company anticipates profit growth for the full year, in line with levels achieved for the first half.</p>

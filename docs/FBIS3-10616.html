Foreign Ministry sources said Abdenur used the occasion of a  meeting with Mark Lora, the U.S. charge d'affaires in Brasilia,  to express the Brazilian Government's "displeasure" over the  U.S. criticism.    The acting Brazilian foreign minister pointed out that the  language used by the U.S. delegation in Geneva to discuss the  situation of abandoned minors in Brazil was "senseless,  improper, inopportune, and unfair."    Vivian Derryck, the U.S. representative to the UN Human  Rights Commission, accused the Brazilian Government on 8 March  in Geneva of committing "savagery" concerning the abandoned  minors.    According to local humanitarian organizations, an average of  four abandoned minors are killed in Brazil every day.    Abdenur and Lora also discussed the meeting's original  purpose, namely drawing up the agenda for a visit U.S. Vice  President Albert Gore will pay to Brasilia on 21 March, the last  leg of a tour that also will take him to Buenos Aires and La Paz.    In the Brazilian capital, Gore will meet the president of  the  Republic, Itamar Franco, with whom he will discuss bilateral  relations and a projected hemispheric summit the United States  plans to stage in its territory at an as-yet-undetermined date  this year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rabat, Apr. 27 (MAP) -- An Algerian authorized  source said that the Algerian ambassador to Spain was speaking  on behalf of his country and voicing Algeria's standpoint when  he addressed a conference held recently in Madrid on the peace  plan in the Sahara.    The statement came following the response of Morocco to the  Algerian diplomat's "vigorous and deluding" statements before  the conference and after a Moroccan official source wondered  whether the Algerian diplomat was expressing his own standpoint  vis-a-vis the situation in the Sahara or that of his country  which repeatedly claimed it was observing restraint regarding  the Sahara issue.    The ambassador had said that the present deadlock in the  Sahara issue was due to "the hesitations of one of the two  sides...while the Polisario [Popular Front for the Liberation of  Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] has always showed a high spirit  of maturity".    The Algerian source, quoted by the official news agency  "APS"  said the Algerian ambassador is plenipotentiary and was  attending the conference as Algeria's official representative.</p>

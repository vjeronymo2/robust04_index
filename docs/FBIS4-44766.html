			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Jolivet: "... and Joins Globalstar"] </F>   [Text] Alcatel is positioning itself for the  telecommunications of the third millennium. The French group  will be among the number of investors in the future satellite  communications system Globalstar.    Seated together with the American firms Pactel and Qualcomm,  Italy's Alenia, Germany's Deutsche Aerospace, Great Britain's  Vodaphone, and Korea's Dacom and Hyundai, at the  1.6-billion-franc [Fr] round table being hosted by the American  firm Loral (35 percent), Alcatel is contributing Fr200 million  for an 11-percent share.    The project, whose total cost will exceed Fr10 billion,  calls  for using 48 satellites in low orbit. Globalstar will offer  voice and data transmission, telescopic, and location and  tracking services, all to be accessible by fixed and mobile  terminals from any point on the planet. It is expected to be  operational in 1998 and to have 10 million subscribers within 10  years from then.    Alcatel, the world's number one in telecommunications, could  not afford to remain on the sidelines in the face of the  large-scale alliances that are being forged. Satellite networks  are one of the stakes in the mobile telephony battle of the  coming years. Motorola has rallied some 20-odd groups worldwide  around its Iridium project. Microsoft and McCaw Cellular have  recently announced their Teledesic project.    By joining Globalstar, the French group is strengthening the  American positions it has already gained by way of joint  ventures. Since 1991, Alcatel has been working together with  Loral within its subsidiary Space Systems/Loral, in which  Alcatel acquired a 49 percent stake together with Italy's  Alenia. Alcatel also operates a company, Euteltrac, which it  owns jointly with Qualcomm, in the satellite locating and  tracking sector.    Industrially, Alcatel will be responsible for designing and  producing the payloads to be carried aboard Globalstar  satellites. These amount to 45 percent of the cost of the  satellites, and their production will be spread over a period of  four years.    This will ensure an ongoing workload at Alcatel's Toulouse  plants at a time when orders from European manufacturers are at  a low ebb.  <H5>  Major Projects Worldwide </H5>   Globalstar: 48 satellites to be launched into  orbit beginning in 1998. Loral and eight groups will invest Fr10  billion.    Iridium: 66 satellites to be in service beginning  in 1998. Motorola and 20 groups will invest Fr20 billion.    Teledesic: 840 satellites to be in service  beginning in 2001. A joint Microsoft-McCaw Cellular project at  an estimated cost of approximately Fr52 billion.    Odyssey: Under preparation by TRW.    P21: Under preparation by Intelsat.</p>

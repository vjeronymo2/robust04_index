			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO RAIL COST ESTIMATES JUMP BY $338 MILLION;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: ADDED TO A PREVIOUSLY REPORTED OVERRUN OF $135 MILLION, THE  TOTAL ESCALATION HAS NOW REACHED $473 MILLION.  </P> <P> Cost estimates for building the 17.4-mile Metro Rail subway project have  escalated by $473 million and Los Angeles transit officials now put the total  at $3.9 billion, a California Transportation Commission official told The Times  on Tuesday.  </P> <P> A $135-million cost overrun had been previously reported. But Los Angeles  County Transportation Commission officials have informed the state that the  costs will go up an additional $338 million as a result of federal funding  delays, according to Robert Chung, deputy director of the state Transportation  Commission.  </P> <P> The federal Department of Transportation is providing more than 40% of the  funding for the downtown subway, but the county commission said that delays in  reaching a funding agreement have set the project back at least a year, thereby  increasing construction costs.  </P> <P> Linda Bohlinger, a top fiscal planner for the county commission, said the cost  increases were presented to state officials in April. She said the federal  government is being asked to pick up $170 million of the cost overrun.  </P> <P> The subject of Metro Rail cost escalations was brought up during a state  Assembly Transportation Committee hearing Tuesday in Los Angeles that was  called to examine the cost of developing a 300-mile rail transit system in  Southern California. The state is funding part of this development.  </P> <P> During the hearing, state officials testified they had been told last March  that the cost of building the subway was increasing. The state had asked the  county for a detailed cost breakdown, but never received a reply, said Robert  I. Remen, executive director of the state commission.  </P> <P> The state was seeking the cost per passenger mile of building Metro Rail, a  subway linking downtown Los Angeles with North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) asked  Richard Stanger, the county's director of rail development, to explain why the  county had not supplied the state with the cost figures. Stanger said he could  not explain why, but promised to get the figures as soon as he could.  </P> <P> "I want those numbers by the close of business Friday," Katz ordered.  </P> <P> He accused the commission of stalling and using "a shell game" to obscure the  cost increases.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview after Tuesday's hearing, Chung explained that the  county commission had provided broad cost overrun figures in a report filed  with the state commission.  </P> <P> "The 1990 LACTC financial plan for the Metro Red Line has increased $473  million over the plan presented to the (state commission) in 1989," the April  26, 1990, report concluded.  </P> <P> It stated that the added costs were due in large part to a yearlong delay by  federal officials in signing a funding agreement on the second phase of  construction.  </P> <P> In addition, federal officials are requiring the commission to build the next  13 miles of the subway project in two stages, instead of one long project.  County transit experts said this was less efficient and would delay completion  of the project by another year or more. The subway now is scheduled to reach  North Hollywood by 1997.  </P> <P> Some delays have been caused by the conflict between the county commission and  the Southern California Rapid Transit District, Chung said.  </P> <P> The RTD was responsible for constructing the 4.4-mile first phase under  downtown Los Angeles. But the commission stepped in and took over the project  in July after audits revealed a $135-million cost overrun. The first phase of  the project is two years behind schedule and will not open until the fall of  1993.  </P></p>

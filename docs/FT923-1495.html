			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Swedes untie welfare apron strings - Efforts to adapt to fresh realities finalised in the early hours of yesterday morning - represents a significant break with the welfare state attitudes that have dominated the country since the 1930s. Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, told the Financial Times last night that although the 'vision of the Maastricht treaty was in doubt' at the moment, he wanted to see Sweden - when it becomes a European Community member - as one of the 'core countries in economic and monetary union'. With all-party support for underpinning the exchange rate and a continuing broad political consensus over Sweden's EC membership application, he is drawing considerable comfort from the readiness of his Social Democratic opponents to swallow fundamental changes in the structure of the welfare state as a price to be paid in adapting the country to the new realities of global markets. The Stockholm bourse share index fell 1.5 per cent yesterday in active trading and short-term interest rates rose as the Riksbank, the country's central bank, maintained a 50 per cent marginal lending rate to the banks. However, capital appeared to be flowing back into the country. The continuing unease in Sweden is partly a reflection of the wider turbulence on the European money markets. It is still hoped that the package hammered out at the weekend between the four-party centre-right coalition government and the Social Democratic opposition, aimed at eliminating a growing structural deficit over the next few years, will make clear the determination of the government to deal with the country's underlying economic difficulties. The country's old social consensus, based on high public spending and high taxation administered by a powerful centralising state, and that once-famous Swedish model of comprehensive welfare provision, is being gradually abandoned. Next year old-age pensions and child benefit are to be cut in value. Housing subsidies are being reduced by as much as SKr3bn. Swedes who are sick will receive no benefit for their first day of absence from work and the amount they get thereafter will be less than before, with a saving to the government of SKr4.5bn. Sweden's foreign aid budget is also being cut by SKr1.5bn to 0.9 per cent of gross national product from 1.0 per cent. The cuts in government spending will amount to Skr18.9bn worth of savings next year with a further Skr8.7bn coming through higher taxes (mainly on petrol and tobacco) to strengthen the revenue side of the budget. The total effect in on next year's budget will be Skr27.6bn but the impact will rise to SKr40.6bn by 1997. The all-party agreement also makes an important long-term commitment to transform Sweden's health and injury insurance system by shifting its enormous and mounting costs from the shoulders of the taxpayers to employers and trade unions with a saving to the state of Skr50bn, 3 per cent of gross domestic product. This reform is expected to go through in the mid-1990s with broad political support. Mr Bildt sees this long-term change as opening up the huge public sector to private market forces and going a long way to begin the necessary reduction in the size of Sweden's public spending as a proportion of gross domestic product which at 56 per cent is the highest in the developed world. His government has been forced to make some sacrifices in its free-market programmes. A moratorium has been imposed on the further privatisation of state companies for the rest of the present parliament. A plan to abolish the wealth tax has been postponed until 1994, as has a proposal to reduce the tax on capital to 25 per cent from 30 per cent. But under the remorseless pressure of outside markets, Sweden's political establishment has been forced to accept that the country must adapt to the realities of economic and political integration with western Europe. It has taken four weeks of severe turbulence on the markets and dangers to the fixed exchange rate of the krona to bring about what Mr Bengt Dennis, the Riksbank governor, has been seeking. As Mr Bildt argues: 'A few weeks ago I saw severe troubles in parliament on economic policy. Now we will have a comfortable majority for what needs to be done.' Under unprecedented conditions, the right-left divisions of Swedish politics have been swept aside, albeit temporarily. A poll carried out by Sifo found 76 per cent of Swedes in favour of the crisis package. Such popular support for the all-party agreement suggests the end of the old Swedish model will not be a cause for national mourning.</p>

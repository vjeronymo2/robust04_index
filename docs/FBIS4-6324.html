			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government on Wednesday allowed a local shipping line to run a  freighter directly to a North Korean harbor. Samsun Shipping  Corp. will haul 250 tons of Remicon facilities and equipment to  Yanji in northeastern China via Chongjin, a northern east coast  harbor of North Korea.    An official at Samsun Shipping said one of its vessels,  "Halibut," would leave Pusan at 8 P.M. Wednesday and enter  Chongjin on April 22. After unloading its cargo, the vessel of  St. Vincent registry will leave Chongjin on April 25 and return  to Pusan around April 27, he said. The direct shipping from  South Korea to the North will be the first of its kind in two  years and eight months after the same line shipped 5,000 tons of  South Korean rice from Mokpo to Najin in July 1991.    Samsun Shipping is learned to have set up a joint-venture  firm with the Xianhu business group in China's Yanbian area last  month and agreed to open a sea route linking Pusan and Chongjin.  "We have approved the Pusan-Chongjin shipping because North  Korea allowed the Xianhu business group to use the Chongjin  harbor for cargoes from anywhere in the world," a National  Unification Board official said.    Xianhu concluded a joint-venture contract with North Korea  last June for the development of the Chongjin harbor, under  which the Chinese group possesses the exclusive right to use the  North Korean harbor for 50 years, the official explained.</p>

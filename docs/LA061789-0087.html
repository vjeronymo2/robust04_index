			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE AIMS REBUKE AT JOHNSON IN CONDEMNING INSENSITIVE LANGUAGE  </P> <P> In an extraordinary rebuke aimed at apparent anti-Semitic remarks made by  Assembly Republican leader Ross Johnson, an agitated Senate on Friday  unanimously approved a resolution urging legislators to avoid derogatory  language in conducting their business.  </P> <P> The resolution identified Johnson by name and directly quoted controversial  remarks he made the previous day to Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), who is  Jewish and who accused Johnson of anti-Semitism.  </P> <P> The resolution did not, however, criticize Johnson personally. Instead, it  merely expressed the Senate's resolve to "assiduously avoid any conduct that  could reasonably be expected to be offensive to any diverse element of our  population."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 32-0 Approval  </P> <P> In a hushed chamber after a 20-minute discussion, the Senate voted bipartisan  32-0 approval of the unusual statement, which is not binding on anyone but is  intended to discourage "derogatory appellations" in the upper house.  </P> <P> Only minutes before, Johnson, one of the most combative members of the  Legislature, made a public apology to the Senate-Assembly budget conference  committee of which Robbins is a member. Robbins, however, did not hear it  because he was on the Senate floor awaiting action on the resolution.  </P> <P> Later, Robbins, no stranger to controversies that he concedes he helped to  create, demurred on whether he would accept the apology, insisting only that "I  have no desire to prolong this."  </P> <P> "If I said anything that was interpreted or could have been interpreted as  having been a slur on anyone's religious preferences or ethnic background, I  most sincerely apologize," Johnson told the committee.  </P> <P> But the La Habra Republican told reporters he would never apologize for  confronting Robbins in the committee on Thursday "on his inappropriate and  quite possibly illegal behavior towards members of the Assembly Republican  caucus."  </P> <P> He charged that Robbins abused his position as one of the Legislature's six  state budget writers to "bully and browbeat" Assembly Republicans as they came  before the committee one by one to seek funds for locally popular projects in  their districts, such as parks.  </P> <P> Robbins targeted members of the Assembly GOP because they had refused to give  their permission for reconsideration of a high-priority Robbins insurance bill  that was killed earlier in the lower chamber.  </P> <P> Johnson learned of Robbins' conduct in the budget committee and charged angrily  into the hearing room, where he greeted Robbins as "Senator Torquemada," a  reference to Tomas de Torquemada, a leader of the bloody Spanish Inquisition  against Jews in the late 15th Century.  </P> <P> Robbins took offense at the remark, to which Johnson shot back: "Maybe,  senator, I should have referred to Sammy Glick." Glick was a central figure in  the 1941 novel "What Makes Sammy Run" and was portrayed as an utterly ambitious  and ruthless film mogul who was Jewish.  </P> <P> After the Senate action on the resolution, sponsored by his long-time ally in  the San Fernando Valley, Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), Robbins defended his  conduct in dealing with Assembly Republicans and seemed to affirm the  legislative adage: "Reward your friends and punish your enemies."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fair Shake Factor  </P> <P> He told reporters he believed that the Assembly Republicans had dealt with his  insurance measure "unfairly" and that as a state budget writer, "obviously I'm  more receptive to someone who has given me a fair shake."  </P> <P> Each summer, nerves fray and tempers flare as lawmakers fight to see that their  interests are provided for in the state budget.  </P> <P> But this time around, pressures seem to loom larger, especially as the FBI and  U.S. attorney press their investigations into suspected corruption in the  Capitol.  </P> <P> In an interview Friday, Johnson charged that Robbins, a potential contender  next year for the state insurance commissioner's post, was trying to divert  attention away from a story in Thursday's Los Angeles Times reporting that the  Van Nuys Democrat is a subject of the FBI probe.  </P> <P> Johnson said Robbins had "chosen for political reasons to make a great issue  out of something that I suspect in his heart he knows is utter nonsense."  </P> <P> Teri Burns, a spokeswoman for Robbins, later denied that notion. "He took it  (Johnson's remarks) very personally. It wasn't related to other issues," she  said.  </P> <P> It is rare for either house of the Legislature to take on one of its members  publicly, although plenty of backbiting occurs in private. The last time one  chamber directly criticized a member in public occurred in 1981 when the Senate  reprimanded former Sen. John Schmitz (R-Corona Del Mar) for issuing a press  release that described an audience at an abortion hearing as composed of "a sea  of hard Jewish and (arguably) female faces" and using such terms as "queer,  butch and bull dykes."  </P> <P> In presenting the resolution on Friday, Davis noted that the measure fell far  short of criticizing Johnson and zeroed in on his remarks that "could easily be  construed as anti-Semitic."  </P> <P> He said that derogatory racial or religious remarks have no place in  legislative deliberations.  </P> <P> "There are times like this that I think real men and real women have to stand  up and take positions," Davis told the Senate, adding that no one asked him to  introduce the resolution.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Views  </P> <P> Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), one of the Senate's two black members, agreed,  declaring that "we cannot tolerate in jest or in sincerity any insensitive  remark." However, Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), who is Jewish and  co-authored a successful political reform ballot initiative with Johnson,  defended the embattled Republican and asserted that the resolution was  unnecessary because Johnson had apologized.  </P> <P> "Assemblyman Johnson says there isn't an anti-Semitic bone in his body, and I  believe that," said Kopp, who ended up voting for the measure. "All of us are  subject to the vicissitudes of simple momentary loss of rational discourse."  </P> <P> Senate GOP leader Ken Maddy of Fresno noted that "intemperate remarks" occur  frequently in the Legislature and "all are regrettable." He said he did not  believe it fair to single out in a formal resolution "one incident, as bad as  it may have been."  </P></p>

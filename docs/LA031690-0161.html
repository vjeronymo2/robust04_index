			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C.'S ONLY TALK-RADIO STATION TO GO ALL-MUSIC  </P> <P> Orange County's only talk-radio station has laid off its morning team as it  prepares for a planned switch to an all-music format.  </P> <P> Bob and Yvonne Turnbull, a husband-and-wife team who hosted a magazine-style  show weekdays from 6 to 9 a.m., were let go after their show Wednesday at  Anaheim-based KORG (1190 AM). On Thursday, their show was replaced by  syndicated programming.  </P> <P> Bob Turnbull said he and his wife were told that they were being let go to make  way for a switch to an all-music format. While he called the parting "amiable,"  he expressed disappointment that the county would lose its only talk station.  </P> <P> KORG's vice president and general manager, Bob Wood, said Thursday that the  station is "looking at several options right now" but is leaning toward a  format that aims to attract an audience 45 to 65 years old with a blend of big  band and adult contemporary music.  </P> <P> The service would be provided by Unistar, a Colorado-based company that  provides 24-hour programming in a variety of formats to more than 1,000  stations nationwide, via satellite. Wood said that if KORG goes with the  service, it would use only part of the satellite feed and would keep some  locally produced programming.  </P> <P> "If we can get this format in this market, I think it would be an asset," Wood  said. He stressed that no deals have been finalized and said no date for the  switch has been set. Besides the Turnbulls, KORG's midday host Karen Tyndall  was replaced last month with satellite programming, as was Ken Satin's  afternoon show. Neither was a salaried station employee.  </P> <P> The 10,000-watt KORG has gone through several format changes in recent years.  It last switched formats in February, 1989, from Christian programming (as  station KPZE) to an all-talk lineup with an emphasis on Orange County. It also  flirted with an all-news format as KNWZ after years as a Top 40 rock station,  KEZY-AM.  </P> <P> KORG and sister station KEZY-FM were purchased last year for $15.1 million by  New York-based ML Media Partners. When former owners Anaheim Broadcasting Corp.  agreed to sell in June, ML officials said there were no plans to change formats  at either station. KEZY-FM is a Top 40 station.  </P></p>

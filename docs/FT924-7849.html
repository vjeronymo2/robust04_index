			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (4): A different perspective on space - Business parks / The slump has at least been beneficial in clarifying which are the potential winners BUSINESS Parks were the epitome of the affluent Eighties, when tenants deserted congested town centres to find a brave new world. But like the author who storms best-selling lists with a first book, they now have to prove they can repeat the success. Many will not make it. The slump has slowed business moves and put a clamp on finance, dragging back the frenetic growth of even the best schemes. But the worst would have sunk without trace even in good times. This puts a different perspective on the vast amounts of space in the pipeline. Applied Property Research reckons little or nothing has been built on more than 800 planned leading schemes - and nor is it likely to appear. The projects lack one of the vital ingredients: high-quality buildings, extensive landscaping or, most of all, good communications. The slump has at least been beneficial in clarifying which are the potential winners, and that boils down to about 100 schemes and only a handful of developers. Arlington Property Developments, despite being part of the ailing British Aerospace conglomerate, is among the few. Mr Patrick Deigman, managing director, says business has halved since the boom, but inquiries are at record levels. 'Companies have picked out where they need to go. They are just holding off making a decision to move until they see clearer signs of a recovery,' he says. 'The next six months could see a flood of real moves.' The big trend is for a company to buy land and build its own premises. British Gas, for example, is still planning a massive headquarters on almost 40 acres at Birmingham Business Park, despite rumours of backtracking on the deal, says Mr Deigman. Speculative building has shrunk, however, and new supply seems likely to be less than 6m sq ft in 1992, compared with about 20m sq ft a couple of years ago. That should about match this year's take-up - again a massive decline since tenants gobbled up more than 17 m sq ft at the peak of the boom. But some still feel they can risk building in advance of demand. Akeler Developments is relying on the double bonus of regional grants and enterprise zone incentives to underpin Doxford International, a proposed 1.25m sq ft park in Sunderland. Four blocks totalling 113,000 sq ft will be ready for tenants by the spring and have been sold on to a property enterprise trust for more than Pounds 18m. Arlington is also spec building at Bracknell, Reading and Birmingham. Another positive aspect of recession is re-emergence of the 'mid-tech' building which mixes office and industrial space. Around London, these were elbowed out by high-rented offices, although some planners infuriated developers by blocking the trend. The developers may now have cause for thanks because of shortages of mid-tech space for tenants who cannot afford  -or do not want - pure offices. Many companies sucked into such office schemes at Pounds 20-plus a sq ft now have little chance of assigning leases around the western end of the M25 where new office space can be found for Pounds 17.50, according to Mr Chris Palmer and Mr Chris Bearman at Grimley J R Eve. They say mid-tech space has netted a clutch of deals in Barwell Business Park, Chessington at about Pounds 8-Pounds 10 a sq ft over the past six months, often to international companies. Whole regions are also short of supply. 'Yorkshire and Manchester cry out for a first-class business park,' says Mr Geoff Marsh of Applied Property Research. Leeds-based Mr Simon Ives of Chesterton agrees that West Yorkshire has only the Lawnswood park on the city's northern fringe, although he points out that at least the North is not awash with empty space. He is not optimistic about new development. 'Even if someone was prepared to put up speculative space they would find it extremely difficult to borrow the money. One also wonders where the demand would come from.' But Mr Deigman would move into Manchester tomorrow if he could find the right site. He has looked at 40 without success. Plans for a 4.5m sq ft giant at Gloucester will keep him busy, however. This sort of 'fourth generation' development is the pattern for the next decade, says architect Michael Aukett - who has a special authority after creating the template for modern development more than a decade ago through the mould-breaking Stockley Park near Heathrow, and who now keeps busy working up schemes in both eastern and western Europe. The new generation will be big - more than 100 acres - with all the trimmings of low land cover and high-quality buildings. They will integrate with the community by providing homes, leisure and shopping facilities, and link into public transport. But the transition will not be easy, says Mr Aukett, particularly if developers are tempted to recoup high land costs by clogging sites with high-earning uses. Some have already made this mistake and may suffer slower future growth. Many more, however, face an even bigger disappointment for aspiring to turn sow's ear industrial sites into high-tech silk purses.</p>

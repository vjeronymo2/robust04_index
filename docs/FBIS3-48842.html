			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- The Pusan Alliance  for Democracy and National Reunification released a statement  Saturday denouncing the United States and the South Korean  puppet clique for scheming to deploy Patriot missiles in South  Korea, according to a radio report from Seoul.    The statement said that "the U.S. projected deployment of  Patriot missiles may make difficult the negotiations between the  North and the International Atomic Energy Agency on nuclear  inspection and lead to a war."    It said that "the plan is entirely contradictory to the  universal trend toward peace and reconciliation" and urged its  immediate withdrawal.    The organisation strongly demanded that the South Korean  puppet authorities refuse introducing missiles which will bring  the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.</p>

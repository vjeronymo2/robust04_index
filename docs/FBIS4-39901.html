			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent A. Pishchayev; from the "Vesti" </F> newscast]    [Excerpts] A meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council [NACC] at the foreign minister level in Istambul,  Turkey, summed up the results of NACC's work over the half-year.  [passage omitted]    In a brief interview with Vesti prior to his departure by  air  Andrey Kozyrev noted that on the whole we have no fundamental  differences with NATO. Meanwhile, he said, NATO members do not  in all ways share the principle of the full equality of NACC  members, on which we insist. They prefer the formula NATO plus  partners. In particular this was reflected in the communique on  the NACC meeting.    [Begin recording] [Kozyrev] I could not agree with certain  formulas, which to my mind take insufficient account of Russia's  role. For instance, concerning Karabakh, a formula is being  proposed that notes and stresses only the role of the CSCE. We  do not demand anything special, but our interests must be taken  into account.

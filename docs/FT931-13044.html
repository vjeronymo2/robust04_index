			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Muddled about money The conflicting signals in yesterday's money supply data provide a perfect excuse for the chancellor to do nothing about interest rates for the time being. While M4 growth has fallen below its target floor of 4 per cent, the narrow M0 measure looks set to rise above its ceiling this month. Together with the cheerier news on confidence emanating from the CBI, that goes some way to offsetting last week's gloomy news on employment, production and retail sales. Even if the economy is not in a desperate plight, though, it is hard to discern anything more than anaemic recovery. Consumers may be prepared to spend a little more of the real wage increases they are enjoying if they are still in work, but only when they are offered discount prices and not if it means going into debt. The weakness of bank lending is particularly striking. It seems to confirm that, while some prices are moving in response to devaluation, there is little demand-pull inflationary pressure in the pipeline. M0 may have breached its target, but the ceiling was unduly low in the first place. That leaves room for interest rate cuts at some stage, perhaps after the Bundesbank's intentions are clearer. The money supply trend creates an opportunity for the government to relax the rules preventing sales of gilts to banks being counted towards PSBR funding. The move would only reduce the flow of gilts, however, if banks could be persuaded to buy more paper. All the more reason to steepen the yield curve by cutting short-term rates.</p>

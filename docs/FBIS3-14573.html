			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, March 28, IRNA -- Foreign Minister 'Ali  Akbar Velayati is to leave here today for Conakry on a  six-nation tour of Africa which will take him to Guinea, Burkina  Faso, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Kenya, and Namibia.    Political observers deem the visits as "very important" and  in line with bilateral interests for further strengthening of  political, economic and cultural ties as well as regional and  international cooperation.    In the pre-revolution era, Africa was ignored by the shah's  regime which had ties with only certain African countries such  as the racist South African regime. However, the following the  triumph of the Islamic revolution in 1079, Iran severed its  relations with the racist South African regime upon the orders  of the father of the Islamic revolution the late Imam Khomeini,  and expanded its ties with sub-Saharan African countries.    Islamic Republic of Iran now has established ties with 20  African countries at the ambassadorial level and "very sincere"  relations with many others, but is yet to develop healthy  economic ties with them.    The six African countries which Velayati is to visit are  rich  in gold, diamonds, silver, bauxite, zinc, iron, copper, tin and  cobalt as well as in such agricultural products as coffee,  cocoa, tea, rice, cotton, sugar cane and pineapple.    Iran can have favourable cooperation with the said countries  and can invest in their mineral and agricultural sectors in  favour of common interests.    However, Iran has no direct aerial and marine transportation  links with the said countries to promote economic cooperation.    Contrary to Iran, the European Community, U.S., Japan and  even the Zionist regime have embarked on economic investments in  sub-Saharan Africa unilaterally to plunder the rich natural  resources of the deprived continent.</p>

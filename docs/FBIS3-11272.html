			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Omar Morales, member of the Cuban delegation </F> attending the experts' technical meeting on the creation of the  Association of Caribbean States in Jamaica, by Bianca Elena  Govin in Kingston, Jamaica; date not given; from the "Evening  Information Review" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Govin] Since Wednesday, Kingston, Jamaica, has been  the headquarters of an experts' technical meeting to further the  establishment of the Association of Caribbean States [ACS], a  regional organization in which Cuba will participate as a full  member. We will now talk to diplomat Omar Morales, member of  the Cuban delegation, to learn details of this meeting. What  are the meeting's objectives? What countries are participating?  What topics have been discussed up to now?    [Morales] The ACS's basic objectives are to further economic  integration and operational cooperation. Those were the initial  objectives but they have since been expanded because we have  also talked about establishing commissions for foreign economic  relations, trade, investments in the Caribbean region, and  transportation. In our search for new cooperation mechanisms,  the association's initial objectives expanded and now include  the ones I mentioned initially, as well as the coordination of  all the economic issues to which I have referred.    The current meeting is being attended by the all the  independent Caribbean countries [words indistinct] the 25  independent Caribbean countries and several dependent  territories with the manifest absence of Puerto Rico and the  Virgin Islands. They are the only ones not attending the  conference.    Up to now, we have only discussed the organization's  charter.  We have discussed the text of the document or agreement that  will legalize the ACS. On this issue, one of the topics that  has prompted more attention is the participation of the  dependent territories because there are big differences between  all the dependent territories. Saint Martin and Montserrat are  not the same, for example, as French Overseas Departments such  as [word indistinct] and Guadeloupe. Each of them has very  special characteristics, and we will have to reach specific  participation formulas for each of them. Of course, their  participation in the organization will be different from that of  the independent countries.    Today, we continue and expect to really get into the issue  of  the text of the charter. Yesterday's meeting ended with the  presentation of the Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] program,  and today we will start to debate the text itself. This is what  we have done up to now.    [Govin] In the past days, news agencies have reported that  the topic of NAFTA, which, as we all know, was signed by the  United States, Mexico, and Canada, is going to be debated in the  Jamaica meeting. What can you tell us about this, taking into  account that Mexico is a signatory of that pact and will also be  a member of the future ACS?    [Morales] No, this issue has not been mentioned up to now,  and I don't think it will be included because the ACS is not  being established to deal with the NAFTA issue. Furthermore,  one of the principles included in the discussions on the  association's constitution, is that the association has to work  to further the integration of our countries. Once we have, for  example, an integration organization for Latin American,  Caribbean, [word indistinct], or however you want to call it, we  will be in a more advantageous position and could then talk to  other blocs or associations.    The fact that Mexico, which has maintained a very  constructive attitude at the meeting and is one of the countries  that has enthusiastically furthered the establishment of the  association, is in the [words indistinct] has no importance.  There are many countries, such as Colombia, Venezuela, the  Central Americans, Caricom itself, that are in the association  and also participate in other integration mechanisms. The  countries that already participate in integration mechanisms are  not limited in any way because they will now participate in the  ACS.    [Govin] The official constitution of the ACS is scheduled to  be held in Barbados next July. Could you briefly give us the  organization's characteristics and its main objectives.    [Morales] As I said before, the association's main objective  is to further Latin American and Caribbean integration and an  operative cooperation among our countries. Those are its main  goals, and several commissions will also be created. We all  want, despite the fact that it means a lot of hard work, to  finish our job and officially establish the association in July.  This obviously will require a very strong effort by all the  member countries as July is only three and one-half months away  and we are just starting to debate the charter. We, thus, have  to hurry and work hard to be able to constitute the ACS in  Barbados. It is anticipated that all the Caribbean heads of  state will attend this event.</p>

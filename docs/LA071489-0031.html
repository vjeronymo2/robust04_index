			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE PANEL CALLS FOR DIVERSITY ON FISH AND GAME COMMISSION  </P> <P> The Senate Rules Committee has served notice on Gov. George Deukmejian that it  wants people other than white, male hunters appointed to the state Fish and  Game Commission.  </P> <P> The committee of three Democrats and two Republicans agreed to send Deukmejian  a letter "imploring" him to appoint women, ethnic minorities and  representatives of conservationist organizations to the commission.  </P> <P> The issue surfaced at the conclusion of a confirmation hearing Wednesday for  fish and game Commissioner Albert C. Taucher, a retired Long Beach sporting  goods store operator who was reappointed to a second term. The committee  approved the appointment and sent it to the floor on a 3-1 vote.  </P> <P> The commission, among other things, sets policy guidelines for the state Fish  and Game Department, regulates hunting and sport fishing and has increasingly  become involved in preservation of wildlife habitat and protection of non-game  species.  </P> <P> Sen. Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland) noted that the commission consists of five  white males, all of whom are hunters. He said he favors more diversity,  including appointment of members who represent environmental organizations.  </P> <P> Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside), who suggested a letter to the governor, said  he believes Deukmejian should appoint "people who are not necessarily  protagonists of the hunt, (but) people who have great feeling for the animals,  their habitat and their well being."  </P> <P> Senate Leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), committee chairman, announced  that he will not vote for appointees to the commission "unless they are  balanced." He said it is important that the commission members reflect the  gender and diverse ethnic composition of California.  </P> <P> The commission's executive secretary, Harold C. Cribbs, confirmed that all five  commissioners are white males and said they "primarily hunt waterfowl and  upland game birds."  </P> <P> As a group, he said, hunters "are as much mainstream conservationists in  California as you'll find."  </P></p>

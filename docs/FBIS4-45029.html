This was announced by 'Abbas Ahmad-Akhundi, minister of  housing and urban development, at the first one-day gathering of  chiefs and officials of offices of representatives of the vice  regent and managers of the organizations throughout the country  affiliated with the Islamic Republic Housing Foundation. He  added: These units, which are small in area, will be appropriate  for young married couples and small families.    The minister of housing and urban development added: This  year construction of 25,000 housing units is planned with the  necessary budget.    He said the average area of these kinds of units will be  less  than 50 meters. He said: The price of these kinds of units is  less than 10 million rials [R], and the budget for it will be  close to R1 million.    Akhundi added: The remaining funds for these units will be  collected over 15 to 20 years as monthly rentals, which will be  between R50,000 and R60,000.    He noted: The price of the land is a factor in setting the  price of these units, and the Ministry of Housing and Urban  Development will oversee the procedure for setting prices and  deposits.    Akhundi cited rural emigration to the cities, especially  Tehran, as a great problem. He said: If the Housing Foundation,  in cooperation with the Documents and Deeds Registry  Organization, can distribute deeds among the rural people, it  will be doing them the greatest service.</p>

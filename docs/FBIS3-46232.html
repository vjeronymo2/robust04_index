Governor Tian Chengping chaired the meeting and  provincial party Secretary Yin Kesheng made a speech entitled  "Improving Our Understanding, Unifying Our Thinking, and Further  Strengthening Work in the Rural and Pastoral Areas." Provincial  party and government leading comrades including Doba, Wang  Hanmin, Ma Yuanbiao, and Liu Guanghe were present at the meeting.    In his speech, Comrade Yen Kesheng first analyzed the  situation in pastoral areas. He said: Since the introduction  of reform and opening up, a profound change has taken place in  Qinghai's pastoral areas, which have made historic achievements.  Particularly in recent years the provincial party and  government have introduced many policies and measures to  strengthen agricultural and animal husbandry work. At a time  when financial resources were quite tight, the provincial party  and government increased investment in agriculture and animal  husbandry, and paid attention to comprehensive agricultural  development and structural adjustment. As a result, pastoral  areas could maintain a good trend of stable economic development  for many years. But we should soberly understand that animal  husbandry production is still at a low development level, that  the foundation of animal husbandry is weak, that its production  structure is simple, that the comparative returns in grain  production have reduced, and that the increase in the peasants'  income is slow. If these problems are not seriously resolved,  they will affect the development of agriculture and animal  husbandry and the province's national economic development and  will also be a drag on modernization. Therefore, we should  under all circumstances put agriculture at the forefront of  economic work and this should become the basic guiding principle  in Qinghai's economic work.    Comrade Yin Keshing pointed out: The 1990's are a crucial  period for the province's reform and economic construction.  Rural and pastoral areas throughout the province should further  improve their operational mechanism so that their markets will  be full of vitality. In line with the instructions of the party  Central Committee and the State Council, the provincial party  committee has decided to extend the period of contracted  farmlands for another 30 years and that the period of contracted  pastoral areas will remain unchanged for 50 years. [passage  omitted]    Comrade Yin Keshing continued: The central issue of the  province's rural and pastoral areas is to increase the peasants'  and herdsmen's incomes. Increasing their per capita net income  will promote all aspects of work in the rural and pastoral  areas. We should help the masses' increase their incomes and  move toward moderate prosperity, and take this as the general  objective. To achieve this end, the following two points should  be given attention. The first is further adjusting and  optimizing the production structure, developing township and  town enterprises, and cultivating a high-yield, high-quality,  and highly efficient agriculture by means of science and  technology. The second is increasing investments, strengthening  basic facilities construction for agriculture and animal  husbandry, and improving production conditions. [passage  omitted]</p>

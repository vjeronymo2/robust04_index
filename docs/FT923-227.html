			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Northern Telecom blames recession for 426 jobs cut NORTHERN Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications company, yesterday announced that it was cutting 426 jobs, most of them at its plant in Northern Ireland. The company blamed the recession for the redundancies and said the cuts would reduce overheads and maintain efficiency. The cuts involve 230 shopfloor posts and 90 managerial and administrative jobs at the company's Monkstown plant in Newtownabbey. The Monkstown factory originally belonged to STC, which Northern Telecom took over two years ago. As a result of yesterday's announcement, the factory will cease production of a range of products including point-of-sale tills, power supply units and circuit boards for telephone exchanges. A further 106 jobs are being lost at the company's plants in Basildon, Essex, and in south Wales. The Basildon factory is being closed, with most staff redeployed to nearby sites. About 700 staff will continue to be employed at the Ulster factory making high-technology transmission equipment. The company said the redundancies would take place by the end of the year and were designed to maintain the company's competitive position. The workforce was informed at a mass meeting yesterday. A union spokesman described the redundancies as devastating, in an area of Northern Ireland already hard hit by redundancies. Pirelli Cables, the UK subsidiary of the Italian cable and tyre group, yesterday announced the shedding of nearly 300 jobs. A total of 240 jobs are to go by the end of the year with the closure of its copper cable factory at Bishopstoke, Hampshire. From next year, copper cable production will be concentrated at the company's Newport plant in south Wales. Pirelli also said it would shed 50 workers at Newport in order to cut costs and improve efficiency. MMB stake taken, Page 29</p>

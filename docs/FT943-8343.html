			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Archer placed order for Anglia TV shares Lord Archer personally placed the orders to buy shares in Anglia Television which were the focus of the recent Department of Trade and Industry investigation into alleged insider trading. The Pounds 80,000 dealing profit did not, however, go to a stockbroking account in his name, which in part explains why the DTI decided at the end of last month not to launch any prosecutions after the completion of the inquiry. Lord Archer told the DTI's inspectors that he did not profit from inside information and never received a penny of the proceeds from the share transactions. The best-selling author and former Conservative Party deputy chairman said yesterday he had spoken to his lawyer who had advised him it would be 'very foolish' to make any comment about the circumstances leading to the DTI inquiry. However, officials and stockbrokers familiar with the case have disclosed that orders to buy the Anglia shares were made by Lord Archer shortly before January 18 when MAI made a Pounds 292m bid for Anglia. The dealings netted a profit of Pounds 80,000 after Anglia's share price soared 180p on the day of the bid. The private client stockbroking firm which received the share buying orders, Charles Stanley, assumed that Lord Archer wanted the purchases to be made for his own account. The firm, which has several senior Conservatives as clients, was subsequently told that the purchases were on behalf of an Arab man, whom the firm did not know and has not subsequently met. After the MAI bid was launched, the stock exchange's insider trading group reviewed a series of share purchases of Anglia shares ahead of the takeover offer. It contacted Charles Stanley, which disclosed that orders had been placed by Lord Archer. Within three days, the Exchange had put together a dossier on the transactions, which it passed to the DTI. Lord Archer faced allegations that he or his Arab acquaintance may have profited from inside information because his wife, Lady Archer, is a non-executive director of Anglia. After an inquiry lasting five months, the DTI said at the end of July that it would take 'no further action against any of the parties concerned'. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, made the decision not to launch any prosecutions after reviewing a report drawn up by inspectors under section 177 of the Financial Services Act and then receiving legal advice from independent lawyers. After the DTI's decision not to take further action, Lord Archer is understood to be confident he will achieve his ambition of being given a senior post in government or in the Conservative Party hierarchy. However, Conservative party managers believe he may be over-optimistic. Many Tory MPs believe the press leaks in early July of the DTI investigation were responsible for Lord Archer not receiving a post in John Major's summer government reshuffle. Officials have disclosed that the bulk of the DTI investigation had been completed at the time of the press leaks. Investigators were already convinced before the leaks occurred that prosecutions were unlikely. The DTI was criticised by MPs from all parties after it responded to press inquiries by confirming that the investigation was taking place. Section 177 reports are never published but it has been passed to the Stock Exchange and the Securities and Futures Authority.</p>

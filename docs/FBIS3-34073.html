			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The president has described the esteemed families of  the martyrs and devotees as the greatest and strongest  foundations of the Islamic revolution, safeguarding the gains of  this sacred divine system. He added: The presence of these dear  ones in society and in various arenas of the Islamic revolution  act as an inspiration to the people and contribute toward  reconstruction. He went on: The esteemed families of the  martyrs, the devotees, and the war-disabled are regarded as a  vast network, which protect the Islamic revolution and its holy  and remarkable gains in society.    Speaking today on the third day of the auspicious occasion  of  the Ten Days of Dawn, which is named the day of devotion and  martyrdom, and addressing families who have donated more than  one martyr, the president went on: You have voluntarily given  your dearest assets -- that is, your sons -- to be martyred for  the path of God. You are, thus, the best examples of devotion  and self-sacrifice. You have proved that nothing is more dear  to you than the path of the Islamic revolution and the line of  his eminence the imam, may God be satisfied with his deeds.    He added: Thanks to the strength given to the Islamic  revolution by the martyrs, the devotees, and their families, the  Islamic Republic of Iran is stronger and more stable than any  other regime in the world, despite today's seditious world and  despite so much resentment and hostility against us. Since the  families of the martyrs are continuing the path pursued by their  dear ones, this system's stability will increase daily.    Referring to the fact that the Islamic revolution of Iran  has  its roots in the hearts of all the members of society and other  Muslim and deprived nations of the world, the president said:  This revolution is not dependent upon individuals. Those who  think that by eliminating certain individuals they can deliver  blows to the revolution are mistaken; in the same way that after  the passing of his eminence the imam, God's blessings be upon  him, which was a great loss for the nation, the esteemed leader,  Khamene'i, as a wise and aware leader took the reins of the  leadership of this divine nation and decisively and vigorously  continues the path and holy aspirations of the founder of the  Islamic Republic.    He added: As a servant, I always feel indebted to the  nobility, dignity, and the comprehensive participation of all  the members of the public in all the stages of the Islamic  revolution, especially the esteemed families of the martyrs,  those missing in action, and the disabled. I hope that in the  future I will be able to exert more efforts in helping these  people.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: God has provided the  leadership  of the revolution and the steadfastness and self-sacrifice of  the Iranian people as proofs and guiding lights for history and  for those who come after us, so that the people of the world may  see God's will with their own eyes and can use it as a model.    The president said: Negative propaganda and the expanding  nature of the animosity and hatred of world arrogance toward the  Islamic revolution have further strengthened and consolidated it  inside the country, have encouraged the onlookers outside to  make further studies of the amazing dimensions of this historic  phenomenon of the present age, and have forced them to review  their negative assessment of the Islamic revolution.    Praising the sublime status of the martyrs, those missing in  action, and the disabled, and the patience and dignity of the  members of their honorable families, the president said that by  keeping alive the memory of the epic deeds of those beloved ones  we will be able to awaken pure consciences. He said: Those  acts of self-sacrifice have ensured the future of the revolution  and the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The fruits of  their self- sacrifice have made it possible that, alongside the  efforts for reconstructing and strengthening the economic health  of the country, the spiritual foundations of the society will  also be further strengthened.    According to the Central News Unit report, at the beginning  of this meeting, which was also attended by the families of the  martyrs of the presidency [as heard], Hojjat ol-Eslam  val-Moslemin Rahimian, the representative of the vali-ye faqih  and the head of the Martyrs Foundation, made a short speech in  which he expressed his gratitude for God's grace and blessings  in removing the danger to the life of the president. Amidst the  crushing slogans of the families of martyrs condemning the  conspiracies of the enemies and prayers for the health and  well-being of the president, Rahimian said: The esteemed  members of the families of martyrs and the disabled, through  their dignity, piety, and detachment are trying to have an  active presence and participation during the period of the  reconstruction of the country, as they did during the period of  the holy defense, Iran-Iraq war.    In these ceremonies, some of the children of the martyrs  chanted revolutionary songs.</p>

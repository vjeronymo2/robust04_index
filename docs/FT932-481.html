			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Eritrea hits at OAU's 'failure' ERITREA, Africa's newest independent state, stunned the opening session of an Organisation of African Unity summit yesterday by declaring that the OAU had been an utter failure for 30 years, Reuter reports from Cairo. 'The sad fact remains that the OAU has become a nominal organisation that has failed to deliver on its pronounced objectives and commitments,' Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki told a hushed conference hall. 'Although the OAU has often championed the lofty ideals of unity, co-operation, economic development, human rights and other worthy objectives, it has failed to seriously work towards their concrete realisation. 'Thirty years after the foundation of this organisation, our continent remains affected by growing poverty and backwardness. 'The African continent is today a marginalised actor in global politics and the world economic order,' he said. 'Africa is not a place where its citizens can walk with raised heads but a continent scorned by all its partners, a continent that seems to produce endlessly the wrong manuals for economic development, democratisation and political management,' Mr Afewerki declared.</p>

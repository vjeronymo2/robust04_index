			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Moss Bros up 77% on higher market share A LARGER share of the UK suit market helped Moss Bros, the clothing outfitter, lift pre-tax profits by 77 per cent, from Pounds 354,000 to Pounds 625,000, in the six months to July 31. Mr Rowland Gee, managing director, described the rise as 'satisfactory given the fragility of the recovery the UK is seeing'. The shares rose 7p to 245p. The group, which makes 70 per cent of its operating profits in the second half, lifted its market share for suits from 5.5 per cent to 6 per cent in the first six months. It maintained its position as the number one hire business for formal wear with a 38 per cent market share. More than half the pre-tax profit was accounted for by interest receivable of Pounds 321,000, down from Pounds 491,000. Operating profit was Pounds 304,000 on turnover of Pounds 25.5m, compared with a previous operating loss of Pounds 137,000 on turnover of Pounds 23.9m. The group had net cash of Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 8.5m) at the period end. Mr Terry Donovan, finance director, said the group was 'not embarrassed by the money - too many retailers have fallen by the wayside'. The group would continue to take a cautious approach with its cash. Mr Gee said the group had rigorously controlled its costs and was continuing to pursue a policy of organic growth. Capital expenditure rose from Pounds 260,000 to Pounds 1m in the period. The Savoy Taylors Guild outlets in Canterbury, Exeter and Colchester were relocated to larger shops and a new Cecil Gee branch was opened recently at Lakeside, Thurrock. The group now has 107 stores, almost half of which trade as Suit Co. Earnings per share rose from 1.42p to 2.5p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 1.5p.</p>

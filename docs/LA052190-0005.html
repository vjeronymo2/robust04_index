			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR'S ACTION IN SHOPLIFT CASE  </P> <P> As your reporters well know, many days I bite my tongue upon reading the  morning's news. Much of what I read is a snippet of fact nestled in so much  speculation and distortion that, even when I directly witnessed or caused the  event under discussion, I don't recognize the story.  </P> <P> Today, I am having a tougher time than usual biting my tongue. On a Saturday  afternoon in April, I received a call from one of my executive assistants, Jeff  Matsui. I learned that a Japanese official was in trouble at the airport, and  that the trouble had started with a claim of shoplifting. From that moment  until now, I proceeded to do my job. As the ranking officer in this city with  responsibility for every constituent, and with particular sensitivity to our  foreign visitors, I called the airport to learn the circumstances firsthand.  </P> <P> I quickly learned the answers to my questions from the sergeant of the airport  police. My staffer, who had gone to the airport in response to a call from a  member of our sister city committee hosting the official, did too. The foreign  dignitary was in custody for shoplifting. There was no accompanying  disturbance. He had a lawyer representing him. The parties, the store and the  visitor, were discussing how they wanted to proceed. The store authorities  decided that they would drop the matter, not because of any pressure or  suggestion from me or my representative, but of their own volition.  </P> <P> In the course of my duties, I have often been called upon to make inquiries.  But in 27 years in elective office, I have never urged anyone not to prosecute  a criminal case and I didn't in this instance. Should the foreign dignitary  have been prosecuted? Should the police have placed the man in jail? These were  not questions for me to address, and if these options are still being  considered, they still are not for me. But, I'll be damned if I'll stop doing  my job to make inquiries in appropriate circumstances, no matter how  controversial.  </P> <P> So, for those of you who live, work in or visit this city, please know that if  you run afoul of the law, you will have to take responsibility for the  predictable consequences. But if you need me, or simply think you need me, to  make inquiry about a matter, I'll be there and will not be discouraged or  intimidated out of fear that some irresponsible reporter may distort the facts  to suggest that my actions were improper.  </P> <P> TOM BRADLEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor  </P></p>

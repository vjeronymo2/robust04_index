			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Bundesbank movehelps to ease tension in ERM: Central bank cuts money market rates THE BUNDESBANK eased its short-term money market interest rates yesterday, raising speculation that cuts in its Lombard and discount lending rates could come as early as next month. The central bank council's decision to relax the terms applied in its securities repurchase operations with banks was a 'small but psychologically important signal that rates are off the top', said Mr Richard Reid of Union Bank of Switzerland. The cut in the money market rate helped to ease some of the recent tensions inside the European exchange rate mechanism, pushing the French franc further away from its floor against the D-Mark. Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, said: 'This marks the passing of the peak of the pressures in the ERM.' The move, however, had little impact on the punt, which continued to trade below its floors against the Belgian franc and the Dutch guilder. Council members decided at yesterday's unusually lengthy meeting that the so-called 'repo' rate would be reduced to 8.60 per cent from recent levels of 8.75 per cent and higher. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said later that the move was 'not a signal, but a continuation of our existing policy of relaxation in money markets'. There were suggestions yesterday that the Bundesbank would await the outcome of talks on this year's public sector wage round and German state budget before taking any more decisions on whether to ease policy. However, yesterday's move was widely read as an indicator that the bank wanted to reduce other rates, and was preparing to. Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at the Bayerische Vereinsbank, said the Bundesbank was getting people used to the idea that changes were coming. He expected cuts in the leading rates within two months, while Mr Axel Siedenberg at Deutsche Bank Research suggested change could come within four to six weeks if the central bank continued cutting the 'repo' rate, which has recently been steered down by more than 100 basis points. Most German experts had expected Lombard and discount rate reductions at the end of March or later. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, who has been exercising discreet pressure for relaxation in monetary policy in the light of deteriorating domestic economic conditions, said the latest move would give a positive impulse to international economic development, in Europe especially. Mr Wolfgang Roth, economics spokesman for the Social Democrat opposition, accused the bank of neglecting its domestic and international responsibilities, saying it should ask itself if it wanted to cause a long, deep recession. Mr Schlesinger, who on Wednesday firmly squashed lingering hopes of a cut this week in leading lending rates, said yesterday's decision followed 'an exhaustive debate on the monetary and currency situation'. Local experts, who suggested that industrial orders data had probably been released early by the economics ministry in an attempt to influence the council, dismissed some interpretations that the move was intended to help relieve pressure on the French franc, still close to its floor within the ERM. 'If they wanted to help, they would have cut the Lombard and discount rates,' Mr Hufner said. Mr Reid at UBS said that while the international effects of Bundesbank policy appeared to have encroached more on the central council's thinking, it did not want to be seen to be acting to influence exchange rate policy.

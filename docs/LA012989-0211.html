			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT ISSUERS SEE GOLD IN ORANGE COUNTY CARDS  </P> <P> No, they're not just picking on you.  </P> <P> If you live in most areas of Orange County, another credit card application  really does fall out of your mailbox just about every other time you open it  up.  </P> <P> With its upscale demographics and affluent life style, Orange County has been  targeted by many of the nation's financial institutions and dozens of national  and regional retailers as a key battlefield in America's escalating credit card  marketing war.  </P> <P> The reason, according to card marketing specialists, is that the county has a  heavy concentration of households with large incomes and big debt loads -- just  the kind of households that credit card purveyors lust after.  </P> <P> Steve Kollar knows all about it.  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa resident, director of investment services for Rare Coin  Investments in Newport Beach, said he receives an average of one bank credit  card mailer a week, most from out-of-state banks pitching their Visa and  MasterCard accounts.  </P> <P> "They must really target this area," he said. "When we lived in the Midwest, we  never got this much junk mail."  </P> <P> Nationally, the median family income was $29,000 last year. In Orange County,  it was $45,000 and it is expected to hit $49,000 this year.  </P> <P> "And study after study has shown that as income goes up, expectations rise. And  with increased expectations comes increased use of credit to realize them,"  said Stephen M. Szekely, a vice president of Payment Systems Inc., a Tampa,  Fla., consumer financial services research firm.  </P> <P> In other words, keeping up with the Joneses is an expensive proposition in  Orange County, and credit card marketers know that a lot of the life style the  county is famous for is supported by charge accounts.  </P> <P> Some credit industry observers see danger signs in the intensifying marketing  efforts, however.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are succumbing to the temptation of getting additional cards  and end up in many cases with credit limits that are far beyond their ability  to handle," said Larry Schwartz, co-director of Credit Card Bureau, a Boynton  Beach, Fla., firm specializing in prevention of credit card theft and fraud.  </P> <P> The 401 regional Consumer Credit Counselors offices of the nonprofit National  Foundation for Consumer Credit Inc. last year worked with more than 211,500  people who needed help in paying off their credit card debts and other  unsecured consumer loans.  </P> <P> The average consumer credit debt load of those coming into the regional centers  was $10,000.  </P> <P> In Orange County, however, it was about $17,500, a clear indication that county  residents are not only more affluent but also that they have a greater affinity  for credit.  </P> <P> American Banker, the banking industry's daily journal, estimates that  nationwide, more than 1 billion solicitations for bank credit card applications  were mailed to consumers in 1988.  </P> <P> Direct mail pitches for credit cards usually result in about one new account  for every 100 letters sent, which means that those 1 billion mailings probably  brought 10 million new customers to the various banks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Age, Income Groups  </P> <P> And from all available evidence, a disproportionate number of the solicitations  were sent to people with Orange County addresses.  </P> <P> Payment Systems, the consumer research firm, has found that credit card  marketing efforts tend to target households where the annual income is $15,000  or more and the potential card customer is between 25 and 44.  </P> <P> "That's because the 25 to 44 age group generally borrow the most and keep  outstanding balances on their credit cards longer," Szekely said.  </P> <P> A segment of the 45-and-over age group -- those with annual household incomes  above $35,000 -- is also frequently targeted, mainly for the so-called premium,  or "gold," cards, he said.  </P> <P> And the number of addresses that fit into one of those two target groups  represents a big slice of the approximately 830,000 households in Orange  County.  </P> <P> A composite of Orange County statistics drawn from Census Bureau data and  information from credit card marketing specialists shows that about 60% of  county households are within the target age groups, compared to about 51% for  the nation as a whole. And about 80% of the county's households are believed to  earn more than $15,000 a year, compared to about 70% nationally.  </P> <P> More important to credit card marketers, the county, as its high median income  indicates, has far more households earning $35,000 or more than just about any  other place in the nation.  </P> <P> "The high income and the high incidence of home ownership increases the chances  that when a national data bank is tapped for a direct mailing campaign, Orange  County will come out with a higher hit rate than most other areas," said Greg  Landenburg, vice president of bank card products for Security Pacific National  Bank in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Orange County residents also tend to apply for more new cards than consumers  elsewhere, said Gregory Bjorndahl, managing partner of the West Coast Group, an  Irvine marketing firm specializing in credit card use patterns.  </P> <P> "From conversations with large credit card issuers, I know this is an appealing  area for them, for reasons that are very much the trends in the industry," he  said.  </P> <P> The card marketing blitz began with the advent of annual fees and the loosening  of banking and interest restrictions in the late 1970s by states such as  Delaware and South Dakota.  </P> <P> Most of the solicitations arrive in the mail, sent from the dozen or so  out-of-state banks that have made mass marketing of credit cards a  multibillion-dollar business.  </P> <P> "The out-of-state banks are targeting California much more than the in-state  banks," Bjorndahl said.  </P> <P> MNC Financial Inc. of Baltimore, parent of Maryland Bank, runs one of the most  aggressive credit card marketing programs in the country through a separate  division based in Delaware. Over the past 5 years, MNC has become the nation's  fifth-largest credit card issuer, with about 3.4 million accounts with $4  billion in outstanding debt.  </P> <P> And California -- particularly Orange and Los Angeles counties and the San  Francisco Bay Area -- has become the bank's biggest market.  </P> <P> "We have more card customers in California -- 527,000 of them -- than even in  our own back yard here in Maryland," said David Spilman, vice president and  treasurer of MNC.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High Net Earnings  </P> <P> The reason banking companies such as MNC have plunged so heavily into credit  card marketing is simple: It can be extremely profitable if done on a big  enough scale with enough controls to keep losses down.  </P> <P> MNC's credit card operation, which involves only about 17% of the company's  9,000 workers, accounted for nearly 33% of the company's $50-million profit in  1987, Spilman said.  </P> <P> In 1986, the latest year for which industrywide figures are available, the bank  card issuing and servicing industry had net earnings of $3.9 billion, according  to Payment Systems, the Florida research firm.  </P> <P> Cardholders that year paid more than $13 billion in interest on about $84.5  billion in total bank card debt. They also paid $3.2 billion in annual fees,  which many card issuers began charging about a decade ago.  </P> <P> It is those annual fees -- which can run from $6 to $65 or more -- that bring  in the profits, said Elgie Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders of America, a  Washington-based lobbying and consumer education group for people with bank  credit cards.  </P> <P> For example, Citibank, the New York banking giant, had about 20 million  accounts at the end of 1988; 3.5 million of those were opened last year. Most  were the result of Citibank's massive direct mail campaigns, said William  Ahearn, vice president of the Citibank individual banking division.  </P> <P> With the annual fee on the basic Citibank Visa or MasterCard running about $20,  those new accounts added $70 million to the bank's revenue even before  cardholders incurred interest charges on any unpaid balances.  </P> <P> When the credit card marketing competition began nearly a decade ago, issuers  worked hard to sell consumers on the idea that if one major credit card was  good, three or four were even better.  </P> <P> That no longer is the message behind credit card solicitations. Many issuers  now seem to want you to carry and use only their products.  </P> <P> But many Americans find that credit cards, like potato chips, are more  satisfying by the handful.  </P> <P> In a study done in the middle of last year, West Coast Group found that  Californians who own credit cards carry an average of 9 -- the national average  is 8 -- and that 43% of the card-carrying Californians wanted more.  </P> <P> Nationally, about 71% of all households possess at least one bank credit card.  The figure for California is 87%, according to Payment Systems.  </P> <P> A Santa Ana restaurateur who asked not to be identified said he has a total of  60 credit cards that give him the ability to draw as much as $180,000 in cash  advances should he use all the available credit at one time.  </P> <P> He said he uses the credit to raise smaller sums to help cover short-term cash  needs for his outside investments.  </P> <P> A more typical user is Kollar, the investment director for the rare-coin  dealer. He carries MasterCards from four banks, Visa cards from two banks and  an American Express card.  </P> <P> Kollar said the reason for his getting most of the cards was that he used to  travel on business nearly every weekend and needed the extensive credit to  cover his travel costs until he was reimbursed.  </P> <P> Credit card marketers argue that the marketing push is generally harmless, that  consumers are not forced to apply for the cards and that they can just toss the  mailers out. The credo seems to be that people, not credit cards, cause debt.  </P> <P> But critics argue that the constant barrage of direct-mail solicitations  provides a temptation that some may find too powerful to resist.  </P> <P> "These mailings by banks are totally uncontrolled," said Schwartz, the Florida  credit card theft and fraud prevention expert.  </P> <P> "They have all this access to demographics and names of people across the  nation, and they mail out hundreds of millions of applications and the average  number of cards has gone up to about eight per person," he said.  </P> <P> That means there are about 880 million credit cards out there, Schwartz said,  with total purchasing power of $2.75 trillion or about 2 1/2 times the amount  of currency in circulation.  </P> <P> A LOOK AT CREDIT CARD USERS IN THE STATE  </P> <P> Households in Los Angeles and Orange counties consider bank automated teller  machine cards more important than credit cards, according to a survey by West  Coast Group.

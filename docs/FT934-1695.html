			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Arts: The Arts Council tries to keep things sweet England's arts companies discovered yesterday how much subsidy they will receive from the Arts Council in 1994-95 - and for most of them the news was better than anticipated. Despite receiving a cut of Pounds 3.2m, or 1.7 per cent, in its grant from the government, the council, with its usual sleight of hand, has given most of its clients same again funding next year. So Covent Garden (which still takes in Birmingham Royal Ballet) is frozen at Pounds 19.5m; the ENO at Pounds 11.65m; the National Theatre at Pounds 11.16m; and the RSC at Pounds 8.47m. Since all these companies must have been planning on a small reduction in grant they should be marginally relieved. It is the same across the board. The South Bank Centre gets Pounds 13.4m; English National Ballet Pounds 3.6m; Manchester Royal Exchange Pounds 1.3m; Opera North, Pounds 3.8m, and on and on. There are a few rogue payments. Following through its declared, and unpopular, aim of boosting contemporary dance and the visual arts, the council has given Dance Umbrella a 20 per cent uplift to Pounds 175,000; Rambert gets 35 per cent more at Pounds 1.2m; and Shobana Jeyasingh, flush with Pounds 100,000 as the Prudential Awards winner, enjoys 34 per cent more from the council at Pounds 170,000. Michael Clark receives his first Pounds 100,000. In the visual arts, the Whitechapel has a 6.8 per cent improvement to Pounds 471,000; the Photographers Gallery almost a 13 per cent uplift at Pounds 352,000; and the Serpentine, which is threatened with an outrageous increase in its rent from the Royal Parks, is bolstered with almost 9 per cent more, at Pounds 248,000. There is the odd casualty: principally Glyndebourne Touring, and the Regional Arts Boards, which fund thousands of small arts groups, are suffering a reduction in grants of up to 4.5 per cent. But the council has done its bit to keep the arts going through 1994 when falling box office income, reduced sponsorship and squeezed local authority funding will make survival difficult. The council found the money by cutting Pounds 2m from its Pounds 14m budget for new projects and schemes, especially in the theatre. This is bad news for touring drama companies, many of which might now close. As secretary general Anthony Everitt said yesterday, 'the aim is to protect the basic infra-structure of arts organisations throughout the country'. By this clever package the council has gone a little way towards recovering some of the massive loss of face and confidence it suffered through its mishandling of the funding of the London orchestras. On Wednesday it confirmed that all four would receive virtually identical grants next year - a complete climbdown from its aim to axe two and create two super orchestras.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Arts: Perfect marriage of aesthetics - Glyndebourne There was never much doubt about it, but now we know: Glyndebourne's new, round opera house is a magnificent success. From the start Michael and Patty Hopkins designs looked full of promise, and they have been beautifully realised. Externally, the building fits into its context without a cross glance or a jar - within a few years many visitors will be surprised to hear that things used to be different. Cunningly, it has been built down into the hill, so as not to protrude too much above the old surroundings. There is still height enough to accommodate external balconies, from which to admire the Sussex view. I had wondered whether the increased numbers might make the statutory picnicking a bit of a scrum, but no: new garden-room has been provided, and the grounds felt no more crowded than before. And the interior, a dream of blond wood, exceeds all expectations. Not only is it comfortable (that, at least, we were counting on), but with its rising concentric tiers it looks intimately crowded, just as a proper theatre should. Nobody seems distanced from the stage, even on the uppermost tier. Excellently chosen lighting achieves a jewel-box effect - charming, not twee, since there is no decorator's folderol in the house. Friendly simplicity is the keynote; even the 'boxes' on either side of each tier are open and informal. Best of all, the acoustic offers everything one had hoped for. Gone is the dry, boxy sound of the old auditorium; now the orchestra rings clear and uncramped, in far better balanced perspective, and singers' voices bloom in the new space. Almost inevitably, Glyndebourne chose Le nozze di Figaro to inaugurate the house. The old Peter Hall production was to have been revived, but the sets were lost in a fire two years ago. John Gunter has re-done them, thriftily: the garden act is planted now with nothing but giant stalks of rhubarb, among which the clandestine comings and goings become a public charade. Hall's original staging was unique in making the dodgy action both clear and (more or less) believable. Clarity, at least, remains a great virtue of the 'newly mounted production' by Stephen Medcalf. Everything that matters is there, and it doesn't subject its cast to any awkward tricks or gimmicks. Since Bernard Haitink is the conductor, with the London Philharmonic, Mozart's score is rendered with lively faithfulness. I thought Haitink had taken particular care to brighten the accompaniments for the extraneous arias - Marcellina's and Don Basilio's - in the garden act, though they will never really justify themselves. (Nice for the Marcellina and the Basilio, who otherwise get no solos; but they do nothing to advance the action in the run-up to the finale of a longish opera.) It is Figaro and his Susanna who dominate the proceedings here: personable Gerald Finley and Alison Hagley, who have the further advantage of distinct individual timbres and styles. The naughty Count is Andreas Schmidt, elegant but slightly dry-voiced; his Countess, Renee Fleming, wielded her big soprano with increasing grace as the opera developed. Old Bartolo is Manfred Rohrl, who gives him an old-fashioned gentility and reserve: a collector of first editions, probably. Wendy Hillhouse cuts a nicely ample figure as Marcellina. Robert Tear's Basilio - a piece of power-casting, that] - brims with character, though in ensembles his penchant for reaching up slowly to high notes sometimes takes the edge off the rhythm. As Cherubino, Marie-Ange Todorovitch is deliciously candid and plausible. There is a sexy young Barbarina from Susan Gritton, and Donald Adams makes her uncle Antonio definitively crumbly and grumbly. For the lawyer Don Curzio, John Graham-Hall imitates the original Michael Storace stuttering-trick (Mozart was initially doubtful about it, but Storace persuaded him). All in all, it is an unspectacularly happy, rewarding evening: just what we love Glyndebourne for, and even more now in its splendid new house. Sponsored by NM Rothschild &amp; Sons Ltd, Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque. In repertory until July 15.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN PLAYOFF HOPES DIM AFTER 71-67 LOSS TO CCAA FOE CHAPMAN  </P> <P> There is still a pulse, albeit a faint one.  </P> <P> Using a couple of baseball terms, let's put it this way: There are two out in  the ninth inning and two strikes on the Cal State Northridge basketball team.  It needs a grand slam to win.  </P> <P> The kicker is that there's nobody on -- figuratively and literally.  </P> <P> Northridge likely will need victories in its last three California Collegiate  Athletic Assn. games if it hopes to reach the playoffs. And considering  conference co-leaders Cal State Dominguez Hills and UC Riverside, are among  those remaining on the schedule, it doesn't look good for the Matadors.  </P> <P> Chapman College pushed Northridge a little closer to oblivion by defeating the  Matadors, 71-67, Thursday night at the Hutton Sports Center in Orange.  </P> <P> Chapman and CSUN were tied for fourth with Cal Poly San Luis Obispo coming into  the game; only four teams make the CCAA's postseason playoff tournament.  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo also lost, 85-66, to UC Riverside on Thursday, leaving Chapman  alone in fourth.  </P> <P> Even if CSUN pulls back into a tie with the Panthers by season's end, Chapman  is the team that will qualify for the playoffs.  </P> <P> The first tiebreaker in the league playoff format is head-to-head competition.  Chapman is 2-0 against CSUN, having defeated the Matadors, 79-74, three weeks  ago.  </P> <P> Chapman, one of only two teams in the CCAA shooting better than 50% as a team,  was even better than that against Northridge.  </P> <P> The Panthers shot 56% as five players reached double figures in scoring.  </P> <P> "We knew we needed a total team effort tonight," said Russ Ortega, who scored a  game-high 17 points. "This was a crucial win for us."  </P> <P> Still, Coach Pete Cassidy was quick to point out that Northridge -- 14-10  overall, 5-6 in the CCAA -- qualified for the tournament with a 7-7 record last  season.  </P> <P> Down by seven with two minutes left, Northridge scored four consecutive times  down the floor, cutting the Panthers' lead to 69-67 when Darren Matsubara made  two free throws with one minute left. But in that last minute, CSUN fell victim  to -- of all things -- its own hustle.  </P> <P> With 17 seconds left -- and only a tick or two on the 45-second shot clock --  Northridge forced a jump ball. Unfortunately for the Matadors, the possession  marker favored Chapman. The 45-second clock then was reset -- actually turned  off -- and the Panthers had no need to attempt another shot.  </P> <P> Forced to foul, CSUN's Karl Becker hacked Mike Minier, who made both ends of a  one-and-one situation with 16 seconds remaining to give Chapman a more  comfortable four-point lead.  </P> <P> Matsubara led Northridge with 13 points and Alan Fraser added 12. Derrick  Gathers added 10 points and Kendell McDaniels had nine points and 10 rebounds.  </P></p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Domino shares rise 22p as profit target reached DOMINO PRINTING Sciences, the Cambridge-based manufacturer and distributor of industrial ink-jet printers, has slightly exceeded the profits forecast made in September with the Pounds 15.5m rights issue. It increased pre-tax profits by 48 per cent to Pounds 9m (Pounds 6.09m) in the year to October 31 on turnover up 31 per cent to Pounds 60.4m. The shares closed 22p higher at 423p. Domino benefited from changes in EC directives for food retailing, which led to increased demand for products. There was a full contribution from subsidiary operations in France and Spain. Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, said: 'We are especially pleased with our performance in France, where our subsidiary increased sales of machines by 90 per cent.' Sales of new machines were particularly encouraging, with 40 per cent more installations than the previous year. Average selling prices reduced slightly, reflecting increased distributor business and discounts for larger orders. This expansion in machines installed would be reflected in higher ink sales. The group had net cash of Pounds 1.8m which, when coupled with proceeds from the 98 per cent subscribed cash call, enabled it to start the year with cash balances of more than Pounds 17m. Domino planned to use the cash for further expansion in its core ink-jet operations and related areas. During the year sales had grown by 19 per cent in Europe (excluding France and Spain); by 21 per cent in the Americas; and by 35 per cent in the rest of the world. Mr Dennis said results for the first three months of the new financial year showed that growth was continuing, but at a lower level in Europe, as indicated in the rights issue document. Earnings per share rose by 40 per cent to 28.83p (20.54p). A final dividend of 4.15p gives a total for the year of 6.25p (5.2p).</p>

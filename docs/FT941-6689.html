			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Last pit service centre to close British Coal yesterday announced the closure of its last mine service centre, Tursdale in County Durham, with the loss of 205 jobs. The announcement was just days after the news that Bestwood mine workshops in Nottinghamshire, where 262 men work, are also to close. In future British Coal's remaining 17 collieries will buy in maintenance and repair services for pit machinery and equipment. Tursdale workers will vote today on the move. Yesterday workers at Bestwood voted to accept the closure.</p>

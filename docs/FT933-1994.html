			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Mexico sells state insurer stake THE Mexican government has sold 51 per cent of the state-owned insurance company Aseguradora Mexicana (Asemex) to Grupo Mexival-Banpas for 1.807bn pesos (Dollars 582m). Asemex is Mexico's fourth-largest insurer, with assets of 4.219bn pesos. It is the country's leading casualty company, and insures federal government entities, such as Petroleos Mexicanos, against damages. It also insures some of the country's leading companies. In the eight months to August, it reported profits of 82.8m pesos. The purchase turns Mexival-Banpas into Mexico's fourth-largest financial group by assets. Banpas, a medium-sized Mexican bank, was itself bought from the government by the brokerage Mexival for 544.9m pesos in June 1991. The finance ministry said Mexival-Banpas would incorporate Asemex into its financial group, and aim to penetrate the life assurance market. It would also seek to sell an equity stake to one or two foreign insurance companies. With inflation in Mexico now under control, several foreign insurance groups have formed alliances with Mexican insurers. Commercial Union of the UK, Aetna and New York Life Insurance Company of the US, and Italy's Asicurazoni Generali have acquired large minority stakes in Mexican insurers.</p>

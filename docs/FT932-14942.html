			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Soaring dollar hopes come down to earth: Why the currency has failed to live up to forex dealers' expectations MANY FOREIGN exchange dealers predicted that this would be the year of the soaring dollar. But, nearly four months into 1993, investors in the US currency are still waiting for it to make its next big move upwards. Last September, the dollar hit a historic low of 1.3860 against the D-Mark, the world's second most traded currency. In the next four months, it rose some 29 pfennigs against the German currency, boosted by the election of President Bill Clinton and a sharp upturn in the US economy. But New Year predictions that the dollar would break through the DM1.70 level by April have been dashed. Yesterday, it was trading at around DM1.5970, some two pfennigs below its level at the start of January - and some people in the currency market are predicting that it will go even lower. 'The dollar is at an interesting turning point,' says Mr Avinash Persaud, an economist at UBS in London. 'At these levels, fund managers are comfortable holding dollars. But if the currency were to slip further from here, we could see a large scale shedding of their dollar positions.' The dollar has been capped because short-term interest rates in the US remain nearly 5 percentage points below those in Germany, providing a smaller return for investors in the US currency. This makes it expensive for investors to hold dollars for long. Several factors have ensured that this differential has remained so wide. Growth in the US economy was more sluggish than expected in the first quarter of this year. Currency investors bought dollars in large quantities at the start of the year following US gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter of 1992 at an annualised 4.7 per cent. The comparable figure for the first quarter of this year is expected to be down to 3 per cent. This slowdown in growth suggests that the Federal Reserve will refrain from raising interest rates in the near term. The Bundesbank's cuts in official interest rates have been more modest than expected. Germany's discount rate has been reduced by 75 basis points so far this year. But the central bank has cut rates in 'salami-sized slices' rather than introducing the aggressive easing of policy that had been foreseen. The yen, the third most traded currency in the world, has risen to historic highs against the dollar in recent weeks amid speculation that Japanese leaders would promote a strong yen to reduce the country's huge trade surplus with the US. The new Japanese fiscal package of Y13,200bn announced this week has led to a slight strengthening of the dollar in recent days, however, in the belief that the package will help to reduce Japan's trade surplus. There is speculation that the Bundesbank is selling dollars on the foreign exchange market as a means of rebalancing its reserves. The Bundesbank acquired an estimated Dollars 20bn in foreign currencies during last autumn's crisis in the exchange rate mechanism. These funds are thought to be being sold back to the market, supporting the D-Mark. Views differ sharply over whether the US currency will go up or down from here. Mr Persaud of UBS believes the dollar has bottomed out at its current level and that it will be at around DM1.63 by the end of the month. He believes US growth will look increasingly favourable compared to that of Germany. He also thinks that the Bundesbank has proved that it will cut rates for domestic reasons, and that this is a good augury for more policy easing. However, Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, believes there is some chance that the dollar could move as low as DM1.30. He points to 'disturbingly weak' US money supply growth and poor consumer confidence figures as signs that the economic slowdown is set to continue. He also believes that the current holding of Dollars 500bn of reserves by the world's central banks is far more than is justified by the economic performance of the US; and that a reaffirmation of French and German central banking ties in Europe could lead to greater cross-holdings of francs and D-Marks by the Bundesbank and the Bank of France. 'In these circumstances, there would be little point in major central banks continuing to have such large holdings of US dollars,' he said.</p>

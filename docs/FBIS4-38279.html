			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive review  of all items in the 24 June issue of the Arabic-language  newspaper Cairo AL-SHA'B that pertain to political Islamic  issues.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Lawyers Escalate Anti-Government Protests    2. Prominent Journalist Urges Better Relations with Iran    3. Document Shows West Scheming To Reduce Muslim  Population    4. Writers View Islamists' Ability To Govern    5. Omani Authorities Arrest Islamists    6. Washington Drafts Plans Against Algeria's Islamists    7. Turkish Islamic Party Said Winning More Support  <H5>  LAWYERS ESCALATE ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTS </H5>   An 800-word report by Khalid Yunus on pages 1 and 7 deals  with the development of the crisis between the Lawyers  Association [LA] and the government. The report says  'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad, the chief of the LA Cairo branch, who  has been staging a hunger strike to support demands for the  release of the detained lawyers and the holding of an inquiry  into the death of Islamist lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani while in  police custody, has been taken to the hospital after a serious  deterioration in his health. The Egyptian Organization for  Human Rights reportedly issued a "press release" calling on the  Egyptian Government to meet Muhammad's lawful demands to save  his life. The report says that scores of lawyers began a sit-in  in the LA headquarters in solidarity with Muhammad, and that  some of them joined in the hunger strike.    --A related unattributed 150-word report on pages 1 and 7  says the LA branch in Ismailia decided to hold a general  congress Thursday, 30 June, as part of the lawyers' activities  against the detention of their colleagues and the government's  failure to "bring the officers responsible for the death of  lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani to trial."    --An 80-word boxed announcement extending over two long  columns on page 1 and signed by LA Doyen Ahmad al-Khawajah and  LA Secretary General Ahmad Sayf al-Islam says that the LA  Council decided at a 19 June meeting that: 1. Lawyers shall  not attend two prosecution sessions on 28 and 29 June to renew  the detention order of the lawyers. 2. Lawyers shall stage a  general strike on 28 and 29 June "to protest the continuing  aggression against lawyers and the legal profession." The  announcement says disciplinary measures will be taken against  violators of the two decisions.  <H5>  PROMINENT JOURNALIST URGES BETTER RELATIONS WITH IRAN </H5>   A 600-word front page report by Ashraf Khalil cites  well-known Egyptian journalist Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal as  calling for improving relations with Iran and healing the rift  between the two major regional powers. Haykal reportedly told a  Cairo seminar on Iranian-Arab relations that the Egyptian  leadership is largely to blame for the bad relations between  Cairo and Tehran. He said no one has produced a bit of evidence  that Iran supports terrorist acts in Egypt. "I believe that  direct action in Egypt is against Iran's interests, and I  believe that the Islamists in Egypt -- and they are Sunnis --  are far from being influenced by the [Shiite] Iranian  authorities," Haykal is quoted as saying.  <H5>  DOCUMENT SHOWS WEST SCHEMING TO REDUCE MUSLIM POPULATION </H5>   An approximately 2,500-word report by 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad  on page 3 discusses "a serious document" obtained by the paper  on U.S. and Western schemes to reduce population growth in the  Islamic world and thus weaken the Islamic nation. The document,  headlined "International Campaign to Destroy Islam," reportedly  "reveals new aggression by the U.S. AID against the Muslim  countries." It recounts the U.S. agency's birth-control efforts  and programs in countries like Nigeria, Niger, Egypt, and  Jordan. It says the agency depends on local religious leaders,  secular women activists, and the private Future Group of the  United States to implement these programs. The document says  the plans to reduce the population of the Muslim world, which  are given appealing names like "birth control" and "time  intervals between births," are facing major difficulties thanks  to Islamic opposition, which has largely managed to convince  Muslims that birth control is a sin. The document, whose source  is not given, discusses the strategy of the United States and  the NATO alliance to deal with the population growth in the  Islamic countries. It reportedly says that "the rising  population growth rate in the Islamic world, at a time when the  Western countries and the United States are recording low  population growth rates, will necessarily lead to a war against  the Muslims--a war in which NATO will use its influence, power,  and intelligence resources to contain the growing threat of  Islam." The document says all indications are that the Islamic  countries will grow more powerful in the future and the  international balance of power will change in the next 20 years  as a result of the growing population rates. Therefore, "the  United States and NATO should do their utmost to curb the  population growth in the Islamic world and control its natural  resources," the document concludes.   <H5>    WRITERS VIEW ISLAMISTS' ABILITY TO GOVERN </H5>   AL-SHA'B carries on page 9 an approximately 2,000-word  article by Egyptian writer Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal and a  1,500-word "comment" on the article, signed with the initials  M.A.H., presumably the newspaper's Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad  Husayn. Haykal's article, which mainly discusses the Islamic  experience in Algeria and its repercussions on the Muslim world,  first appeared in the Japanese newspaper YOMIURI SHIMBUN "some  time ago" according to the introduction. In his article, Haykal  criticizes the Algerian Government and Army for obstructing the  Islamists' attempt to reach power through democratic elections.  He notes that the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria, like the  other political Islam movements in the Muslim world, lack  specific programs and plans that can help them to effectively  solve the problems of the people once they reach power. The  Islamic movements, Haykal adds, lack in the leading cadres to  implement their political ideas. Haykal also notes traditional  U.S and Arab Gulf support for the Islamic movements against  secular nationalist forces.    In his commentary, Husayn says that in the absence of real  democracy, where the road to government is open to any political  force, the opposition can only have general plans and ideas, not  specific programs and detailed institutions. He maintains that  the Islamic movement, in its general inclinations and broad  vision, offers a clearer and more defined program than that  offered in the past by the pan-Arab, leftist, and liberal forces  when they were in the center of opposition. He notes that all  political groups come to power with general principles and  inclinations that may be amended and adjusted as practical  experience dictates. He says: "It is true that the Islamic  creed does not commit Muslim to certain constitutional  establishments, an economic theory, or a foreign policy, but it  offers terms of reference to all these -- that is, general  constitutional principles. Islam has general principles  governing relations between the ruler and the ruled, and general  rules and principles governing economic life." He also notes  general principles that define the relations between the Islamic  state and the foreign world. Concerning the lack of Islamic  leading cadres, Husayn says that even if this is true, it does  not mean a Muslim government will fail. The scarcity of  leaders, he argues, is a traditional problem that has faced  every new movement seeking radical change in society, but there  are short-term and long-term solutions. Regarding the role of  the United States and the traditional Arab governments in the  Islamic revival, Husayn says those parties tried to use the  Islamic movements in the past, when the pan-Arab movement was  the source of revolutionary anger. "Now however, the  revolutionary awakening comes from the Islamic movements  themselves, and this is problem number one for U.S. policy."  Husayn concludes that "the Islamic awakening is a return to the  nation's identity," not a reaction to frustration or a response  to foreign support.  <H5>  OMANI AUTHORITIES ARREST ISLAMISTS </H5>   An "exclusive" unattributed 120-word report on page 7 says  that the Omani authorities, in an unprecedented move, have  arrested 70 Islamists of Omani, Sudanese, and Jordanian  nationalities and closed a number of Islamic libraries in that  country. Among the detainees, the report says, is Muhammad  Bin-Ahmad al-Ghazali, undersecretary of the Ministry of  Agriculture and Fishery; his two brothers; a judge; and an Air  Force officer. Sudanese and Jordanian university professors  were also arrested, according to the report.  <H5>  WASHINGTON PREPARES PLANS AGAINST ALGERIA'S ISLAMISTS </H5>   An unattributed 150-word report on page 7 claims that the  United States "has prepared a new security plan to confront the  Islamists in Algeria." The report cites information that the  recent meeting between the Algerian foreign minister and U.S.  National Security Adviser Anthony Lake dealt with "new American  ideas to combat the Islamic phenomenon in Algeria." According  to the information, the United States is asking that the U.S.  intelligence agencies and the National Security Council be given  a major role in security planning for Algeria. The United  States reportedly expressed readiness to support the Algerian  Government forces, but wanted the Army to get rid of the  elements that support religious activity.  <H5>  TURKISH ISLAMIC PARTY SAID WINNING MORE SUPPORT </H5>   In an approximately 3,500-word report from Istanbul, Chief  Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn discusses from an Islamic perspective  the Turkish developments and challenges, such as the Kurdish  problem and the economic crisis. He concludes that "Turkey is  at a decisive crossroads. Its secular option and its link with  the Western European camp have reached, or almost reached, a  dead end." He says the government can no longer tackle the  major challenges of territorial unity, economic crisis, and the  lost dignity. All this, he contends, is increasingly helping  the Islamic Welfare Party, which may win twice as many seats in  the 1996 elections as it won in this year's election.</p>

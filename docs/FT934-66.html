			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Magical and unforgettable Sir, Max Loppert ('Entranced by the voice of an angel', December 24) is not alone in his childhood memory of the young Victoria de los Angeles in Johannesburg 38 years ago. Her appearances were a musical landmark for South Africans of all ages, and none who attended any of those magical evenings has forgotten the experience.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Apr 11 SAPA -- South Africa's foreign  investment unit, the financial rand, plunged to its worst level  and the commercial rand followed suit in a bruising day's trade  Monday [11 April]. The finrand, an indicator of foreign  confidence in the country, rapidly slid to R[Rand]5.7150 to the  U.S. dollar, crashing 77 cents or 16 per cent from its  pre-week-end closing level of R4.9200.    Traders said international investors took an extremely  gloomy  view of the failed summit between the country's political  leaders which ended late Friday. "All hell broke loose. Just as  we thought it was finding its bottom, it fell further," a trader  lamented.    "In the run up to the elections, the finrand is going to  head  lower. Particularly, the situation in Natal seems to prevent  free voting and in fact it's likely to be a bloody  confrontation."    The finrand's previous worst level was recorded in August  1986 when it breached R5.5500 to the greenback after the then  President P.W. Botha's security crack-down and failure to  embrace reform.    Another trader said the bleak statements issued by President  F.W. de Klerk, African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela,  Inkatha chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and King Goodwill Zwelethini  after the Friday summit "initially got the ball rolling with  offshore investors taking an extremely bearish view of the  outcome of the meeting".    Rumours sprung up on the currency market of a large  disinvestment order, and coupled with a reluctance by market  participants to be short of dollars pummelled the investment  unit even lower, dealers noted.    The bearish sentiment spilled over into the commercial rand  market as importers rushed to buy foreign currency requirements  in anticipation of the rand weakening further.    The rand plunged to a record low of R3.6148 before regaining  some composure to close at R3.5928 from Friday's R3.5525 close.    The local unit was not helped by a stronger U.S. dollar on  world markets, as it added to the uncertain waters the SA  economy would wade through before April 26-28 -- the election  date.    A dealer said that there had been no sign of Reserve Bank  intervention in either the commercial or financial rand.    Reserve figures released ahead of the week-end indicated the  bank had little resources to continue to prop up the rand.    Analysts said the foreign exchange reserve figures showed  the  Reserve Bank in fact had to borrow on its foreign "overdrafts".</p>

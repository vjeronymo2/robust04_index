			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Observer: Black stuff Moscow-style private enterprise arrived with a huge Russian contingent at the Farnborough airshow this week. At the foot of a ladder leading to the cockpit of a Sukhoi fighter aircraft stood a jolly round man dressed in a denim jacket, jeans and white training shoes. 'Pleeese. Fife pounds' were his only words of English and constituted an invitation and unofficial fee to see inside the cockpit of the beast. Observer naturally resisted the arrival of a black market in plane spotting. Only a young woman in a short skirt took up the offer and was allowed through gratis.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Spectre of falling Balkan dominoes haunts Europe: Serbia's neighbours fear war could spill over into the rest of the region and beyond WHEN Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US assistant secretary of state, made a whistle-stop tour to Moscow and the Balkans last month, one thing was uppermost in his mind. He wanted to make sure that Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and Russia would back any sanctions that the United Nations was soon to impose on Serbia, and its tiny ally Montenegro. All these countries have now come out in support of the sanctions, not only in the belief that relations with the US would strengthen as a result. They fear civil war may engulf Serbia and want some guarantees that the US and the international community will prevent it from spilling over into the entire Balkan region. US diplomats have said they cannot provide such guarantees. The fear of civil war in Serbia is now openly discussed among all the opposition parties in Belgrade. Such a war could involve supporters of the ultra-nationalist, armed Serbian Radical party, led by Mr Vojislav Seselj, who regard Serbia's nationalist president Slobodan Milosevic as having reneged on his commitment to create a Greater Serbia. It could also involve humiliated members of the Yugoslav army, thousands of whom have been forced by UN agreements - to which Mr Milosevic was a party - to withdraw to Serbia from the republics of Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia. A Serbian civil war could also be sparked off by rising social discontent as sanctions, which are already biting, further erode living standards. Above all, unrest could be triggered in the Serbian-controlled southern province of Kosovo, where the 2m-strong ethnic Albanian population, denied any rights since 1990, when Belgrade forcibly incorporated the province into Serbia, could be provoked into rebelling. Western diplomats believe it would be difficult to contain a war in Serbia. If fighting broke out in Kosovo, neighbouring Albania could become involved through helping the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. This would play into the hands of Serb extreme nationalists, who have always argued that Albania harboured territorial ambitions there. The ethnic Albanians in neighbouring Macedonia, who make up 20 per cent of the population, might be tempted to lend support to Kosovo. This would cause instability in the small, independent but still unrecognised republic because nationalists in Bulgaria, and Greece, could be tempted to revive historical claims on Macedonia. 'That is why the European Community should have recognised Macedonia last January,' a western diplomat said. 'The longer we put it off, the greater the chance of unrest in Macedonia, and in the region.' A war in Serbia would also mean that the 50,000-strong Moslem population in the Sandzak, south-west of Serbia, might also attempt to rebel against Belgrade's proxy Montenegrin reservists in the region. 'We still must not ignore the impact of what Turkey and the other Moslem states in the Middle East would do. They are disgusted and shocked by the way in which the Moslems in Bosnia have been slaughtered by Serb irregulars,' another diplomat said. Further north, in the Serbian-controlled province of Vojvodina, the 350,000-strong ethnic Hungarian minority is already campaigning for more ethnic and cultural rights in the region. A war in Serbia could radicalise them even further, raising the prospect of unrest on Hungary's borders. Moreover, UN officials and western diplomats believe a civil war in Serbia could allow Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to start a new offensive in Slavonia, in eastern Croatia, where UN peace-keeping forces are deployed. Mr Jozsef Antall, Hungarian prime minister, fears that a civil war in Serbia, and recent developments in Czechoslovakia, could quickly open up the whole question of central Europe's post-war borders. For instance, Hungarian diplomats believe that if Mr Vaclav Klaus, the new prime minister of Czechoslovakia, finds it impossible to reach an agreement on retaining the Czech and Slovak federation with Mr Vladimir Meciar, head of the nationalist Slovak Democratic party, the status of the 600,000 ethnic Hungarians in an independent Slovakia could be undermined. The Hungarians in Slovakia have always wanted the retention of the federation. For them, the Czech lands act as a counterweight to Slovak nationalists. Without the federation, they believe Slovakia will become more nationalist and intolerant of ethnic rights for themselves, as well as for the small Ruthene and Ukrainian minorities. Already, Mr Miklos Duray, who was elected to the federal parliament and who is head of Co-existence, a party that groups ethnic Hungarians and Poles in Slovakia, is calling for greater autonomy for Hungarians. Hungarian diplomats privately argue that any discrimination towards the ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia would radicalise a wing of Hungary's ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum. 'The last thing Budapest wants is the development of a political situation in Slovakia in which the ethnic Hungarians will be pushed into seeking protection from, or unification with, Hungary,' a Hungarian diplomat said. 'This would play into the hands of the nationalists in Romania, who would then say Budapest wanted to annex Transylvania (where over 2m ethnic Hungarians live). The whole region would be thrown into instability,' he said. 'That is why a war in Serbia would be so dangerous.'  --------------------------- THE BALKANS  --------------------------- Solvenia  --------------------------- Population: 1.9m 90.5% Slovenes  2.9% Croats  2.2% Serbs  4.4% Others  --------------------------- Croatia  --------------------------- Population: 4.7m 75.0% Croats 11.0% Serbs 14.0% Others  --------------------------- Bosnia Hercegovina  --------------------------- Population: 4.4m 39.5% Moslems 32.0% Serbs 18.4% Croats 11.1% Others  --------------------------- Montenegro  --------------------------- Population: 620,000 68.5% Montenegrins 13.4% Moslems  6.5% Albanians 11.6% Other  --------------------------- Macedonia  --------------------------- Population: 2.0m 67.0% Moslems 19.8% Albanians  4.5% Turks  2.3% Serbs  6.4% Others  --------------------------- Serbia  --------------------------- Population: 9.7m 66.8% Serbs 14.0% Albanians  4.2% Hungarians  1.6% Croats 13.4% Others  --------------------------- Vojvodina  --------------------------- Population: 2.0m 54.4% Serbs 18.9% Hungarians  5.4% Croats 21.3% Others  --------------------------- Kosovo  --------------------------- Population: 2.0m  90% Albanians   6% Serbs 1.5% Montenegrins 4.0% Others  ---------------------------  ----------------------------------------------- COUNTRIES WHICH COULD BECOME INVOLVED  ----------------------------------------------- Czechoslovakia  ----------------------------------------------- Population: 15.567m Czechs 9.8m Slovaks 5.01m Hungarians 0.6m Germans 52,000 Poles 73,000 Ukrainians &amp; Russians 56,000  ----------------------------------------------- Romania  ----------------------------------------------- Population: 23.19m Hungarians 2.5m Germans 120,000 Gypsies 2.3m Jews 30,000  ----------------------------------------------- Bulgaria  ----------------------------------------------- Population: 8.99m (1989) 1.2m Moslems mostly Turks  ----------------------------------------------- Albania  ----------------------------------------------- Population: 3.25m 3.117m Albanians 58,758 Greeks 4,697 Macedonians  ----------------------------------------------- Turkey  ----------------------------------------------- Popluation: 50.664m 12m (est) Kurds  ----------------------------------------------- Greece  ----------------------------------------------- Population: 10.139m  -----------------------------------------------</p>

Nigerian Foreign Minister Baba Gana Kingibe, interviewed on  television said the demand was "unacceptable" since the very  reason for the proposed summit was to discuss the dispute over  the Bakassi Peninsula in the oil and fish-rich Gulf of Guinea.    "Of course that (pre-condition) is unacceptable. The precise  point of their meeting is to discuss the Bakassi dispute so the  question of withdrawing from Bakassi before the meeting does not  arise," Kingibe said. He said however that Nigeria was  considering an offer from Cameroonian President Paul Biya to  meet his Nigerian counterpart General Sani Abacha on neutral  ground in Africa.    "As you know, the head of state (Abacha) invited President  Biya to come to Abuja to discuss the Bakassi problem (...) the  invitation was extended without preconditions and the invitation  was accepted without pre-conditions", the minister said.    Kingibe who spent two days in Cameroon for talks last week  said that before he went Biya had said he was willing to attend  talks in Maiduguri, capital of Nigeria's north-eastern Borno  State near the Cameroon border. However Kingibe said that when  he met officials in Yaounde it "became clear that the  Cameroonians were shifting their position regarding  conditionalities before the meeting could take place--that the  gesture of goodwill and good faith should be made by Nigeria and  that we should withdraw our troops from Bakassi before President  Biya could meet with General Abacha in Maiduguri."    The Cameroonians said that the "Cameroonian public opinion  would not understand their president coming to Nigeria when  Nigerian troops are in what they consider to be their  territory." They suggested that "the two heads of state should  meet in a neutral country and we are working towards that,"  Kingibe said.    Biya said Monday in Yaounde that the meeting could be held  in  Cairo since Egypt currently holds the chair of the Organisation  of African Unity. Kingibe said he would travel Wednesday to  Cairo to present Nigeria's position on the dispute to the  Egyptian authorities. [passage omitted]</p>

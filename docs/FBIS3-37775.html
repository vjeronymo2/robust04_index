			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian National Defense Minister Linas </F> Linkevicius by TIESA chief editor Domas Sniukas in Vilnius; date  not given: "Some People Are Serving, While Others Are Trading"]    [Text] [Sniukas] Although the "Partnership for Peace"  document, signed with NATO by President Algirdas Brazauskas on  27 January in Brussels, has already been discussed in public, I  would suggest that we begin our conversation from this issue.    Society, the ruling force, and the opposition accepted this  historical fact favorably but with no joy.    There are, probably, many reasons. Although boasting of this  event as its accomplishment, the opposition did not feel  overjoyed because the official move was made by their political  rivals. In general, the ruling force does not like commotion.  There have also been some doubts: Would it not have been  better to remain neutral? Would not this political move, which  does not yet have any definite security outlines, cost us too  much?    How does the Lithuanian National Defense Ministry assess  this  act?    [Linkevicius] First of all, our ministry rates it as a clear  and definite decision to look for collective security guarantees  in the West. This was no sensation to me or, I think, many  Lithuanian people. Despite the constant intimidations from the  opposition's propagandists that the Lithuanian Democratic Labor  Party [LDDP] is steering Lithuania toward the East, the  country's integration with European economic, political, and,  finally, military structures is consistent, and we were not the  last to make just another step. I will remind everyone that  ours was the first state among the former Soviet Union republics  to be admitted to the European Council. It was also the first  one from which the Russian Army withdrew. We fell short of  being the first in Brussels -- only Romania outstripped us "in  the bend."    Certainly, the signing of the Partnership program does not  yet change anything the next day. We are only drafting the  concept. This is by no means NATO membership with guaranteed  military assistance in the event of aggression.    It is only clear that this agreement will bring us closer to  NATO and Western Europe, and will require a qualitative  transformation of the armed forces.    First of all, our military facilities and ammunition will  have to be revamped according to NATO standards. The same  applies to the training of servicemen and officers and the  functioning of the national defense system.    Not everything is new here to us. We have already  accomplished something, we have had joint military exercises and  so on with the Latvian and Estonian Defense Ministries.    We will also train jointly a Baltic military formation that  could be used under the U.N. colors.    [Sniukas] The president has stated that our partnership with  NATO is a process....    [Linkevicius] This process has already begun. A working  group headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas Januska has been  set up at the government. The Danish and German ambassadors to  NATO have already visited Lithuania. Integration moves are  being discussed operatively. An officers' group is undergoing a  training course in Denmark. British specialists have proposed  serious assistance in military training. Sweden has offered the  Baltic states considerable assistance in forming the  international military corps.    I am not saying that this will cost Lithuania nothing. Yes,  it will! Maybe, very much. However, how could one assess our  security, independence, and our economic and cultural condition  after 50 years of dependence....    A conference of Nordic defense ministers will be held in  Visby in summer which will be attended by Baltic representatives  as well. It is there that the assistance plans will be  specified.    [Sniukas] The Moscow press has reported that quite a number  of jokes are circulating at the Russian General Staff concerning  the Baltic states' armored bicycles, the "corn" [reference to  outdated light planes suitable for spraying corn fields rather  than fighting] air force, and fishing boats armed with  machine-guns. Foreign countries are said to propose trash to the  Baltic states which pay much for it without consideration. This  is how Western "assistance" is presented.    [Linkevicius] Certainly, the military of the country in  which  imperialist feelings are still alive and the nuclear weapons of  which can wipe out if not the entire world then at least its  half, can mock the first steps of our Defense Ministry. I would  not agree, however, that Russian soldiers are morally superior  to Lithuanian ones.    Every beginning is difficult. Mistakes are made, pilferers  take advantage of the situation, and there is much disorder. I  do not doubt, however, that Lithuania will be proud of its Army  shortly, while the latter will be able not only to march but  also will not repeat the mistakes of 1940 which were actually  dictated by politicians.    [Sniukas] Russian jokes are supplemented by the constant  criticism, particularly of the arms purchase, in the Lithuanian  press. The press does not doubt that this was a crime, but it  is uncertain whether anyone will be punished.    [Linkevicius] One should not expect a Solomonic reply. I  think that we should distinguish at least two stages in the arms  purchase.    The first one would relatively include the years 1990-1991  when we did not yet have the international recognition, when  each day and hour were full of dangers, and when the National  Defense Department was only emerging. Let us remember the years  1918-1920 when the Lithuanian Army bought arms from German  soldiers for money, fat, and vodka. The recent situation was  also similar.    Certainly, the deals of the recent months must be legally  and  financially justified.    I can tell the public that the Defense Ministry leadership  will not defend the honor of the regiment. However, it will  observe the presumption of innocence until the court judgment.  We have reached an agreement on job cooperation with the State  Inspection Department and the Prosecutor General's Office. I  think that we will learn the truth not only about the arms  purchase but also about other deals.    [Sniukas] Listening to the statements by Defense Ministry  officials about officers' low wages and poor conditions in  units, the community may wonder whether our Army is not overly  large. We would not resist the big neighbors even if we  increased the soldiers' number tenfold. Should we rather  improve its quality?    [Linkevicius] I think that this question should be addressed  to our politicians. It is not the National Defense Ministry  that defines the number of armed forces. Do not forget its  majesty, the budget, and the finances specially assigned to  national defense.    To be aware of the exact number of servicemen, the Seimas  [parliament] should announce a military doctrine. The latter,  in turn, cannot be drafted without a security concept.  Unfortunately, our Seimas men and women have not yet discussed  this issue.    [Sniukas] We have signed the "Partnership for Peace" program  with NATO. However, it is difficult to predict any definite  benefit except the political one. Meanwhile, Russia surely did  not like this move. The community is considering now: Has our  security improved or weakened after this?    [Linkevicius] We have not heard any statements from Russian  officials after 27 January that are cause for concern.    First, this agreement is not directed against other  countries.    Second, I think that leaders of the United States and other  countries have fully explained the essence of this agreement to  Russia. Furthermore, the gate is not closed to Russia.    True, our right-wing press, which speaks through the mouth  of  the opposition, is full of suspicions toward Bill Clinton and  other Western leaders concerning the fact that Lithuania's fate  has already been decided and so on. This does not surprise me  because suspicion is, probably, the key trait of the current  opposition.    However, if we approved of these suspicions, then there  would  be no sense in creating a state at all.    As far as I know, the Lithuanian Government trusts the  decency of the United States and other big states. Therefore,  it has appealed to NATO and wants closer cooperation with the  European Union.    [Sniukas] Your office is a political one. Given our  opposition's clamor, you must be scolded quite often....    [Linkevicius] The press criticizes the ministry more often  than me personally. It is difficult to tell which bitter  article was inspired by politicians or the editorial board  itself.    I know the principles of the press because I myself have  been  a journalist. I understand that spicy material means high  circulation and prestige for a publication.    Nevertheless, before issuing criticisms, I wish reporters  considered whether their articles would discipline an  unsuccessful official or provide grounds for foreigners to think  how awful the Lithuanian Army is.    Journalists sometimes do not realize that definite criticism  (often without arguments!) makes all soldiers anxious, impairs  their good spirits, and increases their nihilism.    I would also like to note one more issue. Journalists have  no secrets, while we, the military, must keep many of them. We  could reply to some articles but we would then have to  declassify certain things. Since we cannot do this, one is left  with the impression that the press is always right, while the  National Defense Ministry is always wrong.    No matter how many troubles -- objective and subjective --  we  may have in our armed forces, let us cherish them. Let us scold  them, but let us say a few good words as well!    [Sniukas] Only some of the conscripts come to the Army  today. There is a prevailing opinion among the community that  only the children of ordinary parents (I will refrain from using  stronger epithets) perform the duty of their homeland defense.  They are a type of recruit. I have not heard of children of  high officials, Seimas deputies, millionaires, and Gariunai  [notorious market-place near Vilnius] boys serving in the Army.    [Linkevicius] You are correct to note this. Because we  cannot draft everyone, various excuses and advantages ensue.    [Sniukas] I can again impart the public opinion, in case you  do not know it. "Good children of good men" do not serve in the  Army due to bribes and connections.    We lament that physically weak and unfit youngsters come to  the Army. While they are living a difficult everyday Army life,  their contemporaries with strongly built muscles are flying to  Beijing, Istanbul, or Amsterdam, enriching themselves daily, and  even mocking the Army. Do we not discredit the sacred duty of  homeland defense in this way? Does not service in the Army  become the job of simpletons?    [Linkevicius] I would not use such strong words. However,  the problem is serious. Conscription commissions are  subordinated to the Health Ministry, and we are unable to  control bribes. I will be self-critical -- both our ministry  and the Prosecutor General's Office are conniving.    We could introduce alternative service, but it is difficult  to organize it under economic depression. Military departments  at higher educational establishments could train officers in the  reserve.    [Sniukas] I would propose the following plan of conscription  to military service: We should draft the strongest and  healthiest persons. If the latter did not want to serve they  could ransom themselves for, let us say, 10,000 or 50,000 litai.  There would be many such people, while the National Defense  Ministry could raise another budget as the one assigned by the  state. The money which now flows as bribes into the pockets of  commission members would go to the National Defense Ministry  account.    Certainly, all this should be fully voluntary. Then  servicemen would not envy those who have paid the ransom, while  the latter would not feel the humiliating superiority. Such a  principle could be abandoned after imposing order in the  country's legal system, and after economic possibilities for the  expansion of Army ranks emerge.    [Linkevicius] This is an interesting proposal but it is the  matter of the Seimas.    [Sniukas] Thank you for the interview.</p>

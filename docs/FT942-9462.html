			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Management: Japan culture shock For Nick Collins, licensing controller of Pringle of Scotland, it was an opportunity to become 'immersed in an alien culture', learn a 'horribly difficult' language, and find out about management styles on the other side of the world. Collins is one of more than 500 young managers who has benefited from the European Commission's Executive Training Programme in Japan - a 15-year-old scheme that aims to develop the presence of European companies in the Far East. Last week 40 more Europeans headed east to start the intensive 18-month course, of language training, factory visits, culture and business seminars and a secondment to a Japanese company. Initial screening is carried out across the European Union by PA Consulting Group, with the final assessment in Brussels by the Commission (which pays the training costs and living expenses). Successful candidates range from managers in companies with sales as low as Pounds 2m to multinationals such as Royal Insurance and Michelin. Law firms, software companies and electronic components suppliers are among those represented in the latest group. 'All these companies are currently doing business in one way or another already with Japan, although often in very small volumes,' says John Patrick, PA's recruiter. Up to 70 per cent of 'alumni' are still directly or indirectly involved with EU/Japan trade and almost 50 per cent are living in Japan. Pringle's Collins believes participants will get more out of the programme if they do a stint with their company in Japan when the course has ended. 'It's a country that changes very quickly, it is easy to lose track.' Recruitment details from PA's John Patrick, 123 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1W 9SR.

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Sport: The art of the bribe - Soccer 'IN Europe you just don't do it very well do you?' said my fat Malay friend, barely suppressing a laugh. 'You have to be clever, and your football administrators clearly aren't' He was referring neither to team selection nor ticket sales. Instead, what is making so many involved in south-east Asian football, so many who sit up all night to watch any kind of match beamed from the West, curl up in chuckles, are the match-fixing scandals in Marseille, Warsaw and Tbilisi. My friend, who has regularly profited from knowing the score of a big game some 24 hours before it kicks off, explained: 'First of all, officials cannot be seen to be involved. And the people who always benefit most are the bookies. So you let the bookies do the work and, if you are friends with at least one of them, you reap the benefits.' The work, as he so delicately calls bribery, is quite complicated. You do not, explained the rather attractive daughter of a bookie, allow a player to bury money in your in-laws' back garden. This is what Christophe Robert, of Valenciennes widely reported to have done with the Ffr242,000 he allegedly received from the unfortunate Jean-Jacques Eydelie of Marseille. If you can help it, you do not pay cash at all. No one, least of all a footballer, a species not known for intellectual grandeur, should put himself in the position of having to explain a sudden accretion in his bank account. Instead, a south-east Asian bookie will buy all tickets they know are going to win in the local four-digit lottery - and then give them to the players. The money is therefore legitimately gained. He will organise the renovation of, or better still, the down payment for, a nice little four-bedroomed house. He will buy the player a car, several overseas holidays or a small yacht. Rolex watches and Bally shoes are prized commodities, particularly when given to each member of a player's vast extended family. But before he puts his hand in his pocket, the astute bookie will consider very carefully which player or players (or referees) to approach and how the match is to be fixed. The less sophisticated might expect a lugubrious defender to score an embarrassing own goal or even pass the ball, inadvertently, to an opposing forward. The expert bribee is more inventive. He will fail to cut out a cross. He will find himself subtly out of position. Or, and this is the favourite strategy in south-east Asian football at the moment, he will only play well for one half. Usually, there are three or four players on the take in a game. They are the most talented on their respective team. 'You get the best striker, the two best defender and the goalkeeper and you've got the game,' a Singaporean journalist told me. 'You do not contact them directly. Instead you use relatives and girl friends. You then plant runners in the hotel where the players are staying. They are there just to make sure the player knows the bookie is serious. And if a chosen player starts being difficult, you have to make a few threats. Nothing too serious. Just a severe beating, maybe smashing his car up or threatening his family. If a a player succumbs once, he is in the hands of the bookies for good.' Rather like Sunday afternoon golfers, south-east Asian gamblers love to wager on the first-half score and a second-half score separately, and then the match as a whole. This has opened a wonderful new arena for the bookies. For example, if Singapore Rovers are expected to beat Singapore Rangers easily and the bookies have taken a lot of bets at generous odds on a lop-sided half-time score, Rovers might have a terribly unfortunate 45 minutes in front of goal before destroying Rangers in the second half. At slightly less advantageous odds, of course. According to Peter Velappan, secretary-general of the Asian Football Confederation, some SDollars 200,000 (Pounds 80,000) of bookie benefits were available at every match in the Southeast Asian Games in June: 'The syndicates in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Bangkok have combined their resources to make it a professional set-up, a multi-national corporation with no permanent headquarters. I was once quite shocked to receive a report about a youth team, all its members under 15, carting away TVs, video players, radios and stereo sets, after losing 12-0 in an international youth competition. 'I have not come across an FA in this region which has looked this problem squarely in the face. So it is now not surprising that it has spread to parts of South Korea and parts of south China.' Velappan knows how difficult it is to prevent, in spite of the efforts of th Football Association of Singapore, for example, which has employed plain clotheses policemen to investigate suspects and forbids players to use the telephone for the last six hours before a game. Once bribery becomes an institution, with proof impossible to grasp, it is difficult to prevent. That is the real danger for European football.</p>

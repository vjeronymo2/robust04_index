			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Leading business figures backing the Tories SIR ALISTAIR GRANT joined supermarkets group Argyll in 1977, and has been chief executive since 1986. Group pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 64.6m in the year to March 1986 to Pounds 290.8m last year. Argyll's annual report puts Sir Alistair's remumeration at Pounds 518,000; under Labour his extra tax burden would be about Pounds 92,000 a year, or Pounds 1,770 per week. SIR ALLEN SHEPPARD joined GrandMet in 1975 and became chief executive in 1986. Pre-tax profits of the group have grown under his leadership from Pounds 368m in the year to September 30 1986 to Pounds 963m last year. His 1991 emoluments are put at Pounds 713,391 (excluding pension benefits); the rough cost to him of Labour's proposals would be Pounds 129,450 a year, or Pounds 2,490 a week. LORD KING OF WARTNABY has been chairman of British Airways since 1981. Since the company was privatised in 1987, profits have risen from Pounds 162m in that year to Pounds 285m in the first nine months of the current financial year. BA's last report and accounts show Lord King's emoluments as Pounds 407,650 a year so Labour could cost him Pounds 71,358 a year, or Pounds 1,372 a week. PETER DAVIS joined Reed International from J Sainsbury in 1986, becoming chief executive later that year. The publishing group's profits have risen from Pounds 188m in the year to March 31 1987 to Pounds 222m last year. His emoluments (excluding pension contributions) are put at Pounds 310,569. On that basis, Labour could cost him Pounds 52,900 a year, or Pounds 1,010 a week. STANLEY KALMS is chairman of Dixons, the electrical goods retailer, which he joined in 1948. Pre-tax profits have been damaged by the recession, falling from Pounds 102.6m in the 1986-87 financial year to Pounds 81.7m in 1990-91. The Dixons report shows his annual remuneration at Pounds 566,132; the cost to him of Labour would be Pounds 101,450 a year, or Pounds 1,950 a week. Figures are based on earnings in annual report. They assume that figures shown taken as salary (rather than other taxable benefits); they do not take into account the proposed change in child benefit</p>

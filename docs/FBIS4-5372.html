			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- North Korea proposed on  Monday to have a South-North liaison officials contact at  Panmunjom on Wednesday morning, saying they have messages to  deliver to the South.    In a telephone message to the South, North Korea said that  at  the contact they would deliver messages recently adopted by a  joint session of the North Korean Government, political parties  and social organizations.    The messages are addressed to the South Korean Government,  political parties, social organizations and some individuals, it  said.    A Unification Board official hinted that the South would not  send a liaison official to Panmunjom as suggested by the North.    "The message is apparently part of their united front  strategy. A dialogue for political propaganda's sake is  something not desirable," the official said.</p>

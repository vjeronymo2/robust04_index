			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: J Smurfit falls 27% to IPounds 48m but sees upturn Jefferson Smurfit, the Irish paper and packaging group, yesterday reported a further decline in full year profits but expressed confidence that a recent upturn in demand for cardboard boxes in the US and Europe signalled the end of the paper industry's worst recession for 50 years. Pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 fell by 27 per cent to IPounds 47.8m (Pounds 46.6m), against IPounds 65.8m restated for FRS 3. Sales increased by 16.5 per cent to IPounds 1.47bn (IPounds 1.26bn), mainly reflecting the inclusion of UK Corrugated, Cundell and Irish Paper Products for the first time. Mr Michael Smurfit, chairman, said the results reflected 'a further decline in our already low prices which was mainly the result of continuing overcapacity'. The pre-tax figure was struck after IPounds 37.6m (IPounds 29.7m) of exceptional costs relating to the group's share of its US associate's Dollars 150m (Pounds 103m) pre-tax charge for restructuring. Earnings per share slipped to 7.2p (7.8p) but the proposed final dividend is raised to 2.7694p, making a total for the year up 7 per cent at 4p, against 3.74p. Operating profit fell from IPounds 104.2m to IPounds 75m, of which IPounds 4.71m was from acquisitions. Net interest receipts dropped to IPounds 9.77m (IPounds 16.2m) as net cash declined from IPounds 149.5m to IPounds 38.4m partly reflecting currency devaluation. With the exception of Ireland, sales volumes declined in all countries. The combined Ireland/UK region reported an 11 per cent increase in profits to IPounds 28.2m on sales which grew by 50 per cent to IPounds 557.7m. In continental Europe profits fell by 63 per cent to IPounds 7.95m (IPounds 21.5m) on sales down by 7 per cent to IPounds 380m, but Mr Ray Curran, chief financial officer, said European price trends were now looking 'much more positive'. The Latin American operations continued to generate the lion's share of trading profits although their contribution fell by 14 per cent to IPounds 54.2m. In North America JSC/CCA, the associate set up through a leveraged buy-out in 1989, reported increased losses of IPounds 14.7m (IPounds 1.08m). JSC completed the first stage of a two-part refinancing aimed at raising Dollars 2.45bn yesterday including a Dollars 250m public equity offering. COMMENT Smurfit's management gave an upbeat assessment of prospects in both the US and Europe yesterday. In the US, the group's most important market, the recovery has already eaten up spare capacity and price increases appear to be sticking - every Dollars 10 price rise adds Dollars 20m to Smurfit's bottom line. This year pre-tax profits of about IPounds 98m and earnings of 14p look possible but the real advance should come next year when profits could reach IPounds 165m producing earnings of 23p. The shares are trading on a prospective multiple of 13.6 against next year's earnings and should be bought or held.</p>

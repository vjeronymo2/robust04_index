			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Scalfaro at Allied Landing </F> Commemoration"]    [Text] (ANSA) Nettuno, June 3 -- Recollection of and  sympathy for those who died and suffered on all sides in the  Second World War was at the centre of a speech here on Friday [3  June] by Italy's President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.    "No one can change history, but pain and human sacrifice can  never suffer distinctions or divisions," said Scalfaro at a  memorial service attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton and  Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi.    "I cannot forget that in the division of my country,  suffering and bloodshed affected other sons of this earth," said  the head of state. A particular thought was spared for the  Americans who died in the Salerno, Nettuno and Anzio landings  "whose young, sacrificed, lives we celebrate today."    Affirming that the dead of past wars are calling out for an  end to current conflicts, Scalfaro recalled how Italy, over the  past 50 years has always responded "swiftly and generously to  calls for solidarity and brotherhood between people, in the  service of liberty and justice, in the same spirit in which it  was present in the heroic battle for freedom."    Calling for nations to be on their guard against "future  dangers and fears", the president condemned the Second World  War, "because man chose violence against all reason," and  because of the existence of "dishonest dictatorships, with the  hegemony of a `superior race' which massacred brotherly equality  between people and generated nameless genocide."    On the podium alongside Scalfaro were President Clinton and  his wife Hillary, who were greeted by huge crowds waving Italian  and American flag as they made their way through Nettuno, 40 km  south of Rome, where they arrived by helicopter earlier this  morning.    Security officers ran metal detectors over all those wishing  to enter the war cemetery here for the service to mark the 50th  anniversary of the Allied landings, a service attended by many  Italian veterans.    Premier Silvio Berlusconi, who was present but did not make  a  speech at this morning's ceremony, displayed irritation at  journalists who wanted to quiz him solely on the domestic  political situation. "Can't you be a little bit moved for once,  seeing all these boys who died for Italy," the premier asked the  press.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lower cotton prices forecast despite deficit WORLD COTTON consumption is expected to outstrip output in the 1993-94 season (August/September), but stiff competition among exporters may keep prices low, the International Cotton Advisory Committee said yesterday, reports Reuter from New Delhi. Output in 1993-94 is forecast at 18m tonnes, unchanged from the previous year, but consumption is likely to rise by 450,000 tonnes to 19.3m tonnes. Despite the growth in the world total, consumption in many importing countries is declining and there is stiff competition among exporters resulting in lower prices. The ICAC said that the average of Cotton Outlook magazine's Cotlook A Index for the season to date was around 55 cents a lb, compared with the 1992-93 average of 58 cents and a 20-year average of 72 cents. The committee is a worldwide organisation of 46 governments created to monitor developments affecting cotton production and to promote the use of cotton. At least 190 foreign delegates and observers are attending the five-day meeting in New Delhi. ICAC estimated world cotton stocks at the beginning of the season at 9.1m tonnes, including 3.3m in China and 1m in the US, the two biggest producers. Stocks are expected to fall to 7.8m tonnes by the end of the season. While stocks in China are forecast to fall by 1m tonnes to 2.3m because of lower production, US stocks may rise to 1.3m tonnes.</p>

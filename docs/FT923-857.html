			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (9): When agent steps on manager's toes - Responsibilities are shifting in the industry as the customer-supplier relationship changes ARE TRAVEL managers a dying breed? As recession grips more and more companies, the specialist function of travel manager is slowly being absorbed by some companies into other administrative functions and the bulk of the responsibility is being contracted out to travel management companies. Travel purchasing in larger companies over the last five years has been disappearing into general purchasing departments or financial departments. In contrast, smaller size companies - which do not have the attendant big bureaucratic set-ups of their larger counterparts - are generally keeping this function with, say, the managing director's secretary. Travel managers have always been the central purchaser of travel as a means of controlling travel costs. The argument went that one person who centrally bought travel could therefore have the buying muscle to negotiate more competitive prices. This has not changed; but it might be a travel agent who becomes, in effect, the travel manager, reporting to a purchasing manager at his/her client company. Any large organisation which spends large sums of money getting its executives from A to B should procure that travel by a purchasing specialist. The establishment of such a function within or outside a company not only creates opportunities for negotiating bulk-buying terms but it also contributes to the streamlining of administrative procedures which conserve executive man-hours. The advantages of such an arrangement are obvious, travelling executives are relieved of time-consuming chores such as obtaining and checking tickets, making hote1 reservations, updating passports and processing visa application forms. The travel manager or travel agent can also organise a business trip in collaboration with airlines, hoteliers, car hire companies and travel agents to ensure that the executives arrive comparatively free of frustration and in optimum working condition. New technology coupled with a trend of company divestment is now turning the traditional role of travel manager on its head. The advent of sophisticated management information captured at point of sale by computer reservation systems (CRSs) had turned traditional business travel agents into travel management companies as they try to win business on the strength of having a better handle on travel costs It means that, in some cases, the travel manager is reduced merely to administering the customer-supplier relationship as there is no longer an in-house travel department. This takes up 30 per cent of a purchasing manager's time or of that of someone who has a clerical function. 'A comparison can be drawn with the gradual disappearance of in-house advertising departments in the 1960s, leading to a functionary such as a marketing manager/director having the customer/supplier relationship with out-based advertising agencies and media buyers,' explains Mr Richard Lovell, managing director of business travel agent Wagons-Lits UK. What has fuelled this trend is those companies divesting themselves of non-core business. 'It's a way for a company to strip out as much cost and overheads as possible,' explains Mr Michael Cleeve, former business travel manager at British Telecom and now head of his own consultancy advising on travel and expense management. Business travel agents, or travel management companies as they prefer to be called nowadays, have picked up new business but they are not all the way there yet and even some agents would admit that. 'There's a bit of a vacuum left when the travel manager goes and the travel agent isn't doing all his or her work. There are gaps, particularly in the processes which link the business traveller with the travel management company,' says Mr Cleeve. One problem area is effective communication of the various deals that have been worked out with the travel suppliers. A generous route deal with an airline will be lost if none of the travelling executives patronises that airline. Communicating such deals to large companies with several sites around the country is difficult. Mr Cleeve argues that business travel agents should refine a company travel policy, help build some synergy between the company and itself and communicate it effectively. 'So often the travel policy and desired practice are remote from the traveller,' says Mr Cleeve. As a general rule, travel agents welcome this new-fangled customer-supplier relationship as it can lead to a clearer definition of responsibilities and service standards and also clarify how an agent will be paid. Traditionally, travel agents make their living from commission earned when booking travel products. But with large accounts, say, those over Pounds 1m a year and which are simple to manage, a fee-based payment system is often better. Under this arrangement, an agent invoices his or her customer for airline tickets, hotel bills and car hire net of commission and instead, charges a service fee. The fee is a percentage of sales. Alternatively, companies might find it easier to pay their agent a transaction fee for each booking. It will all depend on the size of the account. Clearly, the world of travel management is in upheaval but the increased set of options spell good news for any company trying to make sense of containing travel costs.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUST WE RUSH THE EXECUTIONER?;  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY: COURTS MAKE MISTAKES MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WE LIKE TO ADMIT. WE  MUST BE SURE BEFORE WE DROP THE PELLET.  </P> <P> A committee headed by former Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. and  composed exclusively of federal judges from the South has recommended drastic  limitations on the rights of condemned people awaiting execution. In California  alone, there are more than 200 who may be affected by these changes in our  fundamental procedures.  </P> <P> The Powell committee report, which Chief Justice William Rehnquist submitted  directly to Congress in a manner that drew unprecedented criticism from most of  the chief judges of the U.S. Courts of Appeal, would severely restrict the use  of the writ of habeas corpus in capital cases. Speedy executions, rather than  fairness and due process, would be the order of the day.  </P> <P> Are we really so desperate to execute people that we can no longer afford them  the full rights of review that condemned people have always had? Are we really  willing to sacrifice certainty for speed where life is at stake? Are we really  prepared to execute people who have been convicted or sentenced in violation of  the provisions of the Constitution?  </P> <P> If not, someone had better tell the Congress before it enacts the Powell  committee recommendations. Legislation that would accomplish just that is now  on a special fast track, which would permit Congress to act before the lessons  of common sense and history can make their weight felt.  </P> <P> The issue is not, as some seem to believe, whether we should turn criminals  loose simply because courts make technical errors or admit improper evidence.  It is whether in capital cases we can afford to ignore fundamental  constitutional violations that may affect the jury's decision to find the  defendant guilty or to impose a death sentence instead of life imprisonment.  </P> <P> If the error is not of constitutional magnitude or if it does not affect the  verdict, the federal courts will not intervene.  </P> <P> The writ of habeas corpus, no less, is under attack by the chief justice and  the committee he appointed. One might expect to hear the alarm bells ringing  throughout the land. Yet only the American Bar Assn. has thus far shown any  signs of springing into action. Its litigation section has issued a report  calling for greater, rather than lesser, protections for the rights of those  facing death at the hands of the state. The Bar Association itself is scheduled  to consider the matter early next year, shortly before Congress is expected to  act.  </P> <P> To understand the significance of these attempts to limit federal-court review  of state-imposed death sentences, one need only look back over a recent  seven-year period. During that time, almost 75% of the orders of execution  issued by state courts were found to be in violation of the Constitution. But  for federal review and the writ of habeas corpus, a substantial number of  people would have been executed in contravention of the fundamental principles  set forth in our Bill of Rights.  </P> <P> In some cases, the defendant may have been innocent; in others, only the  fairness of the sentence may have been at issue. Either way, the lesson is  simple: Courts make mistakes -- even in capital cases. And they make them more  frequently than we like to admit. This elementary fact should lead us all,  supporters and opponents of the death penalty alike, to one uncontroversial  conclusion: We must be absolutely sure that we are right before we drop the  pellet or pull the switch. We must not deprive any human being of a fair chance  for judicial review if a reasonable argument exists that reversal of his or her  death penalty is required by our laws.  </P> <P> This is the very principle that the Powell committee squarely and explicitly  rejects. The committee's recommendations reflect an understandable public  frustration over increasing crime, the narcotics threat, the slowness of the  judicial process and our general inability to control our national and  individual destinies. We want to strike out -- to act -- to see tangible  results, at last.  </P> <P> What is more tangible and final than an execution? And what is more difficult  to understand than why it takes the courts so long to decide that a mass  murderer should be executed? So, the Powell committee looked for ways to speed  up the death-penalty process. And it found a simplistic solution. Limit the use  of the historic writ of habeas corpus in capital cases. Afford condemned  prisoners fewer rights than persons convicted of lesser offenses. Prohibit  successive habeas petitions in capital cases, unlike in all other felonies.  Adopt a rule that if a capital prisoner's lawyer fails to raise an issue in the  state proceedings, the prisoner is barred from ever raising it in federal  court. Adopt another rule that any issue not raised the first time the case is  presented to a federal judge is, except in rare instances, forever waived.  </P> <P> These rules might be helpful and reasonable if all lawyers were perfect. But  lawyers, like judges, are not. Lawyers make mistakes, too. And the Powell  committee's view is that it is the condemned man (or woman) who should pay for  those mistakes -- with their lives.  </P> <P> The Powell committee's report is not entirely without redeeming social value.  For example, it encourages states to adopt procedures for the appointment of  counsel for indigents who want to file habeas petitions in capital cases.  </P> <P> On the other hand, it reaffirms the rule that prohibits condemned prisoners  from asserting constitutional rights that the Supreme Court had not  acknowledged as of the time the crime was committed. How much fairer and more  sensible the view of the bar association committee: "We believe it is  unacceptable to sanction executions under procedures that have been declared  unconstitutional."  </P> <P> The Powell committee met only six times. It was composed exclusively of judges  from places in which executions are common. It heard from no witnesses,  accepting only written comments. Yet it felt sufficiently confident of its  views to recommend the most radical curtailment of the writ of habeas corpus in  our history.  </P> <P> It may take years before all the consequences surrounding adoption of the  Powell committee recommendations become evident. Meanwhile, executions will  certainly increase -- but at what cost to our Constitution?  </P></p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Slovak ministers resign The entire government of the Slovak republic resigned yesterday, rejecting an appeal by President Michal Kovac to remain in office until an interim government was formed, deposed prime minister Vladimir Meciar said. Mr Meciar (pictured left) lost a vote of no-confidence in parliament on Friday after months of wrangling with Mr Kovac and defections in his own party. Leaders of nearly all the other parties in parliament said they would meet later yesterday to discuss a nominee to form the new government and a timetable for early elections. Mr Meciar said he would return to parliament as a deputy to lead his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia in opposition.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Carlton warns on Channel 5 deal CARLTON TELEVISION has warned the Independent Television Commission that it may seek a judicial review if the Channel 5 franchise is awarded to Channel Five Holdings, the consortium led by Thames Television. The commission is due to decide tomorrow whether to award the franchise  - which will cover about 70 per cent of the UK population - to the Thames consortium, the only bidder. If the commission decided not to award the franchise, it might face a judicial review threat from Thames. Carlton, which will take over the London weekday franchise from Thames on New Year's day, is concerned that it might face competition from Channel 5 in London before the end of its first year on air. At issue is likely to be the nature of the proposed service from the consortium. Carlton will argue that the 1990 Broadcasting Act envisaged a national channel with the obligation to show a diversity of programmes and not a London-based service to be shown all over the country. At a later date, Channel 5 plans to provide services from other cities such as Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow, although it may be the turn of the century before those are established. The consortium's programme plans reflect the focus of one of its important backers: Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of CityTV in Toronto, which specialises in local news, films and popular music. The ITC has to decide whether the consortium's finances and programme plans pass a quality threshold. It must also be certain that the consortium can retune millions of video recorders likely to suffer interference from the Channel 5 signal. Apart from Thames and its parent, Thorn EMI, Channel Five Holdings has the backing of Time Warner, the world's biggest media company. Associated Newspapers; Pearson, owner of the Financial Times; and Cox, the Atlanta-based media group, are among those which told the commission they are interested in investing in the project. Thames has made the minimum bid of Pounds 1,000 a year and, unlike all but the smallest ITV companies, Channel 5 will not have to pay part of its advertising revenue to the government.

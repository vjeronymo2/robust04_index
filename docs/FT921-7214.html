			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / International Company News: Takeover code revision gains approval THE SECURITIES and Futures Commission, Hong Kong's financial regulator, has approved a revised version of the colony's takeovers code. It will come into effect on April 1, writes Simon Holberton. Mr Ermanno Pascutto, executive director of the SFC and chairman of the takeovers committee, said the final draft was close to the document the SFC released in November. The most important of the revisions, however, is a tightening of the definition of acting in concert. Persons will be deemed to be acting in concert if they co-operate to obtain or consolidate control of voting rights in a company, whether by purchasing securities or by coming together for such purpose. Previously, the code referred only to the acquisition of securities.</p>

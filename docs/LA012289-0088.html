			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CENTER FOR LATINO PROBLEMS MIXES ALTRUISM, PROFIT  </P> <P> The man on the phone sounded desperate. He had been working at a factory for 13  years but had not been promoted because, he suspected, he is Latino. What  should he do?  </P> <P> Moments before, an exasperated woman had called seeking help in collecting  $1,000 from her former landlord, money that was borrowed more than a year ago.  Neither caller spoke English.  </P> <P> The director of Centro de Proteccion Familiar (Center for Family Protection)  scheduled appointments to work on solutions to their problems. Director Ana  Rosa Rodriguez told the first caller that her staff could write letters to his  supervisor and to the company president explaining the situation. She would  also refer him to the state Department of Fair Employment &amp; Housing.  Rodriguez would arrange for one of her mediators to work with the other caller  and her former landlord. The services would be provided free of charge.  </P> <P> The same services could be provided by a number of publicly funded, nonprofit  social service agencies, but Centro de Proteccion Familiar has a distinguishing  characteristic -- it's a business run by executives who mix altruism with  profit.  </P> <P> CPF is the brainchild of Spanish Research and Marketing, a South Pasadena-based  advertising and marketing firm that specializes in tapping the Latino market.  </P> <P> CPF is a marketing operation that is advertised as a way to help first- and  second-generation Latinos adjust to life in the U.S., while generating business  for doctors and other professionals.  </P> <P> The idea is to assist and build good will in the Latino community by providing  free services such as translation of rental agreements and other legal  documents, mediation services for tenants and consumers and information on  immigration questions.  </P> <P> In the process, CPF counselors come across people who need medical, legal and  insurance services. Those people are referred to professionals, who pay a  monthly fee to be part of the marketing program.  </P> <P> How much is altruism and how much business?  </P> <P> "Fortunately we've done very well. We had a sense we owed something and wanted  to give something back," said Dennis Delmonte, one of three principals of  Spanish Research and Marketing. "Obviously making money is great, but if you  don't feel good about what you're doing, then what good is it?"  </P> <P> Officials of the business say that their referral system complies with state  law and the ethical guidelines of the medical and legal professions regarding  referrals to professional services.  </P> <P> The first CPF office was opened in the Pico-Union District of Los Angeles in  1986. A second office was established in Montebello last July and a third was  opened in Santa Ana last month, Rodriguez said. A fourth office is scheduled to  be opened in San Bernardino within two months. And the advertising firm hopes  to eventually open offices in the South Bay area, the San Fernando Valley, West  Los Angeles, Riverside, northern Orange County and San Diego, Delmonte said.  </P> <P> The marketing technique has generated hundreds of referrals for doctors and  other health professionals, who pay from $3,000 to $5,000 a month to be part of  the cooperative marketing campaign, Delmonte said. More than 60 professional  health offices and an insurance company participate, he said.  </P> <P> "We helped them (members of the Latino community) with those little problems  that no one wanted to help them with because it didn't make money," Delmonte  said. "That good will is coming back."  </P> <P> Jesus Castanon of Los Angeles, for example, sent a $70 money order to a family  in the Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez. After more than a month, it had not  arrived and Castanon felt he was getting the runaround when he sought  reimbursement from Western Union officials in Los Angeles. With the help of  CPF, Castanon received his refund. There was no charge.  </P> <P> "It was thanks to them more than anything," Castanon said in an interview.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dispute With Dealer  </P> <P> Leopoldo Lopez of Huntington Park said CPF helped him in a dispute with an auto  dealer over the amount of money owed by Lopez. Again, there was no charge.  </P> <P> "They resolved the problem," Lopez said. "I'm happy with them."  </P> <P> Rodriguez estimated CPF resolves about 15 such cases a month per office.  </P> <P> Spanish Research and Marketing was established in 1978 by Jorge Azpiazu, who  was born in Argentina, and Tito Alvarez, a native of Puerto Rico. Delmonte, who  said his parents are from Puerto Rico and Chile, became a partner later.  </P> <P> They started a cooperative marketing campaign for lawyers in 1978 that  eventually became Centro de Proteccion Legal, a subsidiary of Spanish Research  and Marketing. Delmonte said lawyers from about 350 offices in Los Angeles,  Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties pay from $1,500 to  $9,600 a month to participate in that campaign.  </P> <P> The monthly fee buys them a marketing program, which includes group advertising  in Spanish-language media, instruction in how to relate to Latino clients and  other assistance. The average legal office receives from 25 to 50 referrals a  month from the program, Delmonte said.  </P> <P> Centro de Proteccion Familiar was formed when it became apparent that not  everyone calling the legal branch needed a lawyer, Delmonte said. Centro de  Proteccion Familiar uses similar group-advertising and referral techniques.  Both subsidiaries also publish monthly magazines to provide their target  audience with information on legal rights, medical and other issues. CPF  distributes literature from various public agencies on issues ranging from  consumer protection to drug abuse.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Screen Professionals  </P> <P> CPF and the legal branch screen participating professionals for expertise and  sensitivity toward Latinos, Delmonte said. That includes an office visit and a  check for malpractice lawsuits, he said. Some professionals have been refused  participation, and others have been expelled, he said. Again, altruism is mixed  with good business sense.  </P> <P> "There are mills. They treat people like animals. They get them in, they get  them out and bill," Delmonte said. "We have to get people who are  conscientious. Every participating office is a reflection of the whole  program."  </P> <P> CPF works out of sleekly appointed, storefront offices, each with several  bilingual employees. On a recent week, the Los Angeles office received 226  calls, while the Montebello office received 243 calls, and Santa Ana had 113,  according to CPF records.  </P> <P> CPF makes referrals to medical professionals and lawyers in workers  compensation, personal injury, general-civil, landlord-tenant and medical  malpractice cases, said Rodriguez, the CPF director. Medical referrals result  almost entirely from the workers compensation cases, she said.  </P> <P> In those cases, CPF counselors ask the claimant what his injury is, and  appointments are made with doctors, chiropractors and other medical  professionals, said CPF spokeswoman Bettina Netri.  </P> <P> Spanish Research and Marketing and participating professionals walk a fine line  to avoid breaking state law regulating how doctors and lawyers get their  business, officials said.  </P> <P> Medical referrals for profit are prohibited by state law, said Catherine  Hanson, legal counsel for the California Medical Assn.  </P> <P> A seldom-enforced state law prohibits "runners" or "cappers" from soliciting  business for attorneys by frequenting hospitals, courthouses and other public  and private places, officials said. That allowed for attorney referral  services, which charge fees and advertise to drum up business.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1987 Legislation  </P> <P> Legislation was enacted in 1987 to regulate attorney referral services to guard  against price-gouging and other abuses, but those new regulations are under  review by the state Supreme Court and have not taken effect, said Anne Charles,  a spokeswoman for the California State Bar.  </P> <P> Delmonte said his operation is legal because participating professionals are  not guaranteed a set number of referrals for a fee. They are charged for a  marketing program, from which they expect business as they would from  traditional advertising, he said.  </P> <P> Charles said the association was not familiar with the marketing practices and  she, therefore, could not comment.  </P> <P> But an official with the California Medical Assn., after hearing a description  of CPF's program in an interview, questioned the ethics of the marketing  program.  </P> <P> "Profit is clearly a criterion, the purpose for making the referral," said Jay  Michael, the association's vice president for government relations.  </P> <P> Joyce Simmons, a consumer protection analyst with the state attorney general's  office in Los Angeles, said she reviewed the marketing program more than a year  ago for fraudulent advertising claims but found no violations. The review was  done under the auspices of the Immigration and Amnesty Task Force based in the  the Los Angeles city attorney's office. The operations of many area businesses  offering services to immigrants were reviewed during the amnesty application  period.  </P> <P> Referrals aside, Rodriguez said one of her key responsibilities is to teach  clients that they are not powerless to combat, say, a dishonest landlord or car  dealer.  </P> <P> Since the inauguration of the immigration amnesty program, more immigrants who  figure they will be able to stay legally in this country are buying  large-ticket items such as cars and making other decisions that require  knowledge of business dealings and legal protections, Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> Ironically, Rodriguez said, the majority of disputes mediated by her counselors  involve Latino businessmen.  </P> <P> "A lot of Hispanic businessmen are committing fraud in plain daylight," she  said.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for several Los Angeles immigration and consumer agencies and private  immigrants' rights organizations said they had not heard of CPF or CPL. Some  said it sounded as if the programs could be providing a valuable community  service.  </P> <P> But a spokeswoman for the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights of Los  Angeles, which is composed of 40 immigrants' rights groups, issued a word of  caution similar to what Rodriguez and her staff might tell people.  </P> <P> Said spokeswoman Linda Mitchell, "If people are offering you free services and  referring to somewhere where you have to pay money, you should find out what  you're getting for your money."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 103 AND ROXANI GILLESPIE  </P> <P> In 1978, during the campaign for Proposition 13, insurance companies promised  that if the proposition passed, they would be able to lower rates because of  the money they saved on property taxes. My rates, as did those of everyone else  I know, continued to rise. Now, after the passage of Proposition 103, I am told  that implementation might take 10 years, and some companies will not be  required to comply at all. Whatever happened to "We The People?"  </P> <P> DAVID M. SHERR  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Staveley questions wisdom of new salt price restriction MR BRIAN Kent, chairman of Staveley Industries, yesterday said the tighter restrictions on salt prices announced earlier this week could force the UK's two producers to move increasingly away from basic bulk white salt. On Thursday the Department of Trade and Industry announced that price increases, restricted since 1987 to the rise in production costs minus 1 per cent, would be tightened to production cost growth less 2 per cent until 1997. Mr Kent said this could force producers to concentrate on higher added value products such as water softening agents and dishwasher pellets, which are not affected by the restraints. Salt continued to be Staveley's best-performing business in the year to April 4 when pre-tax profits fell almost 14 per cent to Pounds 24.2m. Sales declined 10 per cent to Pounds 298.3m. The largest decline came in the weighing division, where the operating return tumbled 39 per cent to Pounds 8.1m amid start-up problems with a German factory and the collapse in defence-related business. Earnings per share, depressed by the Pounds 27m rights issue in June 1991, fell from 20.6p to 16.6p. The final dividend is maintained at 5.9p, for a total of 8.2p (8.2p). COMMENT About the only disappointment in these results was Brian Kent's failure to pull a new chief executive out of his magic hat. Salt continues to come up with the cash, and mechanical and electrical engineering is remarkably resilient. Measurement shows good prospects for recovery, when one eventually comes. The risks are that the German factory proves a deeper thorn than thought, and the measurement order book takes longer than planned to rebuild. But even so, forecasts ranging from Pounds 24m to Pounds 28m make the shares - on a prospective p/e of 11 - look good value.</p>

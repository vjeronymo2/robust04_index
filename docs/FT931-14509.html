			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Taurus delay prolongs stamp duty on shares INVESTORS in UK shares face extra stamp duty costs of some Pounds 600m as a result of another delay to Taurus, the paperless settlement system. Brokers, registrars and others will today receive a letter from the London Stock Exchange setting a new target date for the launch of the system sometime in spring 1994 - at least six months later than the previous September launch date. The abolition of the stamp duty tax on share transactions, promised by Mr John Major, then chancellor of the exchequer, in his Budget speech of 1990, was tied to the launch of Taurus, partly because it would be-come difficult to levy the duty under this new settlement system. The latest delay is to allow more time for testing the system. With some 280 financial institutions planning to link into the Taurus network, the complex testing process is not expected to be completed before the end of this year, according to the Stock Exchange's letter. The longer testing period was urged on the exchange by financial institutions, which were concerned that not enough time was being allowed to try out the most complex part of the system. This element, which deals with rights issues, takeovers and other events that affect shareholders' benefits, is not due to start full testing until the summer. The launch of Taurus will not follow until several months after testing is finished, to allow for a full dress rehearsal - expected to take two months  -and the need for final approval from the Treasury, as well as the completion of audits of all the Taurus participants. The development of Taurus is due to enter an important stage this week, as the exchange's central settlement system is subjected to live testing for the first time.</p>

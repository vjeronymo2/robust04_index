			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has stated the following: In  a desperate and treacherous criminal act, aircraft belonging to  the traitorous rebels carried out an aggressive raid on the  power generating station in the city of Mocha at 1415 today.  This raid is part of a series of criminal actions carried out  by this traitorous gang against economic and civilian  installations and targets in our country that began with the  firing of Scud missiles at defenseless civilians in Sanaa,  Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, Zinjibar, and (al-Rahidah), and includes  the shelling of vital installations in Aden, led by the Aden  refinery and the power generating station in al-Hiswah. These  attacks express this gang's profound enmity toward the people  and their achievements, as well as its hostile desire to destroy  the homeland and implement the scheme designed to fragment its  unity.    The source added that these hideous criminal acts committed  by the rebellious gang against economic targets and  installations and residential areas in the cities come at a time  when many vital installations and targets in Aden, where this  criminal gang is entrenched, lie within the range of our valiant  Armed Forces' artillery. Our Armed Forces, however, are  extremely eager to preserve and protect these installations from  this traitorous clique because they are the property of the  homeland and the people, and also because the Armed Forces are  complying with the leadership's strict instructions not to  inflict any harm on these developmental achievements, which are  the people's wealth and the fruit of their efforts and sweat.</p>

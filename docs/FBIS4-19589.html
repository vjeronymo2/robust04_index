			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Bosnian refugees demonstrated in  Bonn on Wednesday [20 April] in favor of "immediate  intervention" by NATO in Gorazde. The Society for Threatened  Peoples organized the vigils in front of the embassies of Great  Britain, Russia, and the United States, as well as other places.  The Society says that about 400 people joined the  demonstrations.    Tilman Zuelch, chairman of the Society, demanded the calling  of a special session of the North Atlantic council. He stressed  that "the ending of the genocide in Bosnia should not be left to  the United Nations any longer." Without NATO intervention the  70,000 trapped Bosnians in Gorazde will be "destroyed" by Serb  troops. In addition, Zuelch demanded a special Bundestag  session on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

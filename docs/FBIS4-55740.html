			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Karol Wolf: "Slovak Hungarians Are Looking </F> Across the Danube"]    [Text] It is no secret that shifts on the Hungarian  political scene tend to be carried over to the countries  inhabited by Hungarian minorities. This holds even more true  for Slovakia, with its politically differentiated Hungarian  minority.    The electoral defeat suffered by the ruling Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] will find its expression in Slovakia in  the loss of influence of Miklos Duray, chairman of the  Coexistence movement, who directly participated in the MDF's  election campaign. Both the chief of the victorious Socialists,  Gyula Horn, and the leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats,  Gabor Kuncze, do not conceal their distaste for Duray's  positions. Horn even used the word "dummy" [hlupak] when  referring to Duray during his last visit to Slovakia before the  elections.    The second Hungarian political party in Slovakia, the  Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH], will probably  retain its former standing after the change of power in Hungary  and will continue to strive for the integration of all Hungarian  ethnic parties.    The chances of the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS], which is not  represented in the present parliament, have improved. It is a  member of the Liberal International and a direct partner of the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which will probably  participate in the new government in Budapest. Similar to the  MKDH, the MOS pursues as its basic political goals the formation  of a three-member [ethnic Hungarian] coalition and the weakening  of the influence of Coexistence.    However, the Socialists' victory in Hungary offers yet  another alternative concerning the political evolution of the  Hungarian minority in Slovakia. It is no secret that the Party  of the Democratic Left [SDL], which does not conceal its joy  over the success of its colleagues on the other side of the  Danube, has long been trying to gain broader support in the  south of the country. Compared with other political parties, the  SDL is purposefully building its structures there, and, today,  when SDL Chairman Peter Weiss can boast of his friendship with  Horn, its chances are growing bigger. The Hungarians in  southern Slovakia wish calm and peace, which is exactly what the  Weiss-Horn duo offers.    The political evolution of the Hungarian minority in  Slovakia  thus offers two alternatives. The propaganda of Horn's  Socialists can help the SDL, which will most probably open its  ticket for ethnic Hungarian candidates. The second alternative  is that, with the MOS's entry into the Hungarian coalition, more  liberal ideas will appear in the policy of this minority, and  right-wing currents will come to prevail in it. In view of the  permanently proreform attitudes demonstrated by Slovak  Hungarians in sociological surveys, the second alternative is  more likely. It needs to be said, however, that both  alternatives bear in themselves the potential to introduce  greater calm into the Slovak-Hungarian dialogue.</p>

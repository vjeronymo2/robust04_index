			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Johannesburg March 3 SAPA--The African National  Congress [ANC] on Thursday [3 March] gave notice it had  apparently accepted international mediation, saying a joint  ANC/Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] task force should be established  to address "the specifics" of this proposal. The ANC's national  working committee said in a statement in Johannesburg it had  received a full report of the March 1 meeting between ANC  President Nelson Mandela and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi  and that it "warmly welcomed the positive outcome of the  meeting".    Committee members had discussed the idea of international  mediation, proposed by Mr Buthelezi, as a way of resolving  outstanding differences between the two parties, and had agreed  to explore this route. "To pursue the matter further with the  IFP, the ANC proposes the establishment of a joint task team to  address the specifics and agree upon mutually acceptable terms  of reference."    The committee had also decided to set in motion discussions  with the IFP on other outstanding issues, including future  meetings between their respective leaders. [passage omitted]</p>

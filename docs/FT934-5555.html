			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Cuba hit by floods Cuba's struggling economy has been hit by poor weather for the third time this year, as heavy rain caused extensive flooding, killing at least 16 people, writes Canute James. Cuban officials said the floods coincided with the start of the sugar harvest and could depress production in the most important sector of the island's economy. The flooding disrupted communications and transport, damaged hundreds of homes and forced the evacuation of almost 50,000 people.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. imperialists dared [kamhaeng] to conduct a  series of aerial espionages on the northern half of the  Republic. According to military sources, an RC-135 strategic  reconnaissance plane, which flew to the sky above South Korea  from the U.S. imperialists' overseas base on 28 March, made a  sortie to the sky above the areas near the Military Demarcation  Line [MDL] and ran wild in taking aerial photographs and  electronic reconnaissance on the strategic centers [chollyakchok  chungsimjidaedul] of the northern half of the Republic while  making repeated shuttle flights between east and west. The  strategic reconnaissance plane has conducted aerial espionage  more than 10 times since the beginning of March.    Meanwhile, from around 17:00 [08:00 GMT] to 24:00 [15:00  GMT]  on 29 March, a U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane  made night flights in the skies above the areas adjacent to  Oeyon Island, Yangpyong, and Yangyang and ran amok in aerial  reconnaissance on the entire area of the northern half of the  Republic.    On 9 and 15 March, three of the high-altitude strategic  reconnaissance planes made 24-hour alternate flights around the  sky above the areas near the MDL and were frenzied with aerial  espionage.    Aerial espionage by the U.S. imperialists has been  intensified concurrently with their full-scale military  confrontation commotion [chonmyon kunsajok taekyol sodong]  against us since 21 March, the date on which the third round of  DPRK-U.S. talks had been scheduled.    On 24 March, the U.S. imperialists dared to conduct aerial  espionage on the northern half of the Republic by deploying five  RC-12's, four RV-1 Army tactical reconnaissance planes, two U-2  high-altitude strategic reconnaissance planes, and two EH-60  electronic-warfare helicopters day and night on the sky above  South Korea. On 26 March, they also ran amok in aerial  espionage on our side by flying seven RC-12 Army tactical  reconnaissance planes on the sky above the areas near the MDL.    The frequency of such aerial espionage on the northern half  of the Republic by the U.S. imperialists during the period from  21 to 30 March totalled over 90 times. The total frequency in  March amounted to 234 times, 40 more than that of February.    Various facts clearly show how the U.S. imperialist are  running wild with blood-shot eyes in the preparatory maneuvers  for a war of aggression against the northern half of the  Republic.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 105 (595) by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Sources close to the head of state told INTERFAX  that President Nursultan Nazarbayev was drafting a message he  intended to read to parliament next week on resolving the  political crisis in the country.    The crisis was brought to a head when the Supreme Soviet  declared it had no confidence in the government's socioeconomic  and legal policies. The document said that while making noises  about building a market economy the government essentially  obstructed the market reform and had triggered an economic chaos  in the country. Parliament also thought that the government had  not worked a society consolidating program.    To avoid complete paralysis of the authority parliament  suggested "a constructive dialog between all branches of power  and public and political organizations leading to a national  reform program and formation of a government capable of  implementing the program."    A government official told INTERFAX that the government knew  what to do and was capable of doing it. He said that the  Tereshchenko government has a specific anti-crisis program that  was being adapted to the situation in the wake of the  introduction of a national currency. The official was critical  of parliament which, he said, had failed to adopt numerous bills  on oil, transportation and finances and thus obstructed  investments in the Republic's economy.    The press secretary of Tereshchenko described the parliament  declaration as unconstitutional. In a statement made public in  Almaty he emphasized that under the Constitution the government  had to report only to the president.</p>

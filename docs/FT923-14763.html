			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Warning from TUC on training DISCRIMINATION in education and training against young people from lower-income families has made the UK an 'under-educated and under-trained nation', the TUC warns today. It says in a submission to the National Committee on Education, a privately funded inquiry, that only 5 per cent of 18-year-olds with parents in manual jobs go on to higher education. Pupils from professional and managerial backgrounds are more likely to be accepted for higher education. Black and ethnic-minority students are under-represented in further and higher education. However, the belief that too little is invested in training is challenged in a book published today by the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market think tank. The book, by Mr Len Shackleton, an economist at Central London Polytechnic, says Britain could be providing too much training, because government policy is based on insufficient research and economic analysis. Opportunities for All. TUC, Congress House, Great Russell Street, London WC1B 3LS. Pounds 2. Training Too Much. Institute of Economic Affairs, 2 Lord North Street, London SW1P 3LB. Pounds 7.45.</p>

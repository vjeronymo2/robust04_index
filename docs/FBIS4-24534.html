			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Dongyun (3769 0392 0061)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 13 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Having  experienced the test of four price-rise peaks, including the one  happening last year, though commodity prices still rose month by  month in the first quarter of this year, Guangdong Province  remained unalarmed in the face of "rising prices" and managed to  regulate and control commodity prices in a steady and orderly  way.    Following the relatively sharp price rises generated by  grain  price fluctuations last year, plus the influence of the  "carry-on [qiao wei 5062 1442]" effect, Guangdong Province's  commodity prices kept on climbing up in the first quarter of  this year. Compared with the same period last year, the  commodity retail price index in this period increased by 20.5  percent or 0.4 percentage point higher than the country's  average level. Therefore, there was still a considerable gap  between this figure and the goal set last year by the provincial  government to keep price rises at about 12 percent.    In the first of quarter of this year, Guangdong devoted  efforts to strengthening the construction of the "shopping  basket" and "rice bag" projects to ensure production and supply  of the residents' basic daily necessities. In terms of the  "rice bag" program, while stabilizing the area of land sown to  grain crops, provincial financial departments allocated 150  million yuan to build 50 grain-producing-base counties within  three years starting from the beginning of this year, a grain  reserve system and a 250-million-yuan system of risk funds for  grain were set up, and the system of purchasing grain at the  protective prices was further implemented. In the "shopping  basket" program, continued efforts were made to stabilize and  expand the "shopping basket" bases; Guangzhou, Zhanjiang,  Shaoguan, and seven other cities established  500-million-yuan-or-so funds for regulating and controlling  prices of non-staple foods; and active efforts were made to open  wholesale markets for agricultural and sideline products and  market fairs, thus unclogging commodity channels.    At present, with the weakening of the "carry-on" effect and  the strengthening of regulation and control, Guangdong's  consumer goods prices, service charges, and capital goods prices  have dropped considerably. In the capital goods market, supply  has exceeded demand. The prices of daily-use consumer goods are  staying at the late-1993 levels and the prices of some of them  have steadied or gone down. Vegetable prices are relatively  stable. According to a survey conducted by the Guangzhou City  Statistics Bureau, compared with the previous month, the  commodity price index in March dropped by 1.8 percentage point.    Today most fellow countrymen have some understanding of the  "twin" relationship between economic growth rate and price  rises. Perhaps it is easier for Guangdong people, who are market  conscious, to comprehend the relationship.    Nevertheless, in terms of the overall picture of Guangdong's  market prices in the first quarter of this year, as the factors  generating price rises continue to expand in number, relevant  departments dare not lower their guard.    Guangdong's price rises in the first quarter of this year  were characterized by a high starting point and an overall rise  with the prices of the residents' daily necessities and service  charges staying high. During this period, the prices of food,  books, and magazines and the charges for communications and  medical and health-care services rose by over 20 percent, and  recently they registered another rise of 5.4 percent. The  general price rise in various cities of the province was  universally quite high. Yangjiang, Heyuan, Qingyuan, and  Zhanjiang Cities were among the cities with the highest  price-rise levels.    According to relevant statistics, compared with the  corresponding period last year, in the first quarter of this  year, investments by state-owned units increased by 43.3  percent, and total volume of consumer goods retail sales rose by  33 percent. This helped push market prices up. At the same  time, during the same period many major reform projects were  carried out. This also served as an important reason behind  price rises in Guangdong. According to calculations, the  adoption of a new taxation system, the unification of foreign  exchange rates, and the introduction of price reform alone have  driven up the province's commodity prices by about four  percentage points. In addition, man-made factors causing  inflation, such as wanton raising of prices and wanton  collection of fees, should not be ignored because they can make  a stormy sea stormier.    Jiang Shanli, director of the Guangdong Provincial Commodity  Price Bureau, summarized the province's market price situation  into 15 characters reading: The situation is quite grim.  Though facing great difficulties in regulating and controlling  market prices, we have confidence in doing so.    It has been learned that relevant departments in the  province  are taking corresponding measures, such as increasing effective  supplies, putting the scale of investment and credit under  control, strengthening the monitoring of prices of the  residents' daily necessities and service charges, and expediting  the pace of pricing legislation, to achieve the government-set  goal of price control for this year.    In the first quarter of this year, although Guangdong ranked  ninth in the country from its previous middle and lower level in  terms of price rises, people here believe that this does not  mean that the province's commodity price situation will further  deteriorate. On the contrary, although some hinterland  provinces and cities may achieve marked results in the short  term in their efforts to control prices by relying on  administrative measures and financial subsidies, this practice  can be called "drinking poisoned wine to quench the thirst." In  relying on the superiority of its relatively high marketization  level, Guangdong has upheld the dominant position of regulation  by market mechanisms and placed great stress on developing  production and invigorating circulation. From a long-term point  of view, this way of doing things is undoubtedly a wise move.</p>

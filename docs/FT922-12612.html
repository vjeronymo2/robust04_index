			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie edges towards all-time high THE UK equity market moved to within striking distance of its all-time high after another heavy wave of domestic and overseas buying interest stimulated by last week's Conservative victory in the general election. Yesterday's 39.7 jump took the FT-SE 100 share index up to 2,640.2, only some 40 points short of the all-time high of 2,679.6, reached on September 2, 1991. Over the past five trading sessions - or since polling day - the Footsie has risen almost 250 points, or 10.32 per cent per cent. There was further strong encouragement for the market, and more particularly for City investment houses, in the high level of turnover on the stockmarket since last Friday's election result. Yesterday turnover expanded to 829.3m shares, the second highest this year. This compared favourably with Tuesday's 601.8m shares and Monday's 629.3m but fell well short of last Friday's 1.34bn. The sharp upturn in the number of shares traded obviously brings with it a similar increase in the value of customer business and broker commissions. 'If nothing else, the Conservative election win has saved hundreds of jobs in the City,' said one broker. London was up and running from the outset, with strong buying of the Footsie future after hours on Tuesday leading the cash market higher. The future remained at a big premium to the cash market all day, closing some 47 points above the footsie and 25 points above fair value. Some traders said the market had been taken by surprise by the weight of money pouring into UK equities since the election. 'We expected a big jump but nothing like this,' said one who added that marketmakers, having sold out of what were generally small bull positions in equities, are now looking at short positions in many areas. The initial burst of strength in London was helped by the big gains on the world's two most important stockmarkets, Wall Street and Tokyo. Wall Street, which hit an all-time peak on Tuesday, was moving ahead strongly as London closed, while Tokyo, bruised and battered in the past few weeks, staged a good rally overnight. Worries that the market may have run ahead of itself in the post-election euphoria were not taken too seriously by senior dealers. 'We have not seen any real selling into the market and fund managers are very frightened to be out of equities.' He said the market was well aware of the likelihood of a big rights issue queue forming up, but mentioned the good performance of sterling and the recent signs that the economy is moving out of recession, albeit very slowly. Midland Bank remained the focus of attention as Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, made another unsuccessful attempt to place a block of 60m shares in Midland for the Kuwait Investment Office. Composite insurers surged higher although specialists cautioned that the sector, battered by a series of insurance disasters including natural disasters and colossal claims for mortgage indemnity, could well be first in the queue to raise much needed funds.</p>

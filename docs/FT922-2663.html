			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: SMI caught in a vicious circle - An acquisition-led expansion at the Italian metals concern has brought surging turnover but not profits growth SOCIETA Mettalurgica Italiana's (SMI) purchase of Kabelmetal, its bigger German rival, enabled it to double sales and become Europe's biggest maker of copper and alloy products. Turnover at the Florence-based group surged to L3,013bn (Dollars 2.5bn) last year thanks to the purchase of the German copper concern, formerly owned by the MAN group. However, its profits have remained static. The Kabelmetal deal was the latest and biggest step in SMI's L600bn expansion over the past five years, when it transformed itself from a collection of small Italian copper companies into a multinational with acquisitions in France, Spain and, most recently, Germany. Earnings, however, have not kept pace with growth. Net group profits after minority interests amounted to just L12.2bn in 1991, less than the L12.7bn made on turnover half as big as in 1990. The reason for the disappointing earnings lies in the depressed state of the construction industry in most European countries and the fact that SMI's capital has not kept pace with its acquisition-led expansion. SMI - led by Mr Luigi Orlando, a three-time deputy chairman of the Confindustria employers' federation - belongs to the exclusive club of companies which form the salotto buono - the good drawing room - of Italian private-sector industry. Its ownership reflects its pedigree. SMI, the main holding concern, holds 45 per cent of Europa Metalli, the chief operating arm, which, in turn, controls the group's foreign subsidiaries. SMI itself is 47 per cent owned by GIM, a financial holding company controlled by the Orlando family, which features a bevy of top Italian private sector names such as Pirelli and Mediobanca among its shareholders. Having a small base of stable shareholders has facilitated control by the Orlandos and the network of big Italian family-controlled companies, which are often linked by complex cross-shareholdings. However, the lack of a wide shareholder base is also one of the reasons why SMI's capitalisation has failed to rise at the same rate as its growth. The company is caught in a vicious circle. Foreign expansion has been essential to reap economies of scale and compete with bigger public and private-sector rivals abroad. Yet SMI's owners have been reluctant to pump in more capital to match its growth until earnings improve. But it is the lack of funds, and consequent heavy borrowing costs, which are among the factors now depressing profits. While the group's debt declined by around L50bn to L900bn last year, the total is still on a par with total shareholders' funds. Meanwhile, consolidated interest charges amounted to around L100bn last year, representing over 3 per cent of sales. 'That is still too high,' admits Mr Orlando. The problem is not entirely of SMI's making. The price for Kabelmetal rose unexpectedly after the German cartel office blocked MAN's original plans to reinvest the proceeds. The delay meant MAN missed the deadline for special tax breaks linked to its reinvestment plans, prompting it to demand a higher price and tougher payment terms for Kabelmetal. Instead of paying L276bn over several years, SMI had to deliver the full L410bn in cash. Consolidation of its acquisitions is SMI's top priority, says Mr Sergio Ceccuzzi, managing director. SMI has already divided product responsibilities between different parts of the group. Kabelmetal, by far the biggest single unit, has been given sole charge of material purchasing. Research has been split between the French, German and Italian operations, with a single manager in charge, while SMI itself has closed some factories in Italy. Small improvements have already been evident on the bottom line. Gross operating earnings, although partly swollen by the inclusion of Kabelmetal, climbed to L235bn from L106bn in 1990. Productivity improvements are also responsible for the operating improvement. However, Mr Orlando stresses SMI will have to do much better before turning to shareholders for more capital. Much will depend on the market. SMI's French and Spanish arms failed to make money last year, while its UK operations were also badly affected by the crisis in the building trade. Meanwhile, prices for copper products remain depressed by overcapacity and price competition. The company hopes its bigger size will give it greater leverage over suppliers and customers, and leave it better placed to sit out price wars in the industry. Hence its decision not to cut its L35 dividend for ordinary shares and L70 for savings stock this year. Explaining the decision to leave the dividend intact, Mr Orlando stresses SMI's efficiency improvements should lead to higher earnings this year, even without an upturn in the market. Eventually, the group will need more capital. With its domestic shareholder base limited, SMI is already trying to become better known abroad. In February, it launched an Ecu100m commercial paper programme, organised by a trio of French, Swiss and Italian banks, as its latest step to become more familiar on foreign markets. However, Mr Ceccuzzi has no false hopes about the role of foreign investors. 'The image of our industry is not always at its best. It's almost come to be seen as one an industry without a future,' he admits. 'It's up to us to show we can set ourselves targets and then show results,' adds Mr Orlando. 'Only then can we ask shareholders for more cash.'</p>

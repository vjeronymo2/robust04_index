			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: BBA Over a 10-year spell, shareholders have little reason to think kindly of their investment in BBA. Equity shareholders' funds are barely equal to the amount that they have subscribed in rights issues. Total returns  - including dividends - are somewhat shy of what might have been earned in the building society. A year ago the company raised Pounds 128m on the basis of a maintained dividend, yet investors now find that the promise is valid for a single payment. After a decade of frenetic dealing and fund raising, only merchant banks and lawyers have reason to rub their hands at the mention of BBA's name. With a new chief executive, Mr Bob Quarta, investors must decide whether the future will be different from the past. The company gamely argues that its new-found zeal for cost cutting will produce margins in excess of 10 per cent. And while the reduced dividend leaves a sour taste in the mouth, it is probably the right pragmatic decision. It is certainly a marked contrast to Lucas, which continues to fund its excessive payout in increasingly convoluted ways. Rationalisation and slow recovery in the continental European car market will improve returns. Some of the industrial operations are already up to the mark. Aviation, however, faces a longer struggle to justify its place in the portfolio. Investors will have to decide whether they trust Mr Quarta to knit a coherent whole from disparate parts. He has a good reputation, but it is not an enviable position from which to start.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Greek minister says poll crucial - Questions on Europe Theodore Pangalos, 56, Greece's European affairs minister, presiding over the EU's foreign ministers council until June. A former lecturer in development economics at Paris university, he has practised law and edited a left-wing journal in Athens. How important are the elections? 'They are a fundamental test of the European public's interest in European unification. They are the first elections allowing European citizens to participate whatever their place of residence.' Should the parliament be given greater powers? 'The parliament will actively participate in preparing the 1996 conference to reform EU institutions. We should aim for an increased role for the only directly elected body for European citizens.' What should be the EU's priorities in the next few years? 'Employment and migration flows will be the main economic and social problems for the next decade. If we don't answer these two challenges positively, we will have a serious political and social crisis.' Should the EU give priority to deepening integration among the 12, or to widening it towards eastern Europe? 'The enlargement to 16 has almost entirely exhausted the limits of the EU's capacity to absorb new members. Two small countries like Cyprus and Malta could start negotiations in the immediate future. Further enlargement will entail radical reform of EU structures.' Are you worried that German unification and an eastwards shift in the EU's centre of gravity could harm Greece's interests? ''Germanisation' of the Union can be an irrational anxiety. Strengthening the EU is the best way to avoid such dangers. Loose co-operation limited to economic or commercial interests could produce or increase domination.' Will assistance for poorer EU states eventually have to be cut? 'What you call 'assistance' is structural action aimed at increasing social and regional cohesion and helping recovery. 'Such action is essential if we want more than a simple free trade zone.' Is the aim of economic and monetary union by 1999 still practicable? 'The Maastricht treaty provides the route to Emu. Some countries might not satisfy the criteria in 1999, and Greece might be one of them. Such countries will have to wait and make further efforts. The world will not end in 1999.'</p>

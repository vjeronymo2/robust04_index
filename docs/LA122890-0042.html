			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> DALE'S: A NEW FRENCH REVOLUTION IN WEST HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> For those West Hollywood folk who want a friendly, unpretentious, imaginative  little bistro at their disposal, Dale's Bistro may be a dream come true.  </P> <P> It's a storefront restaurant, actually two small storefronts, merged and  updated with enough Post-Modern architectural flourishes -- a linoleum floor  that looks like textured sheet metal, a green marbleized column, some swoops  and curves in the plasterwork -- to put us firmly in the 1990s. There is also  decent Abstract Expressionism on the walls; cheerful French music, and enough  bistro paraphernalia -- a propeller fan; small, dark bentwood chairs; dark wood  wainscotting, and a potted palm -- to set us firmly in casual, nostalgic  Francophilia.  </P> <P> But don't get too comfy envisioning the dark, comfortable anachronisms of Left  Bank nostalgia cuisine.  </P> <P> Tonight's menu, Dale's Beast Row, reveals a playful scuffle between  contemporary California cooking and old-style French American Bistro. A Caesar  salad is reinforced with radicchio and endive. Les escargots are wrapped in won  tons. The steak Diane snags a Jack Daniels sauce. And a classic onion soup  winds up with three cheeses -- one of them, we are told, is goat.  </P> <P> Other old French American cliches are similarly exploded: There are no rude  waiters, no temperamental chef. Our waitress is a sweet-tempered young woman  and Dale Payne himself ambles around the dining room chatting with customers  and pouring coffee and dashing back to the kitchen with precision timing to  finish orders.  </P> <P> The thing is, Payne can afford to reinvent the snail, fraternize with the  customers, put crayons and butcher paper on his tables, enjoy himself on the  job and otherwise push and bend all the so-called rules of restaurant  management. Because when it comes right down to it, the man can cook.  </P> <P> He has, in fact, cooked in good restaurants all over town -- Michael's, Spago,  Bistango, Les Anges. And so, a soft, creamy, perfectly grilled cake of polenta  comes with sharp-tasting shards of olives and roasted peppers and a lively  buttermilk pesto sauce. The fried calamari has a delightfully spiced breading  and a peppery, sinus-clearing rouille. Both the Caesar and the mixed baby green  salad are fresh and well-dressed. A chicken gumbo soup is earthy and spicy and  totally satisfying.  </P> <P> Entrees come with generous portions of wild rice pilaf and ratatouille, both of  which fill the plate but don't particularly excite the palate. The grilled  shrimp were plump and so fresh they made you want to sing sea chanteys;  unfortunately, the curry sauce they were served with was vague and  uninteresting. A roast lamb with mole was a noble experiment; the classic  southern Mexican pepper-chocolate sauce tended to bring out all the raucous  gaminess of the lamb, and it might have better pleased those whose tastes run  wilder than mine.  </P> <P> Otherwise, all the other entrees I tasted were superb. My personal favorite was  the chicken roasted with Provencal herbs and served with a grainy mustard  sauce. The meat was juicy, the sauce was sassy without being overpowering. Also  lovely was a pork loin with red onion confit; the meat was cooked so well it  provided the satisfying succulence found in good veal -- without exacting any  veal-eating guilt.  </P> <P> It's tough, after two courses at Dale's, to have room for dessert. We did  manage a slice of decent apple tarte tatin one night, but for the most part  were happy ending up with a cup of delicious decaf and the opportunity to  finish the crayon drawings begun before dinner.  </P> <P> Dale's Bistro, 361 N. La Cienega Blvd., West Hollywood, (213) 659-3996. Open  for lunch Tuesday-Friday 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m. Open for dinner Tuesday-Saturday  6-10:30 p.m. Beer and wine. Parking in rear. Dinner for two, food only,  $30-$50.  </P></p>

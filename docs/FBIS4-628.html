			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Fall of Financial Rand -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English  on  13 April in a page-12 editorial remarks that the "free fall" of  the financial rand (finrand) on 11 April is "simply a direct  message of a massive collapse in overseas confidence." However,  the "finrand's weakening will not affect the economy materially  in the short term. This market is relatively thin, restricted to  non-residents, and subject to wide fluctuation. But the fall  has wider implications: continuing fears about our future could  kill hopes of massive investment in this country and, without  this, the hope of massive reconstruction will also die." Only  the country's leaders have a chance to "pull us back from the  abyss."    `Folly' To Send Peacekeeping Force to East Rand Townships --  A second editorial on the same page believes it was "misguided"  to deploy units of the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF) in the  troubled East Rand townships. The record of the NPKF "hardly  inspires confidence." THE STAR refers to "desertions,  undisciplined behaviour, fractiousness and racist outburts," and  "to cap it all: only days before its first graduates were sent  into the field, its chief of staff was summarily dismissed after  being charged with drunken driving in an official vehicle." To  send the NPKF to the East Rand townships seems "the height of  folly, particularly as the force is seen by pro-IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party] hostel residents as the ANC's armed wing in a new  guise."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   SANCO `Conscience' To Prod New Government Welcome --  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 13 April in a page-12  editorial states that groups such as the South African National  Civic Organization (SANCO) "have a useful role in a future South  Africa." "True, SANCO, or at least many of its most prominent  leaders like Moses Mayekiso and his advisers, are  unrehabilitated Marxists wh? have made few allowances to the way  the world has changed over the past 10 years, and their  perspectives are, for that reason, often rather flawed." But,  "whatever SANCO's shortcomings, it will do no harm to have a  left-wing `conscience' prodding those in the new government who  may be prone to adopt the fat cat attitudes of their  predecessors."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Paper `Pessimistic' About International Mediation Outcome --  "It is naive to believe the mediation team will be able to solve  the immediate and practical problems related to the elections  later this month," declares a page-6 editorial in Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 13 April. "The violence in places like  Natal has gained a momentum of its own and will feed on itself  for some time to come. The IFP's proposal for a postponement of  the poll is also a non- starter with the ANC adamant April 27  `is sacrosanct'. We will have to resign ourselves to the fact  that a free and fair election in kwaZulu is not going to be  possible and that the birth of a democratic South Africa will be  marked by bloodshed. The mediation team will be well advised to  focus primarily on the outstanding constitutional issues like  the powers of regions." Amicable mediation and agreements on  these issues "could defuse some of the tensions in the country  and help the proposed Government of National Unity to find its  feet. While we are pessimistic about the outcome, we urge all  the parties involved to give the mediation process their best  shot."</p>

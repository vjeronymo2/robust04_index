			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article based on announcement at news conference by </F> Jindrich Vodicka, minister of labor and social affairs: "Toward  the End of the Year, Social Security Payments Will Rise"]    [Text] Prague--An increase in social security  transfers, including pensions, is being readied by the Ministry  of Labor and Social Affairs. This adjustment should come about  during the fourth quarter of this year. At yesterday's news  conference, this was announced by Minister Jindrich Vodicka.    Measures being readied for families with children will have  to do with adjustment of the additional payments for children  (the ministry anticipates an increase of between 40 and 50  korunas [Kc] a month), adjustments in the state equalization  contribution for foster children (it will rise approximately by  Kc200 for a family operating within the one-and-one-half and  double multiple of the minimum living costs in terms of their  income). The adjustment figures on increasing support payments  for the birth of a child (by Kc500) and on increasing the  parental contribution. The ministry is also proposing increasing  burial payments by approximately Kc2,000; adjusting the  contribution for wives and children of soldiers (by  approximately Kc100); the contribution toward the expenses for  quarters for a soldier (by approximately 10 percent); and  payments supporting alimentation and other basic requirements of  citizens who depend on catering services (by approximately  Kc100).    The above amounts are still to be discussed by the  government. But the minister was not expecting any fundamental  changes in the amounts he proposes. He is also proposing the  valorization of pensions, which should also come about in the  fourth quarter but will most likely occur a month later. The  valorization is to be made up of two portions according to the  proposal. The state equalization contribution is to be valorized  first, which means that all pensioners would receive an  additional payment of Kc220. Next, pensions are to be increased  by 5 percent. On average, pensions should rise by Kc360, which,  according to Minister Vodicka, represents a 12-percent rise in  pensions.</p>

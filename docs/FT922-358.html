			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Nigerian court to decide on treason trial today A Nigerian magistrates' court will decide today whether to proceed with the treason trial of five detained political activists. The case, which has become Nigeria's most burning political issue, has pushed to the sidelines this week's parliamentary elections. A decision to continue the prosecution of the five men, despite a restraining injunction issued by a Lagos High Court last week, is likely to fuel the confrontation between Gen Ibrahim Babangida's military regime and human rights activists. The case has come to the forefront as the government enters the last critical six months of its precarious transition to civilian rule. Nationwide elections for Nigeria's Senate and House of Representatives are due to take place on Saturday, the first parliamentary elections after nine years of military rule. The five men were all arrested in a clampdown last month following violent riots over fuel shortages and the inflationary impact of a big devaluation. The detainees include Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti, chairman of the Campaign for Democracy and president of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, an activist-lawyer, and Mr Segun Maiyegun, president of the banned National Association of Nigerian Students. Shortly before Dr Ransome-Kuti's arrest the Campaign for Democracy issued a statement accusing the military government of 'gross mismanagement of the economy, incompetence and widespread corruption'. Two weeks ago the five were arraigned in a magistrates' court in Gwagwalada, 65km from Abuja, the new federal capital. They were charged with conspiracy to treasonable felony by attempting illegally to compel the government to its programme for transition to civilian rule. The activists have argued that the transition programme is thoroughly flawed, is not democratic and is being dictated and manipulated by the military to ensure that the army will return to power. They have called for a national conference to decide Nigeria's political future. Last week the EC added its voice to criticism about the detentions. The military government has been accusedof 'gross mismanagement of the economy, incompetence and widespread corruption'</p>

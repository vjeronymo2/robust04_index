"We have discussed ways of improving bilateral economic  ties,  particularly trade and investments," Australia's trade minister,  Bob McMullan, told the press after a meeting with his Indonesian  counterpart, S.B. Yudono, here Monday.    The two ministers also talked about matters related to the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.    The two-way trade between the two countries in the  January-November 1993 period reached 1.96 billion U.S. dollars,  up by 3.15 percent over the figure in the same period in 1992,  but Indonesia sustained a deficit of 513.5 million U.S. dollars.    In 1982, Indonesia sustained a deficit of 254.9 million U.S.  dollars from its trade with Australia, and the figure swelled to  666.8 million U.S. dollars a decade later.    In the meantime, Indonesia's exports registered at 158.6  million U.S. dollars in 1982 rose to 746.125 million U.S.  dollars a decade later.    On the occasion, the Australian trade minister invited  Indonesian businessmen to invest in Australia and pledged that  Australian entrepreneurs will do likewise in Indonesia.    In an effort to boost trade relations, Indonesia has offered  40 percent tariff binding for 8,877 post headings consisting of  7,536 post headings for industrial products and 1,341 post  headings for agricultural products.    Indonesia has also asked that 505 post headings are excepted  from the tariff binding on the grounds of security, general  exception, or being still needed for national economic  development.    The products whose exception has been requested comprise  inter alia iron and steel products and motorized vehicles and  their components.    Regarding rice, Indonesia is willing to give market access  to  70,000 tons of rice annually, a quantity equal to 50 percent of  import average in 1986-88.    Indonesia has also offered market access to trade in  services  involving five sectors -- tourism, sea transportation, finance,  industry/construction, and telecommunications.    The two sides have also agreed to set up working groups on  trade, industry, investment, agriculture, and food to improve  bilateral economic ties.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Row strains new Italian cabinet AN unprecedented row has broken out within Italy's new government, barely hours after Mr Giulio Andreotti, the caretaker prime minister, announced the list of ministers in his new administration, Italy's 50th since the Second World War. Three Republican Party ministers have decided not to take up their posts, following claims by the Republicans that Mr Andreotti did not give them the ministerial posts promised in last week's talks on resolving the country's political crisis. The new crisis within a crisis means only four of the five parties which have governed Italy in coalition since the early 1980s are likely to be represented in the government. However, the Republicans are expected to form part of the governing majority in parliament. The party, whose secretary, Mr Giorgio La Malfa, resigned on Saturday following the debacle over the cabinet positions, is due to meet this afternoon to decide its next move. Meanwhile, Mr Andreotti has taken all three of the disputed ministries - state shareholdings, culture and regional affairs - under his wing on a temporary basis, at least until the new government presents itself before parliament tomorrow. In a statement on Saturday, the Republicans accused Mr Andreotti of not observing the rules of consulting them adequately in forming the new government. Mr Andreotti, whose task in allocating ministries has been complicated by the need to find positions for the left wing of his own Christian Democratic party, which has now decided to re-enter the cabinet, said that ministerial positions had been offered to the three candidates the Republicans put forward. The dispute has been exacerbated by the fact that the Republicans were not offered the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The portfolio was formerly occupied by one of their leaders, Mr Oscar Mammi. The ministry has grown in political importance as a result of new laws passed last year on monopoly control in broadcasting and the media. This legislation will seriously affect the activities of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's media magnate. Meanwhile, President Francesco Cossiga, has attempted to explain his acquiescence to the new government's decision to put off discussion of constitutional reform until after next year's general elections. In a rambling television interview, the president said that avoiding early elections in the last year of the present parliament had to take priority over all else. That is a far cry from his earlier unparallelled political interventions, in which Mr Cossiga endeavoured to place constitutional reform at the top of the political agenda. Despite all his fighting talk about using his powers to the full to ensure political reform, Mr Cossiga appears to have accepted the new government's programme without demur.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Management: China's treasure chest unlocked / Assessing the potential for UK businesses hoping to strike gold on the streets of Beijing There are no gold bars lying on the streets of Beijing,' according to Imperial Chemical Industries chairman Sir Denys Henderson. But with 1.1bn people in the provinces surrounding the Chinese capital, UK companies, including ICI, are convinced there is treasure to be found. 'You come away from China with a sense of the enormousness of the place and the vastness of the opportunity,' says Bryan Lodder, chief executive of listed textile company Parkland group. 'But after a while, you also consider the magnitude of the pitfalls.' China's advantages - low cost manufacturing and an enormous population starved of Western goods and technology - have long been well-known, but in the early days there was limited scope to exploit this. When Deng Xiaoping opened the door to China in 1979, it was merely ajar. The only opportunity for foreign companies was to set up export-processing joint ventures. Times have now changed. China's determination to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has forced open its own market. However, with factors such as the country's antiquated bureaucracy still hampering the supply of the domestic market, the manufacturing joint venture remains a popular way of proceeding. According to John Beyer, director of China-British Trade Group, which advises UK companies on activity in China, there are around 300 UK joint venture companies in China, and the number is growing rapidly. A joint venture takes much time and money, but it provides the significant advantages of proximity to the market place, and the absence of duties, that are essential for lower-margin or perishable goods. It also provides a relationship with a partner that can potentially ease the bureaucratic burdens, and even provide a client list. According to Derek Welch, Far East Business Development manager at Courtaulds, 'the key issues are trustworthiness and influence', when choosing a joint venture partner. The partner's primary role is to provide the land, the workers, and also the numerous chops (government stamps) that are necessary for planning permission and licences. The overseas company provides capital, technical expertise and machinery. Most problems with joint ventures stem from either having a crooked partner, or wanting different things from the relationship. Understanding the business partner is important, but a company must also clearly define its objectives and ensure these are fulfilled in the details of any agreement. 'You need a lot of patience', says Welch. 'The Chinese have a philosophy that if they wait long enough, they will get whatever they want.' For companies with sufficient capital, there are obvious advantages to controlling the joint venture, and therefore its management. United Biscuits owned 60 per cent of its first manufacturing joint venture, but still had problems when its Hong Kong partner attempted to restrict supplies of imported raw materials. It wanted to use local products to fatten margins. Rather than risk compromising on quality, United Biscuits had to buy out the partner's 30 per cent holding (10 per cent was held by the township where it built its plant). Western companies should at least find that potential partners are in plentiful supply. According to William Whitely, director of valve manufacturer Rotork: 'At the moment, you can't walk down the street without someone trying to sell a joint venture manufacturing agreement to you.' Chinese companies can reduce their tax bill by around two thirds by linking up with a foreign company; they also want access to the technology. Over the next few years, foreign companies will have an alternative route to manufacturing in China, by buying one of many ailing state-owned industrial companies. But Beyer suggests that at present this is only for pioneers. For those companies seeking a substantial new export market, the choice is between setting up a direct sales network or using an agent or local partner. Setting up on one's own is more expensive, and fraught with the difficulties inherent in penetrating an alien market. 'China took the basic decision 500 years ago to be an inward-looking society. That whole mind-set is still in place, but agents should understand that and work around it,' says Giles Chance, chairman of Chance China, a consultancy and agency company. For capital goods, where the British company may have a product that the Chinese need, but cannot produce, the agent can provide access to the complex decision making process. But for those with a long-term perspective, direct access must be preferable. Welch, of Courtaulds, says: 'If you sell through a Hong Kong agent, you don't know where the product is going, and you therefore don't know how to develop the market, because you don't have access to the necessary information.' Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare company, has started a network of wholly-owned sales and marketing offices to help it build a presence in what is the world's fifth largest healthcare market. Allied Lyons has also progressed from an initial 40 per cent stake in a Chinese winery, to build up eight wholly-owned sales and marketing offices, with 300 Chinese-speaking staff. Joint venture production agreements are now planned. The number of businessmen on trade and investment missions to China is testimony to China's growing appeal. Lodder, of Parkland, went to China with the view that it should be only a long-term objective to start manufacturing there. After ten days, he came back saying: 'I now think we should be there within two to five years'.</p>

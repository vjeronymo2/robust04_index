			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taipei, Jan 14 (AFP)--China announced Friday that  high-level talks with Taiwan would resume on January 31, but  Taipei retorted it was considering suspending the key meeting,  citing China's "unfriendly moves" towards it.    In Beijing, the official CHINA DAILY reported that Tang  Shubei, vice chairman of the Association for Relations Across  the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) would meet with his Taiwan counterpart  Chiao Jun-ho on January 31 to discuss economic "and other  non-political issues."    The five-day talks in Beijing were expected to pave the way  for a meeting between ARATS chairman Wang Daohan and the  chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Koo  Chen-fu, who first met for a landmark get-together in Singapore  in April, analysts said.    CHINA DAILY quoted Tang as saying he hoped his talks with  Chiao would settle matters concerning the Wang-Koo meeting and  set the starting date for talks on economic, scientific and  technological cooperation.    But in Taipei, a mainland affairs official said Friday that  Taiwan was considering suspending the talks.    "We have decided to make a re-evaluation on whether the  talks  between Chiao Jen-ho and Tang Shubei should be held as planned,"  said Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of the cabinet-level Mainland  Affairs Council (MAC).    "Mainland China has made a series of unfriendy moves against  us recently and set pre-conditions on topics to be discussed (in  the meeting,) trying to deny our legal jurisdiction by avoiding  political issues," Kao said.    The various steps Beijing had taken to isolate Taiwan and  its  effort to threaten the island militarily "had caused negative  response from the people here and undoubtedly led to adverse  impact on relations across the Taiwan Strait," Kao said.    Taiwan's threat came only two days after China and France  issued a communique in which Paris had pledged not to sell  Taiwan any more arms in order to normalize relations with  Beijing following a year-long freeze caused by its supply of 60  Mirage 2005 jet fighters to the island.    The landlocked African state of Lesotho also announced  Wednesday the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with  China and severed official ties with Taipei.    No problems could be really solved if the mainland continued  the "you die, I live" mentality in dealing with Taiwan, Kao  warned.    The Chinese communists drove the Nationalist troops to  Taiwan  in 1949 in a civil war and still claims sovereignty over the  island. Beijing has barred other countries from making any major  arms sales to or forging diplomatic ties with Taiwan which it  considers part of its territory.    Tang had planned to visit Taiwan last month, but the trip  was  cancelled after talks in Taipei failed to reach an agreement on  the thorny issue of repatriating Chinese hijackers to the  mainland.    The hijacking issue and fishing disputes were major  obstacles  to the successful conclusion of the three previous rounds of  talks between the two semi-official bodies which also got bogged  down on jurisdiction and sovereignty.    A spate of 10 hijackings in 1993 added a new soure of  friction between Beijing and Taipei which have both claimed to  be the legitimate government of all China since the communists  forced the nationalists to flee to Taiwan in 1949 following a  civil war on the mainland.    ARATS closed a two-day meeting in Beijing Thursday during  which it decided to establish a new economic department to  respond to increasing economic and trade relations across the  Taiwan Strait.    SEF and ARATS were set up in 1990 as nominally private  bodies  to get around Taiwan's 44-year-old policy of no direct contact  with Beijing.</p>

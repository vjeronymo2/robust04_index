			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Tighter control of derivatives urged: Report to Congress warns of threat to financial system Inadequate regulation of the rapidly growing markets in derivatives, financial instruments such as swaps and options, poses a threat to the US and international financial system, according to a landmark report to Congress published yesterday. The report, by the General Accounting Office, recommends legislation to extend regulation to all financial firms which deal in derivatives, as well as a consistent approach to regulation from the various financial authorities in the US. In an unusual show of solidarity, a coalition of trade groups representing the banking and securities industries issued a joint statement condemning the call for tighter regulation. The report will increase the pressure for US legislation to control derivatives markets. Commissioned two years ago, it concludes that much of the activity in over-the-counter markets in instruments such as interest rate swaps and currency options is unregulated and concentrated among a few big institutions. The agency, which acts as Congress's investigative arm, warns that the failure or withdrawal of any one of these institutions 'could undermine stability in several markets simultaneously, which could lead to a chain of market withdrawals, possible firm failures, and a systemic crisis'. Mr Edward Markey, chairman of the key House Telecommunications and Finance sub-committee, which is responsible for drafting legislation covering the securities industry, indicated for the first time that he will push for legislation. 'The question is no longer whether regulatory or legislative changes will be made affecting the derivatives markets, but what form such changes should take,' he said. Staff members of the House Banking Committee, which already has its own bill in preparation, indicated that the report would improve the chances of legislation being passed. Lawmakers will have the first opportunity to air their concerns today, as Mr Markey's committee and the senate banking committee will hold hearings on the subject. Mr Charles Bowsher, comptroller general and head of the GAO, will appear before both to answer questions on the report. However, early legislation in the area is unlikely, a staff member of Mr Markey's committee indicated. He said a bill will probably not be ready before the July recess. The House banking committee expects to publish a final version of its own bill early next month. Any legislation is likely to be opposed by the derivatives industry. Yesterday, the Securities Industry Association, the American Bankers Association, the International Swap and Derivatives Association and three other financial services trade groups warned that further regulation would harm the US economy by increasing the cost and reducing the availability of derivative transactions. They criticised the GAO study for being out of date and for failing to take into account changes that derivatives dealers and users have made in recent years to improve disclosure, internal controls and risk management techniques. Derivatives, said the trade groups, 'are an essential component of modern financial activity'. Rather than heightening risk in the financial system, the trade groups said derivatives make it possible to quantify and manage risks more effectively than ever before.

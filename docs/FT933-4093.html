			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Jubilee Line extension looks set for go-ahead THE JUBILEE Line Underground extension to Canary Wharf in east London is almost certain to go ahead, after months of negotiations between banks and the government over the private sector's promised Pounds 400m contribution to the project. A banker to the project said that all material disagreements had been resolved. Eleven commercial banks led by Lloyds will today announce a financial reconstruction of Canary Wharf, which has been in administration under insolvency procedures for more than a year. The 11 lent Pounds 600m to fund construction. The rescue of Canary Wharf - which was built by Olympia &amp; York of Canada, the world's biggest property developer until it collapsed last year - has been dependent on an agreement being reached with the government on building the Tube extension. Banks have been prepared to inject new funds into Canary Wharf only if they could be confident that the Jubilee extension would be built. As part of the reconstruction Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants acting as administrators to the project, are providing creditors with details of a proposed settlement of claims. If creditors accept Canary Wharf will come out of administration under a company voluntary arrangement. It would be the first time that a big company emerged from administration as a going concern. The European Investment Bank, owned by the European Community, is providing Pounds 98m so that the first two tranches of the private sector's contribution can be made. Plans for the Pounds 1.7bn London Crossrail east-west rail link have run into a delay. London Underground confirmed last night that the first meeting of the Crossrail Bill committee, scheduled for next month, had been postponed. The government is continuing its search for cuts in the cost of the scheme and has 'asked for the delay so we can look at costs', London Underground said.</p>

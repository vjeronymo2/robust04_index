And Foothill won the  race in convincing fashion.  </P> <P> Foothill was timed in 3 minutes 6.88 seconds with Mission Viejo second in  3:10.32. The victory gave Foothill 147 points to end Mission Viejo's 14-year  reign as 4-A champion.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo was second with 115.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley won its third consecutive girls' title with 166 points.  Mission Viejo was second with 156.  </P> <P> The last team to win a 4-A boys' title besides Mission Viejo was Foothill, in  1974.  </P> <P> Friday, the teams were even through the first two legs of the deciding race,  but Andy Musch gave Foothill a 25-yard advantage with 100 yards to go. Brian  Cowdell maintained that lead on Mission Viejo's Tsukasa Kawabuchi down the  stretch.  </P> <P> Kawabuchi earlier swam the 100 freestyle in 46.56 seconds to edge Cowdell and  also won the 50 freestyle in 21.19.  </P> <P> Ron Scott was Foothill's only individual champion, winning the 100 butterfly in  50.30.  </P> <P> In the girls' competition, Amy Shaw was the driving force behind Capistrano  Valley's victory.  </P> <P> She won the 200 freestyle in 1:47.91 and the 500 freestyle in 4:46.45.  </P> <P> The Cougars also received a strong performance from sprinter Christy Carolin,  who won the 50 freestyle in 23.94. She finished second in the 100 freestyle in  52.26.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo, which won 11 consecutive girls' titles in 1976-86, finished  second for the third straight year.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo set the only Southern Section record during the meet as its  girls' 400 freestyle relay team swam 3:28.56.  </P></p>

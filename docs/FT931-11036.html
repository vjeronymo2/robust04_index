			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Northwest Air deficit soars NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier in which KLM Royal Dutch Airlines holds a significant minority stake, yesterday reported an after-tax loss of Dollars 89.1m, before special charges, in the fourth quarter. This compares with a Dollars 79.2m loss for the same period of 1991, and brings the after-tax loss for the year to Dollars 156m - substantially increased from the Dollars 3.1m deficit seen in 1991. Including charges related to accounting changes, quarterly and annual losses for the airline operations were Dollars 207.2m and Dollars 383m respectively. Meanwhile, NWA, the privately-owned parent company, incurred losses of Dollars 139m (against Dollars 164.3m) and Dollars 405.1m (Dollars 316.9m) in the fourth-quarter and 12-month periods respectively, with the charges excluded. With the addition of these items, the deficit widened to Dollars 682.4m in the final three months of the year, and Dollars 1.06bn in 1992 overall. Revenues were virtually unchanged at Dollars 1.93bn in the final quarter, but increased by 5.3 per cent for the year overall to Dollars 8.13bn. Northwest's figures complete the results season for the leading US airlines. With the exception of Southwest Airlines, all carriers have shown heavy fourth-quarter and annual losses before the accounting-related charges. Mr John Dasburg, Northwest's chief executive, summed up the prevailing view of the airline companies yesterday when he said the results 'underscore the extremely difficult and predatory pricing environment in which this industry operated beginning in April 1992'. 'The pricing environment and the slow economic recovery both domestically and internationally made 1992 the third bleak year in a row for this industry,' he noted.</p>

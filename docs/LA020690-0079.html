			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH IN STATE FOR 2 DAYS OF FENCE MENDING;  </P> <P> POLITICS: GOP INSIDERS SEE THE TRIP AS A BID TO EASE CONCERN THAT CALIFORNIA IS  BEING SHORTCHANGED IN WHITE HOUSE APPOINTMENTS.  </P> <P> President Bush's two-day California tour, which begins today, is viewed by  state Republican insiders as part of a stepped-up effort to allay concerns that  the White House has given short shrift to California, particularly in  high-visibility appointments.  </P> <P> The effort to mend fences comes as the state faces a crucial gubernatorial race  that will be pivotal to the redrafting of congressional lines. California is  expected to gain five to seven new seats when the governor and state  Legislature draw new boundaries after the 1990 Census.  </P> <P> Bush, who made only one extensive trip to California last year and a short  visit to tour earthquake damage in the fall, plans to return again at the end  of the month and is likely to make several more trips before year's end. Vice  President Dan Quayle also plans frequent visits, largely to raise money for  Republican Sen. Pete Wilson's campaign for governor.  </P> <P> "There's a sense the White House has an East Coast focus and has not really  been in touch with California, Californians and California issues," said Steven  A. Merksamer, Gov. George Deukmejian's former chief of staff who is now a  private attorney and part-time Wilson adviser.  </P> <P> The White House, while aware of the grumbling in the nation's most populous  state, maintains that Californians have gotten at least their fair share of  senior appointments.  </P> <P> "The previous President was a Californian, and there was much more emphasis on  California because he was from the home state," said White House Personnel  Director Charles G. Untermeyer. But he maintained that the complaints about  insufficient appointees are unfounded.  </P> <P> California is listed as the residence of more Bush appointees to senior  government positions requiring Senate confirmation than any other state except  Virginia and Maryland, with their large number of career federal employees,  Untermeyer said. The state's share of the approximately 745 higher-level Bush  appointments, he said, is comparable to the numbers from Texas, Bush's adopted  home.  </P> <P> Others, however, say the White House statistics are misleading.  </P> <P> "The real question is not overall numbers but clout," said Dixon Arnett, a  Washington lobbyist who was once Wilson's legislative director. "And California  clearly does not have people with clout in appointments as much as we used to."  </P> <P> Moreover, several prominent appointees are officially listed as Californians  but have little connection with the state's political machinery. These include  the three highest-ranking appointees on Untermeyer's list: U.S. Trade  Representative Carla Hills, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins and Michael J.  Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.  </P> <P> The two highest-ranking members of the present Administration who are  recognized within the state as bona fide California political appointees are  Deputy Agriculture Secretary Jack C. Parnell and Deputy Transportation  Secretary Elaine L. Chao. Both had the active backing of Wilson and Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Given the state's enormous political importance -- it will provide roughly  one-fifth of the electoral votes needed by a presidential nominee and as much  as 12% of the House of Representatives in 1992 -- some GOP activists maintain  that it is in Bush's interest to have someone highly placed in his  Administration as an informal liaison to the state.  </P> <P> "I would have thought the Administration would have wanted an ear to the  ground, someone from California who would be an ambassador to California as  well as whatever function they were appointed to," said a prominent California  Republican.  </P> <P> Some of the state's Republican leaders deny that California has been overlooked  politically. They note, for example, that Steve Kinney, a former Deukmejian  fund-raiser, has been appointed the national party's director for the Southwest  region, which includes California. The appointment was made by Republican  National Chairman Lee Atwater, Bush's premier political strategist.  </P> <P> The complaints about a lack of appreciation of California's assets have been  registered against a backdrop of eight years when Reagan and an inner circle  filled with Californians ran the government. Previously, Richard Nixon, another  Californian, put his stamp on the capital's political hierarchy for six years  between 1968 and 1974 -- giving the White House a California flavor for 14 of  the 20 years that preceded Bush.  </P> <P> "George Bush's circle of friends are not from California necessarily. They are  from Texas and the East Coast," said Kenneth L. Khachigian, a San Clemente  lawyer who was Reagan's chief speech writer and a senior adviser to Quayle  during the campaign. "The vice president's from the Midwest. Those are always  the two greatest forces in any appointments process."  </P> <P> Moreover, Khachigian and others point out that while Bush raised millions of  dollars in the state, California did not play a central role in his nomination.  Deukmejian steadfastly refused to endorse in the primary and many of the  state's top Republicans followed his lead.  </P> <P> "More than anything else you remember those states that were with you before  the convention," Khachigian said.  </P> <P> Deukmejian, who was considered at one time as a possible running mate for Bush,  put his organization to work for the GOP ticket in the general election. The  Republicans narrowly carried the state despite a massive grass-roots effort for  Democrat Michael S. Dukakis.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, since Bush's election tensions have flared between the White  House and Deukmejian as well as Wilson, the GOP's probable gubernatorial  nominee this year.  </P> <P> Deukmejian felt he was snubbed during a Bush visit to the state last April;  Wilson has sparked anger in the White House by opposing Bush on votes against  the development of the FSX fighter plane for Japan and, last month, on China  policy.  </P> <P> But, with this antagonism reportedly smoothed over, Bush will attend a  $1,000-a-ticket fund-raiser for Wilson and the California Republican Party at  the Century Plaza in Los Angeles this evening.  </P> <P> At the same time, Robert J. Moore, director of the governor's Washington  office, said that, after a slow start, the White House has stepped up  California appointments recently.  </P> <P> He cited the selection of Californians Bill Medigovich as the Western regional  director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; Dennis Underwood as  commissioner of reclamation, and Oscar Wright as Western regional director of  the Small Business Administration.  </P> <P> Some Californians who have been involved in the appointment process acknowledge  that some of the most eligible California talent -- including Deukmejian -- was  not interested in seeking positions in the Administration.  </P> <P> On the other hand, a number of the most prominent candidates for Cabinet-level  positions were not necessarily in the mold of Bush's moderate,  non-controversial selections.  </P> <P> Leading the list of the high-profile disappointed was Craig Fuller, Bush's vice  presidential chief of staff who lost out to John H. Sununu for White House  chief of staff. Fuller, who was California's best bet to have influence at the  highest level, decided to join a Washington public relations and lobbying firm  rather than accept another position in the Administration.  </P> <P> Next in prominence was Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), co-chairman of  Bush's California campaign and the first congressman to endorse Bush publicly.  Dornan, an outspoken, controversial conservative whom Bush called "my number  one surrogate speaker," had sought appointment as drug czar, a job that went to  William J. Bennett.  </P> <P> "He clearly wanted it," said one of those familiar with the appointment  jockeying. "But he's not really in the Bush Administration mold."  </P> <P> Times librarian Pat Welch contributed to this article.  </P></p>

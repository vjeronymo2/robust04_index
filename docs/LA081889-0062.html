			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AGENCIES TO SUBMIT PLANS FOR 5% CUT IN '91  </P> <P> In an early indication of Bush Administration budget strategy, Budget Director  Richard G. Darman has sent a letter to all federal agency chiefs requiring them  to develop plans for absorbing a 5% cut in funding in fiscal 1991.  </P> <P> The reductions would be reflected in one of three budget proposals that Darman  asked each agency head to submit. Fiscal 1991 does not begin until Oct. 1,  1990, but key decisions about the cuts will be made over the next few months,  with agencies required to submit their proposals by Sept. 1.  </P> <P> The memo does not cover defense spending and exempts entitlement programs such  as Social Security. But Darman suggested that agency directors might also want  to propose cuts in entitlement programs as a way of financing any new or  increased spending.  </P> <P> The 1991 budget will be "a major policy document" for the Administration, a  senior budget official said Thursday, because it will be the first budget that  Bush and his aides develop on their own. And it is being drawn up under severe  constraints as Bush tries to meet deficit-reduction targets without violating  his no-new-taxes pledge.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deficit Goals Unmet  </P> <P> So far, budget agreements between the Administration and Congress would not  come close to meeting the 1991 deficit target of the Gramm-Rudman  balanced-budget law, and "it will therefore be necessary to present the  President with options for further spending reductions," Darman wrote.  </P> <P> The memo, distributed to department and agency heads earlier this summer, marks  a distinct change from the traditional method of developing the  Administration's annual budget proposal. In the past, federal agencies have  submitted budget plans to the Office of Management and Budget in the fall. OMB  officials then typically have tried to pare down the requests.  </P> <P> Under Darman's plan, agencies will be required to develop budget cut proposals  at the beginning of the process, a move expected to strengthen the OMB's hand  in the inevitable squabbling between agencies and the budget office over  spending levels.  </P> <P> In addition to an agency's normal budget request, Darman wrote, all agencies  will be required to submit two additional budget plans. One would accommodate a  freeze in non-defense spending other than that for entitlement programs. The  second would require a 5% cut from fiscal 1990 spending levels.  </P> <P> The budget-cutting plans are being driven by the targets set four years ago in  the Gramm-Rudman law, under which the federal deficit in 1991 is not supposed  to exceed $64 billion. For 1990, the deficit is supposed to be kept below $110  million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tax Hike Foreseen  </P> <P> Both Congress and the Administration have found many ways to slip around those  budget targets. Even so, meeting the 1990 target required extensive  negotiations this spring. Cutting the deficit by an additional $50 billion to  meet the 1991 target without increasing taxes will be difficult. Many  congressional leaders predict that Bush will have to propose a tax increase.  </P> <P> Administration officials continue to argue that a tax increase will not be  necessary, although Bush has been careful not to commit himself on how long his  no-new-taxes pledge will last. The process of drawing up the 1991 budget  proposal, which Bush will submit to Congress in January, is expected to  dominate the Administration's agenda for the fall.  </P></p>

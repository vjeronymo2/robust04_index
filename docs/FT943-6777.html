			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Thousands of miners to leave Siberia: Russia reveals mass resettlement plans as inefficient pits are closed About 50,000 Russian coalminers and their families, who face redundancy as pits in the far north of the country are shut down, will be resettled by the Russian government, senior officials from the industry said yesterday. The miners and their families, who live in barely inhabitable Siberian settlements where the pits are the only source of employment, represent a larger social problem which Russia is confronting, as inefficient factories are beginning to shut down in remote areas of Russia. Siberia is filled with cities, like the mining towns, whose entire populations could be left jobless and with little possibility of finding employment elsewhere if the Russian government resists pressure to bail out failing state factories with inflationary soft loans. The social ripple-effect of industrial closures is exacerbated by the role Russian mines and factories have traditionally played as the main providers of social welfare facilities in the towns and cities where they were located. 'We do not intend to throw anyone out on the streets,' said Mr Yuri Malyshev, head of Rosugol, the state coal producers' association. 'We are talking of veterans here who have worked all their lives in the north and are now impoverished in conditions of hyper-inflation.' He said that 50,000 coalminers and their families from the mining settlement of Vorkuta and the northern region as a whole would be moved over the next few years. However, so far only 500 families have been resettled in more hospitable southern areas of the country, and to date Rosugol has acquired a total of only 1,800 flats for the hard-pressed mining families. The Russian government is facing growing pressure from cash-strapped industries and agriculture to release more funds but fears triggering a new round of inflation. It has earmarked Rbs300bn (Dollars 140m at the market rate) for the resettlement programme this year, but Mr Malyshev said that only part of the money had so far been released to Rosugol. Russian coal production was down 12 per cent in the first half of this year, compared with last year's figures, as the industry, confronting a depletion of reserves and crumbling infrastructure, struggles to restructure. Mr Malyshev said that 37 mines and one open cast pit had to be shut if the coal industry was to adapt to Russia's new, tougher, economic climate. However, so far only one mine, the Khalmer-U in Vorkuta, has been closed. The high social cost of the Russian government's fiscal and monetary austerity was further underscored yesterday when 2,000 farmers called for President Boris Yeltsin's resignation at a rally in Moscow. The farmers, trapped in the country's growing debt crisis, said the government paid for last year's crop several months late, a time lag which allowed inflation to consume part of the farms' revenues. At the demonstration, which included an address by Mr Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist party leader, farmers also complained that financially squeezed Russian factories were unable to supply sufficient and timely agricultural inputs and machinery.</p>

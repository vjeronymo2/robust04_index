			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Home income victims call for higher awards - Scheherazade Daneshkhu reports on a court battle VICTIMS OF home income plans are fighting for higher compensation in an action taken by a firm of solicitors specialising in home income plan cases. Barnett Sampson, which has 450 home income plan cases, yesterday instituted proceedings before the High Court to challenge the way in which the Investors Compensation Scheme proposes to award compensation to people who have lost money through the schemes. Investment bond home income plans were sold in the late 1980s mainly to elderly people as a 'safe' way of releasing income from their homes. In fact, these were risky schemes which led many couples into debt, and in some cases to the loss of their homes, when the value of their equity-linked bonds fell and mortgage interest rates rose. The ICS, which can award compensation to a maximum of Pounds 48,000, is obliged to pay 'fair compensation' to those who have succeeded in proving negligence on the part of the broker selling the policy. However, this compensation falls short of what people might expect to be awarded in the civil courts. If you were run over by a car and were unable to work as a result, you would be awarded compensation both for your injuries and for future loss of income. Barnett Sampson is challenging the ICS's view of what is 'fair compensation.' The ICS is presently setting a 'quantification' date up to which it will pay compensation. For example, clients who lost money as a result of schemes sold by Fisher Prew-Smith, which was declared in default in early October 1991, have had a quantification date set at September 16 1991. The amount of compensation will be assessed to that date, after which the investors' only additional claim is for interest at 2 percentage points below base rates. Yet since then, 'most clients will have had to face mortgage interest payments at 2 or 3 points over base,' said Richard Barnett, of Barnett Sampson. He says that if this is a claim against a broker for negligence, clients should be covered for other losses. These include compensation for a continuing mortgage debt, stress or illness caused as a result of the scheme and the payment of professional fees incurred in putting together a case against the brokers selling the schemes.</p>

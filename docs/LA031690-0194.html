			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WARE MAKES IT OFFICIAL -- HE'S OPEN TO NFL DRAFT  </P> <P> Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware will pass up his senior year and declare  himself available for the NFL draft, the University of Houston quarterback said  today.  </P> <P> "This is by far the most difficult decision I have had to make in all my years.  I have cherished my three years here but, for a variety of reasons, I am  declaring myself for the NFL draft," Ware said in an emotional statement at a  news conference.  </P> <P> Ware said he would not discuss the information he used to make his decision but  said he believes he made the right move.  </P> <P> "I made the decision and I'll go with it 100%," he said. "It's not a bad  decision either way. It was never my goal to be the No. 1 pick or go real high.  The goal is to play pro football.  </P> <P> "(San Francisco 49ers quarterback) Joe Montana wasn't a first-round pick and  (Houston Oilers quarterback) Warren Moon wasn't even drafted, and he's one of  the best. There was no one factor I looked at."  </P> <P> Shortly after winning the Heisman Trophy on Dec. 2, Ware guaranteed he would  return for his senior season with the Cougars.  </P> <P> "Since Dec. 2 a lot of things have taken place at UH and in the NFL as far as  allowing juniors into the draft," Ware said. "Yes, that statement bothered me a  little, but you have to understand what all has happened since I made that  statement."  </P> <P> Houston Coach John Jenkins said that Ware is in an elite group of players who  could benefit from leaving school early but that his decision should not be  considered a message for all college players.  </P> <P> "Young men who take this as a quick escape, let it be known that it's not," the  coach said. "In Andre's case, he's close to getting his degree and he will get  it."  </P> <P> Speculation among some National Football League observers is that Ware would  benefit from another year of collegiate seasoning, despite his record-setting  1989 season.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURTAIN PARTS ON JAPAN'S UNMENTIONABLE COMMUNITY;  </P> <P> DISCRIMINATION: THE LOW-CASTE GROUP TRIES TO SUPPRESS A CONTROVERIAL BOOK  POINTING OUT ITS ISOLATION.  </P> <P> Japan's hereditary outcaste community has lodged a vigorous complaint of  discrimination against Dutch author Karel van Wolferen, pressuring a Tokyo  publisher into temporarily halting sales of his controversial book about the  Japanese power structure shortly after it appeared in translation here.  </P> <P> The dispute appears to underscore one of the major arguments made in Van  Wolferen's book, "The Enigma of Japanese Power," that free academic and  political debate is often stifled by social taboos in Japan.  </P> <P> Representatives of the burakumin community, a little-known outcaste group whose  very existence is unmentionable for many Japanese, contacted the Tokyo  publisher Hayakawa Shobo on Oct. 1 and demanded that the book be withdrawn from  sale.  </P> <P> Hayakawa officials apologized and immediately advised major bookstores to  remove the book from their shelves, the publisher's lawyer said.  </P> <P> "There was a very strong tone of intimidation in the initial complaint by the  Buraku Liberation League (BLL)," said Futaba Igarashi, the lawyer.  </P> <P> Sales did not resume until Van Wolferen intervened Oct. 5 and persuaded the  publisher to rescind its warning to booksellers. But a major advertising  campaign is still on hold while Hayakawa negotiates with the league over its  demands for a number of revisions in the second printing.  </P> <P> "This group is essentially parasitic," Van Wolferen said. "The last thing they  want is emancipation for the burakumin. They themselves are the ones who keep  the issues from being discussed."  </P> <P> Kenji Kobayashi, an official with the league, said he objected to the use of  "discriminatory language" in the translated text, particularly the term  "special buraku" to describe the state of economic and residential quarantine  traditionally forced on outcaste communities.  </P> <P> Buraku literally means "hamlet," and the term burakumin ("people of the  hamlet') is a euphemistic reference to the minority's segregated status.  Descendants of the outcastes number between one and three million and still  face widespread discrimination in marriage and employment.  </P> <P> "The phrase 'special buraku' is loaded with a long history of discrimination,  and its usage perpetuates bad attitudes and misunderstanding," Kobayashi said.  He did not explain why his organization draws its own name from the term.  </P> <P> "The book makes many valid points and we think it will have a lot of influence  in Japan," Kobayashi said. "That's why it's important that the section on the  burakumin be based on the truth."  </P> <P> Kiyoshi Imaoka, an editor at Hayakawa, said the publisher has proposed revising  the buraku phrase to "special community" in the second printing but leaving  other disputed sections intact to "serve as a starting point for academic  debate on the subject."  </P> <P> Hayakawa printed 50,000 two-volume sets in its first edition of the book,  originally published in English in April of last year. Yoshi Tadokoro, the  local representative for Van Wolferen's American publisher, Macmillan,  estimated that about 20,000 sets have been sold since it was released in Japan  on Sept. 26 but said that it is too early to make an accurate count. Some news  reports have placed it on bestseller lists for business books, he said.  </P> <P> Van Wolferen became a controversial figure in Japan after he was branded by the  media as a so-called "revisionist," one of an influential group of scholars and  journalists who criticize Japan's trade policies and political institutions.  </P> <P> In his book, he cites the Buraku Liberation League as an example of how  "intimidation is a preferred alternative to legal sanctions" in Japan.  </P> <P> "The denunciation tactics of this group have made it very powerful when it  confronts publishers, authors, journalists, editors and teachers," he writes.  "Any of these who says anything about the burakumin minority that contradicts  BLL ideology runs the risk of being forced to undergo denunciation sessions."  </P> <P> The league's Kobayashi said this allegation is "clearly in error."  </P> <P> "We're only raising our voice on behalf of a minority that's being  discriminated against by misinformation," he said. "That's not intimidation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The burakumin are indistinguishable by race or religion from other Japanese.  Like the lower castes of India, they are defined by birth, by poverty and the  kind of work they do. Their ostracism dates from the 6th Century when Buddhism  was introduced to Japan from the Asian mainland and certain occupations -- such  as butcher, tanner and executioner -- were declared "unclean." Those who  continued to perform those jobs eventually were ostracized and forced to live  in special buraku, or villages. For those whose heritage can be traced to to a  buraku, life in Japan even today is often a nightmare of discrimination and  humiliation. Burakumin especially encounter enormous prejudice if they seek to  wed a non-burakumin, and suicides are not unknown.  </P></p>

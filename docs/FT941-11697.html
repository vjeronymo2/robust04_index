			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Traffic levels 'pose benzene pollution threat' Rising traffic levels threaten to lead to harmful levels of benzene in the air, a government panel of scientists warned yesterday. Fitting catalytic converters to more cars and improving public transport would help, the scientists said. The report by the expert panel on air quality standards, set up two years ago after the 1990 white paper on the environment, recommends that levels of benzene in the air should not exceed 5ppb - parts per billion - calculated as a running annual average. It also recommends that the standard eventually be reduced to 1ppb and that the government set a target date for achieving this. Professor Anthony Seaton of Aberdeen University, chairman of the panel, said that the 5ppb standard 'would broadly be able to be met at present', but 1ppb would be more difficult. Mr Robert Atkins, environment minister, said the government would soon publish a consultation paper on how the standards should be applied. Evidence indicating that benzene causes a form of leukaemia has been accumulating for some 15 years. The World Health Organisation has not recommended standards, saying there is no completely 'safe' level for such chemicals. However, the panel said yesterday that at the levels it has recommended, 'the risks are exceedingly small and unlikely to be detectable by any practicable method'. Smoking 20 cigarettes a day more than doubles the exposure to benzene for someone living in a town. Nearly 80 per cent of benzene in the air comes from petrol cars. Since the start of last year, all new cars have been fitted with catalytic converters which reduce these emissions almost entirely. Diesel engines emit only 9 per cent of airborne benzene, but they also emit harmful carbon particles, as a government report last week warned. Petrol pumps emit a small amount, and food and water also contain traces, the panel said. The panel will publish further recommendations on levels of other pollutants, including carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone and carbon particles. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders yesterday attacked the government's promotion of unleaded fuel, which contains much more benzene than leaded fuel. Cars with catalytic converters need unleaded fuel but emit little benzene; cars which run on unleaded but have no converters emit high levels. Benzene, Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards. HMSO.

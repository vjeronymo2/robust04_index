			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Letter: Lack of trust from a trigger-happy bank Sir, I agree with Michael Proudlock's observations regarding the banks' recent doctrinaire policy of calling in investigatory accountants to examine customers' affairs. A City firm was invited to investigate the accounts of one of our firm's client companies. The report was favourable in terms of the business and future prospects. It was recommended that the bank continued to support the business. However, the bank has not eased its position for running the account. It has only agreed to finance the cost of the investigatory accountants' fee by adding it to the overdraft. The attitude is still in my opinion one of intransigence, doubt, continual harrassment and interference. Venture capital and working capital finance should be provided from sources away from the major clearing banks so that small businesses may have access to them. A new market would develop whereby new relationships could be built up, and reasonable profits made by providing a real service to small businesses. When will such entrants be forthcoming?

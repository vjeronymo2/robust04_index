			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Murtaz Zankaliani, Minister of Trade and </F> Supply, by Armaz Saneblidze, Donetsk-Tbilisi: "Economic  Passions. A Triptych of Two Ministers and One Vice President":  date not given]    [Text] Nothing original about it--a banal situation  expressed in a banal way: the Kiev airport was socked in by fog.  An hour after taking off, our big bird was forced to land in  Donetsk.    All the city airports in Ukraine closed down on 11  January, and the Georgian government delegation was stuck  between Tbilisi and Kiev.    We had all kinds of time. Immersed in the murk, nobody  was in any hurry, owing to the "meteorological conditions," and  it therefore became possible to talk about economic problems  with three professionals, very frankly, on a subject that was  very popular and not very dangerous.    "Was it a mistake for Georgia to introduce the coupon,  and if so why?    The answer to this question began the interview with  Murtaz Zankaliani, the minister of trade and supply.  <H5>  The First Raiment </H5>   [Zankaliani] The trouble with our economists (I'm an  economist so I'm speaking mainly of myself) is that we are wise  after the fact. None among us in Georgia could have predicted  it. It is after we come to the abyss that we find we've chosen  the wrong path. That was the case with the coupon. I voiced my  own skepticism toward it in Parliament. But that's not the main  thing. The main thing is that after we introduced the coupon we  had no other choice. We had no other currency, and of course we  couldn't leave people without pay.    [Saneblidze] Were there previous mistakes that brought us to  this predicament?    [Zankaliani] Our mistake was that we should have stayed in  the inflated ruble zone until we were kicked out. We should have  had the coupon and the lari [the proposed Georgian national  currency unit] ready the way many republics of the former USSR  had their own currency. We were too hasty, rejecting the Russian  ruble prematurely, although by October 1992 no more rubles were  coming in from Russia, and all of our government's attempts to  get rubles were futile. The reason was that in August 1992, in  Bishkek, where the question of whether to remain in the ruble  zone was being decided, we did not have a clearly formed  position, although Russia's representatives easily read between  the lines and knew that we would be the first to quit the ruble  zone. That's why they cut us off from the ruble supply source.  We had in effect quit the zone too quickly. In March and April  1993 we had no Russian money at all, so we had to introduce the  coupon whether we liked it or not.    [Saneblidze] The political background? Didn't it influence  that decision?    [Zankaliani] Anti-Russian sentiment, of course, was one of  the main reasons. We realized later that that categorical  stance, which I criticized at the time, was wrong. We had been  integrated in the Soviet economy for 70 years; for 200 years we  have not run our own country as we saw fit, with our own  resources. Any minister in that period, for example, working  according to Soviet instructions, was virtually a robot. And not  just ministers, either. Things were like that on all levels, in  every sector. We should have learned to run our country first,  we needed a kind of adaptation period. But we tried to do  everything at once. There is probably not a man in Georgia who  thinks that Georgia does not need absolute political  independence, but economic independence cannot be achieved just  by revolution and breaking up the old order. Georgia was so much  integrated into the former unified Soviet economic complex--raw  materials, supplies, components, energy, standards (an electric  locomotive assembled in Tbilisi could only be operated, for  example, within the former USSR), and, finally, the marketing  system--that breaking up the ties without having something new  to replace them was tantamount to cutting vital arteries.  Experience has once more confirmed this sad truth.    Economic independence requires gradual preparation; being  hasty is like building a house from the roof down. That's what  we tried.    [Saneblidze] There was probably a political motive behind  this?    [Zankaliani] Of course, but I'm sure that the politicians  who  were so vehemently opposed to these ties and relations have now  realized the error of this position.    [Saneblidze] Let's return to the coupon as an attribute of  our economic independence....    [Zankaliani] The coupon did work for a few months. The  biggest plus was that it was accepted by the market and the  peasant. For the domestic market, for the closed-cycle economy  (from the producer to the consumer within the borders of  Georgia), the coupon seemed to be adequate. But that economy is  extremely small. We have to import energy, raw materials, and  supplies from outside, you know. When our supplies ran out and  we had to bring in more, the coupon couldn't do it. Neither  agriculture nor the peasant could work. Worse, the peasant  couldn't even bring his crops to the city to sell. The situation  required Russian currency or some other foreign currency.  Inflation skyrocketed. In a few months, the coupon-to-ruble  ratio rose from 1 to 10 to 1 to 100. The coupon became worthless.    [Saneblidze] What do you think of circulating the coupon and  the ruble on an equal basis within the republic?    [Zankaliani] I'm a little ambivalent. We have got together  several times with Vice Premier Amiran Kadagishvili to discuss  the problem. Two positions have emerged. The first is to permit  parallel currencies--rubles, dollars, francs and others--along  with the Georgian coupon (or lari). The second is to seek ways  and means of keeping the coupon as the sole medium of payment. I  have not yet formed an opinion, although I do lean toward the  parallel idea, because, like it or not, we have to import  supplies and raw materials which the coupon cannot buy.    Our governmental delegation intends to conclude agreements  with various countries on trade and economic cooperation. A  special place in this package is held by clearing relations. If  Ukraine agrees to such a relation* (*Footnote: Readers of  SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA know that the Ukrainian government, in an  agreement concluded with the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers on 12  December, made a sole exception for our country and decided to  engage in cashless settlements--commodity clearing--for Georgia  alone.)--Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and others have  already made that decision--it will strengthen the coupon to  some extent. But the ties we are arranging on the inter-state  level are still too small, because basically everything goes on  in the non-state sector, on the level of direct relations, and  making parallel currencies official will constitute  acknowledgment of the actual situation.    Officially, the coupon is the sole medium of payment. This  decision is not backed up by any law or normative act, so the  state cannot punish violators.    What shall we do?    Let us legalize the existing situation, but... a portion of  Georgia's population, you know, is classified as socially  unprotected. For a certain period, at least, the country won't  be able to pay wages and pensions to these people with Russian  currency, even in part. For that reason, I'm a little afraid of  my own proposal to introduce parallel currencies.    But if the agreements we get on these trips of ours enable  us  to give absolute guarantees to Georgia's socially unprotected  population that we will accept their coupons for bread, sugar,  shortening, salt, matches, and so on, also rent and utilities,  if we accept only coupons on public transportation--if we  protect their vital interests in this way--then we can introduce  parallel currencies.    This will not be as frightening as some think. In many  countries, including Ukraine, the coupon is the national  currency, the sole medium of payment. In parallel fashion, there  are two-way currency exchange offices, and nobody makes a fuss  over it. We distort things: Hey, take your coupon and try to  exchange it for a ruble and see what you get.    That's another reason parallel currencies are needed.    [Saneblidze] What about doing away with the mafia's ability  to make money with money?    [Zankaliani] Yes, their ability to make money from money is  a  distortion of the classical formula of money-commodity-money  (without which even the classical banking country cannot exist).  We will never get a market economy that way. Sorry to say,  Georgia does not yet have any real major businessmen and major  entrepreneurs. No one has even opened a tiny shop to produce  combs. A real businessman would generate so much capital in his  business that he would have 10 to 15 percent profit at the end  of the year. What is happening in our country is abnormal. There  are those who think that buying butter cheaply in Moscow and  selling it dear in Tbilisi is real business....    [Saneblidze] How do you see the problem of the parallel  currency proposal and our entry into the ruble zone?    [Zankaliani] I know that some countries (Belarus,  Tajikistan)  are headed that way. But I also know that Russia's economists  are definitely not in favor of that idea. Specialists in Moscow  assured me that if Belarus returns to the ruble zone it will  require printing up an additional trillion rubles, which will  spark a 10-percent rise in the Russian currency's inflation.    Even if we were to try very hard to get back into the  Russian  ruble zone, they wouldn't accept us, and rightly so.    Nevertheless, entering the ruble zone is not ruled out. It  depends on what the West actually does to support us--if there  is an increase in aid, financial injections and investments, if  the situation in the country calms down, and if our economy  revives according to the program whose foundation we are laying  with these visits, a different situation may take shape. But if  none of this happens, the situation will get so much worse that  we will have to beg Russia on our knees to take us into the  ruble zone.    As a Georgian and a citizen of my country, I don't want that  to happen, because when another country's currency is in your  country, that country calls the shots.    We need to take the roundabout route. But I greatly fear  that  we will end up having to join the ruble zone.    [Saneblidze] So reviving our economy, making it work, is one  way to establish a national currency. Do I understand you  correctly?    [Zankaliani] Yes. A Georgian currency needs Georgian  commodities. The Japanese, who have no real natural resources,  have put their wit to work. We are poor too, we have counted it  up and all our efforts can't even meet one-fifth of our needs.  In such a situation, the state, the government will have to  manage a certain portion--perhaps 30 percent--of our resources  in the transition stage; the other 70 percent can be allocated  by the market economy.    Well, now we are organizing that management in the Cabinet  of  Ministers. We will put the clearing method into action, export  what we have and import what we need. Our ministry and the  services which we have created will be the catalysts of coupon  sales. This will reinforce the coupon.    [Saneblidze] You said in one interview that other countries  in our position have introduced their own national currency or a  substitute for it and, to stabilize it, received 60 million  dollars in credit from the World Currency Fund. How about us?    [Zankaliani] They have treated us badly. They gave 60  million  dollars to Kyrghyzstan so that country could introduce its own  som. For us they couldn't even spare 60 dollars. I know that the  National Bank and the Finance Minister are working on these  problems, and maybe something will work out, especially  considering that we have been given the status of a developing  country. We have to work on that.    An interesting detail: just 20 million dollars would be  enough to retrieve the mass of coupons that have been issued to  the public; that's how high the coupon's inflation is. If we do  that, maybe it will enhance wages paid in coupons. We really do  need to make coupons the sole medium of payment in Georgia. We  have to work on that too.    [Saneblidze] That is the only solution. Now, another  problem--the managed 30 percent of our resources, the rest for  economic reform. How can these two extremes--centralization and  reform--coexist?    [Zankaliani] The non-state sector is the only way to develop  the country, its future. But the state must make the effort to  support it. In France, for example, the state sector makes up 53  percent (meaning the form of ownership). The decision has to be  made whether this store or that enterprise belongs to a company,  a joint-stock company, or the state. And whoever owns it has to  run it.    If we do not provide the people with social protection, they  won't allow us to build a market economy. Hence, the economy  cannot exist without state regulation.    Anyone today who is thinking of amassing money and living in  Georgia is making a big mistake. If you have money, put it to  work, use it to create jobs.    Businessmen and entrepreneurs need to give careful thought  to  these matters.    It is entrepreneurs of the Saradzhishvili type who will save  Georgia.    In conclusion, it should not be hard, going by world  experience, for these seemingly mutually exclusive  forces--structures operating by the principles of centralized,  state management and those of the market economy--to coexist.    Generally, however, discussions of these problems, for some  reason, go by the closed-circle principle: bankers sit by  themselves, entrepreneurs sit by themselves, and supply  specialists sit by themselves. We need to look for integrated  approaches.    [Saneblidze] I'll take that advice, and I want to ask your  opinion about the 32 percent, which remains an unresolved  problem in the argument between the banks and the entrepreneurs.  Why can't they agree?    [Zankaliani] That is called currency/foreign exchange  earnings. A country which converts to its own currency passes a  law that business concerns, and so forth, which have foreign  currency coming into their accounts have to give the state a  certain percentage by exchanging it for the local currency. That  law was passed last April, but to this day not a single ruble  has come in. Quite apart from private firms, even our state  enterprises are leaving the money they earned from product sales  in Russia. That money is circulating there and benefitting  Russia's economy. That's one of the reasons for our misery. If  we could regain this money by way of expert appraisal, it would  add up to about 40 billion rubles, or 5 to 10 million dollars.    There are ways to correct the situation, and we ought to do  so.</p>

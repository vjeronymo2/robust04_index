			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 17 (AFP) -- German Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel insisted Tuesday [17 May] that Russia must not be  granted an official veto over whether Eastern and Central  European countries join NATO.    He said this rule also should apply to membership of the  Western European Union, effectively the military wing of the  European Union.    Kinkel was in Vienna with his Dutch counterpart, Pieter  Kooijmans, to present a joint initiative on strengthening the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in the  area of conflict prevention.    Speaking at a press conference, they expressed hope that the  plan would be approved at a CSCE summit in December in Budapest.    Kinkel said that in the wake of the Cold War, Eastern and  Central European countries needed to avoid "new divisions" and  that this was why NATO's Partnership for Peace [PFP] plan was  open to both Russia and them.    The Russians, he noted, want to join the partnership but  "are  seeking certain specific rules in their negotiations with the  alliance."    The plan offers military cooperation in a number of areas  between NATO and mainly the former Warsaw Pact countries but  stops short of offering full membership any time soon.    It was conceived in January by the United States as a way to  respond to Eastern European countries' pleas for greater  security at a time of political volatility and growing  nationalism in Russia without alienating Russia itself.    On the CSCE, Kooijmans said one of the main goals of the  German- Dutch initiative was to boost the CSCE as a regional  organization to help the United Nations.    "When we see that the United Nations is not in a position to  do everything asked of it around the world, it is important to  consolidate regional organizations to help the United Nations,"  Kooijmans said.</p>

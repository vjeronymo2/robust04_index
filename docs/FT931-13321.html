			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Bank of England Governor: Hardliner wins approval from City MR EDDIE GEORGE'S appointment was given a generally warm welcome by City economists, who acknowledged his reputation for taking a hard line against inflation in the UK in recent years. Mr John Shepperd, head of bond research at SG Warburg, said Mr George had a reputation in the City as a hardliner on monetary policy who would give the battle against inflation top priority. 'He may be very cautious about easing interest rate policy,' he said. Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel, also referred to the governor-designate's reputation as a hard man on monetary policy, saying that there should not be any doubts about his credibility in fighting inflation. But he added: 'The problem at the moment is knowing how much independence the Bank will have in formulating policy. The really important question is still whether the government will stick to its anti-inflation objectives.' Several economists said Mr George's strong understanding of financial markets would add to the Bank's credibility at a time when it has a high profile in currencies and gilts. Mr Skeoch said: 'The new governor has been responsible for gilt market operations at the Bank, and that is an important experience to have had at a time when the issue of government funding is so high on the agenda.' Several economists suggested, however, that Mr George is a technocrat who has made his career at the Bank of England, and that this may make him too secretive about the nature of monetary policy. Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, said the incoming governor was very resistant to having visible indices of monetary policy. 'He is the sort of person who wants to conduct policy in a highly discretionary, judgmental way,' he said. City analysts were uncertain - and divided - about Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea's appointment as deputy governor. One senior city economist said the new deputy would have a large say in the presentation of policy, while another claimed that he had never heard his name.</p>

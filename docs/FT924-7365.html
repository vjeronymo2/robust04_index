			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Letter: Blame is irrelevant - pragmatism is the answer Sir, Mr Jimmy Airlie's letter (November 11) seems to address only part of the problems which his union's members face (I quite agree that productivity gains should be rewarded, though not to the extent that the reward reduces future productivity). As Mr Airlie points out, car workers have been affected by declining new car sales; however, Mr Airlie should realise that this is not the fault of Ford, or other manufacturers, let alone his members, and that not only Ford's workers but also their shareholders will have to share the pain of reduced sales, through (respectively) less jobs and less pay, and less share value and lower dividends. As for blaming the government for 'economic mismanagement', surely Mr Airlie can see that laying blame is irrelevant - we all end up paying - and that there can be no part of the population which can say 'It's not my fault' and carry on as before. If he, and others of like mind, adopted a more pragmatic approach the economy will stand more chance of recovering. Ian Stern, 97 Greencroft Gardens, London NW6 3PG</p>

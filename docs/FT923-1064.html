			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cominco seeks tax cuts to secure Trail smelter COMINCO, the Canadian base metals producer, has warned that the viability of its troubled Trail lead and zinc smelter in south-east British Columbia hinges on a willingness by the provincial government to provide tax and other cost-cutting concessions. The BC authorities have so far rejected various recommendations made earlier this year by a 'jobs protection commissioner', notably a proposal for an CDollars 8.5m (Dollars 6.9m) a year reduction in water licence fees levied on Trail. Cominco has a reputation as a tough negotiator willing to carry out its threats. It has said that, without a cut in the water tax, it may not go ahead with plans to overhaul the lead smelter at Trail, which was taken out of service shortly after it began operations in late 1989. A Cominco spokesman added yesterday that the future of the lead smelter could not be separated from the rest of the complex, which is the world's largest producer of refined non-ferrous metals. He said that 'we're not planning on shutting down Trail operations, but under the current tax regime, it's going to be very difficult to operate Trail. The ball is back in the government's court.' Cominco is also seeking a cut in municipal property taxes, rail tariffs and environmental clean-up charges. Trail, which last year produced 242,000 tonnes of refined zinc, or about 5 per cent of western world production, and 87,000 tonnes of lead (nearly 2 per cent of western world output) has racked up operating losses of CDollars 98m over the past two years. According to estimates published by the government, the cost of rebuilding the lead smelter will run as high as CDollars 200m. Other parts of the Trail operation require capital spending of up to CDollars 325m over the next five years. An official in the province's economic development department said yesterday that 'we're going to do everything we can' to ensure that Trail remains open. But the government is concerned that a cut in water rentals might be perceived as an unfair subsidy by Canada's trading partners, resulting in countervailing duties such as those recently imposed by the US against Canadian softwood timber and magnesium exports. As an alternative, the province has proposed a 'commercial arrangement', under which it would buy a portion of the power generated by hydro-electric dams owned by Cominco. Proceeds from the sale of this power would be used to help finance future capital investment at Trail. Mr Robert Hallbauer, Cominco's chief executive, has been at the forefront of recent criticism of the investment climate for mining companies in Canada. He warned in his last annual report to shareholders that unless the authorities address the industry's concerns: 'Canadian companies will accelerate the already significant investment in exploration and mine development in other countries.'</p>

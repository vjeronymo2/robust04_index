			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Director urges Europe to welcome Japanese JAPAN'S leading manufacturers should not be barred from Europe: instead they should be 'firmly inside Europe as role models', according to Mr Walter Eltis, director general of the London-based national economic development office. In a presentation to the Institut de L'Entreprise in Paris yesterday, Mr Eltis argued that Europe could learn valuable lessons from British experience over the past decade in attracting Japanese investors to transform ailing physics-based industries such as electronics, television and car manufacture. Efforts through the 1960s and 1970s to protect the British motor industry led to the creation of 'a combine which by 1986 was losing Pounds 1bn a year to produce not very many not very good cars,' he recalls. He warns that the comparatively poor recent performance of groups like Fiat and Renault is due to heavy reliance on protected local markets: 'If the policy of continental Europe is the same as Britain's it will welcome Japanese manufacturers where (their) competitive edge is exceptional, even if this leads to the total elimination of the previous producers. 'The ideal way to remedy industrial weaknesses is to get the world's best into the economy, and to learn from them with the greatest possible rapidity.'</p>

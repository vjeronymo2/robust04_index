			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: IBM joins Canon in PC venture IBM, the US computer company, and Canon, the Japanese office equipment and camera maker, have joined forces to develop compact personal computers. The aim of the project is to build portable and small desktop machines that incorporate a small printer using Canon's bubble-jet technology. Initially, Canon is to make the computer in Japan for sale under its own name, and will supply the product to IBM on an original equipment manufacturer basis. It is to be based on the PS/55 computer made by IBM Japan and will be available in the 'near future'. Canon Sales, a subsidiary of Canon, markets IBM computers in Japan. Canon also supplies bubble-jet printers to IBM on an OEM basis. The two also plan to develop ties in the field of multi-media devices, which combine audio, video, computer, or communication functions. For IBM, the collaboration is the latest in a series of co-operative arrangements with Japanese companies as part of its new strategy, following a restructuring last year. IBM is developing flash memory devices - semiconductor chips which retain memory after power is turned off - jointly with Toshiba. IBM has also joined forces with Toshiba and Siemens of Germany to develop technology for the 256 megabit dynamic random access memory chip. Hitachi and IBM recently agreed to co-operate on printing technology. IBM is expected to announce today that it is restructuring its personal computer business, the precursor to a new PC product line to be announced later this month, analysts said, Reuter reports. A spokesman said IBM would make an announcement today, but declined to provide details. The restructuring will turn IBM's PC hardware business into a separate independent unit responsible for the sales, marketing and distribution of its products in addition to the development and manufacturing it now controls.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help AAH to Pounds 37.3m ACQUISITIONS costing Pounds 84m helped to boost AAH, the pharmaceuticals distribution group, which yesterday reported a 16 per cent increase in annual profits before tax and exceptionals to Pounds 37.3m. The profits, struck on sales ahead by 11 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn (Pounds 1.26bn), benefited from a Pounds 4.5m contribution from new businesses. These included the purchase of 65 pharmacies, with a further 13 since the end of the year, for a total of 224, and the inclusion for four months of a drugs wholesaler in the Irish Republic. The previous year's profits had been enhanced by a Pounds 6.6m exceptional gain on the sale of a business. In the absence of this gain, pre-tax profits under the FRS 3 accounting standard fell from Pounds 38.8m to Pounds 37.3m for the year to March 31. Mr John Padovan, who took over as chairman in December from Mr Bill Pybus, the incumbent for the previous 25 years, said the group had achieved growth in spite of a 'generally tough climate.' Efforts had been directed at cutting costs, such as closing four of the 27 depots, and improving efficiency. The greatest growth was in the healthcare division, which saw trading profits rise from Pounds 26.7m to Pounds 31.3m on sales up from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 1.2bn. AAH had successfully integrated the Dutch drugs wholesaler Medicopharma, the acquisition of which was the subject of an MMC inquiry last year, and had entered the Irish market with the IPounds 25m (Pounds 24.5m) purchase of Cahill May Roberts. Recession hit consumer products distribution and builders supplies, where profits fell from Pounds 2m to Pounds 800,00 and from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 2.3m respectively. A shift in focus at the distribution business to contract work and the higher value food market helped profits jump from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 2.8m. Environmental services reported a 9 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 4.7m on sales 37 per cent ahead to Pounds 69.1m. The dividend was increased by 5 per cent to 11.5p for a total of 17.3p (16.35p). Earnings came to 32.8p (31.8p). AAH finished the year with gearing of 14 per cent, after paying for the acquisitions and Pounds 24m in capital expenditure. COMMENT The healthcare division continues to forge ahead, with little sign of any significant slowdown. Proposed changes to the NHS are more likely to affect manufacturers than the middlemen. In the current year, AAH is likely to benefit from a steadier performance in Ireland and the purchase of more pharmacies. In its other businesses, the group will have to wait for economic recovery like everyone else. Forecasts for the current year are for Pounds 45.5m, with a prospective p/e of about 14 times. This, combined with the yield of 4.6 per cent, leaves the shares looking somewhat undervalued.</p>

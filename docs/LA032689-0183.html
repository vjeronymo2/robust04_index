			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELTA ROCKET LAUNCH A BIG STEP FOR SPACE COMMERCE  </P> <P> If all goes as planned, a Delta rocket will blast off from Cape Canaveral in  Florida this spring, sending into space the first payload of the nation's  fledgling commercial satellite-launching industry.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas, manufacturer of the Delta, plans to mark the May 31 launch  with a public relations bash aimed at wooing customers and winning political  support for the U.S. industry. The aerospace giant plans to bring in  congressmen and customers from around the world to witness the launch, and  company executives are counting on the reliable Delta to perform according to  script.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of attention on this launch," said Louis Raburn, general manager  of McDonnell Douglas' Delta program in Huntington Beach. "It's a revival of the  launch vehicle marketplace. And it's also the first step toward the  commercialization of space."  </P> <P> The commercial launch market is an outgrowth of the 1986 Challenger space  shuttle disaster that led President Reagan to retire the shuttle from  commercial-launching duties -- which mostly involve putting communications  satellites in orbit -- and to encourage development of a private space industry  using unmanned, expendable rockets.  </P> <P> The United States was caught without a ready supply of alternative launchers  because rocket makers had shut down their production lines years earlier when  the government designated the shuttle, operated by the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration, as the nation's only launcher for both commercial and  military satellites. It has taken the U.S. manufacturers -- McDonnell Douglas,  General Dynamics and Martin Marietta -- about three years to modify their  existing rockets for the commercial market and to get their production lines  rolling again.  </P> <P> However, even as McDonnell Douglas prepares for its inaugural launch, the  American rocket industry is facing serious problems because of increasing  foreign competition and a market that is sputtering before takeoff.  </P> <P> "There are too many rockets and not enough satellites," said John E. Pike, a  space policy analyst for the Federation of American Scientists in Washington.  "The optimistic vision that people had of the commercial rocket business a  couple of years ago isn't going to happen."  </P> <P> About 20 satellites a year, on average, will be launched through the early  1990s, according to various industry forecasts. With each launch contract worth  between $40 million and $60 million, the annual worldwide market is valued at  roughly $1 billion annually.  </P> <P> While a $1-billion business is significant, industry executives are less  encouraged by forecasts of little or no growth in the market through the 1990s.  With more competitors joining the field, there will be less business to go  around.  </P> <P> One reason for the soft market is that satellite customers, such as telephone  companies, are booking fewer launches. Much of the telecommunications traffic  that used to travel by satellite links now is being carried by ground-based  fiber-optic networks. And new satellite uses that might give a boost to the  market -- for example, direct broadcast of television programs to homes with  satellite dishes -- have not caught on in the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Price Disadvantage Cited  </P> <P> Moreover, the new generation of satellites is expected to remain in operation  longer, perhaps 10 years or more, meaning fewer launches to send up replacement  hardware.  </P> <P> Another threat to the U.S. rocket industry, company executives say, comes from  foreign competitors whose launch programs are subsidized by governments. These  subsidies enable foreign rivals to market their services below cost, the  Americans say, making it difficult for the American manufacturers to compete.  </P> <P> Arianespace, the chief foreign competitor, receives its funds for product  research and development from the European Space Agency, while American  companies must fund those costs on their own, said Dennis R. Dunbar, managing  director of General Dynamics Commercial Launch Services in San Diego. "We're  carrying a $5-million to $10-million-per-unit price disadvantage because we  need to recover that investment," Dunbar said.  </P> <P> Arianespace is a 13-member, French-based consortium set up by the European  Space Agency in 1980 to market launches to satellite customers. The consortium  has launched 29 commercial satellites and claims more than half the world  market for launches.  </P> <P> Arianespace officials say American complaints about unfair subsidies are  unfounded.  </P> <P> "The subsidy claim is a red herring and always will be," said Doug A. Heydon,  president of Arianespace's U.S. marketing subsidiary. "Since our company was  formed nine years ago, we have been totally responsible for all our operating  costs."  </P> <P> Arianespace began its business in 1980 by competing with the U.S. space shuttle  and had the market virtually to itself after the Challenger accident grounded  the American-satellite launching business.  </P> <P> Despite its current leadership position, Arianespace has the most to lose of  any of the rocket makers from increasing competition in the market. Unlike its  American competitors, which have large military launch contracts, Arianespace  is totally dependent on commercial business. The French-based company produces  rockets that compete with all three U.S. producers.  </P> <P> "We've lost business to all three of the U.S. companies," Heydon said. "We've  also lost to (China). But that's part of the game."  </P> <P> Arianespace's biggest problem, Heydon said, is the weakened condition of the  U.S. dollar. He said the cost of the Ariane to U.S. customers has risen 70% in  four years.  </P> <P> But both European and American rocket makers share a bad case of pre-launch  jitters about the potential competition from China and the Soviet Union.  Analysts say the Chinese and Soviets are likely to heavily subsidize their  launch businesses in order to gain international prestige and foreign currency.  </P> <P> "The introduction of the Chinese Long March (rocket) and, ultimately, the  Soviet Proton will serve to make the market more unpleasant," Heydon said. "I  don't think there is adequate business to support all these people in the  commercial business."  </P> <P> Industry executives were upset with the Reagan Administration's decision last  fall to relax export restrictions and allow China to launch three Hughes  Aircraft satellites aboard the Long March. In January, China signed its first  commercial contract to launch a Western-built satellite -- a $30-million deal  for a 1990 launch of the telecommunications satellite Asiasat 1.  </P> <P> "We were very disappointed in the Administration's decision to allow the  Chinese to enter the market," said General Dynamics' Dunbar. "It contradicts  the government's objective of having a strong domestic rocket industry."  </P> <P> Under the U.S.-China trade agreement signed in January, the Chinese are limited  to nine launches during the next six years and are supposed to offer their  services for prices comparable to those of Western companies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Soviet Effort Stymied  </P> <P> But Western executives complain that the Chinese are already violating the  trade accord. One industry executive said they recently won a launch contract  with Aussat, the Australian satellite authority, by bidding less than one-third  the price of its Western rivals.  </P> <P> John M. Logsdon, director of George Washington University's Space Policy  Institute, believes that the Chinese will play a role in the commercial market.  "But the notion that they'll take a significant market share from the United  States and Europe is not very plausible" because of restrictions limiting the  number of Chinese launches.  </P> <P> Although the Soviets have been actively marketing their Proton rocket for about  two years, they have been stymied by U.S. law that prohibits Soviet launches of  satellites with American technology. Virtually all satellites launched outside  the Soviet Bloc incorporate American technology.  </P> <P> "If there are no constraints placed on the Chinese or Soviets, we won't be in  the commercial launch business," said Roger Chamberlin, vice president in  charge of Martin Marietta's commercial Titan program. "We have no desire to  sell vehicles at a loss."  </P> <P> But industry observers say other nations eventually will be able to develop  satellites without the benefit of American technology. In order to break into  the commercial market, the Soviets may provide technical assistance to nations  that want to develop a satellite business, said William B. Wirin, vice  president of Space Commerce, a two-year-old Houston company formed as a joint  venture with the Soviets to market the Proton.  </P> <P> "We will go to countries that want to develop satellites and help them do so,"  said Wirin, a former chief attorney for the U.S. Air Force Space Command. "We  will look to the Third World countries and try to help them lower their cost of  launches. If you bring down the cost of communications, you will create a  requirement for many more launches."  </P> <P> The Soviets believe that they can market the Proton to developing nations at  half the world market price, Wirin said, "and still make a handsome profit."  </P> <P> Still another potential competitor, Japan, is expected to make its move into  the commercial business in the early 1990s. Under a license agreement with the  U.S. government, the Japanese acquired technology used in McDonnell Douglas'  Delta rocket and have been developing a launch system called the H-2.  </P> <P> "The Japanese are not saying much publicly, but it is obviously their intent to  be a major player in the space transport game," said an official with the  Office of Space Commerce, a Commerce Department agency. Industry observers say  the Japanese have improved upon the Delta's second-stage engine -- the  mid-stage engine that puts the satellite into an elliptical orbit. McDonnell  Douglas is now mulling the possibility of obtaining the enhanced booster  technology under license from Japan.  </P> <P> All three U.S. rockets, the McDonnell Douglas Delta, General Dynamics Atlas and  Martin Marietta Titan, are descendants of ballistic missiles developed in the  1950s and 1960s. They have been modified at various times throughout the years  for different missions.  </P> <P> After a two-and-a-half-year shutdown, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems of  Huntington Beach reopened its Delta production line in January, 1987. The  contract that put the Delta back in business was a military rather than  commercial order. The company received an Air Force order valued at nearly $1  billion to build 20 Deltas for launching military satellites that would have  gone up on the space shuttle had it not been for the Challenger accident.  </P> <P> On the commercial side, McDonnell Douglas has nine orders for its Delta rockets  valued at $500 million. The company's first launch in May will carry a  communications satellite for the government of India.  </P> <P> General Dynamics Space Systems in San Diego, manufacturer of the Atlas launch  vehicle, has four firm commercial orders. The first launch will be early next  year.  </P> <P> Martin Marietta Commercial Titan Systems in Denver has five contracts for  launches of its Titan rocket, with a value of $500 million. Its first launch is  scheduled for the third quarter of 1989.  </P> <P> The three rocket makers generally compete for different pieces of the market  because their launchers vary in the size of payloads they can carry into space.  The Titan rocket, the largest of the three launchers, is capable of lifting  more than 11,000 pounds into geosynchronous transfer orbit -- which is where  most communications satellites are placed. General Dynamics' Atlas, with a lift  capability of 6,000 pounds, is next in size, and the Delta is the smallest with  a maximum payload of 4,000 pounds.  </P> <P> Some doubt that the commercial market can support three U.S. rocket makers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Military Contracts Crucial  </P> <P> None of the three would be seriously hurt if it were squeezed out of the  commercial market. McDonnell Douglas, General Dynamics and Martin Marietta are  all major aerospace and defense contractors with substantial resources.  Moreover, the American companies have large government contracts to launch  satellites for the military and other federal agencies.  </P> <P> The Defense Department has on order 37 Titan, 20 Delta and 11 Atlas rockets.  Those contracts have a total value of about $6.3 billion.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the American rocket makers say they would like to recoup their  investments in the commercial market, which total about $500 million among the  three companies.  </P> <P> Pike, the Federation of American Scientists analyst, said increasing  competition in the market may make it difficult for the U.S. firms to earn a  profit. He argues that there is insufficient business to support three U.S.  rocket makers and that without military contracts one or more of the firms  would probably be out of the business.  </P> <P> U.S. General Dynamics, for example, probably could not compete in the  commercial business had it not won the Air Force business, he said. Last year,  the company won Air Force contracts valued at $171 million for three Atlas  rockets, with options for eight additional rockets.  </P> <P> "I think that decision was taken simply for keeping General Dynamics in the  rocket business," Pike said. "The rational decision would have been to keep the  Delta and Titan and tell the Atlas to go to the Smithsonian."  </P></p>

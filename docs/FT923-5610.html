			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Jaguar and Iveco to cut 800 jobs JAGUAR and Iveco Ford, the loss-making vehicle makers and Ford subsidiaries, are starting another round of job cuts as motor industry leaders warned yesterday that there was little sign the market for new cars would recover before mid-1993. Ford and Vauxhall, the UK new-car market leaders, announced price cuts of up to Pounds 1,150 on some models to clear old stocks, in response to disappointing sales in August. Jaguar, the luxury car maker which suffered a Pounds 226m loss last year, is cutting a further 700 jobs in the face of declining sales in many overseas markets, while Iveco Ford, the truck maker, is reducing its workforce by 8 per cent with the loss of another 100 jobs. The prolonged recession and the absence of any recovery in demand in August, the most important sales month of the year, has forced both Ford and Vauxhall to lower their forecasts for new car sales in 1992 to only 1.55m, a further 2.5 per cent fall from last year. Sales of new cars in the first seven months of the year were 36 per cent lower than in the peak year of 1989. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, warned that he did not foresee 'any increase in the market in the first six months next year, unless there is a change of tack by the government'. The latest job cuts by Jaguar will reduce its workforce to fewer than 7,300. The company warned that some compulsory redundancies appeared inevitable. The workforce has been cut by 40 per cent since the end of 1990. Jaguar is to cut its planned production for this year to 23,000 - unchanged from last year - compared with the 27,000 forecast earlier. Sales in the first seven months of the year at 13,237 were 10.7 per cent lower than a year ago. While sales in the US rose 1.8 per cent, sales in Japan fell 38.2 per cent to 914. Demand also fell sharply in the UK. Iveco Ford, which lost Pounds 38.6m last year, is cutting 100 hourly paid jobs from its truck assembly plant at Langley, west London. Since the beginning of the recession it has cut its workforce by 34 per cent from 1,796 at the end of 1990 to 1,183. Truck output at Langley is expected to total 8,000 this year compared with 5,750 last year, when the company was forced to cut 90 production days. The UK truck industry has suffered the steepest decline in the post-war period. New truck registrations last year were at the lowest level since 1954. Sales in the first seven months of 1992 fell 8.8 per cent. In the last three years they have fallen 59.5 per cent. Ford said yesterday it was cutting the prices of most of its remaining 1992 models by up to Pounds 1,000 in addition to any discount or trade-in value agreed by a dealer. Vauxhall said it was cutting the prices of its non-catalytic converter-equipped Nova and Cavalier models by up to Pounds 1,150.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Northwest Airlines pact agreed NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, yesterday moved further from the brink of bankruptcy after its machinists' union voted to take part in an employee pact which will save the airline Dollars 885m over three years. Earlier this month, Northwest ratified an agreement with its pilots' union. The latest machinists' pact replaces an earlier tentative agreement which was later rejected by the union. The flight attendants' union is expected to accept the package when it votes later this week. As part of the terms of the deal, employees will have the option of taking a 37.5 per cent sake in the company in exchange for concessions. NWA, the parent of Northwest, has also reached preliminary agreements with its major bank and supplier creditors to reschedule most debt payments through 1997, provided the carrier obtains the labour concessions.</p>

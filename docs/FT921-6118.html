			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Offshore Centres (8): New hub for financial services emerges - Tim Coone looks at Ireland IN JUST three years, Dublin's International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) has emerged from a derelict docklands site to be a new European hub for the management of the financial assets of some of the biggest corporations in the world. Since the first, new office block on the 27-acre site opened in 1990, familiar names associated with diverse manufacturing activities, such as IBM, Alcan, Volkswagen, Volvo, Grand Metropolitan and Outokumpu, have all chosen Dublin as a location from which to manage their world-wide corporate treasury operations. Others, such as Asea Brown Boverie, BMW, Ericsson and Coca-Cola, have chosen the IFSC as the hub from which to manage their world-wide insurance needs. Large corporations such as these, with manufacturing assets and properties scattered in scores of locations around the world, set up their own insurance companies through which their subsidiaries then place their property insurance. Captive insurance, as it is known, 'has developed well and quite unexpectedly', according to Mr Brendan Logue, the manager of the financial services programme at Ireland's Industrial Development Authority (IDA), which is responsible for the overseas marketing of the IFSC. On the back of this business, re-insurance operations have also grown rapidly. Far from being a glass and chrome shell, housing dubious 'brass-plate' operations often associated with offshore centres, the IFSC now has 140 financial services companies, giving direct employment to 986 people. One hundred and ninety five projects have been approved, which have made commitments to employ eventually almost 3,000 people. Originally the brainchild of Mr Dermot Desmond, a controversial but forward-looking Irish businessman, the IFSC was conceived as a means of transforming the derelict docklands area of Dublin into a new European financial centre, which would complement the growth in new manufacturing industries that have sprung up across Ireland under the stimulus of the IDA. Ireland offers many advantages compared with rival centres such as Luxembourg and the Channel Islands, through lower wage and housing costs, a skilled and abundant labour force and good communications with other European business centres. The IFSC is just a 10-minute walk from Dublin's city centre and a 20 minutes' drive from the airport. The development site has plenty of room for expansion and is planned to have complementary developments of a 300-bedroom hotel, a marina, shopping and restaurant facilities and residential properties. If a planned development of a Light Rail Transport (LRT) system gets EC approval and funding this year, much of Dublin's traffic congestion problems can also be overcome, which is one of the city's few drawbacks for developers of services-related industries. One of the key attractions without doubt, though, is a favourable 10 per cent corporate tax rate for companies that set themselves up in the IFSC, similar to the rate for manufacturing companies that establish in Ireland. In 1990, the European Commission approved a five-year extension to 2005 for the application of this rate to the IFSC, acceding to Ireland's argument that its peripheral location within the EC and high unemployment rate justified preferential treatment. Other incentives include 100 per cent first-year capital allowances for development expenditure by owner-occupiers, 100 per cent first-year capital allowances on plant and equipment expenditure, 200 per cent tax deductable rent allowances for tenanted properties and rates exemptions. A measure of the IFSC's growth is given by the Revenue Commissioners' latest figures on corporation tax payments by companies established in the centre. In 1988, its first year of operation, the IFSC generated IPounds 3.7m in revenue. By 1990, this had grown to IPounds 48.2m. Figures for 1991 are expected to be close to IPounds 70m. This would imply profits of some IPounds 700m generated by the 140 firms so far established. Business turnover would thus be maybe 10 times greater. The loss of tax revenues by other EC states has led to the first big row over the IFSC's privileged status within the EC. The German government, finding itself pressured by the mounting costs of the country's reunification, is amending its tax legislation, making corporate profits subject to the same 56 per cent tax rate regardless of source. One of the IFSC's attractions has been the possibility for cash-rich firms to place their surplus cash in investment funds which are then managed in Dublin by specialist companies. Profits are taxed at the 10 per cent rate and can be repatriated without further tax liabilities due to Ireland's double taxation treaties with its EC partners. Many leading foreign banks, such as Dresdner Bank, Citibank, Chase Manhattan and Deutsche Bank, have established fund management operations in Dublin. The head of one such company said the change in legislation could put an end to the management of German corporate investment funds through Dublin. 'The big risk for the IFSC is that other countries may follow the German example,' he said. Others are not so pessimistic, however. Under the proposed tax changes in Germany, only if the overseas tax rate is less than half that of Germany's will the difference have to be paid to the German tax authorities. Fund managers have the possibility of organising their business managed through Dublin to generate an overall tax liability of around 30 per cent of profits, thereby avoiding the full 56 per cent rate in Germany and still making Dublin attractive. Failing that, one institutional fund manager pointed out that companies could challenge the new tax legislation through the German and European courts, as it would violate the double taxation treaty between Germany and Ireland and undermines the spirit of the EC legislation which gives the IFSC its privileged status. In the debate over the tax changes, one of the problems has been to agree a definition of what constitutes 'active' as opposed to 'passive' management of funds in offshore centres. Mr Logue, of the IDA, said: 'We have different interpretations. For the Germans, corporate fund management must be part of the overall business. They object to the splitting-off of fund management activity. Our certification concept is based on movement and business activity but does not qualify as far as the German legislation is concerned.' He said that the proposed changes should not have a big impact on Dublin, though. 'It is only the corporate fund management business that is most vulnerable and the additional taxes will be applicable to whatever location the funds are managed through, putting Dublin at no special disadvantage.' He said that Dublin's other large areas of business, mainly corporate treasury management and insurance activities, will not be affected by the new legislation. 'The worst situation would just be a continuation of the uncertainty,' he said. Mr Bernard Hanratty, vice-president of Citibank in Dublin, said that in the past six months since the German tax debate began 'there has been no increase in institutional investment management business from the German companies.' Nonetheless, like Mr Logue, he believes that the IFSC's long-term future lies with treasury management, mutual funds and insurance. Dublin's tax advantages disappear in 13 years' time but he said that this is sufficient time for institutions to recover their establishment costs of re-locating in Dublin. With 550,000 square feet of office space completed at the IFSC, the government, through its Customs House Docks Authority, is now negotiating the centre's second stage of development, which includes a museum, an hotel, retail facilities, housing and further office buildings. Prospective companies wishing to take advantage of the centre's tax breaks have until the end of 1994 to obtain certification.</p>

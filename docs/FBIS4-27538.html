			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il sent the 103rd birthday table to Mrs. Om in Kim  Chaek city, North Hamgyong Province, the 101st birthday table to  Kim San-ok in Wonsan City, Kangwon Province, and the centenary  birthday table to Choe Kyong-ok in Pyongwon County, South  Pyongan Province.    The number of the macrobian persons is growing under the  popular health care policy of the state in the DPRK where the  people have no worry about food, clothing and housing. The  average life expectancy at birth is 74.5 years.    The afore-said old women who received benevolent birthday  tables said that they were blessed with the sagacious leader and  they could not find proper words to express thanks to the great  benefit bestowed upon them by the dear leader.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: SCA buys out share of US joint venture SCA, the Swedish forestry products group, yesterday moved to bolster its leading position in the world market for adult incontinence products by buying out the balance of a joint venture it set up with Scott Paper of the US. Molnlycke, an SCA subsidiary, is to acquire Scott's 50 per cent interest in Scott Health Care, which the two companies set up in 1992. The price of SKr400m (Dollars 43.4m) excludes Molnlycke's share of cash balances worth about SKr100m. Scott Health Care, which is based in Philadelphia, has annual sales of more than Dollars 100m in the US and Canada for its adult incontinence and wound care products. It is an important part of Molnlycke's operations in the European and North American adult incontinence markets. Developments in recent years in the manufacture of 'fluff products', or absorbent cellulose materials, have made a big impact in the fiercely competitive market for disposable baby nappies. However, another spin-off has been in similar products for adult incontinents. Mr Bo Feltner, Molnlycke's chief executive, said his company had captured about a 20 per cent share of this market worldwide, with annual sales of more than SKr4bn. While total sales of baby nappies are stable in developed countries, sales of adult products are growing by up to 7 per cent a year. Molnlycke recently ran into difficulties in the baby nappy sector, where its products have been battling for market share in a price war with Procter &amp; Gamble and Kimberly Clark. Earlier this month, it announced a SKr1.3bn rationalisation programme to improve competitiveness.</p>

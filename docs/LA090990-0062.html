			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: CLASSIC PLASTIC RADIOS OF THE 1930S AND 1940S BY JOHN  SIDELI (E. P. DUTTON: $19.95)  </P> <P> A celebration of radios made of Catalin, a plastic similar to Bakelite that  produces deeper, more attractive colors.  </P> <P> As is so often the case with Art Deco chatchkis, these radios have strong  architectonic elements. The consummately elegant 1933 "Air King" looks like a  miniature celadon skyscraper. The designs for the pleasingly streamlined 1940  Fada "Bullet" and 1940 Addison also incorporate architectural elements, with  similarly graceful results. Unfortunately, John Sideli allows his enthusiasm  for his subject to carry him away: He describes every radio as wonderful,  charming, handsome, etc. when some of them are not. Required reading for  connoisseurs of camp Americana.  </P></p>

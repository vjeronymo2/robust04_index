			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Crisis could bring a blessing to Kuwait: US troop presence will almost surely mean a mini-boom Kuwait's financial and business community has praised the professionalism displayed by the government, the central bank and the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) in maintaining public confidence and forestalling panic in the emirate by 'flooding the market with liquidity,' as one banker put it yesterday. It is too early to assess the full impact of this latest crisis with Iraq, but the presence of more than 70,000 US and other troops will almost certainly lead to a mini-boom among importers, traders, and retailers and increased activity in consumer durables, foodstuffs and the catering business. If the US maintains its resolve over Iraq and Saddam Hussein's ability to intimidate Kuwait is eliminated, many in the banking and business communities believe a more stable and healthy political environment could emerge. This would lift Kuwait's, and the region's, economy out of the present stagnation. The rush to get cash and hard foreign currencies, which began on Friday, had largely dissipated by Monday night, and according to some bankers had been reversed by yesterday, when Kuwaiti dinars were again in demand and cash was being returned to banks. Given the imbalance in Kuwait's population between nationals and foreigners, bankers said the rush to convert had sensibly been anticipated by the central bank. Of Kuwait's total population of 1.75m, only 670,000 are nationals, latest figures from Al-Shall Economic Consultants show. Its head, Mr Jassem Al-Saadoun, is an independent economic adviser to Kuwait's parliament. The balance of some 1.1m people is made up largely of low-income workers, mainly expatriate Arabs, some 519,000 Asians (mostly Indians), 7,200 Europeans, 4,400 North Americans, 282 South Americans and 479 Australians. Those Kuwaitis who sold dinars were simply transferring money overseas rather than taking cash. The demand for hard-currency cash came from the foreigners; the demand volume from banks' automatic teller machines over the Friday and Saturday banking weekend was always manageable. The population as a whole stocked up on food, water and petrol, the last of which sells for less than Dollars 0.5 per gallon. According to Mr Ibrahim Dabdoub, chief executive of National Bank of Kuwait (NBK), the leading commercial bank, the central bank minimised panic by instructing all banks to ensure public demand was met. The only problem encountered was getting hard-currency notes from one branch to another. The government has gained in other ways. It has frequently been at odds with the national assembly over the management of the economy, but sensibly used Friday's emergency cabinet meeting as a chance to invite the assembly's speaker, Mr Ahmad al-Saadoun, into its councils. Communication has also improved between government and the public, largely because government spokesmen have encouraged the local press to be as outspoken as it wants. Even Kuwait's stock exchange, for years almost moribund, but recently reviving, has reacted favourably. Share prices lost a little in the first two days of the crisis, but since recovered. The real underlying problems confronting the economy - the fall-out from, successively, the Souk al-Manakh crisis when the unofficial stock market crashed in August 1982, the instability from the Iran-Iraq war which only ended in 1988, the oil-price fall of 1986, the Iraqi invasion of August 1990 and its aftermath, all of which drained private sector confidence - can only be met with a return to sustained political stability. A measure of the local economy's stagnation is shown in central bank figures to last June. Some 55 per cent of Kuwaiti commercial banks' assets are represented by their holdings of government bonds; a further 20 per cent by their overseas holdings. Only about 12 per cent of commercial banks' assets are in loans to the private sector. Most financing to the private sector is connected to the government's spending on oil or oil-related projects. The public sector in Kuwait is responsible for 75 per cent of overall economic activity. But the government in turn only spends when it has enough money from oil, which accounts for more than 85 per cent of annual budget revenue. The combination of prolonged instability and a government strapped for cash dominating the economy meant that for years the private sector has kept its money overseas. A portent of any impending economic recovery, were enduring political stability to return to the northern Gulf, came in September with the public issue of shares held by KIA in the Commercial Facilities Company (CFC), a local consumer credit company. National Bank of Kuwait acted as lead manager for a group of local banks and investment companies which underwrote the issue on behalf of the government. Originally, KIA intended to sell only 30m of the 98m shares, 55 per cent of its holdings in CFC. However, the share issue was five times oversubscribed and in face of this, KIA ended up selling 70m of its shares, reducing its holding in CFC to a mere 15 per cent. If confidence returns to Kuwait, further public share issues could be as successful. Then, finally, Kuwait's economy could turn the corner.</p>

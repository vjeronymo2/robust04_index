			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> Dead Ringers (HBO Sunday at 9 p.m.): Stylish horrormeister's David Cronenberg's  icy masterpiece in which Jeremy Irons plays brilliant but disintegrating twin  gynecologists. Not for the squeamish. (2:00)  </P> <P> Le Grande Chemin (Bravo Monday at 8 p.m.): Jean-Loup Hubert's acute 1987  autobiographical film starring his own son Antoine as a shy city boy adjusting  to an unhappy rural household. With Richard Bohringer, Anemone and glowing,  10-year-old Vanessa Guedj. (1:44)  </P> <P> The Killers (Channel 5 Tuesday at 3:30 a.m.): Don Siegel's terse 1964 version  of the Hemingway tale, with Angie Dickinson, John Cassavetes, and as the heavy,  Ronald Reagan, in his final film role. (2:00)  </P> <P> Harry in Your Pocket (Channel 13 Wednesday at 10 a.m.): This is a pleasant,  offbeat diversion -- a slender 1973 tale about pickpockets, with a wonderful  cast: James Coburn, Walter Pidgeon (who steals the show), Michael Sarrazin and  Trish Van Devere. (2:00)  </P> <P> Patti Rocks (Cinemax Thursday at midnight): David Burton Morris' scabrously  funny sequel to his much earlier "Loose Ends" in which a foul-mouthed womanizer  (Chris Mulkey) and his old friend (John Jenkins), now hitting 40, are on a long  journey to patch up Mulkey's latest extramarital scrape. (1:30) KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Technology: Plotting a model economy - New software which can be applied worldwide An Australian computer programmer turned economist has devised a set of software which he claims can be used to simulate virtually any of the world's leading economies. Warwick McKibbin, who studies economics at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think-tank, has sold his software to government institutes in several countries including the US, Australia, Canada and South Korea. His computer codes have been used by Japan's Economic Planning Agency to work out the possible path of Japanese growth and by the US Congressional Budget Office, the economics arm of Congress, to calculate how export and import volumes will be affected by the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement. At the heart of the program is a computer code representing about 600 mathematical relationships linking economic indicators in the main regions of the world, including Japan, western Europe, North America, the Middle East and the former Soviet Union. McKibbin - who left school at 16 to work as a programmer and later gained an economics doctorate at Harvard University - can then add to this code up to 1,000 or so other equations representing the economic features of the particular country he wants to model. In this way he can 'customise' his model, which runs on a cheap desk-top computer, to suit the specific characteristics of individual nations. The equations in McKibbin's model cover factors such as wage costs, unemployment, prices of physical assets such as houses and the amount of money being channelled through capital markets. By linking these factors according to the ways they influence each other in reality, the computer code provides a rough replication of how a specific development - an increase in interest rates affects other factors such as longer jobless queues. McKibbin, aged 36, who worked for 16 years at the Australian central bank and had a spell on secondment to the Japanese government, claims his model is easier to use than other similar sets of computer code linking up economic variables. He says also it has done a 'good job' in simulating economic conditions in specific countries, and for instance was successful two years ago in predicting the budget deficits and build-up of inflation in Germany arising from unification. Computerised models are a well-known tool used by many economists to simulate conditions in specific countries and so help in forecasting and analysis of trends such as inflation or budget deficits. However, they are normally specially designed to describe conditions in a particular country and can only occasionally be adapted in the manner of McKibbin's model. With his wife, McKibbin has formed a company, McKibbin Software Group, to sell his programs. A basic model customised to simulate the economy of a particular country costs about Dollars 15,000 (Pounds 10,000), with McKibbin charging extra for special services including updates of the software. He is looking to build on the company's current annual sales of about Dollars 150,000, and one possible client in the future could be the UK Treasury with which the Australian economist has had tentative discussions. The Treasury already has its own purpose-built model of the UK economy which is supervised by an in-house team of 30 economists. However, the UK government department - which has been severely criticised in recent years for misjudging the path of the domestic economy - is increasingly trying to link up with outside economists to see if it can improve its techniques of economic analysis. Use of 'rival' models which work in a different way from the Treasury's model might be one way to build up an alternative picture of what is happening in the economy.</p>

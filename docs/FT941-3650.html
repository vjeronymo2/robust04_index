			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Linde cuts payout as earnings slide Linde, the German engineering group, is to propose a DM1 cut to DM14 in its dividend for 1993, following a 30.5 per cent fall in earnings to DM369m (Dollars 220m). The company, a leading supplier of fork lift trucks, industrial gases and refrigeration equipment, said its materials handling divisions had been worst hit by the recession. Group sales fell 4.8 per cent to DM7.2bn last year, while incoming orders of DM7.33bn were little changed, it said in a statement yesterday. Linde, which earned record profits in 1992, consistently warned of a downturn for most of last year, reporting a 26 per cent contraction in the European fork lift truck market in the first six months. Profits at the German parent, Linde AG, fell 22.5 per cent to DM150m. The workforce was cut by 2.6 per cent during the year.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The United States is preparing to store 600 new nuclear bombs in underground  bunkers in West Germany to replace an existing arsenal, the Hamburg-based Stern  magazine said. Stern said the United States is building 200 bunkers at nine  bases to store the bombs following a 1983 North Atlantic Treaty Organization  decision to replace its aging nuclear stockpile. The magazine named the new  bombs as "B-61 Models 3 and 4." Nuclear artillery shells are also being  replaced with more modern weapons, it added.  </P></p>

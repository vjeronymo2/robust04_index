The report  shows the dishonesty of the allegations made by the so-called  human rights organizations on the island. Signed by Joseph  Gerald Sullivan, the head of the U.S. Interests Section, the  report points out that in the cases presented by the heads of  those groups, the subjects are incapable of proving that they  have been or are victims of persecution or violations.    The text was addressed to the State Department, the Central  Intelligence Agency, and the Immigration and Naturalization  Service, and was circulated in Geneva while Cuban Ambassador  Jose Perez Novoa responded to the report presented by (Carl  Johann Gros), the special rapporteur of the UN Human Rights  Commission assigned to Cuba.    The official text of the U.S. mission recognizes that the  number of political prisoners is very small and that once they  are freed, they are not persecuted, discriminated against, or  mistreated. Most of them request visas at the U.S. Interests  Section to escape Cuba's economic situation, not out of fear.  Furthermore, the document points out that many of the members of  those groups take that path as the most opportune way to  emigrate toward the United States with that country's official  backing.    The document, signed by the head of the U.S. Interests  Section, describes the differences between groups and the need  to work harder to identify those who, as demonstrated by their  nature, would be most useful in serving the objectives of the  United States.</p>

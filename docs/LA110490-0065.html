			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN JOSE STAYS IN FIRST, DEFEATS FULLERTON, 44-6  </P> <P> With San Jose State's 44-6 victory over Cal State Fullerton Saturday night, the  Spartans appear well on their way to a Nov. 17 showdown against Fresno State to  determine the Big West Conference championship.  </P> <P> That same day, the Titans (1-9) may be involved in another showdown of sorts --  a game against New Mexico State to determine the worst Division I-A football  team in the nation.  </P> <P> Fullerton, which lost its ninth in a row, is ranked 105th out of 106 Division  I-A teams by The National, an all-sports publication. New Mexico State is  106th.  </P> <P> New Mexico State will be a big underdog against San Jose State next week. Ditto  for the Titans against Utah State.  </P> <P> Barring any upsets, Fullerton will play New Mexico State in Las Cruces Nov. 17  -- for none of the marbles.  </P> <P> Like any good coach, Fullerton's Gene Murphy refuses to look ahead to a  possible un-championship game.  </P> <P> "I'll talk about New Mexico State next week," he said. "We're looking forward  to playing Utah State."  </P> <P> That sure beats looking back at Saturday night's game. The Titans were  manhandled by a far-superior San Jose State team, which improved to 6-2-1, 5-0  in the conference.  </P> <P> The Spartans, behind the passing of Ralph Martini and the running of Sheldon  Canley, had 670 total yards, including 473 in the first half, when they took a  37-0 lead.  </P> <P> Martini, with plenty of protection and so many wide-open receivers he probably  had trouble deciding who to throw to, completed 29 of 39 passes for 443 yards  and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> Canley, a tailback who leads the nation in all-purpose yards, carried 21 times  for 123 yards and three touchdowns. He also caught six passes for 58 yards.  </P> <P> David Blakes caught seven passes for 95 yards, and Bobby Blackmon caught four  passes for 109 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> "Pass defense has definitely not been our strong suit this season," Murphy  said.  </P> <P> San Jose State put the game away in the first half by scoring on six of nine  possessions. Twenty first-half plays went for 10 yards or more.  </P> <P> The Spartans finished with 29 first downs, compared to Fullerton's 13, and 504  yards passing.  </P></p>

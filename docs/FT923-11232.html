			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Books: But where is the sauce? BRILLAT-SAVARIN: THE JUDGE AND HIS STOMACH by Giles MacDonogh John Murray Pounds 25, 248 pages IN ANY dispute over the founders of modern gastronomy, Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin would almost certainly be a party - thanks to a small volume he wrote in 1825. Yet, as Giles MacDonogh's engaging if earnest portrait shows, Brillat's contribution to the culinary arts was distinctly unlikely. In essence, Brillat was a rather chubby provincial who happened to live in interesting times. He came from an insignificant town called Belley, in the department of Bourg-en-Bresse, to the south and east of Lyons. Compared to other parts of France, this was a culinary as well as political backwater. With the exception of fine poultry and the fresh-water crayfish which teemed in local rivers and lakes, the area had little of gastronomic distinction to offer. Brillat was born in 1755 into a relatively prosperous bourgeois family. He read law at the University of Dijon, but dabbled in other subjects, notably medicine and chemistry. He then embarked on the life of a contented provincial advocate. But for the Revolution, says MacDonogh, we might never have heard his name. In 1789, Brillat trotted off to Paris as the elected representative of the Third Estate to the Estates General. There followed a turbulent and risk-strewn career, during which he survived constant changes of regime. All the while, he indulged his passion for food and wine. He also gained from exposure to a range of culinary cultures. A period in exile sent him to America. During the Empire, he mingled with Russians and other exotics. And, doubtless, he read the earliest almanacs and books to explore the notion of gastronomy. Brillat's hugely influential La physiologie du gout was published a mere two months before his death in 1825. It was a commercial success from the start. MacDonogh is at his best describing the book's charms, its egotism, its aphorisms and reminiscences which break up passages of otherwise indigestible science. Brillat deserves his biography. He perhaps deserved a saucier treatment.</p>

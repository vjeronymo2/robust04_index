Mr Mauro Molchansky, the company's chief financial officer, attributed the improved performance to a recuperation in world pulp prices, a reduction of local sales tax, an increase in production and economy of scale due to the coming on stream of a Dollars 1.3bn expansion project. Gross operating revenues for nine months were Dollars 345m, up 44 per cent and production was 33 per cent up at 760,000 tonnes.

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> CEREMONIES SALUTE SOLDIERS WHO MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE  </P> <P> Quiet emotion marked Memorial Day ceremonies in Ventura County on Monday, as  hundreds of veterans and their families gathered to hear speeches and lay  wreaths in honor of those who lost their lives in battle.  </P> <P> In a solemn ceremony amid hundreds of American flags lining the paths of Ivy  Lawn Cemetery in Ventura, Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) told a crowd  of 300 that the sacrifices of America's war dead have paved the way for  democracy in some Eastern bloc countries.  </P> <P> "The countries that some of us never thought would be free are becoming free,"  Lagomarsino said. "Let's all pause to consider how much of the new democracy  now sweeping the globe is directly attributable to the day-to-day sacrifices of  these men and women at arms."  </P> <P> Thousands of military men and women remain missing in action or may still be  held as prisoners of war, and they too should be remembered, said Lagomarsino,  who is chairman of the House POW-MIA Task Force.  </P> <P> After Lagomarsino's speech, more than three dozen wreaths were presented by  Ventura veterans groups, including the American Legion, the Retired Officers  Assn. and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Many saluted stiffly after placing the  bright bouquets before the podium.  </P> <P> At a ceremony across the county, Rear Adm. George Strohsahl Jr., commander of  the Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu, addressed a crowd of about 250  at Pierce Bros. Santa Paula Cemetery.  </P> <P> Erect in full white uniform, Strohsahl said although the phrases glasnost and  perestroika seemed to signify a movement toward peace between the Soviet Union  and the United States, "We can't count on phrases to keep the sea lanes open,  or the skies free of enemy missiles and aircraft."  </P> <P> Strohsahl saluted the ultimate sacrifice Americans made in past wars but  cautioned: "Democracy works, but not without sacrifice or a standing, strong  and ready military."  </P> <P> While praising all Americans who have died in battle since the Revolutionary  War, Strohsahl gave special attention to the Vietnam War, which he called "a  bitter conflict."  </P> <P> Strohsahl said although many Americans questioned the validity of the Vietnam  War, "no cause is unjust when freedom is the price."  </P> <P> At the end of each service, spectators stood at attention as a solitary bugle  sounded taps. They then dispersed for a quiet moment at the gravesides of  friends or relatives.  </P> <P> At Ivy Lawn, Vietnam veteran Ernie Tumamait placed a bouquet next to the  gravestone of his father, World War II medic Vernon L. Tumamait, who died in  1955. He also placed a bouquet on the grave of a soldier buried next to his  father, someone he never knew.  </P> <P> "The ceremony was beautiful," Tumamait said. Next to him stood his wife, Anita,  and his two young grandchildren, Johnny and Monique. The couple said they  brought the children so they could see what Memorial Day is really about, and  why they get the day off school.  </P> <P> Said Tumamait: "I think every young person should understand the importance of  this day."  </P> <P> Holiday TRIBUTES: Los Angeles area ceremonies honor fallen veterans.

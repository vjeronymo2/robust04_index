			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRAFFIC SITUATION IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> I believe that there are some people driving around in Orange County who  shouldn't have a license.  </P> <P> The traffic has grown tremendously all over Orange County. Coming home on the  freeway, or even the side streets, is almost like a nightmare. No one drives  the speed limit any more. No one uses signals when turning or changing lanes.  And people are always driving into the bike lane before they plan to turn. And  people wonder why there are so many accidents.  </P> <P> If everyone just learned to be patient and accept the traffic, there would  probably be less-stressful people and accidents. Leave a little earlier. Don't  speed and jeopardize others because you're running late. Be cautious, use your  signals correctly, and stay out of the bike lane. Just be courteous to other  drivers because the streets are just as much theirs as yours.  </P> <P> JILL SADEY  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook disposal may raise over Pounds 700m Tiphook, the transport leasing group, is expected to announce soon the disposal of its container business to Transamerica, the US financial services group, for a figure in excess of Pounds 700m. Shares in Tiphook yesterday fell 6p to 72p after weekend reports that the groups had yet to settle details of the disposal, which was first announced in November. The initial purchase price announced was Pounds 830m, a much higher figure than analysts had believed to be obtainable. The price has been reduced following due diligence by Transamerica, which is now complete, but a figure over Pounds 700m would still substantially reduce Tiphook's borrowings of about Pounds 1.2bn. Tiphook has said it intends to retain the group's other activities - including its fleet of 25,065 truck trailers, the biggest fleet in Europe - which it believes will be capable of servicing the remaining debt. The publication of Tiphook's December capacity utilisation figures, due today will be delayed until the container disposal is complete. Shareholders will be given details of the group's structure and future trading strategies before the end of the month.</p>

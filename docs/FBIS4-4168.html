			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Russia's civic accord,  which is aimed at stabilizing the political and economic  situation in the country, was singed here in the Kremlin today.    Present at the signing ceremony were President Boris  Yeltsin,  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, speakers of the two houses  Ivan Rybkin and Vladimir Shumeyko, and political parties'  leaders and leaders of the republics and regions.    The document was proposed by Yeltsin soon after his main  opponents, including former Vice-President Aleksander Rutskoy  and former parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, were freed in  late February by the State Duma's political amnesty.    More than 100 participants of the ceremony signed the  document, which will remain valid for two years.</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Public pay 'runs ahead of guideline' The government's 'clumsy' intervention in the Railtrack negotiations has highlighted the fact that it is unsure whether its public-sector pay policy is working, according to the independent pay analysts Incomes Data Services. An IDS analysis of the public sector freeze on pay bills finds that most groups have settled for between 2.5 and 3 per cent, comfortably above last year's 1.5 per cent norm. 'The pattern of awards suggests that many public-sector employers have used the inflation rate and the Pay Review Body awards as yardsticks for pay increases and then aimed for efficiency savings to match,' says IDS. In local government the 2.9 per cent Pay Review Body award to teachers has been a strong factor in pay decisions. In the NHS, the administrative and clerical staff have been offered 1.95 per cent. Other groups have been made opening offers of 1.75 per cent, which unions have rejected. IDS says private sector deals are starting to push up over 3 per cent. The increases include performance-based rises of between 0 and 9 per cent for 38,000 retail staff at Boots the Chemist (adding 3 per cent to pay scales) and a flat rate increase of Pounds 6 a week from July for 52,000 staff at Marks and Spencer, worth an average 4 per cent to a sales assistant.

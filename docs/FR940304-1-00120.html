			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For gas ovens, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate product classes for standard and self-cleaning convection ovens and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiant burner gas ovens. As with electric convection ovens, the Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Home Appliance Manufacturers said the unique operating characteristics of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the convection oven warrant a separate class. (Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers, No. 61A at 53). For radiant burner gas ovens, the Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Home Appliance Manufacturers made reference to its comments on radiant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burners for gas cooktops. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 61A at 53).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the discussion of product classes, the Department has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established two product classes for gas ovens (standard and self-cleaning).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that convection and radiant burner gas ovens should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzed as design options. A separate class would be warranted if lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient design options had consumer utility relative to convection and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiant burner gas ovens. The design options commented on by the Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Home Appliance Manufacturers and others have all been considered for gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ovens. The bi-radiant oven concept referred to by the Natural Resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Defense Council was determined to be applicable to electric ovens only. <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data provided by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers, suppliers, and published reports <FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>  were used in the analysis of gas ovens. Manufacturers' data supplied by the Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers were the only source of cost and efficiency data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided with which the Department could analyze oven separators. As with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric ovens, the improved insulation and reduced vent size design options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were analyzed only for standard gas ovens. The Department did not receive any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy-use or cost data concerning the radiant burner gas oven, thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventing it from being analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> D.P. DeWitt and M.V. Peart, ``Bi-Radiant Oven a Low-Energy Oven System,'' Purdue University, prepared for Oak Ridge National Laboratory, April 1980, ORNL/Sub&hyph;80/0082/1, ORNL/Sub&hyph;80/0082/2, ORNL/Sub&hyph;80/0082/3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Costing Analysis of Design Options for Residential Appliances and Space Conditioning Equipment,'' Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, prepared by ADM Associates, Inc., Purchase No. 4541710, December 1987, ``Energy Efficient Electrical Product Knowledge Base,'' Canadian Electrical Association, prepared by ORTECH International, C.E.A. No. 821 U 678, October 1989, U.S. Department of Energy Engineering Analysis, DOE/CS&hyph;0166, June 1980. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For microwave ovens, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that high-grade stainless steel (or reflective material steel coating)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be more efficient than painted cold-rolled steel by approximately one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers No. 61A at 30&hyph;33). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that a small efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvement may be available if fan air flow is increased or if motor energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption is decreased. (Id. at 32). The Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers said that magnetron efficiency has reached its maximum at 72  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent. (Id. at 33). The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that solid-state power supplies are not more efficient, but cost more. At low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power levels, improved performance is expected because they eliminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on/off cycling used by other power supplies. (Id. at 34). The Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that there are no data available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggest that solid-state microwave generators would increase the generating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency over the 70+ percent efficiency available in today's magnetrons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Id. at 34). The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified wave guide may decrease energy absorption by one percent. (Id. at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35). The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that microwave  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oven models with fan-type stirrers use a cover over the fan to prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadvertent damage to the fan when inserting or removing food and to prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degradation of the wave guide due to food splatter. While these ceramic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stirrer covers may absorb some microwave energy, they are essential for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protecting the stirrer and to prevent accumulation of food splatter inside the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wave-guide. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers No. 61A at 35).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has utilized the Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers's estimates for energy savings from improved magnetrons,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflective surfaces, modified wave guides, and more efficient fans. After  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's comments, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department has also excluded solid-state microwave generators and modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food stirrers from its cost/efficiency tables. The Department has generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data for, and included a more efficient power supply in, its cost/efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis for microwave ovens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arkansas Western Gas said that maintenance and installation should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered. (Arkansas Western Gas, No. 64 at 7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

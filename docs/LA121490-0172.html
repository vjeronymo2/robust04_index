			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME DENIES HOLTZ REPORTS  </P> <P> Notre Dame officials denied a report that football Coach Lou Holtz is stepping  up efforts to become head coach of the Minnesota Vikings or Tampa Bay  Buccaneers.  </P> <P> Columnist Paul Domowitch of the Philadelphia Daily News on Thursday quoted  unidentified sources as saying the impetus for Holtz's job hunt is the NCAA's 2  1/2-year investigation of the University of Minnesota, where Holtz coached in  1984 and 1985.  </P> <P> Responding to the Daily News report on Holtz, Notre Dame Sports Information  Director John Heisler said: "I think there's a lot of misinformation in the  story. This has been answered. At every press conference we've had in the last  six weeks, he (Holtz) has said he's not contacted anyone.  </P> <P> "He's not looking for another job. He'll be back at Notre Dame."  </P> <P> The Daily News said sources told Domowitch that Holtz has an intermediary in  contact with both Tampa Bay and Minnesota about his interest.  </P> <P> The Tampa job became available two weeks ago when Ray Perkins was fired.  Vikings Coach Jerry Burns has hinted that he will retire at the end of the  season.  </P></p>

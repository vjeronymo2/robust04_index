			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Jun 16, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima  (parliament) adopted amendments Thursday to the law on radio and  television stipulating free distribution and use of state-owned  radio and television program charts.    Consequently, legislators rejected the previous version of  the bill that applied copyright norms to state-owned radio and  TV programs.    Democratic Party's Ilga Grava supported the new version  claiming that a broadcast schedule is not creative work but "a  showing of work content of state institutions."    The paid publication of the programs would soar newspaper  prices and tax-payers would have to make additional investment  into the maintenance of state-owned radio and television,  speakers said.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE USES PLOY TO BOOST FUNDING FOR 'STAR WARS'; DEFENSE BILL VOTED  </P> <P> The Senate, just two days after voting to freeze funding for "Star Wars," voted  Thursday to add $600 million to the controversial missile defense program for  the coming fiscal year.  </P> <P> Hours later, by a vote of 96 to 2, the Senate adopted the full $288-billion  military spending bill. A House-Senate conference committee will meet next week  to thrash out a final version of the appropriations bill.  </P> <P> The earlier vote had been widely interpreted as a setback for "Star Wars," and,  on the surface, the vote appeared to be a reversal of that defeat. But sponsors  of the increase said that the new vote represents no change in the Senate's  basic reservations about the program.  </P> <P> Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), a leading advocate of  Thursday's move, described it as -- in effect -- a parliamentary ploy in the  complex negotiations now going on between the House and the Senate over "Star  Wars" funding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Administration Silent  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, which opposed the Senate's freeze, had no comment on  Thursday's action. "We're still a long way from a completed budget cycle," said  Maj. Alan Freitag, a spokesman for the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative  Office.  </P> <P> Nunn said that the 53-47 vote did not reflect a change of the Senate's  position. He said the additional $600 million would only help the Senate to  achieve the goal of its earlier vote -- a freeze.  </P> <P> "Only in America -- only in the Senate . . . can we reach this kind of  dilemma," Nunn said, referring to the anomaly of voting an increase to achieve  a freeze.  </P> <P> The current chapter in the saga of "Star Wars" funding began last Tuesday, when  the Senate voted 66 to 34 to freeze funding for the program at slightly less  than $4 billion in fiscal 1990, which begins Sunday.  </P> <P> Not only was it the first time that the Senate had ever rejected an increase in  "Star Wars" funding, but the freeze represented about $600 million less than  the Senate had approved earlier this year in setting a maximum ceiling on such  spending.  </P> <P> The House, which is more hostile to "Star Wars" than the Senate, had voted to  spend only $3.1 billion.  </P> <P> Tuesday's Senate vote occurred as members of the House and Senate Armed  Services committees were engaged in hard bargaining to determine what the final  spending level would be in fiscal 1990. House members interpreted the Senate's  freeze vote as a sign of weakness on the part of the Senate.  </P> <P> As a result, Nunn said, House members are now demanding that the two chambers  agree to something less than a freeze for "Star Wars" -- or about $3.5 billion.  </P> <P> Nunn, in a Senate floor speech requesting the $600-million increase, warned his  colleagues that he would be forced to cave in to the House demands for a cut  unless the Senate bolstered his bargaining position by adding the extra money.  His argument persuaded even some long-time "Star Wars" critics such as Sen.  Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) to vote for the increase.  </P> <P> But Nunn pledged that the goal of the second Senate vote was to hold next  year's "Star Wars" spending at this year's level, not increase it. He said  support for "Star Wars" is "eroding" in the Senate, which has always favored  the program, even though the two votes may be sending a mixed signal about the  true sentiment in the chamber.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wants Goals Defined  </P> <P> Nunn said that Congress cannot continue to spend billions of dollars for the  program unless President Bush more clearly defines the goals of what is known  officially as the Strategic Defense Initiative.  </P> <P> "They are going to have to take a hard look at what they really want," said  Nunn, " . . . and clearly their time is running out."  </P> <P> Even though the Senate voted to bolster Nunn's bargaining position, it was  uncertain whether the ploy would persuade House negotiators to accept a freeze  -- particularly when the Senate vote was avowedly done only to affect the  House-Senate conference.  </P> <P> In fact, Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) argued against the vote on precisely  those grounds. "We should not be trying to create a phony bargaining chip that  House members can see through as clearly as they can a cloudless day," he said.  </P> <P> Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and  Nunn's counterpart in the negotiations, was unavailable for comment, but a  spokesman said that House members are still adamant about cutting back on the  funding.  </P> <P> Unlike in past years, when former President Ronald Reagan threatened to veto  the Pentagon spending bill if Congress cut "Star Wars" funding, Bush  Administration officials have been silent on the subject in recent days.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney acknowledged on Wednesday that "Star Wars" is  competing for funds with other priority programs in Congress, such as anti-drug  measures and aid to Poland.  </P> <P> The Senate voted also to require that $820 million of the money authorized for  "Star Wars" in fiscal 1990 be used for research on lasers and particle beams.  Supporters of the proposal said they were afraid that the Administration would  sacrifice long-term research on such "directed energy weapons" in favor of  shorter-term research.  </P> <P> The defense spending bill includes the following provisions:  </P> <P>  -- Elimination of all $1.8 billion for procurement of the Trident 2 missile  but an increase of $70 million to Bush's request of $216 million for research  and development of the submarine-launched weapon.  </P> <P>  -- Endorsement of Bush's request of $1.1 billion for the multiple-warhead,  rail-garrison MX missile and $100 million for the single-warhead, Midgetman  missile.  </P> <P>  -- Endorsement of a plan to shut down 86 domestic military bases and scale  down five more.  </P> <P>  -- Funding of $255 million for research and development on the Marine Corps'  V-22 Osprey, the vertical-takeoff plane the Bush Administration sought to  cancel.  </P></p>

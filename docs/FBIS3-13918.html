The wounded patients expressed thanks and appreciation to  His  Majesty King Husayn for his generous Hashemite initiative toward  the victims of the ugly massacre, committed in the holy Ibrahimi  Mosque during the blessed month of Ramadan, and Jordan's  honorable pan-Arab position, under the leadership of his majesty  in support of their brothers the sons of the Palestinian people  and the holy shrines in all circumstances.    His Majesty King Husayn had ordered the formation of a  higher  committee to raise donations for the massacre's victims.

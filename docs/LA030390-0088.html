			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POOR STORAGE RUINING NASA DATA, REPORT SAYS;  </P> <P> SCIENCE: THE GAO CHARGES IRREPLACEABLE TAPES MAY BE DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR.  SPACE AGENCY OFFICIALS STRONGLY DISPUTE THE FINDINGS.  </P> <P> Hundreds of thousands of magnetic tapes containing irreplaceable scientific  data from American space missions are deteriorating -- and perhaps damaged  beyond repair -- because of improper storage and management, the General  Accounting Office said Friday.  </P> <P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has stored at least 1.2  million reels of information beeped back to Earth from orbiting satellites and  lunar and planetary probes during the 32-year history of the American space  program, the GAO reported.  </P> <P> Yet NASA "does not have an agency-wide inventory of its data" and "does not  know what is being retained and where it is located," endangering critical  information that could be vital to future scientific ventures, the GAO  investigators charged.  </P> <P> In a report prepared for the House Space, Science and Technology Committee, the  federal auditing agency said eight of 10 storage and processing facilities it  inspected failed to fully satisfy the accepted regulations for storing such  material.  </P> <P> Five of the facilities were in compliance with fewer than half of the  government and industry archival guidelines, the GAO said.  </P> <P> NASA sharply disputed the major findings contained in the 76-page document,  challenging the GAO's assertion that it has failed to protect space-science  data as a national resource for future generations.  </P> <P> John E. O'Brien, NASA assistant deputy administrator, said in a letter printed  along with the GAO findings that the report was "unnecessarily harsh, and  contains sweeping generalizations and extrapolations which we believe to be  unfounded and unsubstantiated."  </P> <P> Specifically, O'Brien said NASA could find no evidence that important data has  been lost as a result of mismanagement. And he said that all of the  recommendations offered by the GAO already were being addressed.  </P> <P> The report was issued as NASA prepares to go to Congress for the first major  funding of new space programs, which will produce a flow of information  dwarfing the output of satellites and deep-space payloads launched in the past.  </P> <P> The report cited as an example the planned Earth Observation System, which  would gather data needed to accurately forecast the effects of global warming.  </P> <P> If deployed as now recommended by the space agency, the system would generate a  volume of data equivalent to all the books in the Library of Congress every six  weeks, the GAO said. One of its orbiting platforms, loaded with a dozen  scientific instruments, would transmit a trillion bits of data per day, enough  to fill 700 high-density magnetic tapes.  </P> <P> Members of Congress who are seeking data needed for computer models of global  climate behavior have taken new interest in finding out how much and what kind  of information the space agency already has collected.  </P> <P> "NASA's data management has been one of its weakest features," said Sen. Albert  Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), chairman of a Senate subcommittee on science, technology  and space. "We've been trying for months to complete an inventory of exactly  what they have, where it is, and how it can be accessed. It has been an  eye-opening experience."  </P> <P> The GAO investigators reported finding space-research data in storage  facilities that failed to meet criteria for temperature and humidity control,  fire and water protection and tape maintenance.  </P> <P> More important, the report said, some of the most significant tape-management  deficiencies were found in the two largest facilities responsible for managing  irreplaceable data: the National Space Science Data Center at NASA's Goddard  Space Flight Center in Maryland and a U.S. Geological Survey facility in Sioux  Falls, S.D.  </P> <P> The GAO report noted that officials at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,  which controls the United States' planetary space missions, have determined  that important data has been lost through faulty storage and management.  </P> <P> JPL officials "with substantial experience and expertise" estimated that half  of the 130,000 tapes the laboratory had stored at the Los Angeles Federal  Records Center at Laguna Niguel "may be damaged beyond recovery or contain data  of little or no value," the GAO said.  </P> <P> "This evidence, combined with the serious physical storage conditions . . .  substantiates our concern that NASA's space-science data stored on magnetic  tapes are at serious risk of becoming partially or completely unusable," the  report said.  </P> <P> Concern about deterioration of data gathered by the Voyager, Viking and Mariner  spacecraft led JPL officials to copy 12,500 reels of tape in 1983 to preserve  priceless information gathered from the planets of Mercury, Mars, Venus,  Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. The $495,000 project showed that efforts to  restore 10-year-old tapes often led to their destruction.  </P> <P> NASA is now experimenting with the use of optical disks as a replacement for  magnetic tapes.  </P> <P> At Goddard Space Flight Center, 10,000 tapes of satellite data have been stored  on just 243 disks, but the GAO report said it is too early to tell whether  improvements offered by that technology address the myriad problems of data  storage, preservation and dissemination.  </P> <P> While the report primarily blamed NASA for the "deplorable conditions" under  which the scientific data is stored and maintained, it said the General  Services Administration and the National Archives and Records Administration  also share responsibility.  </P></p>

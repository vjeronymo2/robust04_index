			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Growth in GDP allays US concerns The US economy grew slightly more rapidly than originally estimated in the second quarter of this year, but not as fast as some analysts had feared, writes James Harding. The US Commerce Department announced an upward revision of the growth in second-quarter real gross domestic product - the output of goods and services in the US - to 3.8 per cent from its initial estimate of 3.7 per cent. The increase in GDP between April and June, measured at seasonally adjusted annualised rates, follows a 3.3 per cent rise in the first quarter of 1994 and a 6.3 per cent increase in last year's final period. Analysts had expected an upward revision to as much as 4.2 per cent, which would have raised concerns that the economy was growing too rapidly. Financial markets yesterday appeared to interpret the moderate increase on the original estimate as a sign that the Federal Reserve's pre-emptive tightening of monetary policy to head off inflation was having the desired effect. The government also reported that after-tax profits of US corporations rose 7.4 per cent in the second quarter in a sharp reversal of the 3.5 per cent drop in the first period.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Medan, Indonesia, April 18 (AFP) -- North Sumatra'  main city of Medan was returning to normal Monday after workers'  protests in which one businessman died, but anti-ethnic Chinese  sentiment was still apparent.    Most businesses were back in operation and traffic had  returned to normal but a businessman said "there are still some  worries" and said that many of his women colleagues and  employees were still being brought to and from works by male  relatives.    The number of security officials deployed in strategic areas  in the city, including shopping areas, was increased to 3,000  from 2,000 Sunday following rumours that students might join the  protests, a witness said.    The witness added that most workers involved in the protests  had yet to return to work.    Pamphlets circulated in private by an organization claiming  to be "an indigenous group", called on Medan residents to rid  the city of ethnic Chinese whom they said "destroy Indonesia's  economy and destroy the moral of officials by among others,  colluding with officials to get credits."    This was a reference to the case of the state-owned Bank  Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo), which suffered losses of up to  613 million dollars after issuing credits without proper  collaterals and procedures following alleged collusions between  high-ranking officials and ethnic Chinese businessman Eddy  Tansil.    Labour protests in North Sumatra started Thursday, involving  tens of thousands of workers who, among other demands, urged the  government to increase wages and recognize the right of workers  to organize. At present the government only recognizes the All  Indonesia Workers Union (SPSI).    The protests, which continued Friday on a larger scale,  degenerated into an anti-Chinese riot and an ethnic Chinese  factory owner, July Kristanto, was killed as scores of shops and  factories were vandalized.    The Chinese, who make up about one-third of Medan's 1.5  million population, are widely resented in Indonesia because of  their economic power.    The REPUBLIKA daily Sunday quoted an unidentified  businessman  here as saying the riots had forced several ethnic Chinese  businessmen to flee to Singapore and other countries.    Medan District Military Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Agus  Ramadan, said that four battalions totalling about 2,600  security personnel had been deployed in the area in anticipation  of further "anti-ethnic Chinese demonstrations".    The military said that about 120 people had been arrested  for  alleged involvement in murder, vandalism and arson, but that all  but 20 had since been released.    A Vice-Chairman of the Sejahtera (Prosperous) independent  labour union (SBSI), Ghufron, said in Jakarta Monday that the  union had together with eight other non-governmental  organizations, organized Thursday's demonstration but denied  inciting the demonstrators to violence.    An SBSI official dispatched to Medan on a fact-finding  mission, reported that several local thugs had admitted to being  paid by "certain parties" to manipulate the strike by initiating  vandalism and attacking people," another SBSI Vice-Chairman,  Sunarti, said.    Sunarti declined to elaborate until the fact finding mission  had been completed.    "The workers detained in the wake of the strike should be  immediately released," Sunarti said, adding that the government  should also "be capable of arresting and punishing those who  have consciously manipulated the strike with violence."    The union said that 78 people were still detained by police  in Medan, including the union's local chapter secretary and  treasurer and the wife of a union secretary.    The protest which spread to two nearby provincial towns  Sunday, were reported to be continuing Monday in one of them,  Siantar, although on a much smaller scale, an SBSI executive  said.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNDERGROUND PALESTINIAN LEADERS VOW ESCALATION DESPITE CRACKDOWN  </P> <P> Underground Palestinian leaders said in a leaflet circulated Monday that they  will escalate their rebellion despite the army's tough new measures to quell  the 13-month revolt.  </P> <P> In the city of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, assailants hurled firebombs  into an Israeli bank, injuring several Arab employees and causing minor  property damage, the army said. Arab reports said four employees were treated  for burns or smoke inhalation.  </P> <P> In the underground leaflet circulated in the occupied territories, the Unified  National Leadership of the Uprising rejected Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's  proposal to hold elections in the occupied territories in return for an end to  violence.  </P> <P> The leaflet said the proposal "will be sent to the garbage dump of history."  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the rightist Likud Party, also  criticized Rabin's plan.  </P> <P> "I hear that all the Arabs reject this plan," Shamir told Israel Radio. "I  would not propose that we enter into a whirlpool of arguments about a thing  that stands no chance of coming into being."  </P> <P> Shamir's closest ally, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, said Israel's peace plan  still is being formulated.  </P> <P> Uprising leaders said in their leaflet that an Israeli agreement to an  international conference with PLO participation is required for an end to  anti-Israeli violence.  </P> <P> Last week, the army announced that it will destroy the homes of stone-throwers  and fire plastic bullets at fleeing assailants and protesters who build stone  barricades.  </P> <P> A 33-year-old man was shot with a plastic bullet Monday in the West Bank  village of Jabaa, and four Palestinians were wounded in the occupied Gaza Strip  when army troops opened fire to halt stone throwing, Arab hospital officials  said.  </P></p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Technology: Work hazards that irritate / A look at protective measures against occupational skin diseases Advertisers of creams, soaps and protective lotions bombard the consumer with warnings about the ravages that age, sun and dishwashing can wreak on the skin. But few warn of the hazards at work. According to Richard Rycroft, author of the Textbook of Contact Dermititis, occupational skin diseases cost US companies between Dollars 222m (Pounds 150m) and Dollars 1bn year through lost productivity, medical care and disability payments. Recently US researchers have published studies on the effects of occupational irritants on the skin. In the UK, the disease accounts for the loss of 7m working days a year. Now Carolyn Willis, senior scientist in the department of Dermatology at Amersham Hospital in the UK is leading a research project to investigate the relationship between allergies and susceptibility to irritants. The research is being funded by the British Occupational Health Research Foundation, a charity set up in 1991 to investigate medical issues directly related to the workplace. It brings together industry and the academic sector to sponsor research with practical application to employers. Substances used by workers in industrial sectors from mining to hairdressing can pose dermatological risks. Obvious culprits include acids, oxidizing agents and petroleum products, but even constant exposure to water or an over-humid office atmosphere can cause what is medically known as irritant contact dermititis, the most prevalent form of occupational skin disease. Symptoms include redness, swelling, blisters, dryness, itching, stinging, burning and thickening of the skin. The disease can be acute - when one contact with an irritant induces a reaction; or chronic - where the reaction evolves over a period of exposure. For those suffering from allergies such as eczema, asthma or hay fever, the damage can be even more severe. Employers can offer protective gloves, clothing or medicated creams, but none of these are entirely effective as not enough is known about the disease, says Willis. Willis has enlisted 70 'healthy' male volunteers for the project and applied six frequently used workplace chemicals such as solvents, detergents, acids and alkalis to their skin. Willis will study the effects of the chemicals under the microscope, with the aim of developing better protective and therapeutic measures. 'Since a lot of companies are going to have a difficult time preventing their workers from being exposed to these chemicals, the development of effective protection is very important,' she says. The irritant contact dermititis research is one of four projects which is being sponsored by the BOHRF. David McWilliam, director general of the BOHRF, says the work should be most useful in the sorts of research that individual companies may be unable to afford. 'Many companies are already spending a lot of money in directly funded research on problems specific to those companies,' he said. 'Where there is a big gap is in conditions that have a very general impact - like irritant contact dermititis - where no one company could afford to research it. 'We give them the means to club together and pay a modest amount for what is very important research.'</p>

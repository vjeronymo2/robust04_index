			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By James Hardy, PRESS ASSOCIATION News lobby correspondent] </F>   [Text] World powers will not bullied by threats of war from  North Korea into backing down on international obligations,  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd warned tonight.    He denounced North Korean communist dictator Kim Il Sung as  one of a brand of "unpredictable tyrants with chips on their  shoulders" who threatened post-Cold War peace.    And he told foreign diplomats in London that unless a  lasting  peace was reached in Bosnia "in the next couple of months"  United Nations troops--including the British ground force--might  be forced to pull out.    In a grim assessment of world affairs, Mr Hurd gave a  chilling warning that the cloudless summer of 1914 ended in the  disaster of the First World War.    "This is not 1914, but it will not be an easy summer. Our  skills, patience and resolve will be tested," he said.    But as North Korea lurched relentlessly towards violent  confrontation over allowing inspection of its nuclear  facilities, Mr Hurd warned that the international community  would not be intimidated.    The United Nations Security Council would not be deterred  from carrying out its international duties and would offer a  "resolute response" to North Korean sabre-rattling.    "Security is only possible in a world where weapons of mass  destruction are not widely available," he said at the annual  Diplomatic Banquet.    "Unpredictable tyrants with chips on their shoulders must  not  be allowed to flout their treaty obligations--but this is  exactly what North Korea has been doing for the last 18 months."    Britain would back Security Council measures to persuade the  North Koreans to comply with their nuclear obligations.    "They should understand that compliance is in their own  interests. But they should be under no illusion--we will not be  deterred by threats of war from doing what is necessary,  including extensive sanctions. Any unwise move by North Korea  will be met with a resolute response."    Mr Hurd told the banquet held at the Foreign Office that  North Korea was only one of a number of potential flashpoints  across the world--and time was rapidly running out to reach a  lasting peace in Bosnia.    The ceasefire was "fragile and threatened" by people who  thought they could gain more from war than peace.    Britain and France remained deeply concerned for the safety  of their troops as Russia faced pressures to give unquestioning  support to the Serbs and the United States considered lifting  its arms embargo.    The pressures at work were "understandable but dangerous"  and  had far-reaching consequences for the UN Protection Forces  (UNPROFOR).    "They make it inevitable that Bosnia faces a fork in the  path," he said.    "Either there is a settlement soon, in the next couple of  months, or there is a real risk that the arms embargo will be  lifted, weaponry will flood in to both sides, UNPROFOR's  position will become impossible and will have to withdraw."    The war could then spread unchecked into neighbouring  regions.</p>

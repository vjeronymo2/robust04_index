			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Leaders of the United Workers Front [FUT] are  reaffirming their decision to strike on 28 June; they say they  do not fear the president's National Mobilization Decree, a  decree they want repealed. They are also making the following  demands:    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We are asking the  Supreme Court to uphold the Constitutional Guarantee Tribunal's  decision to suspend the Agrarian Development Law. This  demonstrates the country's true position, and it proves that the  position of the workers and peasants from the various fronts is  justified when they demand that the Agrarian Development Law  approved by the National Congress be repealed. [end recording]    The National Teachers Union has joined the strike and is  demanding that the freedom of education projects be suspended.  The union is also demanding higher salaries for teachers.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] The Ecuadoran  teachers  have listed their demands: We oppose the standard salary draft  bill, and we are demanding higher wages and salaries in  accordance with the law. We oppose the two hours of religious  teaching, and we support free lay education at all levels. We  also are demanding that the 62 teachers who have been dismissed  unfairly be reinstated. [end recording]    The FUT strike has been widely criticized by politicians and  analysts who say that the Indian situation is being exploited.  Also, the impact of this strike, a strike that many believe is  unjustified, must be considered at a time when most of Ecuador  has just been returned to tranquillity.</p>

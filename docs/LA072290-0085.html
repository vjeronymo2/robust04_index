			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE BEST MARKET VALUE  </P> <P> How to get there: Granville Island Market is a short cab ride (about $5  Canadian one way) from downtown Vancouver. Tiger Bus is a new shuttle that  provides regular service between downtown hotels and the market.  </P> <P> The fare, $7 Canadian round trip, includes a ride on a ferry across False  Creek. City buses Nos. 50 and 51 go over the Burrard Bridge to the market.  </P> <P> Hours: The market is open every day, May through September, but closed on  Mondays, October through April, plus Christmas and New Year's. Most stalls are  open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; coffee and breakfast stalls open at 8.  </P> <P> Recommended: Bridges, Pelican Bay Restaurant, Granville Island Hotel and  Isadora's, all on Granville Island.

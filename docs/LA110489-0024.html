			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 5 SCORES BY PEERY POWER CANYON  </P> <P> A school-record streak was snapped Friday night, but a different school record  was established and a remarkable record grew even more lustrous.  </P> <P> Canyon High receiver Clint Beauer, who had caught a touchdown pass in each of  the Cowboys' first eight games to set a school record, was shut out by  Palmdale.  </P> <P> Tailback Chris Peery picked up the slack, however, scoring a school-record five  touchdowns to lead Canyon to a 42-6 Golden League victory over the Falcons at  Palmdale.  </P> <P> "He was major league tonight," Canyon Coach Harry Welch said.  </P> <P> The win was the Cowboys' 37th in their past 38 league games and secured at  least a share of the league championship, Welch's seventh in eight seasons as  coach.  </P> <P> Peery, who gained only 21 yards in the first half, exploded for 118 in the  second and finished with 139 in 20 carries. He scored on runs of 13, 18, 19,  one and one yards.  </P> <P> Beauer could have used just one of those touchdowns to keep his streak alive.  </P> <P> "We sacrificed him the whole game," Welch said. "He didn't complain a bit.  That's what kind of team player he is."  </P> <P> Beauer caught just one pass, but he fell one yard short of the end zone when he  hauled in a 47-yard pass from Chris Spahr on a fake punt. One official raised  his arms, indicating a touchdown, but another marked the ball at the one. Peery  scored on the next play for the Cowboys (5-3-1, 4-0 in league play).  </P> <P> Palmdale tailback LaShante Parker scored on a one-yard run in the first quarter  to give the Falcons (3-6, 2-2) a short-lived 6-0 lead. Parker finished with 99  yards in 23 carries.  </P> <P> Canyon also won the passing battle. Quarterback Tim Beidle completed six of 11  attempts for 104 yards.  </P> <P> A trio of Palmdale passers completed only seven of 39 for 102 yards.  </P> <P> The Falcons outgained the Cowboys, 131-118, in the first half, but still  trailed at the half, 21-6.  </P> <P> Palmdale took the opening kickoff and marched 65 yards. Parker, who gained 70  yards in the half, finished the drive with a one-yard run for the 6-0 lead.  </P> <P> But the Falcons had to play defense, and it proved a chore. They were called  for encroachment six times in the first half, including three times on Canyon's  first drive.  </P> <P> Peery returned the ensuing kickoff to the 50, then Palmdale defenders jumped  early on three of the next six plays. Fullback David McDivitt eventually scored  from 14 yards and Chris Wilson's point after gave the Cowboys a lead they would  never relinquish.  </P></p>

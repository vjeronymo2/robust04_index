Raja Mohan] </F>   [Text] Washington, Feb. 10--The India Interest Group, set  up by the U.S. business community at the initiative of General  Electric, an American firm, is preparing a scheme to improve  Indo-U.S. ties.    In a "statement of purpose" issued on Tuesday, the India  Interest Group identified three major objectives. One, "to  support further liberalisation" of India's trade and investment  policies. Two, to help "raise the visibility" of Indo-U.S.  relations with "policy and decision-makers in Washington."  Three, to promote a two-way dialogue between the American  private sector and leading members of the Indian Government and  the Indian Business community.    This is an informal group of U.S. companies which have a  "special interest" in issues affecting India in Washington.    The current members in the group set up in December 1993  include, American Express, American President Lines, AT &amp; T,  Bechtel Group, Black Veatch International, Citibank, Coca Cola,  Digital Equipment, Enron, FMC, Ford, General Electric, IBM,  International Equity Partners, Kellogg, Morgan Stanley,  Raytheon, Unisys, U.S. West, and Woodward Governor Co.    The group in Washington has the active support of the  confederation of Indian Industry and the Indian Ambassador, Mr.  Siddhartha Shankar Ray.    An interface: The India Interest Group is not  meant to "preempt or displace any existing efforts," but provide  a mechanism to work with high-level U.S. Government officials,  and provide "a line of communication" with Indian business and  senior Government officials "about our common interests" in  India.    On Tuesday night at a working dinner Mr. Ray sought to  generate interaction between the India Interest Group and the  India caucus, a group of Congressmen working to promote Indian  interests in the U.S. Congress.    Mr. Michael Gadbaw, vice-president and senior counsel of  General Electric referred to the importance of India in the  company's strategy of globalisation. He called on Washington to  understand the nature of changes in India and stated that  "commercial interests would need to be increasingly taken into  account in the policymaking process as far as India was  concerned."    Declaring that India Interest Group was "extremely bullish  on  India," Mr. Gadbaw called on New Delhi to create greater  transparency and speed in investment approval process,  accelerate the enunciation of exit policy and promote  development of infrastructure in power, transportation and  telecommunications.    Mr. Frank Pallone, the Congressman from New Jersey, who  heads  the India caucus called for formulation of specific ideas and  projects to promote economic ties between the two countries.</p>

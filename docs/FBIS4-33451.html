			<p>BFN     [Text] Jaime Crombet, vice president of the National  Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], has described  Santiago de Cuba's overall energy situation as positive. The  thorough repairs conducted at the Rente Electric Plant, which  has already reached an output of 315 megawatts or 45 percent of  its capacity and has resulted in a significant reduction in  power outages, deserve to be described as such.    Crombet was told that electricity generation in the province  will reach 75 percent capacity and be more reliable after  December. Crombet warned of the adverse effect of increasing  fraud among consumers who, as a result of the increase in  electric fees, return to new ways to receive electricity  illegally. Crombet called for a widespread campaign, beginning  today and continuing until September, against citizens receiving  electricity through illegal hookups and lines, mills, and other  methods. Crombet added that is necessary for everyone using  electricity to pay for it.    Crombet also called for adopting measures to solve the  problem of burned out transformers plaguing Santiago de Cuba,  due to voltage shifts caused by some self-employed workers using  electrical equipment in their small workshops. Crombet praised  the provincial boilers efficiency program, which has attained  efficiency in 115 of the 274 boilers available; developments in  biogas production; and developments in hydroelectric power with  34 such small plants in operation, along with the Carlos Manuel  de Cespedes Dam, which will generate 2.8 megawatt-hours --  enough to supply almost the entire city of Contramaestre.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALLERY PHOTOS COMPARED TO CHILD PORN;  </P> <P> ARTS: AN EXPERT WITNESS DELIVERS A POTENTIALLY DAMAGING BLOW TO THE  MAPPLETHORPE DEFENSE. SHE TELLS THE JURY HIS WORK IS NOT FIT FOR A MUSEUM.  </P> <P> An expert witness delivered the most dramatic and potentially damaging  testimony against the defense at the Mapplethorpe obscenity trial Thursday when  she compared two of the photographs at issue to child pornography and said none  are fit to hang in an art museum.  </P> <P> Judith Reisman, a mass media researcher with links to anti-pornography groups,  contradicted the testimony of other arts experts who extolled the late Robert  Mapplethorpe as one of the most important photographers of his time.  </P> <P> In contentious testimony punctuated by frequent objections, she said the seven  photographs at issue have no artistic value. And the two depicting partially  nude children are harmful, she said.  </P> <P> "By placing images of children in this day and age that are focused on the  genitalia in this way . . . on the walls of our museums, what we're doing is we  are legitimizing the taking of the photos and we are legitimizing the public  display of the photos and we are . . . putting at risk additional children  because many people see themselves as photographers," she said.  </P> <P> The Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie, are on trial on  charges of pandering obscenity and displaying children in "nudity-related  material" in connection with a 175-piece retrospective exhibit, "Robert  Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment." This is the first time an American museum or  art gallery has stood trial on obscenity charges.  </P> <P> The exhibit, which ends a two-year national tour today in Boston, was held at  the arts center last spring.  </P> <P> In testimony Wednesday, Barrie acknowledged that some of the acts depicted in  the show were "tough, brutal, sometimes disgusting," but he said he brought the  show to Cincinnati because it was "serious and important."  </P> <P> "Robert Mapplethorpe took a very tough, brutal subject and tried to bring  beauty to it," he said.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys tried to discredit Reisman by emphasizing her controversial  published views concerning homosexuals and art and by noting that her  professional background is mostly in video and music and includes a stint as a  songwriter for the Captain Kangaroo television show.  </P> <P> She also listed among her qualifications service on former U.S. Atty. Gen.  Edwin Meese III's commission on pornography and a class she taught at George  Mason University this year on "sex, violence and the media."  </P> <P> Under questioning by H. Louis Sirkin, the lawyer representing Barrie, Reisman  declined to take credit for a quote he read to her that argued that  constitutional protections should not extend to a gay lifestyle.  </P> <P> However, she said, "My opinion would be that anal sodomy is traumatically  dysfunctional and is definitely associated with AIDS, and I could not support  that constitutional protections be extended to anal sodomy."  </P> <P> Mapplethorpe was a homosexual who died last year of AIDS. Five of the  photographs that are being challenged in court graphically depict  sadomasochistic sexual practices.  </P> <P> In testimony that juxtaposed graphic descriptions of the sadomasochistic  practices depicted and highbrow aesthetic theory, Reisman applied her working  definition of art to the images: "Based on the picture's supposed attempt to  express human emotion or human feeling, the criteria is not met," she said of  one photograph.  </P> <P> She based her conclusion on the fact that four of the five photographs did not  include faces. The one that did, a self-portrait of Mapplethorpe involved in a  graphic act, did not meet her test either because his face displayed no  discernable emotion.  </P> <P> Reisman's testimony was the first to directly attack the photographs as obscene  and potentially harmful. Prosecutor Frank Prouty had earlier said that the  photographs "speak for themselves" and that he only needed to show that the  Contemporary Arts Center had publicly displayed them.  </P> <P> Closing arguments in the trial are scheduled today.  </P></p>

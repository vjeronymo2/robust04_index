			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Elmar Guseynov report: "Russia Intends To Encourage Saddam </F> Husayn"]    [Text] Russia is interested in the speediest lifting of  the embargo imposed on Iraq by the United Nations. This is,  inter alia, because it will thereby gain the possibility of  recovering the sizable sums which Baghdad owes our country.  This statement, disseminated by foreign news agencies, was made  by a Russian diplomat who remained anonymous.    The statement seemed an absolute sensation because it marked  a change in Russia's stand with regard to Iraq. On Friday the  Security Council is to discuss the problem of sanctions in the  presence of Iraq's representatives.    One of the leaders of the Near East and North Africa  Department has told IZVESTIYA that Russia intends to insist that  Iraq be given some reassuring signal so as to encourage Baghdad,  which is being seen to make obvious progress in its position on  arms control and the abandonment of programs for the creation of  weapons of mass destruction.    This viewpoint of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is  at variance with the present position of the Americans and the  British. They see no signs that Iraq has merited any  encouragement. At the same time a number of Security Council  members, such as France, China, and Brazil, will obviously voice  solidarity with Russia.    It is maintained on Smolenskaya Ploshchad that Russian  diplomacy's present position does not signify a cardinal shift  in its policy on Iraq. Russia has always held its own viewpoint  on the events occurring in this region. In addition,  recognition of the progress which Baghdad has made in the  disarmament sphere does not signify the immediate lifting of  sanctions. Russia will act in accordance with UN decisions.    At present 547 tonnes of crude uranium and 50 kg of enriched  uranium, which that country possessed, have been removed from  Iraq. But R. Ekeus, leader of the UN Commission for the  Destruction of Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction, insists that  it will be possible to speak of lifting sanctions only after six  months of careful monitoring of Iraqi military installations.  Meanwhile, the actual mechanism of such monitoring has not yet  been worked out. Baghdad insistently demands the lifting of  sanctions, citing the fact that keeping them threatens the lives  of 400,000 people. Western countries, however, doubt the  sincerity of Saddam Husayn's government. The Iraqi authorities  are refusing to accept the Security Council's offer to sell oil  under UN control, although we could be talking of a sum of $1.6  billion which would be used for humanitarian purposes. Russia's  new position could tie still more tightly this whole unusually  tangled mass of problems started by the Iraqi troops' invasion  of Kuwait in 1990.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Zasurskiy: "The Bankers Did Not Like the </F> Proposal of the Deputy Prime Minister; the Congress of the  Association of Russian Commercial Banks Has Opened"]    [Text]  <H5>  Forum </H5>   Attending the Fourth Congress of the Association of Russian  Commercial Banks (ARB) were Sergey Yegorov, president of the  ARB; Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank; Oleg  Soskovets, first deputy prime minister; representatives of the  economic committees of the Federal Assembly, Nikolay Gonchar,  Aleksandr Pochinok, Mikhail Zadornov; and also representatives  of Russian Banks.    Attendees heard Sergey Yegorov's summary report of ARB  activity during the years 1991-1993. Assessing the situation  that developed in Russia, the president of the ARB emphasized  the "untwisting and self-producing spiral of nonpayments," the  "absence of any kind of price regulation," the "excessive level  of interest rates," and also the anti-investment climate in  Russia. It is his conviction that all of this could have a  negative effect on the interests of those sitting in the  audience. His report formulated the ARB positions on these  problems and the possible ways to resolve them. According to Mr.  Yegorov's words, in particular, "the absence of any kind of  price regulation threatens to lead to total noncompetitiveness  on foreign markets of even commodities of our traditional raw  materials export in the near future."    Speaking about the activity of the ARB council, Sergey  Yegorov noted that, as a result of the association's lobbying of  the legislative organs, the commercial banks have already won  hundreds of billions of rubles, which more than pays for the  support of the ARB organization.    The speech of the president also contained a proposal for  Viktor Gerashchenko to familiarize the ARB with normative  documents before they go into effect, a disagreement with the  position of the Central Bank on increasing the limit of the  minimum capital authorization, hopes for the development of  sound banking legislation, and the creation of a National Bank  Board, which would be joined by all organs of economic  authority, plus ARB representatives.    According to Mr. Yegorov, 5,000 crimes were committed in the  financial sphere last year and 20 bankers were killed. The ARB  is continuing to work on Security problems in the banking  business, both in authoritative structures and among members of  the association, which today has on the order of 800 banks.    Speaking at the bankers' forum, Oleg Soskovets proposed a  number of measures for using the banking system in conducting  the industrial policy of the government. In particular, one of  his proposals consisted of directing 50 percent of the profit of  banks from short-term speculative operations to financing the  reconstruction of industry at a favorable rate. There was scanty  applause when the deputy prime minister departed.    In the second half of the day, Viktor Gerashchenko gave his  speech, during which he criticized Presidential Edict No. 1662,  which talks about total voucherization with financial vouchers.  However, Viktor Gerashchenko was less critical of the  president's letter of 12 April, which gives recommendations on  procedures for the bankruptcy of enterprises. This letter, in  his words, makes it necessary to rethink the relations of the  Central Bank with economic agents. Mr. Gerashchenko ended his  speech with an answer to the likely criticism of excessively  following the recommendations of the IMF. "This policy is being  conducted by the government and approved by the State Duma, we  cannot conduct any other. But if you do not like it, your voice  must be louder," he said in addressing the delegates of the ARB  congress.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAROLD P. LEVY; EXPERT ON PUBLIC RELATIONS  </P> <P> Harold P. Levy, veteran public relations professional and writer, has died of  pancreatic cancer at a Pasadena convalescent home, his family announced  Thursday. He was 82.  </P> <P> Born in Trinidad, Colo., on March 8, 1907, Levy grew up in Seattle, graduated  from the University of Washington, and spent five years as a reporter for the  Seattle Times. He moved to New York City in 1934 at the height of the  Depression and began handling public relations and research for social welfare  agencies.  </P> <P> Levy wrote four books based on that work -- "A Study in Public Relations,"  "Building a Popular Movement," "Public Relations for Social Agencies," and the  autobiographical "There Were Days Like That."  </P> <P> "One hint of meaningful change is a new, calmer response on my part to what in  earlier days were manifest freeway driving irritations," Levy wrote in a column  about aging for the Los Angeles Times shortly after his retirement at the age  of 80.  </P> <P> He is survived by his wife, Alice Klund Levy of Glendale, three nieces and a  nephew.  </P></p>

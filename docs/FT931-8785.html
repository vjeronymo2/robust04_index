			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Japan cool on UN peacekeeping plea: Boutros Ghali asks Miyazawa to send troops to Africa MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, yesterday asked Japan to play a bigger part in world peacekeeping, saying this would help counter complaints that the UN was dominated by the US, Reuter reports from Tokyo. But Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, facing strong domestic opposition to a wider role for the Japanese army, responded cautiously in a meeting with the visiting UN chief. He said Japan would not hurry to expand its participation in UN peacekeeping activities, which began last year when a contingent went to Cambodia. Mr Boutros Ghali specifically asked Mr Miyazawa to send troops to Mozambique, after earlier suggesting in a Japanese television interview that it commit troops to Somalia also. 'I think the situation in Mozambique meets your country's condition (for sending troops),' Mr Boutros Ghali told Mr Miyazawa. 'There is a solid ceasefire agreement and operations are under way for rehabilitation of refugees.' So far only 100 UN peacekeepers are overseeing the formerly Marxist country's transition to democracy. The force will eventually number more than 7,000. The government and Renamo rebels signed a peace pact last October. Earlier, Mr Boutros Ghali suggested Japan commit troops to Somalia, where he envisages a new type of peacekeeping operation. Mr Boutros Ghali has suggested that conventional peacekeeping operations be upgraded to 'peace-enforcing operations' which would allow the UN to act without the consent of warring factions. Mr Boutros Ghali and Mr Miyazawa did not discuss the question of sending Japanese troops to Somalia. The UN chief said the world body was undergoing a crisis of confidence because some member states have accused it of coming under the sway of a lone superpower. 'That is why we need the participation of countries like Germany, Japan and Brazil in these and other United Nations operations,' he said. Mr Miyazawa said post-war Japan had vowed never again to become a key military power and should not rapidly expand its participation in peacekeeping operations. Japan's peacekeeping law, enacted last year after 20 months of wrangling in parliament, forbids troops from taking part in United Nations combat duties.</p>

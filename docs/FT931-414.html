			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BCSR directors frustrate move for restructuring of board A SHAREHOLDER move to restructure the board of Bristol Channel Ship Repairers has been frustrated by a boardroom coup. Shareholders attending an extraordinary meeting called at the request of the company's biggest shareholder, Andreas Ugland, the private Norwegian shipping group, backed resolutions which would have wrestled boardroom control away from Mr Christopher Bailey, the current chairman, and three of his associates. Ugland built up a 24.19 per cent stake in Bristol Channel through its UK subsidiary, acquiring the bulk of its stake in July when it bought 18m shares from CH Bailey, which also operates dry dock facilities in the Bristol Channel. This cut Bailey's holding to 8.21 per cent. Three Ugland directors joined the board but since then the two sides have conducted an increasingly acrimonious debate over the management, financial performance and prospects of the company, which owns five docks in South Wales. This led to the move by Ugland to remove three Bristol Channel directors, Mr James Garvin, Mr Michael David and Mr Lionel Dotchon, and appoint Viscount Tenby to a new five member board. These resolutions were passed at the EGM held on Friday. However, Mr Bailey convened a directors' meeting the day before the EGM and 24 hours after the closing time for proxies. At the meeting, attended by the three directors under attack, four previously undisclosed additional non-executive directors were appointed together with Viscount Tenby. The four are Sir Robin Maxwell-Hyslop, Mr Kenneth Griffin, Mr Thomas Bishop and Mr Robert Scammell. In addition, one of the removed directors, Mr David, was appointed general manager of the ship repair yard. In a statement issued after the action Ugland claimed that 'the manner and circumstances in which the new directors were appointed is wholly unacceptable. 'The shareholders' intentions and wishes as carried at the EGM have been frustrated by a clear abuse of Director's fiduciary duties and powers'. Mr John Love, one of the three Ugland directors on the board, said Ugland was 'reviewing the situation'. No-one from CH Bailey was available for comment yesterday. Mr Bailey was said to be 'out of the country.' Last month BCSR reported a Pounds 236,261 loss for the 28 weeks to October 9, against a profit of Pounds 74,884. The loss, on turnover of just Pounds 34,192 (Pounds 661,801), included a Pounds 150,000 non-recurring item 'for cancelling and amending management agreements with CH Bailey'.</p>

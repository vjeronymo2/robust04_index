			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFORMERS GAIN IN SOVIET VOTING; SAKHAROV NOMINATED  </P> <P> Ardent reformers, including some longtime political dissidents, have won seats  in the Soviet Union's new national assembly, officials said Monday, announcing  the results of runoff elections.  </P> <P> In addition, nuclear physicist and human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov was  among 28 members of the Academy of Sciences nominated Monday to run for 12  unfilled seats allocated to the academy in the new assembly, the Congress of  People's Deputies. The 28 nominees were chosen from among 168 contenders by 37  members of the academy's presidium.  </P> <P> One of the most prominent dissidents to win a seat in Sunday's election was Roy  A. Medvedev, a Marxist historian expelled from the Communist Party for his  attacks on Stalinism. Voters in a Moscow constituency gave him victory in the  runoff, rehabilitating him more fully after 20 years in the political  wilderness than any party action could.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Historian Charged Smear  </P> <P> Other prominent reformers elected from Moscow included historian Sergei  Stankevich, who had alleged that the official Soviet press was trying to smear  him by calling him a Zionist and a spy; Yuri Chernichenko, a prominent  journalist and television commentator, and Yuri Ryzhov, the highly regarded  director of the Moscow Aviation Institute.  </P> <P> In the Soviet Baltic republic of Lithuania, candidates from the Movement for  Perestroika, which is known as Sajudis there, won five of the eight seats at  stake, but themovement's secretary general, Virgiljus Cepaitis, lost his own  race in Vilnius, the capital. Sajudis now has 35 of Lithuania's 42 seats in the  new parliament.  </P> <P> For Sakharov, who spent nearly seven years in internal exile under the late  President Leonid I. Brezhnev, his nomination was a vindication of both his  longtime advocacy of human rights despite the government's displeasure and of  his insistence on fresh elections within the Academy of Sciences.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Candidacies Vetoed  </P> <P> Although Sakharov and most of the other pro-reform academics enjoyed widespread  support, the academy's leadership had vetoed their candidacies in January,  provoking street demonstrations and other protests and finally leading to an  unprecedented revolt within the academy that forced a new election there as  scientists refused to vote for many of the officially approved candidates.  </P> <P> Since only eight of the academy's alloted 20 seats were filled during the  initial voting, a new round of nominations and elections was ordered. The  second full round of voting on the new nominees is scheduled for next month at  the academy.  </P> <P> The academy members nominated Monday included Roald Sagdeyev, the leading  Soviet space specialist; Georgy A. Arbatov, director of the U.S.A. and Canada  Institute, and Nikolai Shmelyov, a radical economist whose ideas have had a  major impact on party and government policies.  </P> <P> Additional elections are planned for the middle of May to choose deputies for  the 199 constituencies where there was only a single candidate and he or she  failed to win a majority of the votes cast. A majority of voters had scratched  out their names on the ballots.  </P> <P> Elections for the entire Congress of People's Deputies are likely to be  completed in a month, and its 2,250 members will then meet to elect the Supreme  Soviet, a full-time parliament under an executive presidency.  </P> <P> A third of the deputies are to come from constituencies based on one person,  one vote; a third are coming from constituencies based on ethnic  representation, and the final third are coming from "public organizations,"  ranging from the Communist Party and Communist Youth League to the Academy of  Sciences, a temperance society and a national stamp collectors group.  </P></p>

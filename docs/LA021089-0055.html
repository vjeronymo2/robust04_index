			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO ENTERTAINMENT BRIEFS  </P> <P> David Atherton, former San Diego Symphony music director, has announced four of  the principal soloists in his inaugural Mainly Mozart festival June 2-11 at the  Old Globe Theatre. In addition to pianist Anton Nel, who won the 1987 Naumburg  piano competition, two former members of San Diego Symphony will be featured  soloists. Cynthia Phelps, now principal violist with the Minnesota Orchestra,  and Jerry Folsom, now principal French horn with the Los Angeles Philharmonic,  will be joined by Atlanta Symphony concertmaster William Preucil. For the  festival concerts, Atherton promised a 34-member orchestra, drawn primarily  from outside the San Diego area, to play Mozart's familiar late symphonies and  concertos. In response to the theme of the popular movie "Amadeus," Atherton  has included a Triple Concerto by Antonio Salieri. The British conductor, who  still maintains a San Diego residence, is the BBC Symphony's principal guest  conductor.  </P></p>

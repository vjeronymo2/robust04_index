			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / French try to recapture lost trade in securities THE French stock market is taking action to try to stimulate block trading - the buying and selling of large numbers of shares in the same company - which may eventually lead to the introduction of market makers. One of the main problems for the French market is the drift of block trades  -large deals worth between FFr20m (Pounds 2.04m) and FFr50m - away from Paris to London. Most traders attribute this to disclosure rules in Paris, where regulations were designed to protect private investors. This makes the market less flexible than the London stock market. Last year the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV), the regulatory body, commissioned a study into block trading from a committee led by Mr Francois Bacot, the managing director of Bacot Allain, the Paris broker owned by SG Warburg, the London-based securities group. The Bacot report was studied by the CBV which said that it intends to take immediate steps to make the French market more flexible. These measures include allowing brokers to take positions on shares by using confidential codes, rather than by giving their own names, and greater flexibility in the disclosure of prices. Until now one of the main deterrents for block traders in Paris has been that they had to identify themselves and the price of the deal. By contrast in London, traders are allowed some discretion in the handling of large share deals. The CBV has also commissioned a study into the feasibility of introducing market makers to fix prices for shares in France. These changes should, or so the CBV hopes, help to stem the flow of block trades from Paris to London and recapture at least part of the business lost over the years. However, it warned yesterday that its initiative would be futile unless the French government agrees to abolish the tax on securities dealings.</p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / CBI/FT Distributive Trades Survey: High-street sales rise above last year's levels HIGH-STREET sales in March rose above 1990 levels for the first time this year but volumes remain poor, according to the latest CBI/FT distributive trades survey. A balance of +11 per cent of retailers reported that year-on-year sales rose in March - the first such increase since December - with sales of clothing, durable household goods, textiles, furniture and carpets contributing to the improvement. Sales are expected to continue growing during April, although at a slower rate than last month. Taking the distributive trades as a whole, however, companies reported another fall in sales volume during March compared with a year earlier. The proportion reporting a decline - a balance of - 25 per cent - is less than February's - 32 per cent, but compares with +9 per cent in March 1990. For the 11th consecutive month distributors report that they placed lower volumes of orders with suppliers than in the same month of the previous year. The March balance of - 38 per cent is unchanged from February, and a sharp decline in new orders with suppliers is expected to continue this month. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI distributive trades panel, interpreted the survey in cautious terms. He said that the improved sales may be due to this year's early Easter and a rush by customers to buy before VAT rates increased. In spite of last month's improvements, retailers covered by the survey continued to regard sales as poor for the time of year. Wholesalers reported a drop in volumes of sales compared with the same period last year for the sixth successive month. The balance reporting a drop in March was - 44 per cent - a little better than February's - 48 per cent, but a contrast with March 1990, when the figure was +14 per cent. Continuing weak demand led to wholesalers' stocks building up further during March. A balance of +31 per cent of wholesalers believed that stocks were too high in relation to expected sales, against +25 per cent in February and +19 per cent a year ago.

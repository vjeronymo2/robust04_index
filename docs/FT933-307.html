			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend concern at Sears STORES group Sears produced interim profits at the top end of expectations, but ultimately disappointed the market as it left its dividend unchanged. This and profit-taking after its recent good run left the stock trimmed back 3 to 115p, but still double the price of 12 months ago. Turnover was a hefty 9.9m. In spite of the dividend disappointment, retail analysts still found plenty to cheer in the results and a raft of profits upgrades followed. Most were moved up around 5 per cent from the Pounds 120m area, although some 'buy' recommendations were tempered back to 'holds' on the view that the shares now look fully valued. Footwear and home shopping provided the highlights, although the company was later telling analysts that gross margins for the second half were likely to be flat. Ms Emma Burdett at Hoare Govett commented: 'Recovery is well under way at Sears and there is still a lot to go for, but it may take some time to get all the divisions back to acceptable levels of return.'</p>

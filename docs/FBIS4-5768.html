			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NIKKEI KINYU economics division reporter Kenichi </F> Kawahara]    [Text] Increasing numbers of financial institutions are  cutting their dividends. The onslaught of dividend cuts which  began with second regional banks has spread to credit unions and  shows signs of extending to a portion of the city banks. The  purpose of such dividend cuts is to preserve internal financial  strength and assign priority to the disposal of bad debt.  Currently, little adverse reaction is being voiced by  shareholders, but allegations have been made of insufficient  disclosure of information.    Akira Takai, chief of the First Business Research Department  of the Daiwa Research Institute expresses a paradoxical view  concerning the stock price of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank by saying,  "The stock market has reacted favorably to actions taken by the  bank." When the news was announced on 23 March that the bank  would cut its dividends, its price rose 4 yen, and the ensuing  days witnessed a gradual rise in the stock price. The moves did  not reflect stock price action which is typical following the  announcement of unfavorable news.    The Hokkaido Takushoku Bank has officially denied that "any  decision has been made by the bank" relative to a dividend cut.  However, there is no denying that the bank is conducting  internal studies which consider a dividend cut and expectations  are that in the latter part of April, it will announce "a 1 yen  dividend cut together with a cost-reduction plan and disposal of  bad debt."    Ever since announcement of earnings reports for the March  1993 year, many second regional banks either reduced or  eliminated dividends. They included the Hyogo Bank, Taiheiyo  Bank, Hanwa Bank, Osaka Bank, and Fukutoku Bank, having been  affected by adverse conditions occasioned by the bursting of the  bubble economy. There are signs that March 1994 yearly earnings  reports will reflect cuts in dividends by credit unions and  associations on a nationwide basis. Many leading credit unions,  such as Jonan and Asahi have already announced that they will  cut dividends two points to 6 percent.    It can be said that changes in dividend policies, which  began  with the regional financial institutions, have finally spread to  city banks. However, conditions at Hokkaido Takushoku Bank are  not as serious as they are at the second regional banks.    Hokkaido Takushoku Bank still holds undeclared paper profits  of about 300 billion yen. Otherwise, if undeclared appreciation  of land values and bad loan reserves are considered, adequate  financial resources exist to avoid dividend cuts even if  provision is made for write offs associated with Kabuto Decom  Inc. stock. According to Daiwa Research Institute, investors  have taken the view in the market place that "Banks such as  Hokkaido Takushoku Bank have reduced dividends as the result of  a full-scale write down of bad loans and have thus established  the basis for a clean slate for future operations." It appears  that Hokkaido Takushoku Bank stock price did not decline because  of such considerations.    On 14 and 15 March, the Quick Research Institute conducted a  questionnaire survey of asset managers at financial institutions  and asked them for their reaction in the event of a theoretical  announcement of deficit earnings reports and dividend cuts by  selected leading banks. Only 1 percent of the managers responded  that "the news would be interpreted in an adverse manner and  result in unstable movement in stock markets or financial stocks  as a whole." The largest group of 43.9 percent responded that,  "even if such news had a temporary shock effect, such actions  will lead to an improvement in financial strength of the firms  involved."    The leading regional Ashikaga Bank, which reduced dividends  effective with the September 1993 midyear earnings report,  reacted to controversy over its dividend cut by saying, "The  dividend was cut back to its former level of 5 yen because of a  50-percent drop in earnings. Dividends should rise and fall  along with fluctuations in earnings."    The Ashikaga Bank has taken action to improve the soundness  of its operations by liquidating its nonbank subsidiary known as  Wing Finance and effecting internal bank restructurings. The  idea is to reduce dividends and concurrently bring an end to  retrogressive operating methods.    Such policies to revise dividend policies by banks seem to  reflect banks' tendencies concerning pride and the pursuit of  uniformity in behavior. In the case of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank  which is a city bank, it cannot reduce its dividend below 5 yen  because that is the rate of payout maintained by leading  regional banks. It can increase its retained earnings by only  about 900 million yen annually--by reducing the dividend by one  yen--a figure which is incomparably small relative to its bad  debt figure and would have very little accounting impact.    Even in the case of the Ashikaga Bank, it was able to reduce  its dividend by 1 yen because only a few regional banks, such as  the Shizuoka Bank, were paying a 6 yen dividend. Ashikaga Bank  admits, "An annual dividend payout of less than 5 yen is not  possible." They are admitting that a stable dividend payout is  unavoidable.    Chief Takai of Daiwa Research Institute takes the view that  the move to reduce dividends among financial institutions will  not spread to the leading city banks. The reason is that when  the major effects of relations with shareholders and bank  customers, recognition by society and responsibilities  associated with management are considered, many management  officials believe that "adequate undeclared asset values exist  and dividend cuts would not be advisable from a  cost-versus-effect standpoint."    Chief Eiji Hirano of the Financial Section, Operations  Bureau  of the Bank of Japan voices criticism by saying, "Banks are not  aware that the days of uniformity in behavior are gone. They  should become more conscious of the management control mechanism  reflected in stock market actions." He's saying that the public  utilities aspect of financial institutions is limited to their  financial settlement systems and that banks should be treated  like any other industrial firm in other respects.    Needless to say, dividend cuts are not the only action to be  taken. The reason is that, as reflected in the questionnaire  survey conducted by the Quick Research Institute, market  reactions reflect the bold restructuring actions taken after a  cut in dividends.    According to officials of the bank, the Bank of Tokyo was  "unable to keep up with the dividend increases of other city  banks" from fiscal years 1983 to 1990 because of the accumulated  debtor nation problem, but implemented a personnel reduction of  about 1,000 and, in connection with its September 1993 midyear  earnings report, restored dividends to the lowest levels  maintained by city banks. Shareholders, no doubt, will demand  decisive management actions on the part of banks which effect  dividend cuts.    It is also necessary to take bold action relative to public  disclosure of information. Bank stock prices fell sharply during  March and April 1992. The drop in prices was directly triggered  by massive sales of bank stocks on the part of European and U.S.  hedge funds. According to the Quick Research Institute, "No  progress had been made on the public disclosure of bad loans,  and the fear that banks were holding unlimited quantities of bad  loans exacerbated the selling trend."    The reason why stocks of the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and  Ashikaga Bank have assumed a firming trend is that public  disclosure of bad loans has progressed beyond levels of prior  times and undisclosed bad loan information has been widely  covered by the mass media.    It is also said that the Ministry of Finance, which fears  that dividend cuts and deficit earnings reports will serve as a  cause for instability in financial systems, has recently assumed  a flexible stance. Although premature action should not be taken  on dividend cuts, we should take action to make public  disclosure of operating conditions and appropriate dividend  payout levels permanent fixtures of Japanese financial  institutions.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Unemployment in the UK: The town condemned to two decades of decline Wolverhampton: long-term unemployment - short-term thinking Lewes: painful attrition in the south-eastMidlands Correspondent WOLVERHAMPTON is a symbol of the nation's industrial decline. It ran into trouble in the 1970s and the recession of the 80s dealt its economy a blow from which it has not recovered. The recession of the 90s is akin to stopping a baby's feed when the milk bottle is half full: the baby survives, but miserably. The unemployment rate in the town is nearly 16 per cent. As many as a third of males in some inner city areas are out of a job. 'In under 20 years we have gone from full employment to the worst area of the west Midlands in terms of unemployment,' says Mr Dennis Turner, Labour MP for Wolverhampton South East. Twenty years ago, civic leaders complained that 'national policy on the location of industry continues to leave this important industrial area without its second-generation metal using and forming industries, and appears to deny it growth of almost any sort.' That chicken came home to roost in the late 1970s. In the eight years to 1986, manufacturing industry shed 20,000 jobs. In autumn 1986, when the national economy was experiencing high growth, unemployment in Wolverhampton was above 20 per cent. In 1978 there were 20 companies with more than 500 employees. By 1989 there were only nine. Mrs Gillian Shepherd, the employment secretary, said last weekend that two out of every three people now losing their jobs were back at work within six months. In Wolverhampton, the proportion out of work for longer than a year was more than 40 per cent. The Rev Michael Godfrey, an Anglican industrial chaplain, is one of those trying to pick up the pieces. He is attempting to keep open the Cannon Industries' fires and cookers plant. The company, part of the GEC group, wants to close its local plant and consolidate production at Stoke-on-Trent. 'Every young person you speak to has had a period of unemployment, and they just take it,' he says. 'Unemployment shifts the attitude of loyalty and community because they don't have any to a particular employer. People just think short-term.' There is, he suggests, a 'great survival mentality' which comes out in 'the sheer determination to hold on if you do have a job, and this is what I detect at Cannon'. Expectations are narrowing, leading to what Mr Andy Flockhart, deputy chief executive of Wolverhampton borough council, calls the key structural problem  -'a low skills level, low aspirations and the loss of semi-skilled jobs'. A third of the town's employment is in manufacturing, still higher than the national average. 'While this has contracted from 40 per cent, our services sector has not been growing to take up the slack,' Mr Flockhart says. The civic vision is of Wolverhampton as 'the biggest and most prosperous centre between Birmingham and Manchester,' according to Mr Bill Clarke, the Conservative council leader. Its service sector would be enhanced by redevelopment of the Molineux football ground and the Dunstall Park racecourse. Its manufacturing base would be strengthened by the creation of a science park linking the local university to engineering leaders such as GKN Technology, Goodyear, IMI and Lucas Aerospace. Such plans, in the face of two decades of decline, have been slow in emerging. Mr Turner put that down partly to 'the general reluctance of government to see local authorities playing any real part in the regeneration of industrial communities.' Mr Clarke believes that 'the view has taken root across political parties in Wolverhampton that, unless there is a joint approach, development will not take place'. Either way development will be slow. 'People don't use the word 'hope',' says Mr Godfrey. Yet many feel that Wolverhampton could do more to help itself. Services for the unemployed such as training are 'fragmented', says the local Training and Enterprise Council. 'We have commissioned research to see what is being done by the myriad of services to co-ordinate things better,' says a Tec official. 'Our resources are not as well used as they could be,' comments Mr Turner. 'There is a crying need for greater co-ordination.' Yet, while the biggest fillip would be industrial growth in an expanding economy, civic leaders believe that, to nurture green shoots in brown fields, they need the extra watering which could come from more government funding and more European Community cash.</p>

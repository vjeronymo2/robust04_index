			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi -- More than 30,000 babies in India are  estimated to be still-born every year, and over 1,20,000 are  born cretins -- mentally retarded, physically stunted, deaf-mute  or paralysed -- due to iodine deficiency in mothers, reports PTI.    Disclosing this and other adverse effects of iodine  deficiency, Executive Director of International Council for  Control of iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD), Basil S Hetzel,  said here on Friday that the need for iodine starts even before  a child is born.    He said the total number of still births and neonatal deaths  attributable to iodine deficiency was over 90,000. "If the  mother is iodine deficient, the foetus too suffers iodine  deficiency."    When a child is deprived of its iodine needs during the  period the brain is developing -- last six months of pregnancy  to the first post-natal year -- the consequences could be  disastrous, Hetzel said.    Describing women of child bearing age and children under the  age of 15 years as most susceptible to iodine deficiency  disorders, he said the most common and visible ill-effect is  goitre, an abnormal swelling in the neck.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Halifax chief slams Tory homes policy The chief executive of Halifax building society yesterday made a wide-ranging attack on government housing policy and called for new forms of subsidy to promote choice. In a speech that contrasted Tory party political commitment to choice with the absence of policies likely to achieve this in housing, Mr Mike Blackburn argued there was a need for a better-targeted subsidy for owner-occupation; more support for the private rented sector; and a mix of subsidies for people on lower incomes. He said support for people on lower incomes should be 'tenure-neutral' and available both to those buying and renting. 'It is a national disgrace that homelessness remains an issue in Britain in the latter years of the 20th century,' said the chief of Halifax, the UK's largest mortgage lender. Addressing the annual Building Society Association conference in Birmingham, Mr Blackburn said the government should not reduce mortgage tax relief any further unless it replaced the sub-sidy with one that was more closely directed to particular needs. He cited the example of other countries that targeted tax relief by making it available for a limited time only, or to families with children. It was not satisfactory for the government to try to create a level playing field by withdrawing all subsidies. 'It may have a certain simplicity and rightwing intellectual appeal, but it is not a way of managing housing policy in an advanced country - in many ways it is an abdication by government of its responsibilities for housing policy,' Mr Blackburn said. The kickstart needed to assist the private rented sector could be directed either at encouraging the small landlord or promoting investment by institutional funds through some form of tax-free investment trust. He said, however, a commitment was needed not only from the government, but also from the other main political parties to revive the private rented sector for any such incentives to prove effective. He also criticised cuts made in the Housing Association Grant, and the apparent short-term approach of government policymaking. This approach favoured looking at the immediate impact on public spending, even at the price of higher costs and perhaps higher inflation in future. Mr Blackburn's approach was backed by Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, the second-largest society. The association will publish a paper on housing policy in the summer, in an effort to bolster its lobbying of the government. Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of the housing charity Shelter, also attacked the government for its 'irres-ponsible policy' of promoting home ownership across all classes. She called for changes in the tax and benefit system to address the consequences for housing policy of increasing instability in people's employment prospects.</p>

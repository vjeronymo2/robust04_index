			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SAY GOODBY TO BULLOCKS WILSHIRE;  </P> <P> THE NEW OWNER WILL PUT THE I. MAGNIN NAME ON THE VENERABLE CHAIN OF ELEGANT  FASHION STORES.  </P> <P> Bullocks Wilshire, the stately, 70-year-old specialty fashion chain with the  landmark Art Deco flagship store in Los Angeles' Mid-Wilshire district, will be  renamed I. Magnin on Feb. 1, owner R. H. Macy &amp; Co. said Wednesday.  </P> <P> In addition, the 1928 Bullocks Wilshire building, which is listed in the  National Register of Historic Places, will undergo a multimillion-dollar  restoration beginning next spring. The store will be known as I.  Magnin/Wilshire.  </P> <P> Macy's, which bought I. Magnin and Bullocks Wilshire along with the Bullock's  department stores in May, 1988, emphasized in a prepared statement that the  Bullock's name "will not be changed, nor is there any intent to do so in the  future." In the past, the big New York retailer has put the Macy's moniker on  other regional chains it has purchased in the Northeast and Southeast.  </P> <P> Macy's also said it plans to sell the Bullock's headquarters building in  downtown Los Angeles and convert the I. Magnin store near the main Bullocks  Wilshire to office space to house Bullock's corporate employees. All employees  of that I. Magnin store will be offered positions at other I. Magnin locations,  the company said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Merchandise Overlap  </P> <P> Rose Marie Bravo, the 38-year-old chairman and chief executive of I. Magnin and  Bullocks Wilshire, said in a telephone interview that the name change was  logical from a marketing point of view. "It just strengthens us," she said.  </P> <P> She noted that about 85% of the merchandise bought for Magnin and Bullocks  Wilshire is identical, up from perhaps 60% when the chains were part of  Federated Department Stores. Although the stores both cater to upscale  clientele, Bullocks Wilshire customers have traditionally been older and less  trendy than I. Magnin's.  </P> <P> Soon after Macy's bought the chains, it put them under the same San  Francisco-based management team. Industry sources say Magnin and Bullocks  Wilshire have combined annual sales of more than $400 million.  </P> <P> "We have been really streamlining and trying to get the best of what both  franchises have to offer," Bravo said. For example, she noted that the Magnin  team admired Bullocks Wilshire's strong men's business and began incorporating  those merchandising techniques at I. Magnin stores.  </P> <P> Similarly, Bullocks Wilshire opened a boutique featuring Yves St. Laurent's  Rive Gauche clothing for women because of I. Magnin's success with that line.  </P> <P> Bravo said the company has had good luck with contemporary fashions at Bullocks  Wilshire that "are not something you would normally think of as (appealing to)  the core patrons at Wilshire."  </P> <P> "The more contemporary, the more advanced, the better we did with it at  Wilshire," she said. "That gave us confidence that there was more alike in  these two companies."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Importance of Name  </P> <P> Actually, Bullock's and Magnin have been closely linked since 1944, when  Bullock's acquired the highly regarded fashion chain. Magnin operated as a  subsidiary or a division until 1964, the year Bullock's was merged into  Federated Department Stores. Later, Magnin was made a separate division of  Federated.  </P> <P> Bravo speculated that a name change will have little effect on customers.  </P> <P> "People come to a store because they love the store, they love the people and  the merchandise," she said.  </P> <P> Carol Farmer, a retail consultant in Boca Raton, Fla., agreed that the name has  less to do with a store's success than some might think.  </P> <P> "They can name it Who Tied the Pup or Genghis Khan Emporium if they merchandise  it beautifully," she said.  </P> <P> Retail industry observers had speculated that a name change might be in the  offing for Bullocks Wilshire. Since last spring, the two upscale specialty  fashion stores have been doing some joint newspaper advertising.  </P> <P> With 23 stores, I. Magnin is better known nationally than Bullocks Wilshire,  which has only seven stores, all in Southern California.  </P> <P> I. Magnin, founded in San Francisco in 1876 by Mary Ann and Isaac Magnin, has  17 stores in California, three in Chicago, one in Washington, one in Seattle  and one in Phoenix.  </P> <P> Allen I. Questrom, former chairman of Bullock's and Bullocks Wilshire and now  president and chief executive of Neiman Marcus in Dallas, said Wednesday that  he thinks the name change "is a good idea. There has always been somewhat of a  confusion between Bullocks Wilshire and Bullock's. . . . It makes sense from  the point of view of clarity" both for customers and for Macy's.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fears of Change  </P> <P> But at the flagship store, the planned name change drew mixed reviews from  noon-hour customers resting on benches at the main entrance off the parking  lot.  </P> <P> "Please don't do this to me," said Sophie Schiller, a Beverly Hills resident  who has driven often to the main Bullocks Wilshire store over the last 35  years. "I really don't like I. Magnin because they don't have anything for  people over 50."  </P> <P> Madelyn Keith of Los Angeles feared that the Bullocks Wilshire stores would  change. "I'd rather have Bullocks Wilshire. I hate to see that. It won't be the  same."  </P> <P> But Frank Sorkin, shopping for perfume with his wife, was more sanguine. "It's  just one name replacing another," he said.  </P> <P> Times researcher Melanie Pickett contributed to this story.  </P></p>

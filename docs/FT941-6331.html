			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Observer: Round the bend A triumph for German unification. Forget the negative talk about soaring unemployment and chronic shortages of kindergarten places; disgruntled easterners who believe nothing has been preserved of their once prized communist state have something to boast about at last. Germany's reunited transport ministry has decided that motorists in the west will now be allowed to take advantage of a traffic regulation once found only across the border. All of Germany's drivers will now be allowed to turn right at a red traffic light, provided the road is clear. 'Experience in the new federal states (that is, east Germany) shows that the new regulation can contribute in certain circumstances to the alleviation of the traffic situation,' a ministry circular intones. If that's all the poor Ossis feel is left of their old world, no wonder the shine has started to rub off the commemorative unification coins.</p>

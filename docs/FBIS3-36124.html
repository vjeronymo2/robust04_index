The government will supplement the budget incomes with 30  million lats of Bank of Latvia's profit payments and cut the  administrative reform's fund by 1.2 million lats, Gailis said.    The group also confirmed a plan to form a working party for  free trade talks with the European Union and passed for Saeima  [parliament] consideration a bill on Latvia's signature to  international labor conventions.    The Cabinet failed to accept a resolution on social  guarantees for parentless children and regulations on easier  public transportation tariffs to certain categories of  residents, said government spokesman Sergei Ancupov.</p>

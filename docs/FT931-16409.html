			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / US film makers focus on Uruguay Round: The audio-visual trade tussle has come to a head in Geneva THE US film and television industries have long cast a covetous eye on Europe's Dollars 30bn audio-visual market. For as long, Europe's governments have fought a largely unsuccessful battle to protect local culture from US 'polluting' influences. The tussle has come to a head in Geneva in the Uruguay Round negotiations on world trade reform, where the US has put European concessions in audio-visual services at the top of its EC negotiating agenda. In Geneva the EC has called for the US formally to concede that audio-visual services 'is not an industry quite like any other'. One official said: 'We want some sort of recognition from the US that the sector needs to be considered in more than just economic terms.' With a concession of this kind on the table, he said, the EC could then start to talk market access numbers. 'The overwhelming problem is that in the US, audio-visual services are seen in purely commercial terms,' the official complained: 'In the EC, the economic aspect is seen as much less important, and it is seen in cultural and political terms.' The US has good reasons for seeing the sector as it does: 'Audio-visual services are our second-largest export, and while we are certainly sensitive to cultural issues around the world, the facts are that they are a very significant commercial undertaking for the US economy,' a US official said. The US film and television industry has a turnover of about Dollars 40bn a year - more than the industry of the EC member states combined, and about 40 per cent of the total world industry. Exports in 1990 to the EC amounted to almost Dollars 3.8bn. After imports from the EC of about Dollars 250m, this gave the US a surplus in trade in films, videos and television programmes of more than Dollars 3.5bn. 'This is an enormous commercial market, notwithstanding any cultural desirabilities,' the US official said. It is also a market that is highly fragmented for both cultural and language reasons - making EC companies minnows when compared to US giants such as Universal or Time Warner, and making the markets comparatively easy prey to well-organised foreign competition. As with so many disputes within the Uruguay Round, this is essentially one between the US and the EC. Japan supports the US since its own manufacturers acquired some of America's biggest film-makers. But smaller players such as Australia and India share EC concerns that their own film industries might be hurt if US companies win unfettered access to their markets. The most critical US target is the television industry, since US film makers already account for 70 per cent of cinema box-office receipts across Europe. Just 20 per cent of films are made locally. US film makers would ideally like the EC audio-visual market to be wholly open. In practice, negotiators aim to persuade the EC to open a minimum share of the market to foreign companies, and to promise never again to reduce that share. 'One problem is that they have no offer on the table at all at present,' a US official said. A problem for EC negotiators is that the Commission has no clear mandate under the Treaty of Rome to negotiate trade in services on behalf of member states. In France, the most fiercely independent and culturally sensitive EC market, 60 per cent of all television programming is reserved for French companies - with the exception of film channels such as Canal Plus. Forty per cent must be in the French language. Other member states set a minimum level of 50 per cent local content. In Germany, responsibility for cultural policies rests with regional governments, making it tricky for the federal government to be seen setting policy. Another EC problem is the fragility of the domestic industries. Deregulation and a proliferation of new television channels has led to increased US programme content at a time when the total of programme hours has grown tenfold. The US giants have gained because of superior distribution across the EC region, better marketing, and because they have been able to win marginal sales in the EC at low prices that can be underpinned by sound profits already earned in the large and vibrant domestic market. This success by US film and television companies, coupled with the immense and growing US trade surplus in the sector, make US complaints over EC trade barriers ring hollow. Another EC problem is the Broadcast Directive, which is due for review in October next year, and which sets the framework for cross-border television services throughout the EC. Brussels insists that the EC cannot have its hands tied before the review. In spite of these problems, it would seem possible that the EC could compromise by offering foreign companies at least as much of the EC market as they currently have. With the audio-visual market growing by almost 11 per cent a year across the EC, this binding alone would ensure steady export growth for US producing companies.</p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GOVERNMENT BAN ON OYSTERS HARD FOR THE FRENCH TO SWALLOW;  </P> <P> HEALTH: THE MOLLUSKS ARE TRADITIONAL HOLIDAY FARE. BUT CONTAMINATION IS FOUND  IN SOME HARVESTS AND GROWERS ARE OUTRAGED.  </P> <P> Pity the poor oyster farmers of the Bassin de Thau.  </P> <P> Christmas was coming. All over France, people were preparing for their annual  holiday feasts that traditionally include huge platters of the shellfish as a  first course.  </P> <P> The 8,000 French oyster farmers sell nearly half of their annual production in  the Christmas-New Year's season. According to lore, if a Frenchman eats oysters  at no other time during the year, he will have them for the midnight Christmas  supper.  </P> <P> What a blow then for the 300 oyster farmers in the Bassin de Thau, an estuary  in the Mediterranean Sea southwest of Montpellier, when a government laboratory  discovered traces of salmonella bacteria in oyster beds during a routine test  at the end of November.  </P> <P> For the Thau ostreiculteurs, it promised to be the bleakest Christmas ever with  the French government cast as "le grinch who stole Noel."  </P> <P> Finally, French President Francois Mitterrand came to their rescue this week,  saying he was "touched by the drama of the oyster farmers in which a whole  year's labor has been ruined."  </P> <P> Mitterrand, an inveterate oyster-eater himself, instructed the government of  Prime Minister Michel Rocard to speed up compensation payments to the oyster  farmers so they will have relief before Christmas.  </P> <P> Salmonella poisoning is a common problem with shellfish taken from polluted  waters. Eating the contaminated food can result in acute gastroenteritis and  even death among the young or elderly.  </P> <P> Health specialists theorized that a severe drought this past fall in the  Languedoc plateau above Montpellier caused animal waste to build up in the  fields. Heavy rains at the end of November washed it to the sea, polluting the  shallow Thau estuary.  </P> <P> Acting quickly, the Ministry of Marine Affairs in Paris ordered the Thau  oysters, which account for nearly 10% of the annual national crop of 120,000  tons, taken off the market.  </P> <P> Enraged by the government ruling, which they claimed contradicted reports from  other laboratories showing their waters to be clean, the Thau oyster farmers  went on the warpath. Gangs of them attacked the government laboratory at Sete,  at the mouth of the Thau estuary, where the salmonella had been discovered.  Using clubs and oyster trays, they broke windows and smashed computer screens.  </P> <P> The rampaging oyster farmers and their families then blockaded the highway  leading into the coastal town of Meze. Behind the barricades were 2,400 tables  heaped with more than 5,000 tons of oysters ruled uneatable by the French  government.  </P> <P> "It is these kinds of ministerial edicts," fumed Rene Couveinhes, a Gaullist  opposition member of Parliament from the Herault region that includes the Thau  estuary, "that during The Terror of the French Revolution sent people to the  scaffolds."  </P> <P> Despite the generally held view that the Thau oysters are not among the first  rank of French mollusks -- that honor is reserved for the famous fines de  claires from Marenne and Oleron on the Atlantic coast -- the plight of the Thau  oyster farmers won the sympathy of many in France.  </P> <P> Food crises are taken very seriously here. People remember with horror the  Vacherin cheese scare two years ago. Vacherin, a runny unpasteurized cheese  from Switzerland and the French Jura region, is also a special Christmastime  treat. In 1987-88, the Swiss brand Vacherin Mont d'Or was found to contain  listeria, a potentially fatal bacteria.  </P> <P> In 1985, it was the American horse-meat scandal that had people talking after  trichinosis-causing worms were discovered in meat imported from Connecticut.  There are also dozens of recurring wine and spirits flaps usually involving  someone mixing a common table wine with some pedigreed appelation controle such  as Bordeaux or Champagne.  </P> <P> Oyster farming in France dates from the late 18th Century when the Baron  Bellevert built an oyster park on the Normandy coast at Etretat. The oysters  were delivered to Queen Marie Antoinette at Versailles in carriages pulled by a  dozen horses.  </P> <P> Oyster raising became a major food industry under Napoleon III in the next  century. Today, France ranks fourth behind the United States, Japan and South  Korea in oyster production. In 1988, the French consumed more than 76 million  dozen oysters, or about 18 oysters for every man, woman and child in the  country. About half of these are eaten during the Christmas season.  </P> <P> To the French, oysters are as much a part of Christmas as an evergreen tree and  the chocolate buche de Noel, or Yule Log. The slimy bivalves are extolled in  French poetry and literature. The novelist Honore Balzac described himself as a  "fat man with an incredible passion for oysters."  </P> <P> Author Guy de Maupassant praised oysters as "sweet and fat, resembling little  ears locked inside shells, melting in the mouth between the palate and the  tongue like salted candy."  </P> <P> Likewise, oyster farmers are held in high regard in France in spite of their  penchant for violence, as exhibited in the recent Thau oyster riots.  </P> <P> "It's an unusual profession," commented Antoine Minaud, director of a  government maritime office that was also attacked by the oyster farmers. "The  shellfish farmers are restless people, difficult and traditionally very  individualistic. Perhaps it is because they are half-sailor and half-farmer."  </P> <P> With the plight of the Thau oyster farmers on the front pages alongside the  massacres in Romania and the American invasion of Panama, it wasn't long before  the politicians began to react.  </P> <P> One of them, Couveinhes, the Gaullist legislator from Herault, was making  trouble for the Socialist government by defiantly eating the Thau oysters  despite the ban. "I eat oysters and mussels from Thau waters every day," he  said, "and I'm in good health."  </P> <P> Finally, on Wednesday, during a meeting of the French council of ministers,  President Mitterrand expressed his heart-felt concern for the Thau oyster  farmers. He urged that compensation and other benefits, including government  subsidized interest payments on agricultural loans, be given immediately,  "before Christmas."  </P> <P> Initially, leaders in the French oyster industry feared the Thau oyster scare  would severely hurt the key holiday market.  </P> <P> Indeed, restaurants in the immediate Mediterranean coastal area have been badly  hurt.  </P> <P> "This is breaking the local economy," said Pascal Jacquinot, chef of the  respected Cote Bleue restaurant in Meze. "Our menu is mainly known for its  shellfish. In this season we normally have 120 customers a day. We have 30  employees and 12 cooks. But today we had only seven customers and no one for  dinner."  </P> <P> But as the Christmas feast, known as le Reveillon, draws near, most people in  France are apparently discarding their fears and ordering their holiday  oysters.  </P> <P> "We had a slight decline of about 15% because of all the publicity over the  Thau oysters," said Pascal Mousset, director of La Coupole, one of Paris's more  famous oyster restaurants. "But as the holidays approach, people have begun to  forget."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Statutory and Regulatory Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The restrictions on providing housing assistance to noncitizens with ineligible immigration status have been embodied in statute since 1980. Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 (94 Stat. 1637) (Section 214) was the original basis for restrictions on providing assistance to noncitizens with ineligible immigration status in the assisted housing programs. Section 214 was amended by section 329(a) of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1981 (94 Stat. 408), by section 121(a)(2) of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (``IRCA'', 100 Stat. 3384), and by section 164 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (101 Stat. 1860). (Section 214, as amended by these statutory sections, is codified at 42 U.S.C. 1436a.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There have been numerous attempts by HUD to implement by regulation the statutory restrictions on providing assistance to noncitizens with ineligible immigration status. Rules, both proposed and final, were published in 1982 (47 FR 18914, and 47 FR 43674), in 1986 (51 FR 15611), and 1988 (53 FR 842, and 53 FR 41038). Despite the publication of final rules during the period between 1982 and 1988, the statutory restrictions of section 214 have not been made effective. A detailed history of the regulatory efforts to implement section 214 (including why the final rules were not made effective) can be found in the rule published on January 13, 1988 (53 FR 842).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The most recent proposed rule implementing section 214 (before publication of this proposed rule) was published on October 19, 1988 (53 FR 41038). The proposed rule published in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is based on the October 19, 1988 proposed rule, and takes into consideration public comment received on the October 19, 1988 proposed rule. The discussion of public comments is set forth in section VII of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Procedural Matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. No Restrictions on Use of Assistance Until Final Rule Is Published and Effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Until a final rule implementing section 214 is published and made effective, there are no HUD restrictions on the use of assisted housing by noncitizens with ineligible immigration status. Consequently, until this proposed rule has reached the final rule stage, covered entities (i.e., housing authorities, managers of HUD-assisted housing, and mortgagees in the section 235 FHA insurance program) are not authorized to take any action based on the eligible immigration status of applicants and tenants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Using the ``Effective Date of the Final Rule'' as the Critical Date Rather Than ``Date of Enactment''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (c)(1) of section 214 was added by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (the 1987 Act) and confers discretion on the Secretary of HUD to continue assistance or defer termination of assistance on behalf of an individual for whom assistance would otherwise be terminated if that person was ``receiving such assistance on the date of enactment of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``date of enactment'' is also found in section 214(d) in the description of the elderly persons who need not provide documentation of their immigration status. The statute exempts from such documentation any individual who is ``62 years of age or older, and is receiving financial assistance on the date of the enactment of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD has determined that the provisions of section 214 are too complex to be determined self-implementing as of the date of enactment of the 1987 Act (February 5, 1988). Thus, the restrictions of section 214 will not be felt until a final regulation is published and becomes effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The general Congressional intent of section 214(c)(1) was to protect ``the sanctity of the family.'' (See remarks of Sen. William Armstrong, 133 Cong. Rec. S18615, December 21, 1987.) To honor this intent, HUD believes it is necessary to implement the new protective provisions at the same time that the restrictions of section 214 become effective. To do otherwise would be to thwart the pro-family intent of the Congress by prematurely triggering the statute's protections and rendering them meaningless for families admitted after the enactment date, but before a final rule effectively applies the restrictions of section 214.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In other words, since the exact effect on persons applying for or participating in the covered HUD programs will not be known until publication of the final rule, HUD is interpreting the statutory language to permit lenient treatment to persons receiving assistance on the effective date of the final rule when all parties affected will have notice of the methods that HUD has chosen for implementing the statutory restrictions rather than on the precise date of enactment of the 1987 Act. To limit lenient treatment to persons receiving assistance on the precise date of enactment would create a category of persons (admitted between February 5, 1988 and the final rule's effective date) who would be denied the new statutory protections simply because of the time associated with promulgation of a final rule. Support for this position is found in a House Committee Report in connection with the 1987 Act (H.R. Rep. No. 100&hyph;1222, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 49 (1987) (``House Report'')). In that report, the Congress stated: ``The modifications [made by the 1987 Act] are intended to clarify the original intent of Congress that families in which at least one person is eligible are not disqualified and that the rules not be applied retroactively.'' (House Report at p. 50.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> QUALITY OF LIFE IS EVERYONE'S BUSINESS  </P> <P> Imagine life in Orange County if business cheerfully ignored concerns about  growth management, traffic congestion and the high cost of housing. Imagine if  government simply facilitated new economic opportunity and otherwise left  everything alone. Well, so much for such stereotypes of the frontier in the  real world of 1990. The latest UC Irvine Executive Survey shows business  leaders in Orange County increasingly concerned about damage caused to the  business environment by a host of problems that municipalities and ordinary  citizens are trying to wrestle with.  </P> <P> In the four years since this regular survey of the county's chief executives  started, there has been a 21-percentage-point increase in pessimism about the  county's business climate. Only 23% of those surveyed, most from  growth-dependent service industries, said the county was a more attractive  place to do business than the past year. That was a substantial decline from  the 36% who found the county more attractive in 1987. The important thing was  the concern expressed by business leaders about problems of traffic congestion  and housing for employees in the general business environment.  </P> <P> There were signs of optimism about new business formations in retail and  service areas, and UCI forecasters found signs of continued job growth, both  here and in overseas markets. But the nagging problems explain why business  leaders in some parts of the country have been in the vanguard of efforts to  promote regional solutions to common problems.  </P> <P> There comes a time when the problems that trouble individuals become part of  the cost and headache of doing business. The personal experience of a worker  stalled in traffic or unable to find affordable housing for a family ultimately  affects the business climate. It's one good reason for business and government  to work together.  </P> <P> The good news from the UC Irvine study is that is that there is much optimism  in the general business outlook in Orange County. But the study shows that  business leaders have concerns that are shared by political leaders and  ordinary citizens.  </P></p>

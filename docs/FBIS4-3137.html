			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Yang Yuanhua (2799 0337 5478): "What </F> Are NATO's Intentions in Launching Air Strikes?"]    [Text] On 10 and 11 April, two F-16 NATO aircraft twice  bombed Serbian positions in Gorazde in eastern  Bosnia-Herzegovina to prevent Serbian armed forces from taking  Gorazde, a UN-declared protected region, and to protect UN  peacekeeping forces. This was the first time that NATO had  bombed ground forces since its establishment 45 years ago and  the first time NATO attacked one side in the Bosnian conflict.  They destroyed several tanks in Bosnia- Herzegovina's Serbian  ground forces and bombarded a command center.    NATO's attacks show that it has taken off the mask of  "neutrality," siding with one side and taking military action  and armed threats against the other. This has cast a shadow  over the prospects for a political resolution -- which all sides  are working for -- has worsened and complicated the Bosnian  situation, and has drawn the serious concern of the  international community.    Judging from the military viewpoint, the military effect of  the two air strikes were insignificant, but their political  impact is huge. The fact that NATO took military action against  Serbian armed forces for the first time shows that it has in  reality abandoned the neutral position -- a position which it  had tried its best to retain in the Bosnian conflict -- and it  has become more deeply involved in the conflict. NATO has  attempted to use this to show its strength and force the Serbs  to submit. U.S. President Clinton said: "We will launch air  strikes again if we are requested to authorize UN troops to give  'effective air support' in accordance with UN resolutions." The  NATO air strikes were launched in the name of the United Nations  without prior discussion at the Security Council. They were a  precedent ushered in by NATO to expand its power to launch air  strikes under the name of the United Nations and will harm the  prestige of the United Nations. NATO's action reflects the  United States' changed policy toward Russia and compels Russia  to choose between NATO and defending its traditional ally. The  air strikes in fact have encouraged Bosnian Muslims to ask for a  higher price in the resolution of Bosnian conflict, have aroused  the Serbs' dissatisfaction and feelings of resistance, and have  further aggravated the Bosnian situation. Bosnia-Herzegovina's  Serbian military headquarters published a bulletin saying that  NATO's air strikes represented "brazen aggression" and that it  has decided to break off all contacts with the UN peacekeeping  forces in former Yugoslavia.    What the prospects will be in the wake of the air strikes  are  a disturbing question of concern to the international community.  On 11 April, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry said that the U.S.  administration opposes unilateral interference -- sending U.S.  ground troops -- but does not rule out the possibility of  launching air strikes. Some people in the West are worried that  the Serbs will retaliate, rendering all the previous efforts of  the UN peacekeeping forces futile. NATO officials are generally  adopting a wait-and-see approach. Russian President Yeltsin  favors the resolution of all problems in strict accordance with  UN resolutions. Yeltsin said that, during a telephone  conversation with Clinton, Clinton could not answer his question  on whether the UN secretary general had agreed to the air  strikes. Although the Serbs have not made a clear military  response to this action, their 10 April bulletin said that they  would use every means at their disposal to exercise the right of  self defense.    The Bosnian situation has once again entered a delicate,  complicated, and intensified stage. All sides are adopt an  attitude of restraint to avoid escalating the war and are  seeking a political resolution. This is precisely the goal that  the international community generally is looking forward to.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sp. Sourmelidhis] </F>   [Excerpts] At a time when Turkish Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller appears to be threatening Greece, Cypriot President  Glavkos Kliridhis is ready to resign from his post as president  of that republic to protest the secret negotiations between  members of the UN Security Council and Turkish Cypriot leader  Rauf Denktas' side and the negative decisions on a Cyprus  solution being manipulated by the United Nations.    Yesterday proved clearly that Greek-Turkish relations mainly  "pass through" Nicosia and depend on the solution of the Cyprus  issue.    Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will meet his  Turkish counterpart, Hikmet Cetin, today in Istanbul in a very  bad climate that Ankara has created, aiming to get Greece  involved in adventures and divert Athens from supporting the  Cypriot leadership over the negative Security Council decisions.    Papoulias and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  will  discuss the Cyprus issue and Greek-Turkish relations on the  sidelines of the NATO foreign ministers' spring conference.    The United States is particularly disturbed and dissatisfied  with President Kliridhis' reaction and is trying to avert such a  possibility. The United States is aiming to find a way for a  political dialogue between Greece and Turkey. At the same time,  however, the Security Council's actions protect Denktas' and  Ankara's intransigence.    A few days ago, Ciller sent U.S. President Bill Clinton  another letter about the Cyprus issue. Kliridhis also sent a  letter on the same issue.    U.S. Ambassador Thomas Niles yesterday had a surprise  meeting  with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and discussed  Greek-Turkish relations and the Cyprus issue. [passage omitted]  <H5>  The Cyprus Issue </H5>   UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report on Cyprus  essentially led the Cyprus issue into another deadlock. Of the  five alternative solutions that Butrus-Ghali suggested, only one  refers to Denktas' responsibility for the deadlock.    The United States, as well as Britain and France, chose the  solution that will lead to new, quick negotiations--without  blaming the Turkish Cypriots--and to a new, supplementary report  by the UN secretary general, which, however, will not refer to  the substance of the Cyprus issue.    When briefed by a U.S. diplomat, President Kliridhis reacted  strongly to this development, saying that he is ready to quit.  He also told the Cypriot people that they have been deceived by  the allies and negotiators. Kliridhis was enraged when he  learned that the United States wants to include in the  supplementary report some of the measures it promised to Denktas  and Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Tugay Ulucevik last month in  Vienna. The Cypriot Government never learned officially about  these promises.    President Kliridhis is waiting for Papandreou to extend an  invitation to the Cypriot National Council to confer in Athens.  He is also waiting for a final date to be set for his meeting  with European Commission President Jacques Delors in Corfu  before the EU summit. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello says that  contradictory decisions by the Supervision and Control  Commission [CSC] and the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] have  contributed toward the delays in the demobilization of  government and Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] troops.  The UN official noted that, though the CSC had decided that  demobilization should begin on 1 March, the CCF ordered that,  until Renamo had produced its lists, the government should not  send its lists to the Finance Ministry to have demobilization  subsidies paid out.    Aldo Ajello announced that greater control is to be exerted  on the CCF in the future. The UN special representative also  disclosed that the first UN police contingent is scheduled to  arrive in Mozambique before the end of this month. The UN  Security Council recently endorsed the deployment of more than  1,000 UN policemen in this country to observe the work done by  the police of the Republic of Mozambique.</p>

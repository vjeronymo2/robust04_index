			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Centre-right to offer alliance with Tory MEPs THE Christian Democrat group in the European Parliament has decided to pursue talks for a quasi-merger with British Tory MEPs, with a joint structure and secretariat to be finalised this spring. Last year, the European Democratic Group (34 Tory MEPs and two Danish conservatives) made a controversial request to link up with the Christian Democrats, the leading centre-right political group. The arrangement proposed will fall short of that, but Christian Democrat leaders see an alliance with the UK Tories as a bridgehead for their federalist views in Britain. Last night, a meeting in Brussels of CD leaders, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl and four other prime ministers, criticised Prime Minister John Major, deploring his 'negative stand' at the Maastricht summit on monetary and social policy.

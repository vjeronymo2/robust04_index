			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Let's have a chat over dinner - Summit Diary / FT writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels The last visit of a Russian leader to Belgium was in the 18th century, so it is said, when Peter the Great passed through. Following Boris the Great's visit earlier this week, Belgian diplomats are hoping it won't be another 250 years before the next visit. They are particularly worried that an incident at dinner on Thursday night might have put the chill back into rapidly warming relations between Russia and western Europe. 'Another Berlin Wall has fallen,' Mr Yeltsin said after the EU and Russia signed a political declaration. But over dinner on Thursday night, the Russian leader made it clear he thought the thaw in the cold war had not gone far enough. He petulantly pointed out that Nato's friendly intentions seemed to stop at the Urals. Moreover, he went on to cite its apparent chilliness towards Russia as just the most obvious example of western Europe's deeper reluctance to snuggle up to Russia - lack of concrete funding pledges being another example. It took a few calming words from President Francois Mitterrand of France to prevent the outburst becoming a full-scale diplomatic incident, officials said yesterday. Next time around, maybe they'll soothe Mr Yeltsin's nerves with the comprehensive trade pact he really wanted, rather than the high-sounding promises of a declaration on greater economic and political co-operation. * * * * At least hangers-on at the ministerial meetings have the sun-seeking, island-hopping, ouzo-drinking Greek presidency of the European Union to look forward to. It begins on January 1 and after the drizzly Belgian presidency should be a welcome New Year tonic. Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek foreign minister, did his bit to raise summit-goers' spirits yesterday by making the case for at least three special Greek weekend breaks on top of the scheduled summit of EU leaders in Corfu next June. Book early to avoid disappointment. * * * * More demonstrations to mark yesterday's meeting, and an additional traffic headache for Brussels police. At one point, police were predicting the chaotic near-coincidence in Brussels of 25,000 Belgian socialist union members, protesting against their government's austerity plans, 800 striking teachers, 300 torch-carrying European miners, 400 young Euro-federalists, and thousands of funereal firefighters mourning the death of a colleague. Nothing colourful enough, however, to satisfy Sir John Kerr, Britain's top EU diplomat, who lamented that Brussels demos were always characterised by 'too many farmers and not enough French film stars'. * * * * After the Lord Mayor's Show comes the muck-cart: ministers, diplomats and journalists are bracing themselves for a nightmare on Monday when the Belgian presidency has committed itself to hold five simultaneous ministerial meetings in the overcrowded Charlemagne building in Brussels, many of them charged with clearing up issues unresolved by EU leaders.</p>

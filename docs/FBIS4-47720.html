			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- Hundreds of thousands of  missing ballot papers have been found in two warehouses in the  PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area, the Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] said on Sunday [1 May].    IEC Commissioner Dikgang Moseneke said people had been  subpoenaed to answer questions about the papers found in  warehouses on the East Rand and West Rand. Investigations were  continuing, Mr Moseneke said. A shortage of ballot papers in  the PWV caused long queues at polling stations in the region on  Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By T. Mohan] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh -- Sensitive to the fact that rural  development will be the key to winning the continuing long-term  battle against the recalcitrant Khmer Rouge and their  supporters, the Royal Government has allocated a large chunk of  its national budget towards this end.    The Royal Government's plans for rural development involve  programmes wider than technical advances in agriculture alone.    The five principal ministries and secretariats are currently  involved in rural development and are collectively allocated  some 25 percent of the national budget.    Several contributing countries and agencies are also  involved  in rural development activities of various kinds, together with  over 100 non-governmental organisations.    "There are some 17 priority areas that are seen as being  critical to rural development and the Royal Government attaches  great importance to pursuing a coordinated programme approach to  rural development and to making a major thrust towards bringing  development to the more remote areas. The priority areas are in  providing adequate training and training centres, documentation  centres and workshops and the providing of adequate water supply  for drinking, domestic use and irrigation," the report on  National Programme to Rehabilitate and Develop Cambodia which  was made available to THE CAMBODIA TIMES, said.    In addition to this, it also intends to continue the  repatriation programme with emphasis being placed on integration  and employment and continuing with, if funds permit,  accelerating the mine awareness and clearance campaigns.    Other aspects of rural development include the  implementation  of a new integrated Family Food Production Programme for food  security, repairing, rehabilitating and constructing rural  roads, providing primary health care and fostering an expansion  in rural credit.    "The government also intends to establish Community and  Women's Development Centres and provide informal training in  addition to establishing small enterprises and income generating  activities. It also plans to establish model villages, develop  alternative energy sources and protect the environment and  natural resources and encourage reforestation," the report said.    To address these interconnected priorities, the Royal  Government will pursue two parallel strategies.    Firstly, it is seeking to improve the management of rural  development programmes, primarily by supporting greater  consultation and better coordination among the development  partners.    The principal objective is to strengthen the planning and  delivery capacities and mechanisms of various agencies and  organisations working in rural parts of the country which should  be made effective in the short-term.    Secondly, the government is seeking to improve and to  increase the linkages between the design and implementation of  development programmes, mainly by promoting participatory  methodologies and an integrated approach to rural development.    To pursue these strategies and its many programmes  successfully, the government has identified two key policies to  accelerate rural development.    The second is to ensure a shift towards an integrated and  more people orientated approach to rural development in order to  reinforce sustainability through people participation and gender  sensitivity.    The report said that people's participation is crucial to  the  success of any rural initiative. In addition, rural development  strategies must build people's confidence and expose them to new  ideas and approaches consistent with a more open society, so  that their participation becomes even more meaningful.</p>

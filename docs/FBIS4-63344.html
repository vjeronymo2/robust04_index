			<p>BFN     [Text] The chairman of the Crimean parliament said it was  the duty of the legislature to restore Crimea's constitution of  May 6, 1992, and thereby put the peninsula's relations with  Ukraine on the basis of a treaty. "I cannot see any other option  -- there is simply none," Sergey Tsekov said at a news  conference in Simferopol on Saturday.    He said that, as the legislature discussed the matter, some  of its members made more drastic proposals, namely for a  referendum on the status of the peninsula. Restoration of the  1992 constitution is "the mildest form of relations with  Ukraine," Tsekov said.    Answering a question by Interfax-Ukraine, he said the  ultimate objective of the Russia Bloc is to make Crimea an  independent state and then unify it with Russia, although the  peninsula might be "reunified" with Russia "together with  Ukraine."    "Many of the problems, above all economic ones, can only be  solved by the integrating Ukraine with Russia," Tsekov said.    He said nothing today poses a threat to Ukraine's  territorial  integrity.    Asked about troop movements in Crimea, Tsekov said, "There  are such movements, but they are normal routine troop movements.  No emergency measures have been planned."    He ruled out that the Crimean parliament would be dissolved,  for that, he said, would be illegal. "There are sensible  people" in Ukraine's leadership, who "will not allow an  aggravation of the relations with Crimea," he said.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM scorns agreement call over N Ireland - Electoral Pacts MR John Major fuelled speculation yesterday that he was contemplating a deal with Ulster Unionist MPs in a hung parliament when he scorned calls for a pact among the main parties on not changing the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. Labour and Liberal Democrats expressed fears that the prime minister was prepared to jeopardise progress the government had made towards a political settlement in the province. Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, said the prime minister was 'undermining' the work of Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, over the past two years. The prime minister was 'playing political football' with the lives of people in the province, he said. Nevertheless, Downing Street officials rejected such an interpretation of the prime minister's comments, while Tories and the Unionist party have denied that any discussions have taken place. The row came a day after Mr Brooke offered his resignation for singing on an Irish television show a few hours after an IRA bomb attack in Country Tyrone last Friday. The death yesterday of another man injured in the blast brought total fatalities to eight. Mr Gay Byrne, the show's host, expressed regret for the trouble he caused Mr Brooke. Mr Major was asked by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, if he would support a 'a cross-party approach to Northern Ireland affairs during the election and unequivocally reject any partisan trading with the Anglo-Irish Agreement'. Liberal Democrats, many of whom believe a hung parliament the most likely outcome of the contest, want to force the other main parties to set out more clearly what post-election deals they might contemplate. Mr Major's reply did not mention the agreement and said only: 'This party stands four-square against terrorism and we have set out our policies clearly . . . on many occasions. I do not see any imminent change.' Replacing the 1985 agreement, which gives the Irish government a say in Northern Ireland, would be a central demand of Unionist MPs if they held the balance of power after a general election. Mr Major spent two hours late on Monday night discussing security in the province with members of the Democratic Unionist and Ulster Unionist parties. But the meeting appears to have been more about exchanging views and restoring confidence in Mr Brooke than in sounding out possible post-election demands.</p>

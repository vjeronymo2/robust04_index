			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Fuji Bank tells US unit to cut non-performing loans FUJI Bank, the Japanese commercial bank, has told Heller International, its US financial subsidiary, to reduce sharply its non-performing loans over the next three years. The continuing difficulties at Heller, purchased nine years ago, highlight the problems facing Japanese banks which bought US financial institutions in the mid-1980s. Several of those US units are now burdened by non-performing loans made during the late 1980s, particularly to the property sector. Fuji Bank has invested an estimated Dollars 700m in Chicago-based Heller, and the bank hopes its three-year reform plan will put the unit firmly into profit.</p>

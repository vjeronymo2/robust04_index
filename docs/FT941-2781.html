			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (2): The cycle is different - James Buxton examines the economy in the aftermath of recession 'Scotland,' says Mr Jeremy Peat, chief economist of the Royal Bank of Scotland, 'tends to outperform the UK during a recession, but do less well, relatively speaking, when the UK economy turns up.' The first part of that remark is almost an understatement. Scotland had a remarkably mild recession in the early 1990s. As Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of Scottish Enterprise, the economic development agency, pointed out in a speech a few days ago, the Scottish economy showed greater resilience in recession than that of southern Britain. Redundancies in Scotland, he said, had been lower, the rate of business failures was smaller, real incomes increased more rapidly, manufacturing held up better and retail sales were more buoyant. To the amazement of seasoned economists, Scotland's unemployment rate was overtaken by the UK average in late 1991 and has remained below it - a phenomenon never seen since formal measurement of unemployment began in the 1920s. In January seasonally adjusted unemployment in Scotland was 9.4 per cent, compared with the UK level of 9.9 per cent, and unemployment in Scotland was worse only than East Anglia, the East Midlands and the South-West. Just as Scotland never experienced the full force of the boom of the late 1980s, neither did it have to cope with the bust. Neither Scottish individuals nor Scottish companies became heavily indebted in the way that many in southern England did, and accordingly suffered much less when the economy turned down. Scotland also suffered less, as Prof MacKay pointed out, because it had lost its smokestack industries in the 1980s and acquired, mainly through inward investment, a world-class electronics and information technology industry. In fact, if the category 'electrical and instrument engineering' is stripped out of the official statistics, Scottish manufacturing output shows a worrying decline from mid-1991 onwards. Yet shallow recession is still painful for many people and 9.4 per cent unemployment is far too high. It is hard to convince a Glasgow taxi driver, struggling to comprehend how the de-industrialised city now earns its living, that the disappearance of smokestack industries is anything but a tragedy and a betrayal. The question now is whether the Scottish economy will follow its historic pattern, with its growth rate dropping below that of the UK, or whether some of the factors which made the recession in Scotland shallow will continue to preserve Scotland's relative buoyancy. Most economic forecasters believe that gross domestic product growth in Scotland will lag slightly behind that of the UK in 1994 and 1995, because southern England has the capacity to expand faster. The average of six independent forecasts of GDP growth in Scotland for 1994 and 1995 suggest that in 1994 the Scottish economy will grow by 2.4 per cent against the UK's 2.6 per cent, and the gap will be much the same in 1995. The report Regional Economic Prospects by Cambridge Econometrics is unusual in suggesting that Scotland's GDP growth will exceed that of the UK this year, though it says it will tail off next year. The North Sea oil industry, which is another main factor keeping Scotland's economy up during the recession, achieved its highest output of oil since 1988 in January 1994, reaching 2.4 barrels per day. Output is expected to continue growing to late 1995. But while forecasts by Scottish Enterprise of a marked downturn in expenditure by the offshore oil industry were recently revised upwards, the offshore fabrication yards are desperately short of orders. Scotland, having done relatively well out of defence expenditure over the decades of the Cold War, is now suffering from the defence cuts. The Rosyth naval dockyard in Fife has seen its workforce fall from 6,000 in 1988 to the current level of 3,600, because of a diminished workload from the navy. Last year the government awarded the contract for servicing Trident submarines to Devonport instead of Rosyth, and although it allocated Rosyth surface ship work until 2005, Babcock Thorn, the yard's managers, say employment could by then have dropped to 2,200. One potential bright spot highlighted by Mr Peat of the Royal Bank of Scotland is spending on infrastructure. Scotland is reckoned to have done relatively well in the 1994/95 public expenditure round. A big investment programme in roads is being kept up. Every economy is a patchwork of light and shade. Prof Donald MacKay said in a speech last autumn that Scotland had over the 1955-1992 period matched the efficiency gains achieved by the UK economy, but had failed to maintain its share of UK employment - if it had, another 140,000 jobs would have been created. 'We have clearly failed to diversify existing businesses or introduce new activities,' he said, pointing also to Scotland's low birthrate for new businesses. This was despite having higher public expenditure per head than the rest of Britain, favourable treatment under regional policy, consistent success in winning inward investment and the benefit of North Sea oil on its doorstep. Scotland's dependence on inward investment was recently starkly underlined in a study of the Scottish electronics industry by the US Monitor consultancy. It said that because the industry consisted largely of foreign-owned branch plants it lacked the ability to respond spontaneously to market opportunities. It also said that sectors such as defence electronics were likely to be hit by the decline in defence spending; that future inward investors might find eastern Europe a cheaper location than Scotland; and that Scotland might miss out on future developments in electronics. If nothing were done and no new inward investors came, employment might fall from the current 45,000 to 27,500. Monitor's findings appeared to some to be unduly alarmist. Nevertheless its report was accompanied by the creation of the Scottish Electronics Forum, an unprecedented grouping of both multinationals and indigenous Scottish companies which is working on ways of strengthening the industry's competitiveness. Some senior people in the industry believe, however, that a change in government policy is needed, to give more encouragement to multinationals to carry out research and development (R&amp;D) in Scotland, thus giving them deeper roots, and to support more innovation by indigenous companies to match the big grants available to companies which create jobs in large numbers. These arguments do not find great favour with Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary: 'I don't regard (inward investment) as the only answer to Scotland's problems, or the only alternative to indigenous industry. 'I think our schemes do work because we are actually winning the battle on R&amp;D, and getting more R&amp;D, just as we are getting more inward investment, and we're doing it without buying it at a higher price such as other less competitive countries are willing to pay.'</p>

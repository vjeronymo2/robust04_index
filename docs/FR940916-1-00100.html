			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) How many locomotives currently used on mainline or interchange operations are equipped with air dryers?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Would the use of air dryers be more effective if all locomotives were required to be equipped with the devices, rather than just those specific locomotives covered by this proposal?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Are the costs identified by FRA regarding this proposal accurate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Are there shortline railroads that use or possess any yard air sources which would be required to be equipped with an air dryer in accordance with this proposal? If so, how many?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) What quantitative and/or qualitative safety and operational benefits can be derived from equipping the locomotives and yard air sources covered by this proposal with air dryers?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) What maintenance costs are associated with air dryers?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) What is the reliability of automatic drain valves?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) What procedures are currently in place to ensure that automatic drain valves are operating properly?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Can aftercoolers, ranging from the sixty feet of two-inch radiating pipe design to other commercially available designs, or other similar equipment provide adequate cooling to prevent trainlines from freezing in extreme cold weather?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.105. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section contains design standards for conventional train air brakes except for trains propelled by MU locomotives. FRA intends to preserve the basic conventional train air brake technology that has long been an industry standard. Several commenters recommended that the specifications and requirements for power brake systems for freight service contained in Appendix B to Part 232 be eliminated because they are too restrictive and detailed to allow for technological development. Contrary to these commenters' views, FRA feels that many of the requirements contained in Appendix B for power brake systems are still necessary. FRA does recognize that some of the requirements are outdated and should be eliminated. Therefore, as previously stated in the discussion of &sect;232.101, FRA proposes to eliminate Appendix B and incorporate those requirements that it feels are still relevant to today's equipment directly into various sections of the revised regulation. Consequently, this section contains the general requirement that air brake system components be adequately sealed to prevent contamination by foreign material and also contains provisions regarding the control valve's compatibility with other air brake systems. Furthermore, in order to address the concerns of several parties that the requirements contained in Appendix B are too restrictive to allow the development of new technology, FRA in &sect;232.901 proposes to permit parties to petition FRA to grant waivers or convert some of the train brake system specification and design requirements into performance-based safety requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.107. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section contains standards unique to passenger trains. In this section FRA proposes to preserve the requirement currently contained in &sect;229.47(b) regarding emergency brake valves in MU locomotives and cab car locomotives. FRA also proposes to require a clearly marked emergency brake at each end of passenger coaches in order to ensure quick and available access to the devices if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.109. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section contains design standards for blended brakes. Blended brakes are becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly in passenger and commuter operations. Blended brakes combine the retarding forces of dynamic brakes and friction brakes to produce the desired overall braking effect. FRA proposes to require that the blending of the two retarding forces be done automatically and that the friction portion of the braking system be capable of safely stopping the train in the event of a power loss or other failure of the dynamic portion of the train brake system. Most, if not all, existing blended braking schemes meet these two requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.111. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section involves design standards for dynamic brakes. Most, if not all, of the railroads that provided comments stated that they do not consider dynamic brakes to be a safety device. However, these same commenters stated that they promote and encourage the use of dynamic brakes for purposes of fuel efficiency and to avoid wear to brake components. Due to this encouragement, dynamic brakes are relied on to control train speed and to provide assistance in controlling trains on heavy grades. Contrary to the comments of several labor representatives, FRA does not feel that locomotives should be required to be equipped with dynamic brakes, FRA believes that the decision to equip a locomotive with dynamic brakes is mainly an economic one, best determined by each individual railroad. However, in order to prevent accidents and injuries that may result from an over-reliance on the dynamic brake, which may fail at any time, FRA believes that if the devices are available, engineers should be informed on their safe and proper use and be provided with information regarding the amount of dynamic braking power actually available on their respective trains. FRA believes that by providing an engineer with as much information as possible on the status of the dynamic brakes on a train, a railroad better enables that engineer to operate the train in the safest and most efficient manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously discussed, the operating rules of most railroads currently contain limits on the amount of dynamic braking force that may safely be used depending on the dimensions of the train involved. Most railroad operating rules express these limits in terms of the number of axles that engine consists are permitted to use in dynamic braking. Railroads generally will cut out the dynamic brakes on trailing locomotives, when the train is made up, in order to avoid the possibility of excessive dynamic braking force being applied, which could result in the buckling of the train. However, some operating rules also express dynamic braking limits for operating through turnouts, crossovers, and curves in terms of dynamic brake amperes, yet, there is currently no way for engineers to know the amount of dynamic brake amperage on their train or the amperage they are using. Furthermore, although running tests of dynamic brakes, as proposed by FRA, provide information to the locomotive engineer regarding the availability of dynamic brakes, such tests are limited to the specific moment they are performed. Thus, running tests do not provide continuous information on the current status of the dynamic brakes to the locomotive engineer. Because dynamic brakes could fail at any time, FRA feels there must be some way for engineers to continuously monitor the operation of their available dynamic brakes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

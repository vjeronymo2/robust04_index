			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / TGWU and GMB launch joint campaign BRITAIN'S two big general unions - the GMB and TGWU - took another step towards merger yesterday by announcing a joint recruitment campaign in the building materials industry. The unions have agreed to sign people up into each other's union depending on which is larger in a particular company, and will even ask members to switch to the stronger union on their site. Union leaders hinted that the principle might be extended to other industries where the two unions compete for members - such as the food and drink industry or hotel and catering. Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB, said: 'There's no reason any more for competitive trade unions. Working together is the best way to help our members and to build trade unions. 'I look forward to more co-operation in the future.' The building materials industry has about 70,000 employees, of whom about 15,000 are in the TGWU and a similar number in the GMB. The campaign will concentrate on companies such as Marley, Redland, Tarmac and Hanson.</p>

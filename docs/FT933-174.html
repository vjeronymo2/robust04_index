			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Arts: Pastiche reaches new peaks - Cinema CAREFUL Guy Maddin LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE (15) Alfonso Arau BLOOD IN BLOOD OUT (18) Taylor Hackford ASSASSIN OF THE TSAR (12) Karen Shakhnazarov An utterly wonderful Canadian film is on at the ICA in London and I am thinking: Can we arrange coach trips from all parts of Britain or Europe? Seldom does one stroll into the Mall's culture palace and find a gem like Careful. ICA movies are usually pieces of penitential avant-gardism, airdropped into Britain from planes plying between unheard-of movie festivals. But this film, written, directed, designed, photographed and edited by Guy Maddin - there is auteurship for you - is a joy, a feast, an astonishment. Set in a never-never Bavarian village, it starts as a spoof-Teutonic 'silent' movie embellished with cautionary voice-over: a wise old chorus figure warns of avalanches, crevasses and other Alpine perils ('Guard against any noise]', 'A heedless heart can be lured to dangerous heights]'). Then it modulates into a mountain folk-melodrama plucked as if from the 1920s: the kind of movie that led on later to such joy-through-ozone pictures as Leni Riefenstahls's The Blue Light or The White Hell Of Pitz Palu. Through an occluding swathe of grainy, mock-tinted photography plus artfully crackling soundtrack - ah sweet satiric retaliation for all those dawn-of-time Nordic art movies we once suffered through as youngsters] - we watch the adventures of a doomed, incestuous family living in the village of Tolzbad. Ma is lusted after by blond son Johann; elder son Franz spends his years in cobwebbed detention in the attic (offence unspecified); and young Grigorss, the only healthy and 'normal' son, loves Klara who works in the village's all-female coalmine. (Candle-hats and soot-dusted Laura Ashley dresses a requirement.) There are also cut-out cardboard mountains, wrinkled sky-drops lit by bilious suns, and any number of flugelhorns, goats, ghosts, castles and avalanches. To call this film 'kitsch' would be like calling the Grand Canyon a faultline: true but inadequate. Mr Maddin, none of whose three previous micro-budget films I have seen, must have spent his whole childhood devouring early German cinema. But when pastiche reaches this degree of passionate empathy, it passes into a zone of unpolluted, debt-free genius. I would call Careful worthy of Airplane] did I not think it better than Airplane]. Better because it does not stop at derision; it goes on to make a new shape and poetry from the wreckage of its own lampooning. Maddin makes us notice as never before how beautiful were the slap-up-a-mountain artifices of primitivist silent cinema. When his characters, stick-silhouetted against the backdrop sky like Lotte Reininger figures, clamber down a couple of feet of papier-mache rock, they ask us to believe we are halfway up an Alp at the same time as saying 'This trompe l'oeil would trompe absolutely no one.' And when the schoolmistress with the ludicrous German accent (played by writer-actress Jackie Burroughs of A Winter Tan) deals out her jackbooted moral lessons for the day to the towheaded Aryan youngsters - 'Never Gamble With Life' she scratches on the blackboard - we giggle at the scene's goofiness as well as grinning at the heady oneiric cocktails Maddin makes from mixing his movie memories. (Besides all else, Careful is a mischievous primer on how the follies of Aryan supremacism were embryonic in those purity-obsessed 1920s mountain yarns). Nothing is funnier than a comedy that seems to take itself seriously. Careful never holds out its hat for laughter. It guards an uproarious solemnity even in climaxes like the avalanche triggered by Grigorss to kill Klara's father. (Dare to laugh out loud as the first rumble causes a stuffed goat to topple down the fake mountainside). And as if the kitsch had not already told us a gay sensibility was at work, the film can be read as a dream-parable about closet sexuality: about the tragic absurdity of lives ruled by exaggerated caution. 'The single bleat of a lamb' intones the Wise Old Narrator, 'once caused an avalanche that uncovered an entire graveyard.' Careful is, among much else, a poetic farce about social hypocrisy: about the need to tread softly, lest we stumble on the Real Truth about people and their needs and their emotions. The rest of the movie week dwells among foothills. When you open a press handout on Monday morning and discover instructions on how to make hot chocolate and Quails in Rose Petal Sauce, what should you do? Assume a mistake at the printers? Check that your brain-centres are fully functioning? Or say to yourself, 'Another day, another Mexican magical-realist movie.' Laura Esquivel's novel Like Water For Chocolate was a romance with recipes - this trend is spreading; is she related to Nora Ephron? - and has now become a movie with recipes. As directed by Alfonso Arau (actor, film-maker and Esquivel's husband) it is whimsical, too long and filmed in a dusty orange glow. But in America it has made much money, becoming the year's arthouse answer to Jurassic Park. Reason: its slant on Magic Realism is shamelessly populist. Give the public a pair of lovers kept apart by fate: mother-tyrannised Tita (Lumi Cavazos) and handsome Pedro (Marco Leonardi), who weds Tita's sister when Tita is sentenced to spinsterdom by possessive Mama. Then, having kept them sundered through assorted births, deaths, revolutions and recipes, bang them together finally like two flintstones overdue for combustion. The film has moments of charm and mischief. And I may try the recipes. But set an Esquivel yarn next to a Marquez yarn and you see what a vast instructive gap exists in Latin American fantasy-fiction between the wonderful and the merely whimsical. There is more Hispanic flavouring in Blood In Blood Out, directed by Taylor 'Officer And A Gentleman' Hackford. But this is Latinism Hollywood-style. It is about as convincing as those million-dollar stars' haciendas that dot the hills above Tinseltown: here a whitewashed Spanish arch, there a carefully placed Mexican maid; spread above them all, the exotic waves of red tiling . . . Unlike houses, of course, movies walk, talk and make a lot of noise. This three-hour saga of life on the barrio - the slums and war-zones of east Los Angeles - wants to be the ultimate ethnic epic for LA's fast-growing Chicano population. But around our three artfully differentiated 'heroes' - hotheaded Miklo (Damian Chapa), artistic Cruz (Jesse Borrego), proud and macho Paco (Benjamin Bratt) - spins a plot whose circles diminish even as they accelerate. For every family bust-up there are two more waiting; for every prison riot, expect three encores; and for every mutilation inflicted on our boys - stomach wound, broken back, amputated leg - be sure that exponentially amplified revenges will be meted out to the baddies. 'I wanted this film to have a reality factor that could not be questioned,' says Taylor Hackford. But we know all about Hackford's reality factors. In addition to the Gere-Winger navy lark he directed Against All Odds and produced La Bamba: movies sharing Blood In Blood Out's blend of melodrama, ear-bashing music and comic-book acting styles. This is the cinema of knee-jerk response-induction. Keep hitting the filmgoer in the right place and he will react in the right way. Failing that, he will at least feel too battered to leave the cinema. Assassin Of The Tsar, an Anglo-Russian co-production, is better only in being shorter. Malcolm McDowell is the grizzled, whitehaired mental patient who thinks he killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881 and that he led the firing squad that later erased the Romanovs in 1918. As Lady Bracknell might say, one paranoid delusion is reasonable: two seems like self-indulgence. Dr Oleg Jankovsky attempts to cure him; and director Karen Shakhnazarov attempts, without success, to make the film feel like something more than an extended history exam.</p>

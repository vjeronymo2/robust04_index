			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Central banks defending the indefensible by supporting currencies Sir, Do the central banks never learn? Costly currency interventions were to no avail in saving sterling, the French franc or other minor Euro currencies. Now we see the US Federal Reserve and others trying to stop the dealers from driving the dollar down ('Central banks step in to defend Dollars ', May 5). On past evidence it is hard to see why the central banks should be successful in fighting the trend this time. The foreign exchange markets have just become too large to be defeated. In a world of floating exchange rates, currency overshooting is inevitable. 'Fundamentals' are irrelevant to short-term speculators. They see quick profits based on market psychology, not economic logic. The problem is that the speculators - or rather the attempts to fight them - can force a change in the fundamentals themselves. For example, at the moment US authorities fear that dollar depreciation will deter foreign buyers of US bonds, causing a rise in US long rates and inhibiting economic recovery. But, by trying to fight a falling currency, they may force short rates to rise too much. This in itself, could produce the very rise in long rates and weaker growth which they want to avoid] If central banks could just accept that they cannot fight these short-term trends and let the speculation fizzle out the traders will eventually move on to a new game. The 'fundamentals' clearly favour a stronger dollar and, by accepting that fighting the contrary currency movements short-term could be counter-productive, the central banks may have better success in managing their economies in the long term.

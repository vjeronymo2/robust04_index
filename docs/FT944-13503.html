			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Cabinet set to back bill to deregulate gas supply The government appears set to introduce a bill to deregulate the domestic gas market in the next parliamentary session after Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, yesterday outlined proposals for a pilot scheme in 1996 and full competition in 1998. Although Mr Eggar said he could not confirm the inclusion of legislation in the Queen's Speech next month, his remarks left little doubt that he believes the Cabinet will support tabling the bill. Asked by an MP in a select committee meeting if the deregulation plan could go ahead without a bill next session, he replied: 'Theoretically yes, but you need a lot of theory and not a lot of practice to reach that conclusion.' A likely decision to go ahead with deregulation is supported by a growing consensus that competition would be beneficial. Independent gas suppliers have predicted that prices could fall by 10 per cent with deregulation. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, gas industry regulator, told MPs at the trade and industry select committee yesterday that anyone who paid their bill on time in the new regime was likely to be a winner in price terms. Separately, British Gas said it is likely to raise its prices, including standing charges, by about the rate of inflation at the end of the year. There had been speculation that the standing charge of less than Pounds 37 would be raised to Pounds 42. The company promises discounts for consumers who pay by direct debit and hopes to double the number of people on such schemes, from the 3m at present. Confirming plans for more cost-reflective pricing, Mr Richard Giordano, chairman, said there would also be a change next year to reflect transportation charges. This could increase or decrease prices in some areas by 2 per cent. Mr Eggar told MPs that competition would start with a regional pilot, 'perhaps in an area the size of a county with 500,000 people', in April 1996. A second pilot involving about 2m people would follow in 1997. He hoped to encourage small suppliers into the market, suggesting for example that coal-bed methane gas could be provided to individual villages. He said legislation would also include provision for a levy on gas suppliers to address potential problems if individual suppliers picked up an 'unreasonable' percentage of customers who were expensive to serve. Ms Spottiswoode said a review of British Gas operations in December will investigate claims by independent suppliers that transportation and storage have been overvalued by Pounds 3bn.</p>

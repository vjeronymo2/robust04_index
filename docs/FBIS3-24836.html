			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] State President F.W. de Klerk has announced a  comprehensive plan to stabilize the violence-wrecked East Rand  and restore order to the area. The five-point plan is a joint  initiative by President de Klerk and ANC [African National  Congress] leader Nelson Mandela, as well as other political  leaders.    The South African Defense Force will be deployed in the area  immediately, and the Internal Stability Unit withdrawn. A  representative task group led by the former chief of the Air  Force, General Jan van Loggrenberg, will be in control of the  operation. The task group will also include members of the ANC,  the NP [National Party], and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], as  well as community, business, and church leaders.    The plan includes the upgrading and provision of community  services and the support and protection of people of all  political persuasions who were forced to evacuate their homes  because of the violence. Urgent steps will also be taken to  restore clean administration and good government to the area.    The five-point plan was approved by the Transitional  Executive Council during its weekly sitting in Pretoria today.  President de Klerk said in a statement that the plan was aimed  at restoring stability and trust in the East Rand as soon as  possible. Urgent attention will also be given to health  conditions, the upgrading of hostels, and teaching in the area.</p>

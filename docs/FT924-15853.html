			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Kerry reaches for jugular: Bank of England and US Justice Department heavily criticised Auditors' lack of co-operation with committee condemned THE KERRY report is a mountainous document, bulging with allegations about BCCI's heinous crimes and the failings of its regulators and accountants. It pulls few punches in its criticism of the Bank of England, BCCI's auditors Price Waterhouse and its major shareholders Abu Dhabi, all of which will provide ammunition to the many people who have suffered at BCCI's hands. In the best tradition of congressional reports, it picks over its subject in meticulous detail and reaches for the jugular. Anyone sated with fraud can gorge on prostitution, terrorism, drug trafficking, bribery and death squads or ponder the complexities of the fraudster's mind as detailed in its 786 pages. But the real judgment that needs to be made is how much light Senator Kerry sheds on the chief questions behind this extraordinary affair. Although he draws useful lessons and proposes important legislative initiatives, the overall result is less satisfactory. There are few illuminating insights, which is disappointing for an investigation that had powers to subpoena evidence - although not surprising, perhaps, given the thick veil of secrecy that still surrounds key parts of the story. In seeking to answer the central question of how BCCI got away with massive fraud as long as it did, three points need to be addressed: When did Price Waterhouse first detect evidence of fraud? Should the bank regulators have shut it down earl-ier? How much did Abu Dhabi know? On the first of those, many of PW's early audits of BCCI dating from the early 1980s have been in the public domain for more than a year. They show that loans remained unserviced, clients disappeared, documents went missing. Yet it was not until 1990 that PW officially reported that some transactions were 'false or deceitful'. Like many people who have read these audits with the light of hindsight, Mr Kerry finds it hard to believe that they did not ring deafening alarm bells at PW. But the audits provide only a blurred picture of what was happening at PW, and whatever further evidence exists remains locked away in PW's safe, beyond the reach even of Mr Kerry's subpoenas. The result is that Mr Kerry seems unsure what to make of PW. He contends: 'There can be no question that the auditing process failed to work,' yet he grants that PW's auditors detected fraud and reported it to the Bank of England even though they were being obstructed at crucial turns by BCCI itself. In a pointed comment he says: 'Price Waterhouse wound up owing a duty principally to the people who were deceiving it.' Mr Kerry is clearer on the point of whether bank regulators could have acted sooner. The answer is yes. The Bank of England has always argued that it had only partial responsibility for BCCI because it was headquartered in Luxembourg. But in one of the few new documents to emerge from the report, Mr Kerry quotes from a 1985 Bank memo in which an official writes: 'After spending one week in BCCI I am absolutely certain that the real head office is located on six floors of 100 Leadenhall Street (in London).' The Kerry report is especially critical of the bank regulators' decision in early 1990 to discount evidence of fraud and accept a huge capital injection from Abu Dhabi to keep BCCI going. That amounts, he says, to the regulators and auditors becoming 'partners not in crime but in a cover-up'. However, the real issue here is whether the authorities were doing a service to the depositors by staving off a bank collapse and securing fresh capital from the major shareholder. The question of Abu Dhabi's involvement depends on whether you believe PW's assertion that BCCI management confessed their crimes to Abu Dhabi officials in early 1990. Abu Dhabi denies that, but Mr Kerry accepts it, although without apparently having acquired any corroborating evidence of his own. Until all the evidence does come out into the open, anyone trying to make sense of BCCI has to decide which of many conflicting versions to believe. Mr Kerry lays considerable store by Mr Masihur Rahman, BCCI's financial officer, who testified before his committee last year. Mr Rahman claimed to be totally ignorant of the frauds until the very end. That may be true. But if Mr Kerry suggests that PW was remiss in not spotting fraud sooner, consistency demands that he at least raise the same question about Mr Rahman. A note of frustration runs through the report, reflecting Mr Kerry's inability to nail the full story of BCCI. The Serious Fraud Office, the Bank of England, PW and Abu Dhabi come in for constant criticism for their alleged obstructiveness, and he calls for greater international co-op-eration. That is not just the reaction of a politically driven individual. US government agencies and congressional investigators have been ahead of their British counterparts throughout the BCCI affair, and have played a key role in publicising evidence that might otherwise have been buried by foreign banking laws and court procedures. The Kerry report will doubtless have its repercussions on Capitol Hill. But it still leaves crucial gaps which interested parties must now hope will be filled by the long-awaited Bingham Report in the UK.

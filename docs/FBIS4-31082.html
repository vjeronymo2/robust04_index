			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirjana Protic] </F>   [Text] The deputies of the former Depos [Democratic  Movement of Serbia] coalition in the Chamber of Citizens of the  Federal Assembly, led by Slobodan Rakitic, and former deputies  in the republican assembly and prominent deputies who are no  longer in the Serbian Renewal Movement, constitute the core of  the new Depos party. They have chosen this name because they  are obliged to do so according to electoral law. Speaking about  the policies of the new party at a news conference in the  federal assembly today, Slobodan Rakitic, stated that they are a  democratic party whose program is based on Christian  civilization. Stressing that the opposition has up to now been  mainly saying what it does not want, rather than what it does,  Rakitic said that the party supports everything that is good for  the Serbian people.    [Begin Rakitic recording] Morality, traditional values,  understanding, and tolerance that the Serbian people possess in  their collective being should be the main program tenets of the  reformed Depos. [end recording]    Presidency member Strahinja Kastratovic said that the time  of boisterous parties, yelling, and outbursts of hatred is over,  and that the new Depos favors a peaceful approach and  cooperation with all political parties. Kastratovic stressed in  particular that one should do everything possible to help the  stabilization program and that the party supports Avramovic's  program. The survival of the program is the precondition for the  stability of the parliament. According to Kastratovic, this  means that one should not insist on new elections but support  the efforts of the federal and republican governments.    Regarding Depos' stand on peace in Bosnia, Kastratovic said  that the interests of the Serbian people must be protected, as  must international relations, taking into account the interests  of the republic of Srpska and the republic of Serbian Krajina  while not endangering the interests of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Brundtland expects Yes vote Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, yesterday said she was confident of winning a Yes vote in a referendum next Monday on membership of the European Union, despite a continuing strong lead in the polls by opponents of the move. 'I don't look upon the polls as bleakly as some people do; there has been a tremendous change in recent weeks,' she said. Although the No camp continues to lead in the polls, the gap has narrowed significantly since Sweden voted to join the EU on November 13. Mrs Brundtland said she believed that many people would not make up their minds on the controversial issue until the last minute, as happened in the EU referendums in Finland and Sweden. She believes that the prospect of isolation facing Norwegians now that Finland and Sweden have decided to join the EU would be enough to make them understand what is at stake if Norway rejects membership for the second time. 'I don't believe in threats, but I do believe in appeals and responsibility and it's my conviction that it is best for Norway and its future and for Europe if Norway joins. I think one week is enough to get this point across,' she said.</p>

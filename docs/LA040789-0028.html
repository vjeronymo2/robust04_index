			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING / DAN STANTON: WEATHER POOR, BUT ANGLER SETS HALIBUT DERBY MARK WITH  45-POUNDER  </P> <P> Freakish weather plagued the Santa Monica Halibut Derby on Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> It was breezy, and swells curtailed full-day angling for most of the 1,800 who  participated in the charity event.  </P> <P> Mike Rogalla of Buena Park, fishing with his brother Wayne from their 22-foot  boat, caught a halibut that shattered all derby records.  </P> <P> Drifting close to shore off Torrance Beach, Rogalla, using a live anchovy for  bait, hooked the derby winner that weighed in at 45 pounds, 1 ounce. The catch  was good for a $1,200 prize.  </P> <P> Jim Goodwin of West Los Angeles finished second with his 29-pound, 8-ounce  catch.  </P> <P> At the Marina del Rey weight station, 415 of the fish caught in the derby were  big enough to qualify for the drawing of prizes at an April 15 banquet.  </P> <P> Anglers on Redondo Sportfishing's Sea Spray who qualified with catches longer  than 23 inches and weighing up to 10 pounds: Mike Baker of Torrance, Rick  Hawley of Redondo Beach, Hector Banuelos of Culver City, Tom Hopper of Venice  and Melody Franks of Hermosa Beach.  </P> <P> John Bourget, chairman of the derby, said proceeds will again be donated to the  Boys' Club of Santa Monica. Proceeds will also benefit the halibut hatchery.  </P> <P> Bourget said 250,000 halibut will soon be released from the King Harbor  hatchery.  </P> <P> Fishing in his sea skiff, Rick Beirold of Avalon was using 20-pound test line  with a live anchovy at the east end of Catalina Island near the kelp when he  hooked a white sea bass. Unable to boat the fighting fish, he called on  companion Bob Lee, who gaffed the 37-pound bass.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches:  </P> <P> Mo Mo Pac of West Los Angeles, fishing Santa Monica Bay aboard the Happyman,  caught the whopper of the week when he reeled in a 34-pound halibut. Pac was  not competing in the Santa Monica Halibut Derby.  </P> <P> Ron Bowman of Santa Monica, at Catalina Island aboard the Pronto, won the  jackpot with a 25-pound ling cod.  </P> <P> Sonney Mumy of Torrance won the jackpot on the Sea Spray with a 21-pound  halibut.  </P> <P> Sung Yu Lee of Torrance, fishing at Twin Roads aboard the Redondo Special,  caught a 20-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Fish Reports:  </P> <P> Fishing slowed over the weekend for party boats.  </P> <P> Catches improved Tuesday with bass and sculpin at local areas. Bonito at  Catalina rebounded, with anglers averaging three per rod.  </P> <P> At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Happyman fished Santa Monica Bay and  anglers caught 33 sculpin, 22 sand bass and five halibut.  </P> <P> The Spitfire fished the derby and the two-day count for the flatties was 25.  </P> <P> The Del Mar worked the derby and the count was 20 halibut.  </P> <P> The Betty O's crowd in the derby landed 20 halibut.  </P> <P> Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray tried Rocky Point, and anglers chalked up  125 sculpin, 18 sand bass and 12 halibut.  </P> <P> The Redondo Special on a half-day trip to Twin Roads chalked up 24 halibut,  eight sand bass and seven barracuda.  </P> <P> The Blackjack worked Hidden Reef and scored with 160 rock cod and one ling cod.  </P> <P> 22nd Street Landing: The Monte Carlo headed to Horseshoe Kelp on a half-day  trip and anglers sacked 42 calico bass, five sand bass and four sculpin.  </P> <P> The Freedom, fishing Catalina, returned with 250 bonito, 10 rockfish and five  calico bass.  </P> <P> L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Matt Walsh fished the Rockpile and found sculpin,  with 67 going into the sacks plus one sole.  </P> <P> Freshwater Notes:  </P> <P> Bob Marlin of San Pedro, fishing Lake Casitas, landed a 13 1/2-pound bass.  </P> <P> Duane Swann of Long Beach tried Santa Ana Lakes and landed a 11 3/4-pound  rainbow trout.  </P></p>

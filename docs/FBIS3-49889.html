This was particularly evident at promotional rallies of  presidential candidate Milan Martic, also attended by members of  the executive headquarters [not further specified], in the  Kordun-Banija towns and villages. Talks with academician  Mihajlo Markovic [Socialist Party of Serbia deputy in Serbia],  who answered the Krajina citizens direct questions, elicited  particular attention and approval.    [Begin Markovic recording] I think it is really disgraceful  that anyone living in the Krajina today can think and publicly  claim that there is a chance of Serbia betraying or selling out  the Krajina. I think that this absolutely out of the question;  after all, Serbia and the Serbian people have been exposed to  sanctions and threats of military intervention, and various  other modes of punishment, but they never for a moment relented,  nor will they ever relent in defense of all Serbian people.  [end recording]    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Minister, as presidential  candidate, can you tell us something about the fate of the pink  zones [UN Protected Areas], and, if you win, how you plan to  resolve the issue of the pink zones?    [Begin Martic recording] Not one of the leaderships so far  has ever accepted the pink zones. If you followed the news, you  know that we always rejected them. I have reiterated at least  100 times that I would not recognize the pink zones. I  recognize the Serbian ethnic area and all that is ours, all that  we hold, will be ours, they can call it whatever they like. At  one of the assembly's sessions in Vukovar, I demanded -- I do  not know if anyone of you here was part of the parliament at the  time -- that we abolish the pink zones, that the assembly reject  them. I was prevented from doing so by Milan Babic's  parliamentarians. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

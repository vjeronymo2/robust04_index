Rees] </F>   [Text] Virginia March 20 SAPA -- The African National  Congress [ANC] would give priority to its supporters when it  provides jobs after the April election, the ANC Women's League  president, Winnie Mandela, said on Sunday [20 March]. "We will  prioritise for our comrades. We are going to provide employment  for all of you, starting with the comrades who served in prison  for our cause."    Speaking to several thousand supporters from Meloding  township outside Virginia and neighbouring Mandela Park sqautter  camp, Mrs Mandela laid heavy emphasis on the ANC's aim to  provide houses. "I cannot believe the shacks I saw," she said,  launching a fierce attack on National Party housing policies and  its migrant labour system.    "It is these inhuman practices that compel us to remove the  De Klerk fascist regime."    Mrs Mandela said the ANC would build decent houses for  everybody. A better life was planned for all South Africans,  with priority for the victims of apartheid.    "We will provide you with jobs and education facilities, put  people back to work to create a growing economy, and will  provide services, health and education," she said.    Mrs Mandela said the lack of housing and services had  reached  crisis proportions, adding that the ANC's main aim was to focus  on the 7.5-million squatters and their filthy townships.    As at her people's forum meeting in Bloemfontein on  Saturday,  Mrs Mandela allowed only five questions from the crowd.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response, the Department notes that the Act requires DOE to consider,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this rulemaking, more stringent fluorescent ballast standards and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concomitant energy savings therefrom. The Department considered such programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as alternatives to standards in the Regulatory Impact Analysis found in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section V of today's notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Television Sets <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Classes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Natural Resources Defense Council, Rocky Mountain Institute, and Thomson commented on television set class delineations. The Natural Resources Defense Council stated that separate classes may be needed for stereo sound, remote control, and other features. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No 13 at 24). Also, the Rocky Mountain Institute stated that it might make sense to differentiate on the basis of features like remote control, electronic tuning, and stereo sound. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thomson stated that the large number of necessary variables or items  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to classify television receivers, including, for example, feature content  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and screen size, would greatly complicate any attempt to categorize television  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receivers in order to establish meaningful energy usage guidelines. Thomson  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also said that many customer-preferred performance qualities, such as high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> picture brightness and high-quality stereo sound consume correspondingly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher levels of power than television sets that do not exhibit those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualities. There are other desirable, if not necessary, features, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remote control and on-screen function displays, and federally mandated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> features, such as closed caption decoding, that may increase energy use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Thomson, No. 49 at 3, 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Electronic Industries Association stated that in 1989, 83 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> color television sets sold to dealers reportedly included a remote control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feature and that virtually all television sets use electronic tuning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 3, 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to these comments, the Department established one class for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> color television sets with electronic tuning and remote control. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes that the energy used to illuminate the screen is strongly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by screen size and, therefore, has proposed standards for television  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sets that are a function of screen size. Furthermore, DOE believes that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is no need to separate classes according to stereo sound because the sound is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not on during the efficiency test and therefore sound energy does not affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedure measurements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standard level analysis is based primarily on manufacturers' data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for 19/20 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; color television sets because recent manufacturer cost and energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use data for other screen sizes were very limited. The results of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, based on the 19/20 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; color television sets and the limited data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for other screen sizes ranging from 13.5 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; to 33 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;, were then used to derive the proposed standards as a function of screen size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Department did not consider standards for black and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> white television sets since their share of the market is rapidly decreasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and over 50 percent of those sold are designed for battery or battery-AC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation and are thus designed to minimize energy use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Design options <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Among the comments on television set design options, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rocky Mountain Institute proposed that DOE consider all reasonable options for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing standby power as well as operating power. One option would be to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require a clearly labeled switch that would give consumers the choice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turning the set to standby or completely off. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15 at 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy suggested that DOE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyze use of a step down transformer rather than a resistance circuit for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic tuning and new transformer materials with low core loss (amorphous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alloys). The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy also urged DOE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to look at television sets in other countries, particularly Germany.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3&hyph;4). The Natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resources Defense Council proposed that DOE consider power supply efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvement. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 38).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

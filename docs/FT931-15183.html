			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Technology: Ready for the fray - Andrew Baxter examines Siemens Automation's ambitious targets and its strategy for achieving them In 1990, the year of German reunification, Siemens Automation made its first move into east Germany by acquiring a company in Chemnitz (formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt) that was the eastern bloc's leading producer of numerical controls and drives for machine tools. It was an important, and symbolic move for a business based in Nuremberg, a city near the edge of former West Germany but now in the centre of the reunited country. The purchase may not have gone according to plan, due to the collapse of the eastern European machine tool market, but Europe's largest automation company has a broad enough back to weather a few mishaps. With worldwide sales of DM5.8bn (Pounds 2.4bn) in 1991-92, 20,000 employees and annual spending of DM1bn on research and development and capital investments, Siemens Automation has plenty of technology expertise. But Manfred von Raven, group president of Siemens Automation since October 1, knows that the division needs to exploit its strengths to the full if it is to achieve his ambitious targets. The Siemens division's products have been at the centre of manufacturing technology but still tend to be overlooked by observers of Germany's electronics and engineering giant. It is the world leader in programmable logic controls, the electronic boxes that get machines to do things - from washing cars to running a computer-integrated factory. It is Europe's biggest producer of computer numerical control units for machine tools, and makes a whole raft of other products for use either in manufacturing equipment or by the process industries. After five years of double-digit growth, sales have levelled off over the past two years because of the recession. Siemens does not disclose divisional profits, but the CNC business is losing money - although rather less than the heavy losses among some of its customers - and other sectors are also feeling the pinch. But the pivotal, if unacknowledged, role of Siemens' automation products in giving industry increased flexibility and productivity convinces von Raven that the pause in growth is only temporary. 'Our customers are not adding new or additional capacity,' he says, 'but I am quite sure that 90 per cent of the investments they are making are to increase productivity. In a recession you always talk about productivity and cutting costs.' Worldwide, von Raven sees the market for industrial electronics growing in real terms by 9 per cent a year until 1997. Annual growth will reach 7 per cent in the markets - worth DM95bn a year - where Siemens Automation operates. For a German company which until recently has rarely bared its soul in public, von Raven is refreshingly honest about the division's strengths, and where there is room for improvement if it is to exploit the market potential against a host of very different competitors in its product sectors. On the credit side, he sees big benefits from the company's common R&amp;D base. 'We try to do as much common spending as possible, and then build blocks on top for individual businesses. This enables us to give smaller businesses a chance.' One example is the Siematic controller for plastic injection moulding machines, only a DM50m operation and one that the division could not have entered without its R&amp;D base. He is also very happy with the division's ability to generate ideas. 'We have more ideas than money,' he laughs, 'but the real measure is to look at the number of patents we produce.' And Siemens, along with other German companies, is good at systems integration - finding a solution that requires more than one product. 'But we are not so good, relatively, at turning ideas into products,' he says. 'We can and should be better and quicker at this than we are today. Our internal discussions to build a consensus take too long. It has to do with our culture - we are a relatively liberal company and everybody has at least one vote or maybe even two - one in the morning and one in the evening.' For an automation business this is a tricky problem. Von Raven has to steer a balance between letting his engineers 'look into their neighbour's garden'  -an essential element of systems integration - and having them concentrate on their own area of expertise. Getting the balance wrong can lead to delays, and creates an 'over-engineered' product - something for which Siemens and other German engineering companies have often been criticised. The solution, von Raven suggests, is to cut development times dramatically by launching the product with, perhaps, 70 per cent of its intended features rather than waiting to achieve 100 per cent. The next model will achieve that, and will be all the better for the dialogue with customers generated by the original launch. Streamlining product development times is important in all product sectors but perhaps particularly so in CNC. The problem for Siemens here is that its core market of European machine tool customers is highly fragmented. Testing a new control system to ensure that so many customers like it takes a lot longer for Siemens than for its great rival in CNC and world market leader, Fanuc of Japan. And, says von Raven, the quantities it sells per customer are 10 times lower than Fanuc's, on average. Although many European machine tool makers, particularly in Germany, prefer to use European rather than Japanese controls if they can, the perception in the machine tool industry is that Siemens lost out to Fanuc on technology and marketing in the mid-1980s and has only recently bounced back. Even now, von Raven admits: 'Our image is lower than our performance.' A second important element in meeting the future growth targets is geographical expansion. In the current environment von Raven is keeping a careful eye on capital spending but, Chemnitz apart, he has no doubt where the division should go. 'A stool has to have three legs,' he says. 'Europe is the main one, North America is second (the division recently strengthened its position in the US by buying Texas Instruments' PLCs business) and I'm looking for Asia to provide the third.' This brings Siemens Automation up against the Japanese again - in their home market. But, as with all the new challenges for the division, von Raven is ready for the fray, and confident about the outcome.</p>

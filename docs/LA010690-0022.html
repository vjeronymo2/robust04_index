			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELUS LEAGUE;  </P> <P> NO. 1 MATER DEI SMOOTH AS GLASS WHILE BEATING ST. PAUL, 95-61  </P> <P> When your basketball team is 14-1 and ranked No. 1 in Orange County, it can be  tough to find faults.  </P> <P> But if you're Mater Dei High School Coach Gary McKnight, you just look  underneath your feet. His problem wasn't basketball players Friday night, but  the basketball court.  </P> <P> The basketball court at St. Paul High, where visiting Mater Dei beat the  Swordsmen, 95-61, is a slick, painted concrete surface as opposed to the  standard hardwood.  </P> <P> Instead of being able to enjoy watching his team cruise to an easy victory,  McKnight winced every time one of his players made a cut off a pick, and prayed  that nobody would dive for a loose ball.  </P> <P> "It's a Slip 'n Slide out there," McKnight said. "It's like a Boys Club court.  Someone needs to do something about that court before someone gets seriously  hurt."  </P> <P> The slick surface didn't bother McKnight's starting five, who built a 67-39  lead before McKnight cleared the bench in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Derek Stone, a 6-foot-8 center, led the Monarchs with 20 points, and swingman  David Boyle added 17.  </P> <P> Mater Dei point guard Jason Quinn had 13 points and seven assists, all in the  first half.  </P> <P> Andy Karich and Dan O'Neil had nine points apiece. Karich added eight rebounds  and eight assists.  </P> <P> The Monarchs also forced 23 turnovers.  </P> <P> St. Paul (3-9) cut the deficit by bombing from the outside in the second half,  but the long rebounds only served to feed Mater Dei's fast break.  </P> <P> "That's St. Paul's style," McKnight said. "They either shoot themselves into  the game or they shoot themselves out of it."  </P> <P> Edgar Diaz led St. Paul inside with 15 points, and sophomore guard Brandon  Ertle added 15.  </P> <P> St. Paul also got 10 points from reserve freshman Eric Gutierrez, who connected  on a pair of 25- footers in the first half.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 29 Apr (PL) -- The National Union of Cuban  Lawyers [UNJC] has demanded an end to the harassment in Miami of  Cuban-born lawyer Magda Montiel, who is being harassed because  she attended a meeting between the government and emigrants held  in Havana.    "To witness a crime in silence is to commit a crime," Jose  Peraza Chapeau, member of the National Executive Bureau of the  UNJC, told PRENSA LATINA. Peraza Chapeau was speaking on behalf  of lawyers, judges, district prosecutors, notary publics, legal  counselors, and other UNJC members.    We demand her (Madga Montiel's) protection and the  punishment, according to the law, of those who are violating her  rights, states the text of a statement made available by Peraza  Chapeau.    Montiel is being persecuted by groups of right-wing Cubans  opposed to any normalization of relations with the island since  she returned to Miami after attending "The Nation and the  Emigrants" conference held last weekend at the initiative of the  Cuban Foreign Ministry.    The anger of those groups opposed to any understanding with  the Cuban Government was unleashed after a video showing the  lawyer speaking with President Fidel Castro was shown on a Miami  television station. The Cuban leader hosted a reception last  Sunday for approximately 200 Cubans living in some 30 countries  who traveled to Havana.    In statements to a Cuban radio station, Montiel said she  felt  like a prisoner, persecuted, and was forced to ask for police  protection because of the endless number of anonymous  threatening telephone calls and bomb threats at her office and  her home.    In the UNJC's opinion, "U.S. authorities are obligated not  only to give Montiel protection but also to take strong actions  against the criminals who are threatening her, her children, and  other family members, because the crime of threatening someone's  life is covered in all modern legislation."    Likewise, the UNJC described as abnormal and highly unusual  the fact that Cuban emigrant groups can attack and intimidate a  U.S. citizen (although of Cuban origin) in her own country.  "They are trampling on a U.S. citizen's rights in U.S.  territory," Peraza Chapeau told PRENSA LATINA.    "Once again the concept of liberty is waved before us and  juxtaposed with the negation of the sacred right to have one's  own criteria and to fight for understanding and brotherhood  between persons of goodwill," the jurist concluded.</p>

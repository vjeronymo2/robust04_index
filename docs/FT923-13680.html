			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / MoD optimistic over EFA MR Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will meet his Italian and Spanish counterparts next Tuesday to discuss the future of the European Fighter Aircraft amid increasing optimism at the Ministry of Defence that the Pounds 20bn project can be saved. The talks coincide with intensified lobbying by the UK aerospace industry, which warned yesterday in a briefing paper that the collapse of the EFA - which is in its developmental phase - would have severe consequences on employment and the future competitiveness of the UK manufacturing industry. Italy and Spain have signalled that they wish to continue with the project, Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said in a Commons debate yesterday. The MoD is also pressing for the EFA project to continue - in spite of Germany's withdrawal from production and Treasury scepticism about the extra costs that may now be involved. At the London meeting, all three defence secretaries will discuss options for continuing the project within budget. Mr Aitken said discussions on the costs of the EFA had always been planned for early next year, when the development phase was near completion. 'We are now having these discussions a little earlier,' he said. On the cost side, Sir Barry Duxbury, director of the Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC), the UK industry's trade association, said yesterday that the aerospace industry was 'dismayed' by views attributed to the Treasury on its worries over the EFA costs. Those views indicated 'not only reluctance to acknowledge the UK's defence policy commitments and a lack of appreciation of the cost-effectiveness of EFA but also a large degree of navety on industrial matters'. He also warned that for many smaller companies involved in the EFA, cancellation might lead to the collapse of the companies themselves. The society argued that almost all the developing technologies that would feature in the future of both civil and military aerospace 'are part and parcel of the EFA development programme'. It claimed that the companies involved in the EFA had already produced substantial cost savings 'creating a unit price of less than Pounds 25m' per aircraft. Government risk had also been minimised 'by the most stringent contractual and performance agreements ever developed in the military aircraft field'.</p>

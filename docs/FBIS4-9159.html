			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Budapest (DDP/ADN) -- German Chancellor Helmut  Kohl has promised Hungary support in its efforts for full  membership of the European Union. Germany would accompany  Hungary on this path "with advice, but above all with actions,"  Kohl said at a news conference in Budapest today at the end of  his official visit to Hungary. Without Hungary, Europe is only a  torso and such a Europe is undesirable.    He will use Germany's EU presidency, which begins on 1 July,  to win support in the EU for Hungary's admission, as he has done  with Spain and Portugal, among others, the chancellor said. He  will moreover place on the table the "proposal, as yet not  popular in Europe" that Hungarian deputies should enter the  European parliament in an advisory capacity.    This is naturally above all help for self-help, said Kohl.  The key to EU membership lies with Hungary itself, which is  today a "notable example of stability in a difficult period of  transformation." The Budapest government is the only one in  Eastern Europe to last a full legislative period and can point  to considerable successes in spite of all its problems.    Germany supports the French proposal of reaching a joint  stance on the Bosnian issue, as well as President Yeltsin's  warning to the Serbs. The Russian president must also be  included in future developments.    Kohl spoke against the idea, voiced in Budapest recently by  Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber, of introducing partial  EU membership. The principle still holds that the chancellor is  the one who determines the main direction of policy, Kohl said  in response to a query. The best preparation for EU membership  is closer links between the community and those states that wish  to join. To this end "the terminology has to be sorted out,"  Kohl stressed. For example, Poland is not in eastern Europe, as  is so often said, but in central Europe.    Prime Minister Peter Boross indicated that Hungary will  shortly be approaching the UN in connection with possible  compensation for the losses it has incurred from the blockade  against Serbia. The close cooperation with Germany is an  important factor in involving his country in Europe's economic  system. He expressed the hope that with German help Hungary  will become a full EU member by the year 2000 or perhaps even  earlier. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> Que Viva Mexico! (Bravo Monday at 11 p.m.): This is a fascinating assemblage of  Sergei Eisenstein's aborted 1932 poetic epic of Mexican peasantry. (1:30)  </P> <P> The Best Years of Our Lives (TNT Thursday at 5 p.m.): The key to this enduring  William Wyler-Samuel Goldwyn postwar classic is that it touches upon timeless  themes of homecoming and family relationships and that its three very different  returning soldiers -- Fredric March, Harold Russell and Dana Andrews -- allow  for wide identification. (3:45)  </P> <P> Danton (A&amp;E early Sunday at 1 a.m.): Bleakly beautiful and richly detailed,  Andrzej Wajda's 1982 film is an electrifying depiction of a society hurtling  toward chaos. Gerard Depardieu is superb in the title role as the boisterous  and earthy revolutionary. (3:00)  </P></p>

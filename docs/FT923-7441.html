			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: JP Morgan crosses the great divide - The bank's rapid ascent on the corporate underwriting ladder It has taken almost 60 years, but JP Morgan is on its way to becoming a full-service commercial and investment bank again - a status it enjoyed before the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 forced US commercial banks to quit the securities business. After more than half a century as purely a commercial bank, Morgan is now the seventh largest underwriter of cor-porate debt and equity in the US after such powerful 'bulge-bracket' securities firms as Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. In the first six months of this year, Morgan has underwritten Dollars 5.2bn in securities offerings as either co or lead-manager, and it should soon exceed the Dollars 6.4bn it totalled in all of 1991. The bank has achieved its position in the underwriting rankings just three years after the Federal Reserve granted US commercial banks powers to trade and underwrite corporate bonds. But it was not until September 1990 that Morgan earned the special distinction of being the only bank allowed to trade and underwrite corporate equities. It is believed the Fed gave Morgan its equity powers back first because it was the most securely capitalised of big US banks. It had also lobbied hardest for a return to investment banking. Yet Morgan did not enjoy its unique position among US banks for long. In January 1991, the Fed approved the return of Bankers Trust to the equity markets. Since then, no other banks have been granted similar powers. But The Fed has imposed a limit on the two banks' activities - no more than 10 per cent of the revenues earned by their securities units must come from trading and underwriting corporate securities. The rest must come from government or agency business. Even accounting for the later start, Bankers Trust has not matched Morgan's rapid ascent up Wall Street's underwriting ladder. The only league table it has appeared in so far is junk bond underwritings, where it ranked 10th in the first half of this year with Dollars 425m of issues under its belt (Morgan was ninth with Dollars 550m). Analysts are not surprised that Morgan has made the bigger splash. Under the stewardship of its British chairman, Sir Dennis Weatherstone, it has been much more determined to build a presence in the securities business. Morgan prepared for a return to domestic debt and equity underwriting long before the Fed considered dismantling Glass-Steagall, preparations that Mr Tony Mayer, Morgan's head of worldwide corporate finance, said were started in 1979 when the bank got into the Eurobond business. 'We wanted to not only advise clients, but to execute for them through the entire capital structure,' said Mr Mayer. By 1984, Morgan was the leading US underwriter of Eurobonds, and a big player in the US government and agency securities markets. Its position proved the perfect launchpad when it entered the US corporate bond market in 1989. Morgan was also expanding into overseas equity markets, building its experience of securities underwriting and trading. It also had a well-developed derivatives business, a presence in the debt and equity private placements market, and extensive research capabilities. It also moved into the junk and convertibles markets, both of which operate much like equity markets. When Morgan was allowed to trade and underwrite US corporate stocks in 1990, the bank was fully prepared. 'It made no sense not to become an equity player in your home market,' said Mr Mayer. Analysts say Morgan has clearly made a serious effort to try to become a major equity underwriting firm. Mr Raphael Soifer of Brown Brothers Harriman in New York said: 'They have told people that they want to be back among the bulge-bracket underwriters before the end of the decade.' Morgan's long list of blue-chip clients is the weapon that Wall Street rivals fear most. 'Morgan's strategy has always been client and relationship driven - they are less concerned with the profitability of individual transactions or products, and more whether deals benefit client relationships,' said Mr Soifer. Morgan has been willing to underwrite the higher rated issuers, even at narrower spreads, to gain the distribution experience, and to forge the relationships with the big institutional investors. This aggressive approach is paying dividends. In the past year, Morgan has handled a host of important underwritings, including for Xerox, PepsiCo, McDonald's and Procter &amp; Gamble. It even completed its first lead-managed initial public offering (IPO), of paperboard and packing group Riverwood International. Its approach contrasts with that of Bankers Trust. Like Morgan, Bankers Trust says it was well prepared for the securities business after years of experience in areas including government fixed-income markets, private placements, commercial paper and Eurobonds. By the time the bank was allowed into equities in January last year, everything was in place, said Mr Howard Schneider, president of BT Securities. While not as active as Morgan has been, Bankers Trust has participated in several big equity underwritings in the past year, including Time Warner, Ford, and Burlington Industries. It has concentrated on the high-yield end of the market, an area that matches its client base, many of whom were leveraged buyouts (LBOs) the bank helped go private in the 1980s. Since it returned to bond underwriting, BT has been involved in more than Dollars 6bn of high-yield issues. Although the junk market has undergone a renaissance in the past year, Bankers Trust says it was fortunate to enter the market in 1990 when it was still in a big slump. 'It was a good time to get started if you had a long view,' said Mr Schneider. There was a shortage of liquidity in the market that Bankers Trust was willing to fill: 'Investors were desperate for any dealer to talk to.' For now, the bank will stay away from underwriting rated securities. 'The rated bond business has very narrow margins and a high level of competition, so we are approaching it carefully,' said Mr Schneider. As for equities, Bankers Trust is also treading cautiously. It has been involved in a few IPOs (again with former LBO companies it knows well), some equity syndicates and cross-border equity deals in emerging markets, but nothing like to the extent of Morgan. The two banks' presence in the securities underwriting business has raised questions about whether they have used their leverage on the bank lending side to win underwriting business from clients. There have been rumours about the banks leaning on corporate borrowers to award them underwriting business, but no facts to back them up. The bankers' response to such allegations is uncompromising. Mr Mayer of Morgan says: 'For one, it's nonsense. Two, it's illegal. And three, our clients would not put up with it.' Talk of such tactics serves little purpose. The chairman of one leading brokerage firm, however, offers a constructive answer to the conflicts of interest banks are rumoured to exploit, and to the familiar gripe from Wall Street that banks have an unfair advantage because they can borrow at cheaper rates from the Federal Reserve: 'Give us access to cheap money from the Fed, and allow securities houses into the banking business.' Glass-Steagall may be crumbling - and the granting of equity powers to Morgan and Bankers Trust blew the biggest hole in the Act since its introduction - but legislators are unlikely to go that far. Given the problems of US banks with loan businesses, and in light of Congressional opposition to allowing securities firms into banking, it seems JP Morgan and Bankers Trust will, for now at least, remain the only pioneers allowed to cross the great divide between commercial and full-service investment banking.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 UNDERWRITERS OF CORPORATE DEBT AND EQUITY IN US* January-June 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Manager                            Amount (Dollars m)        Issues  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Merrill Lynch                                  53,738           347 Goldman, Sachs                                 35,813           214 Lehman Brothers                                30,530           203 First Boston                                   24,167           135 Morgan Stanley                                 22,841           148 Salomon Brothers                               19,100            93 JP MORGAN                                       5,178            30 Bear, Stearns                                   5,016            49 Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette                     4,954            38 Kidder, Peabody                                 3,858            45  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Excludes issues of mortgage-backed securities and closed-end funds.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IDD Information Services  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

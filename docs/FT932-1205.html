			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: No-frills service from US fund manager FIDELITY Brokerage, a division of the US-based fund management company, has formed Europe's first cross-border institutional brokerage facility offering cut-price execution-only services to professional fund managers. The concept is already well entrenched in the US markets, where execution-only brokers have gained considerable market share from integrated securities firms which also make market and provide research. In the UK, where Fidelity's operation will be based, execution-only brokers for domestic transactions have declined sharply since deregulation in 1986. Mr Mark Collier, managing director of Fidelity Brokerage, said he expected the new service to spur the growth of cross-border investment, not only for European clients but for US institutions seeking direct access to European markets. 'We are simplifying cross-border investment. We are taking the mystique out of it,' he said. Fidelity said it believed competition in the European fund management industry would increase substantially, and that institutions would increasingly demand better execution services at lower commission rates to gain a competitive edge. And because of the trend towards quantitative management while large institutions were increasing their own in-house research capacity, their need for execution-only services was rising.</p>

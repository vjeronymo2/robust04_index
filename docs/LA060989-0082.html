			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Secretary of Veterans Affairs Edward J. Derwinski said some services to  veterans will continue to be curtailed until Congress passes a bogged-down bill  containing $1.2 billion for veterans' programs. The supplemental spending bill  has been passed by the Senate and House, but lawmakers have added amendments  for funds for a variety of unrelated projects. The measure must now go to a  House-Senate conference committee, which has not scheduled a meeting. In a May  26 directive, the department ordered a freeze on hiring of non-medical  personnel, a halt in purchases of new equipment and curtailment of treatment  for claimants with a specified amount of income who have non-service-related  disabilities.  </P></p>

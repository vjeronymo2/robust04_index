			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Krasnoshchekov] </F>   [Text] Strasbourg April 11 TASS -- NATO air strikes on  Bosnian Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be justified  at this point, Russian Federation Council Chairman Vladimir  Shumeyko said. Shumeyko is in Strasbourg as head of the Russian  delegation attending a session of the Council of Europe  Assembly. Shumeyko stressed that the U.N. decision allowing  NATO to decide on the use of force in the war zone remains in  effect. But the decision was adopted several months ago and the  situation has changed considerably since then, he said.    The latest actions cannot be justified by the need to  protect  civilians in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he continued. Additionally,  Russia's involvement in Bosnian settlement has brought certain  results and opened up ways for continuing the search for a  compromise satisfying all sides. He believes the United States  should not have openly shown support for one side, while  "punishing" another.    He stressed that from the military point of view the  effectiveness of air strikes is also in question. "As a result  of air strikes only one tank was destroyed, but civilians died.  No tank can be worth a human life," he said.    Shumeyko noted that the NATO actions cannot facilitate the  peace process. Time will show if they have not caused further  escalation of the conflict in the region, he concluded.</p>

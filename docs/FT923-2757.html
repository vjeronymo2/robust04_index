			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / BHP takes control of Foster's BHP, Australia's biggest company, is taking effective control of Foster's Brewing, the troubled Australian-based international brewer, in a deal worth about ADollars 1.5bn (Pounds 540m). BHP announced yesterday it was buying 32 per cent of Foster's, plus options, from the receivers of International Brewing Holdings (IBH), the private group controlled by Mr John Elliott, the former Foster's chief. BHP has also offered to buy a further 5 per cent of Foster's capital from Citibank, which has also placed part of IBH in receivership. BHP underlined its influence by placing its nominees in four out of the 12 seats on the Foster's board, following Monday's resignation of Mr Elliott and his associate, Mr Ken Biggins. BHP's move came as Foster's announced it had plunged to net losses of ADollars 950.8m for the year to June and a two-for-five rights issue to raise ADollars 1bn. The losses followed asset write-downs of ADollars 1.19bn which disguised a strong performance from the company's breweries, particularly in the UK. BHP's ascendancy at Foster's has been expected since June 2 when it sent receivers into the IBH group. Mr John Prescott, BHP managing director, said last night his company was comfortable with a long-term Foster's investment. BHP's exposure to Foster's stands at just under ADollars 2.5bn or just over 10 per cent of the brewer's total assets. The receivers of IBH had been attempting to find alternative buyers for the company's Foster's stake since mid-August after BHP made an offer for the parcel, worth ADollars 2.39 a share. That price, which involves debt forgiveness, equates to a cash price of about ADollars 2 a share. It is higher than the ADollars 1.10-a-share price on the Foster's scrip issue announced yesterday. The issue will be fully underwritten by Potter Warburg, the Australian investment bank. BHP says it will take up its entitlement and act as a sub-underwriter. Foster's shares fell 13 cents yesterday to a year low of ADollars 1.46 on the Australian stock exchanges. It said it expected dividends would total 6 cents a share out of profits earned in the year to June 30 1993. Results, Page 28</p>

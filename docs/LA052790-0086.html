			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESIRE IN L.A. BY MARTHA CLARE RONK  </P> <P> Pull away from the map of the mind sprawls  </P> <P> over the whole of city streets, L.A. extends  </P> <P> our own errands and where we have to get to, you  </P> <P> are far away, left at corners where one awning tears  </P> <P> in the once-a-year wind, where the wind blows  </P> <P> the trees as we stand over the open grave,  </P> <P> the one we love; planes taking off from the airport.  </P> <P> Waves turn to go out to sea,  </P> <P> a whole city expanding like the universe,  </P> <P> each drive up canyons, each centrifugal wind reaching  </P> <P> beyond what used to be the limits of a city  </P> <P> and none of us can stop  </P> <P> pushing beyond our time, our money, the need  </P> <P> for some outskirts of a city already wholly outskirts,  </P> <P> reaching for, like erotic desire, the nether parts.  </P> <P> Mannered fingers and necks elongate beyond themselves,  </P> <P> skin hurts drying in the wind,  </P> <P> and waiting to find transparent expansion  </P> <P> into the upper reaches of not even belief,  </P> <P> but craving our own unbelief  </P> <P> and that image of another's skirt  </P> <P> lifted by the warm, slightly soiled air of an open grate.  </P> <P> From "Desire in L.A.: Poems" (University of Georgia Press: $14.95;  0-8203-1175-8, cloth; $7.95; 0-8203-1176-6, paper; 90 pp.).

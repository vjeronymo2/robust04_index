			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- The bombardment by Bosnian Serbs  of civilian targets in Gorazde cannot be justified and goes  against the interests of the Serbs themselves and against the  interests of Russia, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  said today, speaking before journalists after talks with  international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.    At the same time, Russia's chief diplomat continued, it is  impossible to agree with the logic of increasing NATO air  strikes in so far as this would run the risk of an escalation.  It would be a mistake on the part of NATO and the Western  states to make a decision on the possibility of further military  escalation without at least simultaneously having a coordinated  political approach.    Now, more than ever before, Kozyrev emphasized, the time has  come for Russia, the United States, the United Nations, and the  European Union to work out a joint political stance before the  conflicting sides, so that they are left with no doubts  reagarding the need to come to an agreement instead of going  from one crisis to another. At the same time, the Serbian side  must understand that each step along the path of a comprehensive  cessation of hostilities will be accompanied by a corresponding  lifting of sanctions.</p>

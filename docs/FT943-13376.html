			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Merseyside body lifts performance The controversial Merseyside Development Corporation yesterday told MPs it had met or exceeded all government targets set for it in the year ended March 31. The targets are the main means of measuring performance among the 10 development corporations. The Liverpool-based corporation, which was set up in 1981 to regenerate Mersey docklands, has been under fire from the Commons public accounts committee over losses of nearly Pounds 700,000 on an opera concert staged to celebrate a tall ships regatta in 1992. The committee will report in the autumn. The corporation's annual report says it has reclaimed 47 acres of land in the last year, built nearly five miles of new roads and 402 houses, developed more than 750,000 sq ft of commercial floor space, secured 2,753 jobs and attracted Pounds 37m of private-sector investment. In addition it has also attracted 112 new companies into its mainly waterfront areas and has let more than 720,000 sq ft of space - 9 per cent up on 1992-93. Indirect investment in plant and equipment by private-sector companies rose 24 per cent to Pounds 43.2m. The opera concert was contracted to an independent company formed by the corporation's local public-relations consultant. No other tenders were asked for. When ticket sales failed to materialise, the corporation had to inject about Pounds 400,000 to save the concert. The company later collapsed, leaving creditors bearing most of the losses.</p>

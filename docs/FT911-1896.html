			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Environment warning THE TOURISM industry was warned yesterday that it must tackle the problem of 'tourist blight' on the environment if it was to survive and prosper, writes David Churchill. Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said: 'The glittering prospects that the tourism industry has will be tarnished unless it takes its responsibilities to the environment seriously.' He was speaking in London yesterday after publication of a working party's report on tourism and the environment. The party, which was drawn from all sides of the industry, urged greater contribution to schemes to help protect the environment from excessive numbers of tourists and developments. Consumers are suspicious that manufacturers are making environmental claims to push up prices, says a survey published yesterday by the Mintel research group.</p>

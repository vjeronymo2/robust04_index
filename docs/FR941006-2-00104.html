(``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex is proposing to amend Rule 179 to expand the categories of expiring equity securities as to which open orders are automatically cancelled prior to commencing ``next day'' and ``cash'' trading. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Amex Rule 179 provides time frames during which orders in expiring rights and warrants must be for ``next day'' delivery or for ``cash'' settlement, rather than for ``regular way'' five-day delivery. The rule was amended last year to provide for the automatic cancellation of open ``regular way'' and ``next day'' orders in expiring rights and warrants prior to commencing ``next day'' and ``cash'' trading in those securities. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The normal ticker notice provided by the Exchange with respect to expiring rights and warrants provides ample notice to members and member organizations regarding such cancellations, thereby given them the opportunity to replace their cancelled orders if they wish to do so. Substituted ``next day'' and ``cash'' orders are treated as new orders and are not entitled to retain the priority on the specialist's book of the cancelled ``regular way'' order. This amendment has resulted in a significant reduction in ``DKs''&sect; <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  and has facilitated accurate clearance and settlement in these securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32320 (May 17, 1993), 58 FR 30078 (May 25, 1993) (approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;92&hyph;31). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A ``DK'' is an uncompared securities transaction. For further discussion of Amex procedures regarding resolution of DKs,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amex Rule 731. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange is now proposing that Rule 179 be further amended to expand the categories of expiring securities as to which open orders are automatically cancelled prior to commencing ``next day'' and ``cash'' trading to include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> any  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> expiring equity security. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The amendment would be applicable, for example, to preferred stock, <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Contingent Value Rights, Stock Index Return Securities, Equity Linked Securities (``ELKS''), Yield Enhanced Equity Linked Debt Securities (``YEELDS'') and other similar securities. These securities would generally change to ``next day'' delivery and ``cash'' in accordance with the time frames applicable to rights. Thus, during the five business days preceding the final day for trading in such security, every order therein entered on a specialist's book must be for ``next day'' delivery, and, on final day for trading in such security, every order therein entered on the specialist's book must be for ``cash.'' However, when appropriate, the Exchange may establish different time frames for particular types of expiring equity securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex has clarified that the proposed rule change would apply to expiring securities that are not options and that are subject to the trading rules for equity securities, as opposed to debt securities.

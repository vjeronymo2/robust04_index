			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicability of the NSPS Regulation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The federal NSPS regulation for primary copper smelters applies to any such facility that commences construction or modification after October 16, 1974 (42 FR 37937, July 25, 1977 and 40 CFR 60.160). Modification generally means any physical or operational change which results in an increase in the emission rate to the atmosphere. NSPS require, among other things, control of the strong gas streams with a double contact acid plant (i.e., a stack gas of 650 ppm or less SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , based on a 6-hour average (EPA 450/3&hyph;83&hyph;018a)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Kennecott Magna smelter expansion/modification began in the early 1970s, with a commitment to the 1215-foot stack in 1973 and completion of the project in 1977. The modification of the acid plant system resulted in an increase from 60% sulfur capture to 86%, approximately a 65% reduction of sulfur emissions. Based on this information, EPA concluded that the 1970's Kennecott expansion/modification did not subject the smelter to NSPS requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Analyses on the 1986 Submittal.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Kennecott stack height analyses were undertaken to comply with the July 8, 1985 stack height regulation, as well as the condition specified in the approval of the Utah SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP. The reader should refer to the February 2, 1985 final conditional approval (50 FR 7056) and March 23, 1984 proposed approval (49 FR 10946)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  actions for additional information on the Utah SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kennecott originally had two 400-foot stacks (grandfathered stack heights) from which SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from the smelter were vented. The 1970's modification/expansion included the replacement of the 400-foot stacks with a single 1215-foot stack. The GEP formula height (H+1.5 L), considering the nearby buildings, is 212.5 feet. The federal regulation established the policy that sources faced with excessive concentrations, due to downwash, should be required to attempt to reduce those concentrations by reducing emissions to the degree feasible before seeking credit above the GEP formula. The benchmark for this requirement is the NSPS or the alternative level of control established through the application of BART if the NSPS is found to be infeasible. The demonstration that the NSPS is infeasible can be done through a fluid modeling analyses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The initial Kennecott GEP demonstration was submitted on May 2, 1986, with subsequent submittals on October 6, 1986, December 3, 1986, November 13, 1987, and May 11, 1988. There are two basic parts to the Kennecott analyses: the GEP demonstration and BART analysis. The GEP demonstration consists of three subparts: the fluid modeling protocol, the fluid modeling results, and an evaluation of the fluid modeling results with respect to the stack height regulations. The BART analysis is performed if the source contends that the NSPS emission limits are infeasible. Relevant factors for this analysis include: high cost-effectiveness ratio, excessive local community impact, excessive plant impact, and technological infeasibility. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

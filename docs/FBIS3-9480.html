[Vranjes] This morning Serb artillery attacked the  Muslim-controlled part of Novi Travnik. Fierce artillery  clashes between the Serb and the Muslim forces are still raging.  According to this town's people, the separation lines between  the HVO and the Muslim army are absolutely quiet.    Mostar is also quiet. Last night there were some isolated  provocations from infantry weapons in the town center. In  Uskoplje [Gornji Vakuf] Muslim and Croat representatives are  today discussing the further exchange of POW's in keeping with  the all-for-all principle. The exchange of POW's from central  Bosnia remains to be carried out.    Until the next elections the Croatian Democratic Union  [Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica] of Bosnia-Herzegovina is the  only legal representative of Croat interests in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croat National Council from Sarajevo or  any other minority group of Croat deputies has no right to act  on behalf of all Croat deputies and the entire Croat people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Bosnia-Herzegovina HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Community] said in its statement today.</p>

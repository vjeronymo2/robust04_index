			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 21 April TASS -- Tajik Labor and Employment  Minister Shukyrdzhon Zukhurov, who heads the Dushanbe  governmental delegation to the negotiations with the Tajik  opposition, said he was satisfied with the first round of talks.  He stressed that, despite different approaches to several  questions, the two sides had taken the first step towards a  political solution to the inter-Tajik national conflict.    Zukhurov told a press-conference on Thursday that the  difficult two-week negotiations had started 5 April in Moscow  upon the initiative of the United Nations and with the  participation of observers from several nearby republics,  including Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The two sides looked  at three groups of questions concerning the necessity of  bringing a halt to hostilities on the Tajik-Afghan border and  inside Tajikistan itself.    A protocol on the return of refugees and a general  communique  on the results of the first round were signed at the round's  finish. The head of the governmental delegation said that the  second round had been scheduled for approximately the end of May  and would be held in either Tehran or Islamabad.</p>

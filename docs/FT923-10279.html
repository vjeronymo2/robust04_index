			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Weak demand hits Sumitomo Chemical returns SUMITOMO Chemical, a leading Japanese chemical producer, reported a 61.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y9.1bn (Dollars 72.8m) in the first half-year to end-June, as the slowing of the Japanese economy undermined demand for industrial chemicals. Sales for the period fell 14 per cent to Y321.2bn, with sales of basic chemicals down 18 per cent, of aluminium 26 per cent, and of speciality chemicals 2 per cent lower. Demand for basic chemicals such as plastics and monomers has weakened in the Japanese car and domestic appliance industries, which have reduced output this year because of a rapid increase in inventories. Sales of aluminium products were weakened by the sharp fall in building starts during the first half. Domestic sales of specialty chemicals remained strong, but exports were bruised by the appreciation of the yen and the international recession. Sales of agricultural chemicals fell 4 per cent, with an increase in domestic sales of feed ingredients and public hygiene chemicals outweighed by a decrease in exports. Sumitomo had aimed for a pre-tax profit of Y15bn, but the weakening of the Japanese economy in recent months has forced most companies to revise their estimates. For the full year to end December, Sumitomo is forecasting sales of Y640bn, down 8.7 per cent, and a pre-tax profit of Y14bn, down 43 per cent, though even those forecasts may prove optimistic.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY: PASADENA SYUMPHONY KEYS UP FOR CONCERT SEASON.  </P> <P> Scene: Stage of the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, late in the evening of the first  rehearsal for the 1989 season of the Pasadena Symphony.  </P> <P> Cast: Men and women, casually dressed and sprawled on folding chairs. Maestro,  in a navy blue shirt hanging out of jeans, standing on a wooden platform.  </P> <P> Props: Violins, violas, cellos, French horns, trombones, trumpets, oboes,  English horns, bassoons, clarinets, assorted drums, etc.  </P> <P> Action! Maestro jumps, springs, bounces on his platform. He waves his arms  wildly. The instruments blend, creep, rise, crescendo. Midway, the Maestro  speaks.  </P> <P> Or rather, clucks. "Cluck, cluck, cluck" he calls, and then, "More bass drum.  Boomp, bomp, bomp, boomp." At one point, to demonstrate how long a note should  be held, he leans over, almost falling.  </P> <P> He asks the horns for more tongue. He sounds out what he wants with a throaty  noise somewhere between a 2-year-old's indigestion and a Bronx cheer.  </P> <P> He hops violently, waving, calling out critiques, asking musicians to play bars  over. Occasionally, a musician apologizes for a miscue. More often, they  whistle or call out jokes.  </P> <P> Is this any way to run a symphony?  </P> <P> "I'm working with the best musicians in the country," Jorge Mester replies. "We  can afford to be playful . . . You're playing music, after all. It's supposed  to be fun. I think a lot of people forget that."  </P> <P> Mester, 54, has been music director of the Pasadena Symphony for six years. He  recently signed a contract extending his directorship to 1993.  </P> <P> Besides his work in Pasadena, he is director of the Aspen Music Festival and  has been a guest conductor with orchestras all over the world. He has Hungarian  parents, was born in Mexico and attended a U.S. military prep school. Though  his wife moved to Switzerland three months ago, Mester has spent barely three  weeks there. His permanent home, he says, is United Airlines.  </P> <P> Reached in Basel before the symphony's second performance next Saturday, Mester  talked about the season ahead, which in honor of the French Bicentennial has a  distinctly Gallic flavor, and about working in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Pasadena is a lot of things. Rose Bowl, Rose Parade, Doo Dah parade. Craftsman  architecture, Greene brothers. Old Town, new money. Lake Avenue high rises,  slow-growth initiative. Little Old Lady From.  </P> <P> What it is not, is a major metropolis. But like a lot of small cities in  Southern California, it supports a symphony, something that some much larger  cities -- New Orleans, for instance, and Denver -- have not been able to do  consistently.  </P> <P> Major credit for that goes to Pasadena's location, in the entertainment capital  of the world. Although many large city symphonies struggle to pay the bills --  including living wages to musicians -- Southern California is swimming in  symphonies, chamber orchestras and other ensembles.  </P> <P> The result is that first-rate musicians, who can command top salaries in film  and television, can indulge their passion for classical music at symphonies  such as Pasadena's.  </P> <P> Principal horn James Thatcher, for instance, recorded for the films "Indiana  Jones," "The Natural" and "Star Trek." Concertmaster Paul Shure has been  concertmaster for the Hollywood Bowl. Trumpet player Burnette Dillon has played  with Della Reese and rock groups. Percussionist Dale Anderson has done "Ghost  Busters" and the background music for NBC Network News.  </P> <P> "I was having lunch with my first trumpet last Saturday," Mester said, "and he  told me (the Pasadena Symphony) is his only chance to play symphonic music. . .  . It means a lot to them. Very often it's the only classical music they play.  </P> <P> "This is the only place in the United States other than New York, and the only  place in the world other than New York and London, where you can do this."  </P> <P> Mester thinks of these virtuoso musicians when he is designing the Pasadena  season. He considers, too, his audience, which probably will want to hear a  familiar repertoire. "I realized that the place that the Pasadena Symphony  should be . . . was to present programs that were unique and would continue the  tradition of the Pasadena Symphony as an innovative force in Southern  California. It's important to figure out what musical diet the audience would  want to hear."  </P> <P> But besides the enjoyment, there must be new discoveries for the audience,  which is where the orchestra's preferences come in. As Mester says, "I have to  make sure they're going to have fun and be challenged.  </P> <P> "We have to have a good balance between things that the audience feels familiar  with and things that will stretch them a little bit."

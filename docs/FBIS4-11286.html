			<p>BFN     [Text] Alfredo Jordan Morales, Agriculture Minister and  Politburo member, has said that the achievement of full  integration of scientific centers is a priority, especially  concerning the tasks of making furrows.    At the national meeting on miscellaneous crops, the  agriculture minister said that the accomplishments and  experience achieved so far are rather dispersed. It was decided  at the meeting that the next planting campaign in the province  [not further identified] will be designed with the participation  of experts in the area.    Jordan presided over the creation of the 5 de Septiembre and  19 de Abril farms for miscellaneous crops in Jobabo Municipality  in Las Tunas.

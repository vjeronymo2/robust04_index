			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading Following the improved tone on Wall Street, stock index futures moved steadily upwards to recover around half of the previous session's savage losses, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract was 22 points higher at 2,996 at the official 4.10pm close, and in later trading it clawed its way back to the 3,000 level. At the official close the premium to the cash market was 11.6 points, with the fair value premium standing at 17.5 points. Traders described the upturn as a technical bounce but said trading contained a number of more positive points, notably a return of a limited amount of institutional business. One trader said there was 'good quality' buying at times during the session. Institutions have been absent from the stock index futures market for nearly two months. Trading volume was relatively low, however, with 12,154 contracts, compared to 17,815 on Wednesday. The December contract continues to track Wall Street. Reduced turnover was also a feature of traded options, with 39,117 lots dealt, against 46,199 a day earlier. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for 25,179 lots. Glaxo was the the most heavily traded individual stock option with 4,227 contracts. BP and British Airways were also active options.</p>

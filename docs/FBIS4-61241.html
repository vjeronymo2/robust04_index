			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Galina Grigorenko report: Russia's Choice Drops Anchor in </F> Tatarstan"]    [Text] An organizational meeting of the Kazan branch  of the Russia's Choice party was held on Thursday.    Affiliates of the most important political organizations of  the Russian Federation have begun to appear in the provinces  like mushrooms after a heavy rain, and not two days had elapsed  since the presentation of the regional branch of the PRES [Party  of Russian Unity and Accord] in Tatarstan, at which Sergey  Shakhray was present, before Russia's Choice speedily made its  presence known. True, Yegor Gaydar himself did not grace the  gathering of future Kazan party members with his presence. His  faction was represented by Valentin Mikhaylov. It is he and  Aleksandr Shtanin, his recent Power of the People Republic of  Tatarstan Supreme Soviet parliamentary group colleague, who are  the coordinators for the creation of the regional branch of the  Russia's Choice party.    It was expected that the most radical part of Kazan's  democratic movement would unite under the aegis of this party.  But few familiar faces were encountered. The elections to the  organizing committee were prompt, therefore. The 25 participants  in the meeting voted unanimously for the nominations of Georgiy  Semenov, lecturer at the Kazan State University, and Yevgeniy  Kozhevatov, Oleg Talanov, and Damir Galyautdinova, deputies of  the city soviet. The last of the above-mentioned had run in  December on the federal slate of Russia's Choice. It was he who  became chairman of the Kazan branch of Gaydar's party.    The draft program and rules were not discussed at the  meeting: The contents of the basic party documents have merely  been noted as yet. Revisions will not, most likely, be made to  the clauses that deal with the principal goals of Russia's  Choice. These are, in particular, "political support for and  protection of the rights, liberties, and safety of the citizens  and the formation of an effective market economy, civil society,  and democratic state based on the rule of law."    There are already, apparently, branches of the new party in  all districts of Kazan and in Bugulm, Almetyevsk, Bavly, and  Arsk. Today their representatives are to meet for a conference  to form a regional organization of Russia's Choice. Yesterday's  meeting delegated the emissaries to this party undertaking. The  self- nominees began their account of their career with the  words "I was never a member of the CPSU," which evoked the  audience's great approval. It is not hard, therefore, to  anticipate who will be a principal opponent of the Tatar branch  of Russia's Choice also.</p>

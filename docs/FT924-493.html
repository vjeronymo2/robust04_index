			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / International Company News: Finmeccanica details terms of incorporation FINMECCANICA, the holding company controlling the aerospace and high technology interests of Italy's IRI state holding group, yesterday revealed terms of its planned incorporation of its Ansaldo, Alenia and Elsag-Bailey subsidiaries. Shareholders in Alenia will be offered three Finmeccanica ordinary shares for every five currently held. Those in Elsag-Bailey will receive nine Finmeccanica ordinary shares for every five now held. Trading in the shares of all three companies has been suspended for the past two days pending the details. The project should allow substantial savings by eliminating some management levels, as well as creating major tax benefits. Bankers claimed it could also improve transparency. The share swap also covers Ansaldo, which is not quoted, but in which three Italian companies together own around 5 per cent. The Ansaldo shareholders will be offered three ordinary Finmeccanica shares for every five ordinary Ansaldo shares now held. The transaction, which requires approval from shareholders' meetings in February, will take place via a L184bn (Dollars 129m) capital increase by Finmeccanica. Minority shareholders not accepting the swap will be offered a cash alternative. Should all minorities agree, IRI's stake in Finmeccanica's ordinary shares will drop to 86.6 per cent from 96.4 per cent.</p>

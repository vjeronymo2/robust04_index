The fare ($199) includes lodging (based  on double occupancy). Tamarron is eight miles outside Durango in San Juan  National Forest.

Ask about "Colorado's Cool Off"  package.  </P> <P> Colorado Guide  </P> <P> Colorado is "my" state. I was born there, and fervently hope the developers  respect its beauty. I'm particularly devoted to the San Juans and the little  town of Ouray (the "Switzerland of America") and nearby Telluride.  </P> <P> To acquaint readers with the state's offerings, the Colorado Tourism Board has  produced a slick 144-page guide that divides Colorado into six regions.  Describes attractions, tours, resorts, accommodations, guest ranches. Provides  telephone numbers for dozens of chambers of commerce and resort associations.  Other pages devoted to fishing, national and state parks, wildlife, skiing,  ghost towns, balloon tours, Pikes Peak and the Garden of the Gods, the Air  Force Academy at Colorado Springs, the Continental Divide.  </P> <P> Free copies of this coffee-table guide from the Colorado Tourism Board, 1625  Broadway, Suite 1700, Denver, Colo. 80202, or call toll-free (800) 433-2656.  </P> <P> Discount Travel  </P> <P> A note from Thomas Joyce of Afterhours Travel (specialist in low-cost flights  to Europe) announces a $645 summer fare to London ("without the hassle of  advance-purchase restrictions").

One guest wrote that "crossing the threshold of the Cotswold House in  Chipping Campden is like stepping into a cocoon of tranquillity." An American  told proprietor Robert Greenstock: "Thank you for being faithful to your  brochure." The hotel was recently restored. Polished oak, fresh flowers,  original paintings, trompe l'oeil murals. Only 15 rooms with a brasserie that  serves meals, snacks, drinks. No two guest rooms alike. "Behind the imposing  doors of the Cotswold House is all that is best in hotel keeping," travelers  are told. Only 90 miles from London. A recent recipient of a commendation from  the British Tourist Authority.  </P> <P> The Cotswold House, Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire GL55 6AN, England. Rates:  35/45 double (room/breakfast), 52.95/62.95 (room/breakfast/dinner).  </P> <P> Discount Booklet  </P> <P> "How to Avoid the Phonies" is the theme of a booklet being distributed by the  Worldwide Discount Travel Club of Florida. Warns not to give credit-card  numbers over the telephone and to ask for detailed information. Provides  answers to the most frequently asked questions concerning discount trips. Says  it's necessary to read between the lines. Worldwide, with 6,000 members, has  been offering trips since 1982. (Not a travel agency, nor does it compete with  travel agents.) Worldwide is a clearinghouse that sells leftover space on  cruise ships, airlines, tours. Operates for the person who is prepared to leave  on short notice. Worldwide warns, though, that "some clubs take the customers'  money and give nothing in return, ripping off unsuspecting travelers."  Worldwide's booklet suggests precautions to avoid these unfortunate incidents.  </P> <P> Copies from Worldwide Discount Travel Club, 1674 Meridian Ave., Miami Beach,  Fla. 33139.

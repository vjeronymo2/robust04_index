			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Public is the beneficiary of local government review Sir, In response to your editorial, 'England's local shambles' (August 25), the two-tier structure of local government has not worked well in most of shire England in spite of good members and officers at both county and district councils. The public is confused, accountability is poor and services that ought to be integrated are split between two authorities. The public overwhelmingly contacts its local council yet its county council spends 70 per cent of the finance and is unavoidably remote, given its size. District councils know that the Local Government Review will lead to their abolition as well as that of their county council. In spite of this, most of them back a unitary system as long as it is kept local to the people they serve. For these reasons all three national political parties pledged to introduce unitary local government in their manifestos. It has happened in metropolitan England and is about to in Wales, Scotland and most of shire England. Geoffrey Filkin, secretary, Association of District Councils, 26 Chapter Street, London SW1P 4ND</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Focus on the Fed FOREIGN exchange dealers will keep a close eye on tomorrow's Federal Open Market Committee, in the belief that there could be a cut in the US discount rate, writes James Blitz. Last Friday's non-farm payroll figure for September came in slightly better than expected, with a monthly drop of 57,000. However, the underlying gloom about the US economy remains, and, in the view of Mr Gerard Lyons, Chief Economist at DKB International in London, there is a 'better than even' chance of the Fed easing the discount rate below 3 per cent. Late on Friday, US dealers seemed to be coming to this view as the dollar traded at around DM1.4075 against the D-Mark, after peaking at DM1.4360 shortly after the payroll report was released. The Bundesbank made clear last week that another cut in German short term rates was unlikely to materialise for several months, and a Fed cut would widen the differential between US and German short term rates, which is currently at 6.5 per cent. Otherwise, the market's focus is likely to be on sterling. The currency enters its third full week of free floating today and the experience thus far has been miserable. Last week, the currency fell 12.5 pfennigs against the D-Mark in the absence of a clear statement of economic policy from the UK government. In Mr Lyons' view, sterling is 'sick.' Dealers will be looking for some policy lead at the Conservative party conference in Brighton this week, but they are unlikely to get it. If there is no clear statement from the chancellor when he addresses conference on Wednesday or the Treasury Select Committee next Monday, the market will have to wait until the Mansion house speech on October 29.</p>

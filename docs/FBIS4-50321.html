			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- The fourth meeting of  the social and security affairs panel under the Preliminary  Working Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] ended in Beijing today.  The meeting mainly discussed issues such as preparatory work  regarding the design and issuance of the PRC's Hong Kong SAR  passports, as well as issues pertaining to Hong Kong's social  welfare, such as public housing and the retirement security  system.    While discussing the issuance of Hong Kong SAR passports,  PWC  members noted: This task is of great importance to ensuring the  freedom of entry and exit for Hong Kong residents, to  strengthening Hong Kong's economic relations and trade with  other countries and regions, and to maintaining Hong Kong's  status as an international financial center. The members  proposed: Hong Kong SAR passports should embody the spirit of  "one country, two systems," and they should be issued in strict  accordance with the Basic Law. To enable Hong Kong residents to  use SAR passports on 1 July 1997, we should make advance  preparations for the design, printing, and issuance of such  passports. The members added: Our government will take active  diplomatic actions with other countries and regions regarding  mutual visa exemption arrangements for SAR passports; this is  particularly important. They also noted: Besides SAR  passports, preparations should also be made regarding SAR travel  documents.    While discussing public housing policy that has a major  bearing on Hong Kong's welfare, the panel decided to set up a  public housing research group. To broadly canvass opinions in  all quarters, some public figures in Hong Kong will be invited  to serve as advisers to the research group. The panel also  discussed the retirement security system.    The meeting was held in Beijing 16-17 May.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Uncertainty about outlook for UK interest rates Sterling traded steadily yesterday, unaffected by the supplementary budget statement presented by the chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke, writes Philip Gawith. The new revenue measures announced were in line with expectations, and there was little market response. Sterling closed one pfennig firmer in London at DM2.4674, from DM2.4576. This upward move reflected Wednesday's 50 basis point rise in UK interest rates, and came before Mr Clarke's budgetary remarks. More interesting for the market was the appearance before the Treasury select committee of Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. His comments left the market confused about the outlook for interest rates. The dollar had a stronger day, moving from a morning low in Europe, of DM1.5677 to a high later of DM1.5793. It finished slightly firmer against the yen, at Y100.465, from Y100.15. In Germany the Bundesbank council, as expected, left all its main interest rates unchanged. The Swedish central bank also left rates unchanged, despite expectations of a monetary tightening following recent strong data. Mr George caused some confusion when he said he hoped that British interest rates would plateau 'fairly soon'. This appeared to contradict other parts of his testimony, which were seen as pointing towards a further rate rise in the first quarter. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said: 'People are very confused about what the peak is going to be in the interest rate cycle.' Mr Mike Gallagher, director of IDEA, the financial analysis service, said Mr George's comments 'held out that the top of the UK interest rate cycle was nearer than in previous situations.' While this was good for short sterling, 'it tends to sap the upside potential of sterling.' Mr George's comments were taken as a buy signal by short sterling traders, and the March contract finished up at 92.59 from 92.56. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said that with expectations of another rise in US rates having hardened, following recent comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, there was now little to choose between US and UK rates. The March eurodollars contract is discounting an interest rate of 7.25 per cent, compared to 7.41 for the equivalent short sterling contract. Mr Turner said the danger for sterling was that by the end of the month the market might be discounting higher interest rates in the US than in the UK. It was possible, therefore, that a by-product of pre-emptive interest rate rises in the UK might be a weaker pound, if this meant UK rates peaking at a lower level than in the past. Mr Robert Thomas, currency strategist at NatWest Markets, said the preparedness of the chancellor to go along with the Bank cast a very different complexion on UK monetary policy from in the past. In the short term, he said, this would be good for sterling. More immediately, he said, the outlook for sterling 'depends to what extent it pays attention to economic fundamentals, or to political chaos.' Although the dollar rose, the Orange County debacle in the US appears to be acting as a brake. Mr Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York, commented: 'There can only be one basis for linking the dollar to the county: People now believe, quite correctly, that the Fed is most unlikely to be tightening into this situation, on the grounds that other hard-pressed entities - both public and private - could get pushed over the edge after Orange.' Mr Gallagher said the dollar's failure to move higher was a disappointment. 'The impetus that drove the dollar higher seems to have petered out,' he said. He predicted a trading range, for the rest of the year, of DM1.5460 to DM1.595. He said there were definite signs of market activity slowing down, a little earlier than was normal. The Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 740m in its daily operations, after forecasting a Pounds 1.35bn shortage. It also provided Pounds 615m at the new, higher established rate of 6 1/8 per cent. Three month LIBOR firmed slightly to 6 15/32 per cent from 6 7/16 per cent.</p>

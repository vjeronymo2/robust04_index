			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Helsinki quivers after rise in interest rates - The Finnish bourse Helsinki may be small; it is certainly not dull. For the second year running, it has been Europe's top performing bourse; but the pace of Finland's recovery, attendant inflationary fears and their consequences prompted the market to trim its sails yesterday. The FT-Actuaries Finland index, taking this year so far, had risen by 23.2 per cent until Thursday; in dollar terms the rise was an even more spectacular 46.4 per cent, thanks to the strengthening markka. However, the Bank of Finland's increase in its tender rate yesterday from 5.01 to 5.50 per cent was the first indication that the Finnish interest rate cycle has turned, and the Hex index responded with a fall of 31.2, or 1.7 per cent, to 1,836.4. The earlier scenario was less straightforward than it looked. First, the market has actually fallen since the overheated few weeks at the start of the year, before US interest rates first went up. Second, a huge divide has developed between Nokia, Finland's booming telecommunications group, and the rest of the market. Exclude Nokia from the equation and the Helsinki bourse is slightly down on the year. Nokia, the world's second largest manufacturer of mobile phones, accounts for a staggering 27 per cent of Finland's total FM180bn market capitalisation. At the start of the year, it accounted for just 15 per cent. The company's share price has more than doubled this year on booming sales and surging profits. Since September 1992, the group's shares have risen 15-fold. By contrast, other segments of the market have fallen this year. Most surprising has been the slight decline in the forestry index. This has come at a time when all of Finland's quoted pulp and paper groups have reported excellent profits and when price rises in the sector have been higher than anticipated a year ago. Less surprisingly, banks and financials are down 20 per cent. This reflects the continuing losses being suffered by the leading banks and slow recovery from the country's 1992 financial crisis. Global bond market turbulence has weighed on the non-Nokia market. Corporate share issues and an increase in the pace of the Finnish privatisation programme have also soaked up liquidity. Finally, foreign investors, whose heavy buying of Finnish shares in the last two years has helped to drive prices up so sharply, have been locking in gains. Last month foreigners were net sellers of Finnish shares for the first time since September 1992. Foreigners have been attracted to the Finnish market by a combination of circumstances. The economy has made a strong recovery from its most severe recession between 1991 and 1993, when gross domestic product fell by 15 per cent. Restructuring, a weak currency, and an upturn in the international economy suddenly transformed the prospects of the big exporters and cyclical stocks which dominate the Finnish stock exchange. At the same time, interest rates have been standing at levels not seen in 30 years and restrictions on foreign ownership of Finnish shares have been relaxed. The consequence is that a stock market which has always been volatile because of its heavy cyclicals component could become even more volatile now that foreigners own as much as 30 per cent of it. If there was ever a big rush for the door, domestic investors would find it hard to absorb the load. Most analysts still believe the market remains good value, particularly on a European comparison. Shares are selling on a multiple of only 9-9.5 times next year's projected earnings. Mr Kim Lindstrom, managing director of UBF Fund Management, says: 'The market is too cheap. Never in Finnish economic history has there been such a rapid and dramatic corporate earnings recovery.' Mr Lindstrom expects the market to regain momentum in the New Year. Not only might foreigners be back in the market then, but money tied up in domestic fixed-term bank deposits is expected to be released for share purchases. He also believes that companies will be paying much bigger dividends than last year, partly because of strong profitability and also because of tax changes. 'Whereas the total corporate dividend payout for 1993 was FM1.4bn, for 1994 it could rise to between FM3bn and FM3.5bn,' says Mr Lindstrom. Finland's gross domestic product could grow by more than 6 per cent next year as recovery in the export sector spreads to the domestic economy. But there are concerns. Inflation fears are being fuelled by the annual wage tussle between industry and unions. In the pulp and paper sector, unions are seeking as much as 10 per cent and they have threatened a strike from next Friday if their demands are not met. There is also the continuing privatisation programme which could present the market with a digestion problem. An initial public offering from Neste, Finland's biggest industrial group by sales, is widely expected in the spring. The other worry is a continued strengthening of the markka. That might lift foreign investors' stock market returns but it will inevitably harm the competitiveness and earnings of Finland's big exporters.</p>

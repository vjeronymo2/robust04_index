			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MACLAINE HAILS KNEE SURGERY  </P> <P> Oscar-winning actress Shirley MacLaine says her recent knee operation probably  added 15 years to her dancing career.  </P> <P> "I had a video taken of the operation.  </P> <P> The doctor said it was the best movie I ever made," said MacLaine, who is in  town preparing for Tuesday's opening of a national performance tour.  </P> <P> The surgery to repair torn ligaments and a dislocated kneecap came after she  was hurt while rehearsing a dance number earlier this spring.  </P> <P> MacLaine, 56, says she lifted weights and exercised the knee underwater to  rebuild her strength.  </P> <P> "It was my first operation ever, and I could have seen it as a tragedy," she  said. "But it slowed me down to reflect, so I've almost finished another book.  I think it has given me another 15 years of dancing."  </P> <P> The veteran actress won best actress honors for the 1982 film "Terms of  Endearment."  </P> <P> The actress-singer-dancer and best-selling author has written several  metaphysical books, including "Out on a Limb" and "Dancing in Light."  </P> <P> Her next movie project is to play silent movie star Louise Brooks in a  biographical film.  </P></p>

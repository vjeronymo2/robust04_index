In an interview with a station  correspondent after buying state treasury bonds, Governor Zhu  Senlin said: Issuing national bonds is an important move taken  by the party Central Committee and the State Council to  alleviate the state's financial difficulties and to ensure the  development of key national construction projects and  undertakings. It has a direct bearing on the overall situation  of reform, development, and stability.

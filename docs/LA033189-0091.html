			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CD CORNER: BASEBALL HITS ON RHINO INCLUDE FOUR BONUSES  </P> <P> First base is temptation  </P> <P> You know that second base is sin  </P> <P> Third base is tribulation  </P> <P> If you pass, you can make it in.  </P> <P>  -- "The Ball Game," Sister Wynona Carr  </P> <P> Rock 'n' roll is becoming as much a part of baseball as peanuts and Cracker  Jack.  </P> <P> Countless ballparks and telecasts use baseball-related songs such as John  Fogerty's "Centerfield" and Bruce Springsteen's "Glory Days" to add to the  atmosphere between innings.  </P> <P> So why hasn't someone come up with an album of baseball songs?  </P> <P> Noticing the oversight, Richard Foos, president of Rhino Records, and James  Austin, the record label's associate artists and repertoire director, have put  together a collection of baseball songs and other nostalgic touches.  </P> <P> Working with Warner Fusselle, author of "Baseball: A Laughing Matter," the  Rhino pair discovered there probably have been more than 1,000 baseball  recordings -- from rock and soul to pop and rap.  </P> <P> In putting together "Baseball's Greatest Hits," Austin and Foos weren't able to  obtain the rights to everything they wanted (especially "Centerfield"), but  they did come up with such musical gems as Terry Cashman's "Willie, Mickey  &amp; the Duke," singer-songwriter Steve Goodman's sweet and sentimental "A  Dying Cub Fan's Last Request" and salutes to baseball greats Joe DiMaggio,  Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays. The latter two recordings (Teresa Brewer's "I  Love Mickey" from 1956 and the Treniers' "Say Hey" from 1954) even feature  cameo spots by the sluggers.  </P> <P> Among the non-musical classics: Abbott &amp; Costello's "Who's on First" comedy  routine, Lou Gehrig's 1939 farewell speech and manager Tommy Lasorda's X-rated  reaction when a reporter asks his opinion of Dave Kingman's three home-run  performance against the Dodgers.  </P> <P> In addition, there are two versions of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" (an  instrumental excerpt of a 1983 recording by Doc and Merle Watson, and a 1982  parody by Tom Chalkley in the style of Bruce Springsteen) and a 1909 recitation  by DeWolf Hopper of "Casey at the Bat."  </P> <P> While all these selections are among the 18 entries on the vinyl and cassette  copies of "Baseball's Greatest Hits," the CD copies contain four bonus tracks,  including what may be the album's real find: Sister Wynona Carr's "The Ball  Game."  </P> <P> A gospel singer once associated with Mahalia Jackson and the Wings Over Jordan  choir, Carr wrote and recorded "The Ball Game" in 1953 for Specialty, the Los  Angeles record company that was also home of Little Richard. The song was a  gospel hit in 1955, but most fans will be hearing it for the first time on the  album.  </P> <P> Encouraged by the media reaction to the album (talk show host Larry King  devoted an hour to it on his radio show this week and MTV plans to air four  videos of songs from the album on Monday, opening day of the major league  season), Austin is already thinking about a second volume.  </P> <P> "At first, we were talking about potential sales of 30,000 or maybe 50,000, but  I think it could go up to 100,000 by the end of the baseball season," Austin  said. "I'm dumbfounded. I knew there would be interest, but I never knew there  were so many baseball fanatics. We're now working on getting them into ballpark  concession stands."  </P> <P> Among the tracks Rhino hopes to feature in volume two of "Baseball's Greatest  Hits": Fogerty's "Centerfield" and "You've Got to Have Heart" from the musical  "Damn Yankees."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BUDGET REISSUES  </P> <P> *** "The Very Best of Jackie DeShannon" (EMI) -- Like Bobby Darin, DeShannon  has made sharp musical sidesteps over the years that left some of her fans  confused. Yet she is a gifted writer (her credits range from "Put a Little Love  in Your Heart" and "When You Walk in the Room," both included here, to "Bette  Davis Eyes") and an appealing singer (her rendition of "Needles and Pins"  conveyed the tension of a Phil Spector production). This compilation surveys  her '60s recordings for Liberty and Imperial.  </P> <P> ** 1/2 "Patti LaBelle" (Epic) -- Producer David Rubinson worked hard in  LaBelle's 1977 solo debut to keep the singer's melodramatic impulses in check.  Even the taut arrangements, however, couldn't always make up for the uneven  material.  </P> <P> *** 1/2 Little Milton's "If Walls Could Talk" (Chess) -- Another of the  celebrated artists to pass through Sam Phillips' Sun Records studio in Memphis,  Milton Campbell moves convincingly in this 1970 collection from blues (the  rowdy "I Play Dirty") to soul (the delicate "Baby, I Love You").  </P></p>

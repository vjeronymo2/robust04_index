			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Nordic No camp put on defensive The strong anti-European Union campaigns in Finland, Norway and Sweden have been put on the defensive by the decisive vote in Austria on Sunday in favour of EU membership. 'The result took them by surprise,' said Mr Arve Thorvik, leader of a group of former prominent anti-EU campaigners in Norway who now support entry. 'A No vote in Austria would definitely have had an impact, strengthening the No campaign here. But the two-thirds majority for the Yes side is a vitamin shot for us. It shows opinion can be turned around.' Although the No side trails in Finland, where a referendum will be held in October, in Sweden and Norway the Yes campaign has a long way to go to overturn EU opponents before both countries vote in November. By then, the Austrian result will be a distant memory. Mr Kristen Nygaard, leader of Norway's No to the EU organisation, admitted the Austrian result deprived his campaign of a boost. But he insisted: 'I don't believe that the referendum in Austria will have any effect on the Norwegian EU debate.' Ms Eva-Britt Svensson, co-leader of the Swedish 'No to the EU' campaign, said that in Austria the No side lacked a strong organisation, unlike in Sweden where her organisation acts as a national umbrella for a broad range of political opinion united by hostility to the EU. She also said extreme right-wing attempts to scare voters in Austria into voting against membership had alienated many people. In Iceland, meanwhile, Mr Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, foreign minister and Social Democratic party leader, said Reykjavik might apply for EU membership by the end of the year. Iceland has hitherto declined to seek EU membership because of reluctance to open its fishing grounds to Union fishermen.</p>

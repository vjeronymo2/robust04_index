			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Worries surface as Swatch marks time - SMH SMH, the Swiss watchmaking group best known for the Swatch, will receive journalists and investment analysts at its annual results presentations tomorrow in Berne. In contrast to the festive mood of the last two presentations - following profit rises of 32 and 64 per cent - tomorrow's affair is likely to be sober, possibly even quarrelsome. The SMH bearer share has lost a third of its value in the past year in response to unfavourable rumours and developments that have not yet been fully explained by the group's usually voluble chairman, Mr Nicolas Hayek. Fears that Swatch sales were stagnating appeared to be confirmed in February when the group announced flat sales for 1993 of SFr2.86bn (Pounds 1.4bn) and net income up only 7 per cent to SFr440m. Although SMH makes several other highly profitable brands, including Omega and Blancpain, Swatch provides the vital volume. Meanwhile, SMH's strategy of applying the Swatch brand name to other consumer products is looking a bit frayed. The withdrawal of the industrialist Mr Stephan Schmidheiny from the controlling shareholder pool has sharpened suspicions that Mr Hayek prefers to run the group single-handed. Many analysts wonder if he is putting in enough effort to secure the group's place in the post-Swatch mass market.</p>

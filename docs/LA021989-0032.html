			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S UNVEILS BUDGET PLAN  </P> <P> Nothing is so remarkable as Bush's behavior since he has taken office. In tone,  manner, attitude and even policy, his entire thrust has been a rebuke, if not a  repudiation of his predecessor. Most of all has been his call for a "kinder,  gentler nation" -- a bit of a tongue-twister and easy to poke fun at. Kinder,  gentler than what? Than the awful divisive and confrontational way it has been  for the past eight years.  </P> <P> If this is the real George Bush we are seeing (and I am disposed to think it  is, despite the mean-spirited, even vicious campaign he waged), then one can  only speculate as to the psychological implications of his apparently sitting  on these decent impulses all this time, while Ronald Reagan, in his own  guileless way, continually pandered to the base instincts of the American  electorate.  </P> <P> Extraordinary!  </P> <P> SY KASOFF  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Kellogg tackles Indian food habits Kellogg, the US cereals company, yesterday launched a campaign to change breakfast habits in India as its products appeared in Bombay shops. The company, which has built a Dollars 20m factory at Taloja, near Bombay, described the move as 'the largest venture that Kellogg has ever entered'. It first set up a liaison office in New Delhi in 1986, and under the government's liberalisation measures the company has since established a 100 per cent-owned subsidiary in India. Kellogg is targeting some 150m middle-class consumers in a country where breakfast traditionally consists of hot, savoury local food and where cereal breakfasts are virtually unknown. Kellogg executives said the company was committed to spending Dollars 60m over two years in India, and hoped to export to south-east Asian markets. Ingredients were being sourced locally, said Mrs Damidra Dias, Kellogg India's finance director, who added that the company had been involving farmers in Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The cereals will gradually be introduced to other cities and the range expanded.</p>

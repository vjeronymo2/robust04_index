			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Delay agreed in row over Jersey judge THE HOME OFFICE request for the resignation of one of Jersey's senior judges, Mr Vernon Tomes, has been temporarily set aside after a meeting on Thursday between Jersey politicians and Sir Clive Whitmore, representing the Privy Councillors. Mr Tomes, Jersey's deputy bailiff, was asked to resign after complaints from local advocates that he took too long to deliver reserved judgments, in some cases more than two years. Jersey, in the Channel Islands, is a self-governing UK Crown dependency. The home secretary is the Privy Councillor who has special responsibility for it. The island's judges are Crown appointments, as are its attorney general and lieutenant governor. Mr Tomes said the delays in delivering judgments were due to a work overload. The island's politicians feel they can resolve the issue internally, so a delegation was sent to London to try to get the resignation demand rescinded. Senator Dick Shenton, a senior member of the Jersey parliament, said Thursday's meeting in London had been most helpful. He added: 'We recommended the request for Mr Tomes' resignation should be deferred for six months. This would allow us time to sort out the work overload problem ourselves.' Sir Clive Whitmore set aside the original request temporarily and will put the proposal for a six-month deferment to the home secretary. Senator Shenton said: 'We look forward to our request being acceded to.' He does not expect to receive the home secretary's decision until after the UK elections. Members of the States, the Jersey parliament, are concerned that this matter has been misrepresented as a constitutional crisis. The constitution is not threatened and members feel they have a good working relationship with the Privy Council. Some States members refused to speak to London-based journalists yesterday because they were not sure the island's position would be correctly presented.</p>

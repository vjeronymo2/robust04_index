			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Kenya reaches Paris Club debt deal Kenya has rescheduled Dollars 500m (Pounds 333m) of debt arrears owed to the Paris Club of creditor governments, sources close to the negotiations said yesterday. It is the first time Kenya has renegotiated the terms of its Dollars 8bn external debt. The deal was hammered out in Paris last week. Its immediate effect will be to avert a looming balance of payments crisis, by spreading out the payment of arrears over seven years with one year's grace. Kenya began to fall behind on its debt servicing obligations when donor governments, irked by corruption and mismanagement, suspended balance of payments support in November 1991, worth about Dollars 40m a month. Last November the World Bank and donor governments agreed to renew assistance. The donor community pledged Dollars 850m in new aid to Kenya for 1994, in exchange for promises of further economic reform. Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the finance minister, promised to deal with abusers of public office. The rescheduling agreement will limit Kenya's debt servicing bill to some Dollars 240m in 1994, equal to about a quarter of its expected export earnings. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund are pleased with Kenya's economic turnaround in the past six months. Mr Mudavadi's tight monetary policy, and closure of scandal-tainted local banks, have tamed inflation from 100 per cent to an annualised rate of 15 per cent in the final quarter of 1993. Ivory Coast yesterday signed a letter of intent with the IMF paving the way for fresh funds to accompany devaluation of the CFA franc, Reuter reports from Abidjan. The structural adjustment facility is worth Dollars 470m over three years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- At a Western-Russian foreign ministers'  conference a general cease-fire should be agreed with the  Bosnian parties to the conflict, and the path for a political  solution should be cleared. This was proposed by Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev today after talks with his  German counterpart Klaus Kinkel. No date has yet been set for  the foreign ministers' conference. During his exchange of views  with Kinkel, Kozyrev stated that a military intervention should  only be the very last resort. The Serbs should know that there  is a limit that must not be exceeded. Kozyrev mentioned the  shelling of the hospital in Gorazde in this respect.</p>

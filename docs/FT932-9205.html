			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Treuhand concludes mines sale THE Treuhand, the agency responsible for privatising eastern German industry, yesterday concluded the sale of the region's potash mines in a contract giving it a 49 per cent stake in the new company. The contract will involve the Treuhand in a DM1bn (Dollars 620m) investment. However, the Treuhand will have an opt-out clause giving it the right to sell its stake after five years. The ministry of finance will decide in two weeks whether to validate the unusual sale. The contract involves selling Mitteldeutsche Kali to Kali &amp; Salz, which is 75 per cent owned by BASF, the German chemicals group. Kali &amp; Salz will hold 51 per cent in the new company, which will work towards reducing capacity and cutting the labour force in mines in eastern and western Germany. Kali &amp; Salz lost more than DM10m in 1991 on sales of DM1.4bn, while its eastern German counterpart recorded a loss of more than DM100m, on sales of less than DM1bn. The contract preserves Germany's monopoly over the potash industry in Europe, in spite of attempts to seek a foreign partner. However, the new company will reduce total potash capacity to about 3.1m tonnes a year in the whole of Germany, and cut the combined workforce from 11,000 to 7,000.</p>

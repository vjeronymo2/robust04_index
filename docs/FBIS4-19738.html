			<p>BFN     [Text] Journalists from ANSA, Italy's largest press agency,  began a three-day strike yesterday afternoon to protest against  the company's reorganization plan, which envisages a drastic cut  in the number of journalists. According to a document released  by the strike committee, the plan, apart from not providing  adequately for the company's reorganization and relaunch, also  carries serious repercussions for the quality of news items  produced.</p>

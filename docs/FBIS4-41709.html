			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk June 28 TASS -- Russian State Duma  speaker Ivan Rybkin said the disputed Kuril Islands claimed by  Japan should remain Russia and be granted special rights in  economic development.    "The Kurils are our Russian islands", Rybkin said on Tuesday  after visiting the picturesque Iturup Island. He quoted local  residents as telling him that "such beauty should not be lost".    Rybkin stressed that it is necessary to pay more attention  to  the development of the islands "especially in the current crisis  conditions in economy". He proposed to adopt a law on the  Kurils and Sakhalin which will "grant special rights to the  region mostly in economic issues". This would be for the  benefit of Russia in general, according to him.    The speaker also urged to pay more attention to the military  serving on the islands. He said the unit which he visited on  Iturup has only 21 per cent of the necessary personnel and faces  constant financial problems. "It is necessary to decide once and  for all that the units deployed on the islands should be manned  first and have priority in getting all the necessary supplies",  Rybkin said.    He welcomed the recent anti-poaching operation held near the  Kuril Islands as it ended the ambiguity to who the islands  belong. "This was not just a training for coast guards, but  protection of our economic interests", he said and added that "a  certain ambiguity regarding the Kuril Islands gives rise to a  desire of some countries to go and make a profit at the expense  of others (by fishing) actually in our internal waters".    Rybkin stressed that such actions are completely  inadmissible  in other countries.</p>

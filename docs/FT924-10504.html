			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lac de Gras diamond project forecast to have global impact THE LAC de Gras area in Canada's Northwest Territories will be developed into a diamond producer rivalling Botswana, the world's biggest producer of gem diamonds in value terms, according to the Credit Lyonnais Laing financial services group. The area - or camp - as a whole might have the potential to add 20 per cent to total world rough (uncut) diamonds production and one third to world gem diamonds output, says analyst Mr Roger Chaplin in a special study of the Lac de Gras phenomenon, which has seen 40,000 square km (16,000 square miles) staked in the biggest rush for land seen in North America. Mr Chaplin suggests that the first diamond-containing kimberlite pipe drilled in the area - called the Point Lake pipe - is 'giving world-class results and we estimate a value of approximately USDollars 2bn for this pipe alone. 'There are many more pipes to be found, some of which are likely to exceed the Point Lake pipe in size and grade,' he adds. The study estimates that the Point Lake pipe may have reserves of more than 105m carats of diamonds and says a conservative estimate of production would be about 3.5m carats a year, possibly expanding to 7m carats in time. 'These reserves would have a gross in-situ value of about USDollars 9bn and could generate revenues of at least Dollars 300m a year, growing to about Dollars 600m.' Mr Chaplin points out: 'This is equivalent to a gold mine producing 800,000 to 1.7m ounces of gold a year - but far more profitable. To put the size of the potential mine into perspective in the diamond industry, there are only five diamond mines in the world which produce at more than 3m carats a year and between them these major operations account for about 75 per cent of gem diamonds production.' He suggests that, although the share price of Dia Met Minerals, the Canadian company that discovered Point Lake and is now backed by Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest natural resources group, has risen by 2,000 per cent in the past year, if CLL assessment of the discovery is correct, it is still undervalued. Some other analysts are not so enthusiastic. Mr Rob Weinberg at the Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull financial services group points out that Dia Met's share price puts a value of Dollars 290m on its exploration properties, which is equivalent to 36 per cent of Australia's Argyle mine. 'We can't help feeling that that is somewhat excessive.' Argyle is producing about 33.6m carats of diamonds a year, of which about 1.7m are gem diamonds. Others point out that, although there are more than 3,000 known kimberlite deposits in the world, only 1,000 contain diamonds and only between 50 and 60 have ever proved economic.</p>

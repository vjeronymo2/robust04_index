			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): New homes built before your eyes Computer-aided design technology is coming to the aid of the growing number of people tempted by the challenging prospect of building their own homes. The self-build market is worth about Pounds 3bn a year in the UK alone, with about 23,000 homes self-built every year. Now Medina Gimson, which specialises in the design and manufacture of one-off timber frame packages for self-builders, is making the benefits of Cad technology directly accessible to its customers. Cad systems for house design have been available to the building industry for some years but the Medina initiative allows self-builders to sit alongside the designers and watch their home take shape on screen in a matter of hours. The system was unveiled yesterday at the National Self Build Homes Show at Alexandra Palace in London, which runs until Sunday. Medina Gimson: UK, 0732 770992.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>   [Text] Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov  believes the matter will not get to international sanctions  against North Korea. He made the statement on Thursday in an  interview with INTERFAX.    According to Panov, Russia's stand concerning the  possibility  of international sanctions is unchanged: Moscow stands for  political methods to be used first. If the talks between the  United States and North Korea have deadlocked, let's come to an  international multilateral consultations. If it fails, there  first should be a warning on the possible introduction of  sanctions, and only after that sanctions, said Panov.    He said that during the telephone talk on Wednesday between  Presidents of Russia and South Korea, Boris Yeltsin confirmed  the position, which was told to Kim Yong-sam during his recent  visit to Moscow. Panov believes the introduction of sanctions  now that North Korea began to show a more favorable attitude to  the Russian proposal on the convocation of an international  conference, would be illogical.    The diplomat said the interests for the conference was  growing since this is a realistic way out of the situation. Now  practically no one stands against the conference. The  differences are only in time limits, he said. Some people  believe the conference should be held after sanctions are  introduced against Pyongyang. But this is a strange approach.  What conference could we talk about after the sanctions are  introduced?    Panov believes that the initial stage of the conference  could  be held swiftly. First we should reach a consent in principle.  If so, it would be possible to come to agreement on what  conditions the conference will assemble. North Korea and the  United States, for example, could assume some commitments after  which experts would start working over the conference program  and procedure items, he said.    He said that the question on the conference venue had been  discussed. We believe the conference could gather in Geneva and  later pass in turns in Pyongyang and Seoul, he said.    According to Panov, Russia stands for the convocation of a  conference not because it is against the talks between the  United States and North Korea. We stand for the use of all  means. It is possible to use the Moscow-Pyongyang talks if it  is still possible, if it will really be fruitful. Now the  channel is blocked, said the diplomat.    According to him, Beijing believes otherwise and continues  staking on further talks between North Korea and the United  States. We do not rule out the importance of the channel. We  believe it works no longer, said Panov.    He said that no one confirms yet that North Korea has a  nuclear bomb. The International Atomic Energy Agency has not  yet concluded that North Korea created nuclear weapons.  According to the statement by the Agency it cannot guarantee  that North Korea did not take steps to develop Plutonium. This  is the essence of the problem, said Panov.    He said of principle for Russia is the preservation of the  nuclear weapons non-proliferation. It is outside our interests  that in the Far East, near Russian borders, there appeared  another nuclear power, said the diplomat.    To the question about the treaty between North Korea and the  former Soviet Union, of which Russia is the successor, Panov  said that now the treaty does not exist in full measure. The  treaty must change depending on the situation and circumstances.  Now we unilaterally interpret the first article of the treaty.  Now Moscow must not help North Korea under any circumstances,  he said.    The diplomat answered favorably to the question on the  possible unification of the two Koreas. This has always been a  single state and a single people. The unification is possible,  of course. It is quite another matter how things will pass and  how much time this will take. Much time, I believe, said Panov.</p>

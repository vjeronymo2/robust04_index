			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Kokorin, automated assembly line plant </F> economist: "`Either There Isn't Enough Money, or Else Not Enough  Sense . . .': Releasing Prices to Stimulate Production and Then  Cutting Production to Ease Inflation Is Insanity, not Economic  Policy, Says Plant Economist"]    [Text] The nonpayments crisis that has struck our  economy is a Russian variation on the overproduction and market  crisis characteristic for a market economy. Here, as in the  general case, insufficient income and demand from the majority  of the population lie at the base of the crisis. It was  inevitable that our production would get into a market crisis,  because the structure of our production was designed for a weak  differentiation in incomes. As soon as that differentiation  increased, as soon as the incomes of some increased and others  decreased accordingly, then it was immediately obvious that some  of output was not finding a market.    Large incomes are spent completely differently from small  ones. And when some found themselves unable to buy furniture,  clothing, and expensive foods, others found they needed real  estate, Mercedes, and even private account in a foreign bank.    Demand has dropped in the mass market and increased in the  elite market. If we had a closed economy, then the increase in  demand for elite goods would lead to an increase in their  production, thereby stimulating general economic growth. Imports  got in the way, though. The new bourgeoisie, naturally,  preferred higher quality foreign goods. On the other hand, the  mass market was swamped by imported consumer goods and food,  which exacerbated the market crisis for our own output that had  already broken out.    The majority now cannot buy imported goods to the extent  they  used to buy their own. The former are not cheap enough to  compensate for the population's declining purchasing power.  Partially for this reason, imported consumer goods and foods  enjoy a demand because the majority of the population has become  so poor. Who, say, would prefer imported oil to our own Vologda  oil if their income hadn't dropped?    It is not quality, however, but our poverty--this is mainly  what has made imported consumer goods and food competitive. We  are getting goods intended for third world countries, for  nations that don't sneer at them. In the first quarter of this  year alone, of the imported meat and sausage products inspected  by the State Trade Inspectorate, nearly 60 percent were  rejected, as were over 70 percent of the alcoholic beverages and  more than 40 percent of the tea and coffee.    A piquant situation has come about. The poverty of the  majority of the population has made it profitable to import  cheap goods that have no demand abroad because of their low  quality. The reverse is true as well: the huge incomes of a  minority have made it profitable to import goods that do not  enjoy great demand in the West, since they are too expensive.  Whereas our output has proved less than competitive on the mass  or the elite market.    The overproduction and market crisis is being aggravated by  the sharp cut in what are socially absolutely essential state  expenditures. The budget deficit is no testimony to the fact  that they are too great. Unlike years past, the budget deficit  today is the consequence of low state income. Not that long ago,  the state comprised a powerful military-industrial complex and  generously financed science and education, whereas today there  is no money for anything. Naturally, the social product has been  cut. But expenditures for defense, science, and education have  been cut even more. The only item that has increased is the cost  of maintaining the state apparatus. This latter, however,  comprises a relatively small portion of total expenditures and  do not affect the financial situation substantially.    The actual reasons for the budget deficit are well known:  the  loans to commercial banks at a negative interest rate, that is,  for all intents and purposes, subsidies. This is the transfer  into private hands of income from export-import operations; this  is uncollected taxes from merchants and, naturally, the export  of capital on an unprecedented scale.    The flourishing of trade and banking structures costs  society  dear. Maximally high taxes on producers does not help, and an  extremely harsh financial policy with respect to production is  not going to save the situation.    Financial policy in the sphere of turnover has turned out to  be too soft. If the public funds that now go into trade and  banking capital were to go into state income, we would now have  the healthiest budget in the world--that is how mightily the  country's population has been robbed in these years.    They are keep insisting on trying to convince us of the need  to live within our means. This is a rather banal truth. In fact,  however, we are being forced to live much worse than the funds  available would allow, to spend on defense, science, education,  and the rest much less than what society's cash resources make  possible and what is absolutely essential for the satisfaction  of society's needs.    The nonpayments crisis is going to continue to intensify  until the demand for output is cut both on the part of the  population and on the part of the state. This is what our  radical reformers ought to have in mind if they really do intend  to halt the decline in production. But are they aware of the  scale and complexity of the task?    A monopolized economy has a long hard time coming out of a  crisis. By way of illustration, one could cite the United  States. In 1929, a crisis broke out, but there was no  improvement until the very beginning of World War II. Whereas  our market has been deformed to a greater degree than during  America's Great Depression.    The government is preparing draft documentation for the  introduction of a bill of exchange circulation. This is what the  Finance Ministry sees as the final solution to the nonpayments  problem. But who, one might ask, is going to honor a bill of  exchange from our goods producers? The commercial banks?  Possibly. But only on condition that the Central Bank is  obligated to do a stock-taking of these bills of exchange. But  this means inflationary financing, the emission of money not  secured by goods. The bill of exchange is no salvation where the  final solvent demand is limited and dropping.    In order to overcome this overproduction and market crisis,  which is classic by its very nature, and which has been called  the nonpayments crisis here, it is essential first of all to  limit the differentiation in incomes, what is called in the West  an incomes policy.    Think of F. Roosevelt. In a message to Congress in June  1935,  he proposed introducing a progressive tax on major wealth and  corporate profits. Congress approved the bill. In the West,  people realized long ago that excessive concentration of wealth  at one pole and poverty at the other is the basis for economic  crisis as well as social conflict.    Meanwhile, in our country, not only is no sensible incomes  policy being carried out, on the contrary, here everything is  being done for the fantastic enrichment of a minority and  impoverishment of the majority. This does not exclude other  causes for the nonpayments crisis. The government is constantly  delaying the repayment of debts to agriculture and the fuel and  defense industries and violating budgetary discipline for  science, education, and culture. Meanwhile, all social and  economic expenditures are being ascribed to the necessity of  fighting inflation.    There is some logic in this behavior, of course. Our economy  does not have any natural, internal barriers to inflation. This  means inflation can be weakened only by relying on artificial  barriers, which in the final analysis will always come down to  saving money.    All this is correct, but unfortunately this is not an  instance when the end justifies the means. Actually, that's not  even so. What the government considers a goal (stable prices) in  actuality is only a means, whereas the government looks on the  actual goal (production) only as a means for stabilizing prices.  Everything is confused in the Oblonskiy house! Releasing prices  for the sake of stimulating production, and then cutting  production in order to ease inflation, is insanity, not economic  policy.    The problem is not at all a matter of preferring inflation  or  decline but in extricating ourselves from the idiotic situation  in which we have to choose between inflation and decline. This  requires the restoration of state control over prices. Under our  specific conditions, however, this kind of control will be  sufficiently effective only if control over the movement of  goods is established simultaneously. Right now we do not know,  generally speaking, at which line between a market economy and a  planned economy we will be able to halt the decline in  production. Nonetheless, we must act without delay. The  nonpayments crisis is entering its final stage, threatening to  paralyze all industry.</p>

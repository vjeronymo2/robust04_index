			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Chubb secures 64% advance CHUBB Security, which demerged from Racal Electronics last year, reported a 64 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 64.2m, helped by a sharp improvement in operating margins. Sales were almost flat at Pounds 674.4m (against Pounds 668.9m) despite rising crime rates, which the company says expands its market. Chubb's preliminary results complete a week in which Sir Ernest Harrison has been able to report strong performances from the three companies where he is chairman - Chubb, Racal Electronics and Vodafone. The fruits of a cost-saving exercise, were behind the improvement at Chubb, as promised when it demerged from Racal in response to a hostile bid from Williams Holdings. Earnings per share, before extraordinary items, rose from 6.93p to 13.28p and the group is to pay a final dividend of 3.25p, making a total of 4.75p. Had the group reported under the FRS 3 accounting standard, earnings per share would have risen from 1.97p to 12.47p, reflecting high closure costs, provisions and goodwill write-offs in the year to March 1992. Cash flow was strong, reducing net debt from Pounds 60m to Pounds 4.8m, helped by Pounds 15m stripped out of working capital. At the trading level electronic security produced profits of Pounds 39.2m from sales of Pounds 337.3m. Physical security, which includes the original safes and locks business, made Pounds 36.4m from sales of Pounds 337.1m. Margins improved from 7.6 per cent and 8.4 per cent respectively. Chubb made an exceptional charge of Pounds 7.82m, mainly for redundancy and reorganisation costs. Sir Ernest expected further exceptional items this year for rationalisation of manufacturing sites and the closure of some monitoring stations. The tax rate fell from 47 per cent to 38.6 per cent. Mr David Peacock, chief executive, said the group had built no assumptions of market growth into its growth forecasts. 'It is all a question of market penetration,' he said. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BILTMORE SITE ISSUE OKD FOR BALLOT  </P> <P> A petition calling for a vote on preserving Hermosa Beach's Biltmore site as  open space has enough signatures to qualify for the November ballot, the county  registrar-recorder's office confirmed Thursday.  </P> <P> The petition, which was circulated by community activist Parker Herriott, is  the latest in a series of ballot proposals aimed at determining use of the  city-owned parcel at 15th Street and The Strand. It has been vacant since the  Biltmore hotel was torn down about 20 years ago.  </P> <P> All of the past measures have been rejected by voters. Most city officials in  recent years have advocated selling the Biltmore site and using the revenue to  help overcome persistent budget shortages.  </P> <P> The new petition "gives people, for the first time, a chance to vote on open  space," said Herriott, an apartment building owner and actor. He collected  1,880 signatures and 1,445 were verified when checked against county records of  registered voters. To qualify, the petition needed 1,272 valid signatures.  </P> <P> The City Council, which recently appointed an 11-member citizens advisory  committee to study possible uses of the Biltmore site, has the option of  adopting Herriott's petition as an ordinance. Otherwise, the measure must be  placed on the November ballot.  </P></p>

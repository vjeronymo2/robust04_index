			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Letter: Squeezed out Sir, I recently attended a hearing of the US House of Representatives' Committee on Space Science and Technology, Subcommittee on Technology, Environment and Aviation. The subject of the hearing was the National Competitiveness Act of 1993. The orange juice that I bought in the cafeteria of the Rayburn House Office Building was a product of Brazil. Is there a message here? Jeannette Aspden, 443 Sked Street, Pennington, New Jersey 08534</p>

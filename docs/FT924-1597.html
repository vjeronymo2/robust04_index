			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Arts: Bar, Von Otter and Nathan - Song recitals Since the re-opening last month of the Wigmore Hall, London music has taken on the aspect of a semi-perpetual song-festival. The parade of fine song-recitalists (Price, Bonney, Hagegard, Mattila, Bartoli, Janowitz and so on) anxious to re-kindle their relationship with the 'teure Halle', alongside those youngsters fortunate enough to make their first appearance there, continues. May it never cease] A certain sentimental pleasure attaches to every concert here of Olaf Bar. A 1983 Wigmore debutant, youthful and unknown, he leapt directly thence to world fame. Unfortunately, the Bar story seems to have reached something of a dramatic crisis. Singing Mahler song-cycles at the Barbican recently, he disclosed a voice so alarmingly straitened in terms of tonal resource that one left the hall in a state of deepest anxiety and gloom. On Tuesday he gave his now-celebrated account of Die Winterreise with Geoffrey Parsons as piano partner. It did not provoke feelings of Barbican order: the smaller hall is, after all, uniquely encouraging and accommodating to the voice, and in place of a surging Mahlerian orchestra there was the Parsons piano support at its most acutely sympathetic, never egregiously assertive yet always aptly prominent in the narrative pattern. Bar's beautifully clear and poetic diction in his native language, his determination always to balance the various narrative, pictorial and emotional demands of the great cyclic unfolding, are qualities undimmed: his truthfulness as an artist still shines through. But as evidenced in this Winterreise, the state of the voice still raised a worrying number of questions. This is, after all, a man just short of his 35th birthday; the grey-ish, unresonant tone in soft mid-range phrases, stringy over-forcefulness of the loud and high, and regular slippings below pitch are simply not those of a young baritone coming into his prime. Neither are the stratagems to which he regularly resorted to cope with tricky phrase-shapes and intervals. One agonises over Bar not for Beckmesser-ish or canary-fancying reasons, indeed, but because his peculiarly precious artistry in Lieder is continually being let down by current vocal technique. A period of withdrawal for serious self-examination and vocal overhaul is urgently required, while there is still time for it to do good. On Saturday in the Wigmore, there was another house favourite, Anne Sofie von Otter, and another outing of the 'House Full' sign. This was the final song-recital in the 'Tender is the North' series, and the first half - two songs each of six minor Swedish composers - was a duty smoothly if not very grippingly accomplished. The Von Otter mezzo, that even, lustrous instrument, was covered by small patches of cloud (the top sounded tight and chancy); in Wolf she found her best simple, heartfelt form, but then did Britten's four Cabaret Songs as a comic turn, changing hats for each one. This singer's sheer efficiency is never less than astonishing, her linguistic expertise and ease in adapting to a wide range of musical styles always admirably thorough-going. On this occasion, however, the sense of personality responsively shaping words and music proved oddly fugitive. It made for strong, interesting contrast to attend, between these two international-class recitals, Monday's Purcell Room concert (promoted by the the Kirckman Society) by the young Irish soprano Regina Nathan. She had a big success as Susanna in the recent Glyndebourne Touring Figaro. In recital, even in a hall which lent her bright top notes an unkind edge, the grace, fullness and warm, steady beauty of her singing gave unfailing delight. She seems not fully awakened to the distinct, different demands of Schubert, Brahms and Wolf; consonants are sometimes softened into mush. But of her shining, elating promise there can be no doubt.</p>

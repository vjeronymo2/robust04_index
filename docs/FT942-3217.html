			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (19): Wider financial link-ups - Paul Quigley highlights benefits of smart card technology More than just a colourful piece of plastic, the smart card is set to transform the way in which users access and benefit from communications and value-added services. For this reason the possibilities for strategic alliances between the leading players in both telecommunications and banking are vast. Many of the big telecommunications carriers already offer cards of varying capability, based on magnetic strip technology or on account numbers which have to be keyed in. Banks, too, see smart cards as forming part of the process of 'disintermediation' of the financial sector, whereby customers' transactions will be handled by phone, both fixed and mobile. The new entrants into this arena are the digital cellular communications operators, who are poised to unveil innovative services in partnership with other industry sector providers. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and its sister technology, DCS 1800, are part of the new generation of digital cellular networks which use smart card technology as a fundamental part of the system architecture. GSM smart cards, or SIMs (Subscriber Identity Modules), provide authentication for the user to the network, and store vital personal information about the card holder. With older analogue cellular telephones, there was no direct association between the user and the telephone. The user was essentially anonymous, and the handset established its authenticity to the network. With GSM, a handset without a SIM is useless. When inserted into a slot in the handset, the SIM card logs on and transmits the user's encrypted identity ready for use. What makes these cards 'smart' is an intelligent microchip embedded in the plastic. The key technological breakthrough is in the integration of re-usable Eeprom (Electronically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) chips on to this single microcontroller. The chips used in GSM and DCS 1800 are based around the Hitachi H8310 chip, storing up to eight kilobytes of information. Data can be updated, and communicated with remotely and repeatedly after the card has been issued. This is fundamental to the power and flexibility of the SIM card. The chip makes possible the convergence of multiple services, functions and applications on to a single smart card. It is here that the telecommunications carriers, the financial institutions and the digital cellular operators see a significant marketing potential for the future. Thus, Mercury One-2-One the DCS 1800 personal communications network operator in the UK, in partnership with Barclaycard, has launched a service enabling subscribers who use Barclaycard to contact specific departments for various information and financial transactions. The SIM connects the subscriber to a number of services by offering the ability to select from a menu displayed on the handset screen. Though this move is not a full-blown manifestation of a multi-service smart card (the SIM card is still not a credit card in itself), it does represent a start. While the Mercury-Barclaycard initiative is primarily geared towards the management of personal finance, there are clear applications, too, for businesses users. Companies may be able to manage variable costs more effectively by direct payment of bills for sales force personnel or mobile staff. Another application being tested is the payment of tolls on roads. In Germany, GSM smart cards are being used in conjunction with road tolls in pilot trials to test the feasibility of payment for road usage. In a related smart card development, National Westminster Bank, Midland Bank and BT, have formed a joint venture consortium, Mondex UK, to exploit the capabilities of the smart card. The Mondex partners hope that bank notes and coins will be replaced by their smart card. The Mondex card is like an empty electronic purse which has the ability to download ie extract 'cash' in the form of an electronic data amount from the user's bank account, either down a permanent or mobile phone line or through a conventional ATM dispenser which is Mondex-compatible. Used in tandem with the Mondex card is the Mondex electronic wallet, a handheld device, similar in size and appearance to a pocket organiser, which manages the electronic cash transactions to and from the Mondex card. The user inserts the Mondex card into the Mondex wallet which transfers an electronic cash amount on to or off the card. The Mondex card uses the same H8310 family of microchips as is used in GSM smart cards so it will be possible to telebank by connecting a Mondex wallet with the card inserted to a GSM handset so the wallet and handset are effectively turned into a mobile ATM cash dispenser. It is conceivable that instead of a mobile subscriber paying for mobile phone calls by conventional means such as by cheque or direct debit, cellular operators will incorporate Mondex-type capabilities into their SIM cards as another method of paying for mobile telephone calls. Suitably equipped with Mondex card reading equipment, public payphones, retail stores, hotels and many other establishments can use this method of transaction as a substitute for cash. The benefit to commerce is the eradication of the security risks associated with handling and moving money; the benefits to users are manifold. Users will need to distinguish between the terms 'multi-service', 'multi-function', and 'multi-application'. One card may have many different functions but be used solely within one closed environment, while another card may operate in many environments but only perform one function. Between these two is a 'grey area' where a card may have links with different service providers offering the same service - or many different services. The commercial implications of these 'one-to-one, one-to- many, and many-to-many' permutations are complex and fraught with difficulties. Accountability is certain to be important, and the issues surrounding it have yet to be resolved.</p>

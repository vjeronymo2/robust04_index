			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Airtours buys more shares as largest Owners holder accepts AIRTOURS, the holiday company, yesterday continued to buy shares in Owners Abroad, the rival holiday company for which it is making a Pounds 294m offer ahead of next Tuesday's close. Airtours' shares rose 6p to 339p yesterday, allowing the company to buy shares in the market at up to 150p, and taking its total purchases in the last two days to 7.13 per cent of Owners. Airtours is allowed, under takeover rules, to buy in the market up to a price equal to the value of its paper offer, which at the close last night was 149.3p. It also emerged yesterday that Mercury Asset Management, Owners' largest shareholder, had accepted the Airtours offer. After purchases of 400,000 shares on Thursday at an average price of 141.5p, MAM holds a 15.04 per cent stake. The pivotal shareholder is now Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, which has been buying shares since the bid was launched and controls about 10.8 per cent. Phillips has not declared whether it will accept Airtours' offer which leaves the outcome of the bid finely balanced. City observers said yesterday that Thomas Cook, the travel agency, could still block Airtours' bid by buying shares in the market next week. Last Monday, Cook made a tender offer for 12.5 per cent of Owners' shares at 150p conditional on Airtours' bid failing. Instead of strengthening the Owners' case, the move was broadly greeted as irrelevant, particularly as Airtours' share price continued to climb. A purchase in the market by Cook would be doubly effective if the shares were bought from an Owners' shareholder that might have otherwise accepted the Airtours' offers. Airtours' brokers said last night that they were pleased with the purchases in the market, even though there had not been enough sellers at 150p to allow purchase of the 10 per cent stake it is allowed to buy under takeover rules. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said he was confident last night but added: 'This is a close run thing. Where would Owners' share price be without the bid? I am urging shareholders to accept now.'</p>

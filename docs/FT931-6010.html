			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Loan notes sale boosts Norex NOREX, the financial services group, made a Pounds 28.7m profit on the sale of loan notes in Global Marine, the American oil rig company. This boosted pre-tax profit from Pounds 2.26m to Pounds 28.1m for the six months to December 31 on turnover of Pounds 4.18m (Pounds 4.67m). Three years ago Norex America and its partners bought about Dollars 240m (Pounds 169m) of Global Marine's debt, becoming the main creditors after the rig builder emerged from Chapter 11. Norex America, in which the UK group has a 48 per cent stake, took Dollars 134m on to its own books, buying it at a 32 per cent discount to face value. Global Marine has bought back the outstanding debt at 96 per cent of face value. Norex America received Dollars 99m gross, of which Dollars 29m was used to repay bank loans. In the interim up to Dollars 8m a year has been earned on the difference between interest received on the loan notes and interest paid on the associated debt. Mr Kristian Siem, the Norwegian entrepreneur who is managing director of Norex and chairman of Norex America, said cash from the sale of a cruise business had been invested in the Global Marine loan notes. 'It so happened it was easier and cheaper to acquire the debt than to buy companies directly. The debt was never converted to equity and we are delighted with the dividends and the profit.' Norex America would look for further opportunities on the marine side, concentrating more on the financial angles than on actual operation. 'There is a role to play when banks are not lending and we are in a capital intensive business,' Mr Siem said. Results of Norex, announced yesterday, showed an operating profit of Pounds 855,000 (Pounds 4.84m). Insurance broking was ahead of expectations and losses were cut in the executive travel agency. After a minority charge of Pounds 17.7m, attributable profit stood at Pounds 10.4m. Earnings per share were 112.51p (4.95p) and again no interim dividend is declared. Norex is 42 per cent owned by a Bermuda-based trust with members of Mr Siem's family as its beneficiaries.</p>

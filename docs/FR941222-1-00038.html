			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The distance to the receptor wells near the municipal landfill used in the ground-water modeling were obtained from the survey of well distances conducted for the Background Document for EPACML: Finite Source Methodology (EPA, 1992). The value selected as representative of the average condition is the 50th-percentile value for well distance (438 m), and the value for the high-end (close) condition (48 m) is the 95th-percentile value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency used the MULTIMED groundwater model to simulate the subsurface dilution and attenuation of the leachate constituents in order to estimate the concentration of constituents at the hypothetical residential wells. The Agency then calculated risks to an individual, assuming the residents using this well on average consume 1.4 L/day of contaminated water, or 2 L/day for higher consumptions. Values of 9 or 30 years were used for the average and high-exposure duration estimates. The formulae used and a more detailed discussion of the application of these models to the waste samples can be found in the Risk Assessment for Dye and Pigment Waste Listing Determination, available in the RCRA public docket (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For on-site monofills, the leaching analysis was the same as for municipal landfills except that the waste concentrations are not diluted in the monofill.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The distance to the nearest receptor wells near the on-site landfill used in the ground-water modeling were obtained from a telephone survey of 9 city planning offices and a review of site visit reports and site maps. The value selected as representative of the average condition is the 50th-percentile value for well distance (163 m) and the value for the high-end (close) condition (16 m) is the closest value. The Risk Assessment for Dye and Pigment Waste Listing Determination for this rulemaking contains a more detailed discussion of these values. This document is available in the RCRA public docket (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to direct ingestion of contaminated drinking water, additional pathways were evaluated depending on the characteristics of the waste and management practices evaluated. These pathways included inhalation pathways from airborne particulates and volatiles released from the monofills, and indirect exposure pathways such as the ingestion of vegetables grown in soil contaminated by runoff from the on-site landfill and/or dermal exposure due to direct contact with contaminated soil. The algorithms used for the estimation of risks due to indirect exposures were taken from the Methodology for Assessing Health Risks Associated with Indirect Exposure to Combustion Emissions (U.S. EPA, 1990) as modified by the September 24 draft of Addendum: Methodology for Assessing Health Risks Associated with Indirect Exposure to Combustion Emissions. Working Group Recommendations (U.S. EPA, 1993) and the Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund (RAGS): Volume I_Human Health Evaluation Manual (Part B, Development of Risk-base Preliminary Remediation Goals) (U.S. EPA, 1991), and Dermal Exposure Assessment: Principles and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications. Interim Report (U.S. EPA 1992) for dermal exposures to water. These documents are available in the public docket for this rule (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The air pathways were evaluated using the CHEMDAT 7 air emission model to determine the emission rates for volatile constituents from the landfill, tanks, and storage bins. The Fugitive Dust Model (FDM) was used to determine the emission rates for particulates. These emissions were coupled with dispersion coefficients to determine the ambient air concentrations and the rate of deposition of the waste constituents onto the nearby soil, vegetable gardens, watersheds, and water bodies. The distances to air receptors are assumed to be similar to those used for the ground-water wells. The meteorologic locations used for the air modeling were selected by a procedure similar to that used to select the ground-water locations. The annual average wind speed, temperature, and precipitation values for 34 sites near dye and pigment facilities were evaluated to determine three sites believed to represent a range of conditions to be examined in greater detail. Hourly meteorological data for five years were ranked for these three sites to select the location and year of the data to be used in the air modeling. For the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average case, Huntington, West Virginia was selected. For the high-end case, Charlotte, North Carolina was selected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An on-site boiler (as the plausible management scenario) also was evaluated for exposure through the air pathway for still bottoms generated from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (K166), and for wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. The boiler was characterized as a small non-hazardous boiler based upon Agency information and industry-supplied data in the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data. The meteorologic data used to characterize the dispersion were determined based upon a distribution of meteorologic data collected for sites near existing dye facilities. These data are ranked by year and location, and the 50th- and 90th-percentile year and location were selected for the central and high-end dispersion modeling. The air dispersion was estimated using the COMPDEP model to estimate air concentrations and wet and dry deposition of the constituents on nearby soil, vegetables and water bodies. The air concentrations and deposition data also were used to evaluate indirect exposures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Wastewaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For wastewater streams (K163, K165, and wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments) the Agency determined that treatment in surface impoundments represents the plausible management scenario because, since surface impoundments currently are in use or planned at several dye facilities, and waste management practices in the dye and pigment industries are generally similar, the Agency believes that pigment manufacturers may employ surface impoundments in the future. In addition, facilities currently manufacturing dyes also could manufacture pigments in the future and manage wastewaters from pigment production in surface impoundments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The baseline management practice evaluated for these wastewater streams ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., K163, K165, and wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments) was treatment in tanks. Thus, for wastewaters, the modeling included direct and indirect exposures to volatile emissions from surface impoundments and tanks and direct and indirect exposures to contaminants that may leach into ground water from unlined surface impoundments. The air emissions from tanks were estimated using the CHEMDAT 7 air emission model and the dispersion of these emissions was estimated using the Industrial Source Complex Model-Long Term, Version 2 (ISCLT2) air dispersion model. The meteorologic locations used for estimating the emissions and dispersions were the same locations selected for use with air models for volatile emissions from landfills. Very few inhalation health-based levels are available for constituents found in dye and pigment wastewaters. Risk from direct inhalation exposure to wastes disposed in surface impoundments was estimated to be less than one-in-a-million for all constituents. Results from air emission modeling for tanks are presented in the Risk Assessment Background Document for the Proposed Rule in the RCRA Docket at EPA Headquarters (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the constituents in these wastes are highly soluble, leaching from unlined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impoundments was evaluated. The concentration of the constituents in the leachate was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed to be equal to the concentration in the wastewater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

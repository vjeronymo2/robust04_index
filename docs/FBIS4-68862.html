			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Chernyak, doctor of economic sciences, </F> professor: "Privatization or Collectivization?"]    [Text] It is impossible to find a single method of  privatization for all enterprises. As world experience  indicates, it is necessary to designate various groups of  enterprises and apply different methods to them. Everywhere that  privatization has occurred, a combination of forms took place.  State property is privatized through vouchers, redemption, and  auctions. In Ukraine it is planned to conduct privatization  principally (or even exclusively) with the certificate method.  Are we going our own way?    Privatization can be conducted by the direct method (for  cash  and credit resources) and with vouchers (coupons,  certificates)--free of charge, or at a low price (as in the  Czech Republic). It must be noted that privatization that is  free of charge is not such a simple and easy solution, as some  naively think. It accelerates privatization, but it produces  less significant results, for it does not attract additional  capital, it diffuses stocks, and it complicates the management  of property.    Large enterprises are privatized by means of vouchers.  Poland's experience indicates that the best method of  privatizing large enterprises is their transformation into  joint-stock companies and the sale of stock on the securities  market.    Small-scale privatization in the Czech Republic, Poland, and  Hungary was carried out through auctions of stores, restaurants,  dining halls, hotels, and workshops. It is fundamental that the  center initiated small-scale privatization, but it was  implemented by regional organs.    Public auctions were the main method of small-scale  privatization, and large-scale privatization--open conversion to  joint-stock companies. Those who want to buy propose  privatization projects. A competition of projects occurs, whose  criteria of evaluation are quality and availability of financial  support. Obviously, large-scale privatization in Ukraine without  large investment funds and foreign capital is unrealistic. On  the other hand, if privatized enterprises do not operate  successfully, then a crash of privatized funds is inevitable,  inasmuch as they will not be able to pay dividends.    As world practice shows, the privileges of a labor  collective  in the process of privatization are unsuitable. In the Czech  Republic no one received special privileges. The trade unions  demanded special rights for the labor collectives, and even  threatened to go on strike, but no privileges were given to  labor collectives. The only thing the workers received was  credit for the purchase of enterprises on condition of a  high-quality privatization project. The Ukrainian model of  privatization envisions privileges for the labor collective and  managers of enterprises. Are we again taking another path?    World privatization experience indicates that the redemption  of an enterprise by a labor collective is not feasible and  ineffective. It is not privatization "in the true sense of the  word." In Chile enterprises were privatized through redemption  by a labor collective, but they went bankrupt, and the state  bought them out and subsequently privatized them. In enterprises  that are redeemed by a collective, as a rule, innovations and  investments are lacking, and the predominant part of profits  goes to the wage fund... It is not difficult to forecast that if  we take the path of a transfer of enterprises to labor  collectives, the problem of bankruptcy and re-privatization will  inevitably arise.    Ukraine is implementing privatization by means of  pre-privatization measures; i.e., it is taking not a direct but  a roundabout path. Moreover, pre-privatization measures are  treated as privatization intentionally or through  misunderstanding. Commercialization, incorporation, leasing,  closed conversion to a joint-stock company, and redemption by a  labor collective are still not privatization but a complex of  pre-privatization measures. The stock of a closed joint-stock  company cannot be sold--it is not liquid. If there is no right  of ownership to a part of property--this means that there is no  private property. What is occurring in Ukraine is  collectivization, not privatization.    The opinion exists that the only possible and strictly  Ukrainian path of privatization is leasing. What can be said in  this regard? Leasing property is not excluded, but it should be  associated with a search for investors. In our country, leasing  hampers privatization. Leasing is destatization in the framework  of state property, and it can only be discussed within the  framework of pre-privatization measures. The lease contract  expires the day of full privatization. The privileges of the  leasing collective consist only in the fact that it knows its  enterprise well and that it can propose the kind of  privatization project that will win in a competition.    In many countries a serious problem of privatization  crediting exists. Credits for those who desire to take part in  privatization are extended by commercial banks. Without a bank  reference, it is impossible to take part in an auction or  competition of projects. In the Czech Republic, 10 percent (40  billion krona) of the total sum of credit resources of the  country were allocated under privatization. Ukraine does not  have any real credit resources, and its most severe problem is  lack of capital. In this connection, the creation and  development of a credit resources market and a securities market  is of vitally important significance.    In the process of privatization, the search for a real  property owner and a strategic investor who proposes a strategic  plan for development of an enterprise and finances is of  decisive significance. Investment banks, funds and companies,  insurance funds, joint-stock companies, and physical persons  perform the role of such an investor. A majority of enterprises  of Ukraine are not competitively capable, in connection with  which it is necessary to make capital investments. A strong  investor is needed who will invest resources and improve the  financial situation. In our country commercial banks most of all  could be such investors.    It must be clearly realized: Without a resolution of the  question of the strategic investor, privatization in Ukraine  will be reduced to collectivization.</p>

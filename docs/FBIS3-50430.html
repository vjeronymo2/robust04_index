			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Romulo Matamoros from "The Morning Paper" </F> newscast]    [Text] Through Lieutenant Colonel Napoleon Santos Aguilar,  Armed Forces public relations director, the Honduran Armed  Forces has commented on the report issued by Human Rights  Ombudsman Leo Valladares Lanza. Regarding the recommendation  that the files on people arrested by the Honduran Armed Forces  be opened, he said:    [Begin recording] [Santos] I am going to tell you something:  Leo Valladares never said that. Valladares said that at one  point he requested some information that definitely reached him  a little late. That is what I understand.    [Unidentified reporter] But when he says he would rather  have  you provide this information, this tacitly means that you did  not want to give the information to him.    [Santos] Look, there was an exchange of some letters. I  understand that his letters were answered by Colonel [Herbert]  Munguia and by the general auditor of the Armed Forces. Some  information was provided to Leo Valladares by the chief of the  Armed Forces. [end recording]    The public relations director was asked whether the Armed  Forces are willing to provide information regarding the possible  participation of Armed Forces members in cases of missing  persons.    [Begin Santos recording] Look, there is something basic in  all of this. We definitely understand and acknowledge the work  of Leo Valladares. If there have been some misunderstandings, I  think it has been strictly due to a lack of communication.    I understand this is a report that was presented to the  Honduran president by the human rights ombudsman. Valladares  has compiled a large amount of information, and he requested  that legal steps be continued to once and for all resolve the  problem of missing persons. We, the Armed Forces, are waiting  to see the report. I think it would be hasty on my part to give  you an official opinion on the report because I know that you  are just now reporting on it.    We are obviously part of this country's Executive Branch,  and  legal channels must be followed. We will wait and see what the  courts will do, because they are the appropriate institutions to  deal with this. [end recording]    Santos Aguilar justified the current Armed Forces chief's  absence from the country. He left yesterday before this report  was presented. In the report, he was mentioned as head of  Battalion 3-16 in 1984.    [Begin recording] [Santos] Like I said, if General Discua is  not in the country, well... [pauses] As members of the  military, we divide our activities into two groups to avoid  neglecting our responsibilities in the country. I understand  that the commander in chief was here up until yesterday, which  was the day when the individuals who were to take over today  reported for duty.    At this time, General Andino, chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of  Staff, is acting as head of the military institution.    On another topic, I heard Leo Valladares' recommendation on  the appointments of some officers. You can be sure that  whenever any individual is summoned by the courts, the Armed  Forces will have nothing to hide.    [Reporter] When you say the Armed Forces are under the  Executive Branch, does this mean that the next administration  will have to decide whether those who led these battalions are  responsible for the cases of missing people?    [Santos] No, I am not saying that. I am speaking about  strictly legal aspects. The Armed Forces are part of the  country's Executive Branch and appropriate channels exist  through the president for specific situations.    [Reporter] As members of the Armed Forces, how willing are  you to turn over to the courts individuals who are linked to the  cases of missing persons?    [Santos] Let us wait and see what the courts of justice say  in this regard. [end recording]</p>

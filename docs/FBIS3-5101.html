"I deeply regret the reinstatement of this clause that has  retaliation as a precondition," said Yutaka Kume, chairman of  the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.    Japan's auto industry has been under mounting pressure from  the United States to boost purchases of U.S. Auto parts to help  reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced Thursday  that Clinton had signed an executive order reviving the super  301 clause which authorizes him to identify what Washington  regards as unfair trade practices subject to retaliation.    "Unilateral retaliation runs counter to the spirit of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)," said an official  at a major Japanese automaker.    "It's wrong to use the method of linking a macroeconomic  issue like the (U.S. trade) deficit to a microeconomic issue  (like auto trade)," he said.    Some business people said it remains uncertain whether the  U.S. will actually take sanctions against Japan.    "I wonder if it is possible (for the U.S.) to do it because  U.S. consumers will be the victims of import restrictions on  autos," said an executive at one major automaker.    But some others pointed to the need for Tokyo to take  measures to rectify the bilateral trade imbalance, saying Japan  has been slow in taking action on the issue.    "The government should go ahead with macroeconomic measures  to address the trade surplus by boosting domestic demand and  recycling the surplus," NEC Corp. President Tadahiro Sekimoto  said.</p>

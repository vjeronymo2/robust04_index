Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the information collection requirements included in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 29, 1990, the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (INA or Act) was amended by the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 101&hyph;649, 104 Stat. 4978. On December 12, 1991, the INA was further amended by the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA), Public Law 102&hyph;232, 105 Stat. 1733. These amendments assign responsibility to the Department of Labor (Department or DOL) for the implementation of several provisions of the Act relating to the entry of certain categories of employment-based immigrants, and to the entry and temporary employment of certain categories of nonimmigrants. One of the major provisions of the Act governs the entry temporarily of foreign ``professionals'' to work in ``specialty occupations'' in the U.S. under H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant status. 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 1182(n), and 1184(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) will approve H&hyph;1B status for a foreign worker, the employer which intends to employ the alien, must have on file with the Department's Employment and Training Administration a Labor Condition Application for H&hyph;1B Nonimmigrants (LCA), Form ETA 9035. Pursuant to the Interim Final Rule, in filling out the LCA, an employer must specifically indicate, among other things, the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's job title, the number of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) sought, the rate of pay to be paid the nonimmigrant(s), the nonimmigrant's anticipated period of employment, and the location where the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) will work. Additionally, the employer attests to four statements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. H&hyph;1b nonimmigrants will be paid at least the actual wage level paid by the employer to all other individuals with similar experience and qualifications for the specific employment in question or the prevailing wage level for the occupation in the area of employment, whichever is higher; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants will not adversely affect the working conditions of workers similarly employed in the area of employment; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On the date the application is signed or submitted, there is not a strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the course of a labor dispute in the occupation in which H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants will be employed at the place of employment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. As of this date, notice of this application has been provided to workers employed in the occupations in which H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants will be employed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The H&hyph;1B category of specialty occupations consists of those occupations which require the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree (or its equivalent) in the specific specialty as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the U.S. 8 U.S.C. 1184(i)(1). In addition, a nonimmigrant in a specialty occupation must possess full State licensure to practice in the occupation (if required), completion of the required degree, or experience equivalent to the degree and recognition of expertise in the specialty. 8 U.S.C. 1184(i)(2). The category of ``fashion model'' requires that the nonimmigrant be of distinguished merit and ability. 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). INS identifies and defines the occupations covered by the H&hyph;1B category and determines an alien's qualifications for such occupations. DOL only administers and enforces the labor condition applications relating to the employment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rulemaking history, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 20, 1991, Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 56 FR 11705. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 5, 1991, Proposed Rule, 56 FR 37175. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 22, 1991, Interim Final Rule, 56 FR 54720. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 13, 1992, Interim Final Rule, 57 FR 1316. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 6, 1993, Proposed Rule, 58 FR 52152. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 30, 1993, Interim Final Rule, 58 FR 69226. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

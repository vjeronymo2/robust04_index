			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Gibraltar assured of insurance status Sir, To complete the picture so comprehensively set out in your article on the single market in insurance ('Hard work to be free and single: A look at the opportunities and constraints of a single European market in insurance', July 1), your readers will wish to know that, within this context, Gibraltar is in fact deemed to be a separate member state. This is reflected in the new UK regulations which amended the 1982 act so that it applies 'as if Gibraltar were a separate member state'. Insurance companies in Gibraltar fully comply with European Community law and are required to match UK standards. They are licensed by the Financial Services Commission which is ultimately accountable to the UK but on a day-to-day basis acts independently of the British and Gibraltar governments. In terms of the single market, I believe Gibraltar has the ingredients to become the most competitive location. Joe Bossano, chief minister, 6 Convent Place, Gibraltar</p>

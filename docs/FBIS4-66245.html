			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lcdr. Yang Zhiqun (2799 1807 5028): "Officers' </F> Forum--Brown Water, Blue Water--Thoughts on Naval Theory"]    [Text] Editor's Note: Based on the concern of our  numerous readers about naval issues, this publication is coming  out with a new exploratory column--"Officers' Forum," and  inviting some officers to talk about their individual  viewpoints. At the same time, we also hope that our numerous  readers will make some suggestions regarding the new column.    This is a very small planet and one third of the planet's  surface is black land. The other two thirds is blue sea. The  black of the land extends to the blue of the sea and the blue  sea washes the black land. Where they intersect the mixture  becomes brown, and the brown water is the transition between the  black land and the blue water. There is one very important  point: All people live on land. Only by sailing a ship can we go  down to the brown water and enter the blue water.    All newly-constructed ships enter the water from berths and  docks on the land, and when construction is completed, all ships  are sailed out to sea from ports on the land. All early fleets  went out to the vast blue waters from brown water close to land.    When a ship is outfitted with weapons, it becomes a naval  ship. Seamen undergo training to become sailors. Sailors and  naval ships are organized into fleets, and under the command of  an admiral, the fleet becomes a navy.    Navies all go down into the water from the land, first the  brown water, then the blue water.    Navies establish bases on land. Naval ships and aircraft set  out from the bases and attack and beat back the enemy in the  brown water.    If the enemy in the brown water is defeated or driven off,  the navy returns to its base and rests, reorganizes, and  replenishes, and prepares for the next attack. If it is  defeated, the navy escapes back to its base to hide. If it is  not even secure in the base, the whole navy is annihilated.    The navy, stationed at the base, waits to annihilate the  enemy in the brown water. The principal naval tactics are  developed and formulated according to this line of thinking.    Bases are generally distributed equidistantly along the  coast, and assault forces are deployed in key directions. Naval  base forces are deployed in accordance with this principle.    Forces are composed of coastal based aircraft, submarine  formations, and formations of surface ships and boats capable of  carrying out an assault in brown water. Coordinated coastal  defense fronts and small ships and boats can protect base  defensive forces. The organization of the navy's basic forces is  designed, planned, and developed in this way.    The overall plan of relying on the coastal land and keeping  the brown water in view is called naval strategy.    But things generally are not like this at all. The navy by  nature must be concerned about the blue water.    Blue water has had a very long maiden period. The first navy  to bravely go into its depths and draw its sea-lanes was the  Ming Dynasty eunuch Zheng and the Chinese fleet that he led  across the Indian Ocean for the first time in the early 15th  century. Eighty years later, for the first time the Portuguese  navy went around the Cape of Good Hope and proceeded to the  Orient and the Spanish navy crossed the Atlantic for the first  time and passed through the West Indies and saw the Pacific  Ocean.    The blue water has greeted the master and has greeted the  hegemonist. It was almost immediately recognized and carved up.  In 1494 a straight line was drawn along the 48th longitude 2,057  kilometers west of the Cape Verde Archipelago formed an eastern  and a western half, and divided up the great hegemony of  Portugal and Spain.    The blue-water navy began from that.    The blue water has its own blue-water logic: The ocean does  not belong to anyone. The ocean is the common property of  everyone. In world competition, common property also is the  property of the strong. Whoever is strong occupies it first, and  whoever occupies it first, has it first. The blue water has its  own blue-water stage. Time changes and is fickle with all  leaders. The invincible Spanish fleet, the unsinkable imperial  fleet, Holland, France, Japan, the Third Empire to the United  States and Soviet nuclear navies of the Cold War, the blue-water  hegemonists in blood and fire have torn each other apart and  fought to the death, down through history it has never ended.    Blue water has its own blue-water rules. After a thousand  years of evolution, the ancient land powers' concept of natural  expansion of sovereignty into the sea ultimately evolved to the  two modern principles of freedom of the high seas and  sovereignty of territorial waters. With the current  newly-arising countries, the development of technology to  exploit the ocean, and the ever-growing demand for ocean  resources, such concepts as the "archipelago principle,"  "contiguous zones," the "continental shelf," "special economic  zones," and "ocean-bottom resources as the common legacy of  humankind" arise.    The blue-water navy is completely different from the  brown-water navy.    The first person who changed from the original single masted  and single sailed ships to the multiple masted and multiple  sailed ships was the first person to turn his sights to the blue  water. But he still was a "blue-water person" looking at the  blue water from the land.    In 1584 when the English Queen Elizabeth ordered the pirate  admiral Drake to command a ship and attack the Spanish fleet in  the West Indies, she was a "blue-water person" looking from the  blue water to the blue water. And in this century after the  commanding officer of the first guided missile nuclear  submarine, the George Washington, in July 1960, successfully  fired a Polaris intercontinental guided missile from his boat,  he actually was the first "blue-water person" to look back at  land from the blue water.    An historical regression also is a logical regression. The  navy sailed to the blue water from the brown water to conquer  the ocean, but conquering was by no means the objective. The  ocean was conquered to use the ocean. The navy campaigned the  length and breadth of the blue waters to use the ocean. But  using still was not the objective. The use of the ocean was to  counteract the land!    The navy went into the blue water for the blue water, but  more than that it went into the blue water for the land.    The blue-water navy has its own blue-water navy thinking.    Because it goes into the blue water to use the blue water,  it  by no means takes what occurs on the sea as the goal of its  actions, but it takes "control of the seas" as its goal.  Luo-si-ji-er [5012 2448 1015 1422] said, "The function of a sea  force is to seize and maintain control of the seas and put them  to its own use, while preventing the enemy from controlling the  seas."    But "controlling the seas," what objective can it achieve?    First, it protects commercial trading and ensures that  trading sea-lanes are unimpeded. Secondly, it can use sea forces  to capture trading transfer points, colonies, and bases in  distant lands, as Alfred Mahan said. Old Mahan after all was a  man of the last century. He could not understand the  significance of blue water as a strategic nuclear base, nor  could he understand the significance of blue water as a treasure  house of resources.    He-de-li Bu-er [6378 1795 0448 1580 1422] said, "There are  two other uses for sea forces that by no means depend on the  basic objective of relying on the sea as a main line of  transportation. The first is that certain countries utilize sea  forces as a system of strategic nuclear weapons deployed at sea,  or to resist enemy strategic weapons systems. The second  objective has become more and more obvious only in the past ten  years. A country uses military forces at sea to seize or expand  its own ocean resources and to safeguard them from being  threatened from the outside."    In its traditional meaning, navies go into blue water first  for transportation lines, second for nuclear bases, and third  for ocean resources.    The concept of using huge fleets to protect transportation  lines at sea or the merchant fleet of one's own country is  somewhat outmoded, because every large country should believe  that the security of international sea-lanes can be maintained  by more civilized and more intelligent means. The concept of  maintaining a huge sea-based nuclear force in the blue water to  obtain a reliable strategic deterrent is somewhat a product of  the Cold War, at least after the Cold War, it cannot be ample  reason for developing a huge blue-water navy.    The concept of developing a modern blue-water navy to join  in  the approaching fight for blue-water resources somewhat deviates  from the spirit of the present international law of the sea. In  international law the concept of no controlling land, in which  blue-water resources are the common legacy of humankind and not  to be had by whoever first occupies them, is a principle that is  becoming generally accepted.    Blue water as before and blue-water navies today encounter  perplexities.    Navies after all have not forgotten that they went into the  blue water for the land.    When state sovereignty is limited to land borders, the navy  patrols the brown water to safeguard the country's land. When  such concepts in modern international law of the sea as  "contiguous zones," "continental shelf," and "special economic  zones" began to extend the legal meaning of state sovereignty to  brown waters, the implications for the country's land that the  navy should safeguard changed and by direct inference, the navy  in the new meaning of safeguarding the country's land patrolled  the blue water.    When the present world was divided into two large opposing  blocs, each navy to contend for world hegemony made its bid in  blue water, because either side could encounter its adversary in  blue water, and one side need only completely withdraw from the  arena and the the other side could realize its aspiration of  controlling the blue water. When one side ultimately realizes  this aspiration, it has no adversary in the arena and its navy  does not patrol the blue water to drive out the adversary, but  patrols the blue water to take advantage of the blue water to  offer resistance close to its country's land.    When a country's security is military security, the navy  patrols the blue water as a means of military combat. As the  world enters a new era, and state security is more importantly  expressed as economic security and environmental security, the  navy with its unique characteristic of "using non-combat forms,"  must patrol the blue water in a new guise as economic and  diplomatic emissary and as guardian of environmental security.    When a country outside of brown waters asserts sovereignty  over land or islands, its navy will patrol the blue water.    When a country still maintains a nuclear deterrent as the  content of its national security strategy, its navy will patrol  the blue water.    When a country has the humiliation of being chased out of an  ocean, today when it also has an extremely great oceanic  interest, its navy will patrol the blue water.    Sticking to its old ways, the navy will patrol the blue  water.    This is a very small planet and the planet's surface has  black land, brown water, and blue water.    The international law of the sea today stipulates thus: the  black land is yours, the blue water is everyone's, and the brown  water is yours and everyone's.    Oceanic politics today is expressed thus: Guard yours and  categorize everyone's.    The enlightenment from historical experience today is: If  you  cannot occupy yours, it is someone else's.    The next century has this prediction: The black land belongs  to the dried up past, the brown water belongs to the unfolding  present, and only the blue water is the hopeful future.    The navy is a legal person in the law of the sea, is a tool  in oceanic politics, is a student of historical experience, and  is a harbinger of the next century.    Brown water, blue water, the navy patrols in them.</p>

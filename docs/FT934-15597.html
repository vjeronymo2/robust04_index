			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Newspaper groups The Chancellor has some hard political choices to make if he intends to raise extra revenue in his November budget. But one of the softest options - judging by the cheers at the Conservative Party conference, at least - would be to slap VAT on newspapers. Recent cover price cuts by the Sun and the Times may be viewed in Number 11 as an open invitation for such a move. Given the political flak that would fly however much he taxed newspapers, Mr Clarke may choose to apply VAT at the full rate to raise a decent amount of revenue. That would undoubtedly come as a savage blow to the newspaper industry. Publishers would face the painful dilemma of deciding whether to pass on the increase and lose circulation or swallow the rise at the expense of margin. Against the background of sluggish advertising and rising newsprint costs, many newspaper groups would face a particularly rough time. National newspaper titles with strong franchises would be comparatively well placed to endure the pain. But the move would have a long term impact, depressing the prospects for any subsequent price rises. Local newspapers and magazines may prove far less robust, however. With somewhat spurious precision, the Newspaper Society suggests 245 regional newspapers would close. The Periodical Publishers Association estimates that 25 per cent of magazine titles would shut. But, theoretically, those that survived the shake-out could prosper.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 26 KYODO -- Foreign tourists in Lhasa,  Tibet, reported Thursday [26 May] that four Tibetan monks were  detained on Tuesday after shouting proindependence slogans near  the city center.    Police near the famous Johkang Temple in Barkhor Square  immediately descended on the monks, knocking some of them to the  ground before taking them away in police vehicles at about 9  A.M. Tuesday, witnesses said.    On May 25, the Buddhist festival of Sagothawa is held.  Traditionally, it attracts monks to the Johkang to pray. On May  23 last year, an estimated 4,000 Buddhist monks and nuns staged  independence demonstrations.    According to witnesses, the police presence has been heavy  in  the city over the last several days and passengers on all buses  coming into Lhasa are having their identification papers checked.    Several monks arriving in the city are believed to have been  turned back by police at bus stations, the witnesses said.</p>

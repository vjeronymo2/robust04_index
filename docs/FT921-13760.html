			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / The Gatt makes its last stand: The draft final act of the Uruguay Round offers a unique chance to liberalise trade / It must not fail I have never faltered, and I will never falter, in my belief that enduring peace and the welfare of nations are indissolubly connected with friendliness, fairness, equality and the maximum practicable degree of freedom in international trade. How remote did achievement of Cordell Hull's dream seem when he published these words in 1937. How fortunate that the US secretary of state, the father of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, persisted. For now, in 1992, his dream is on the verge of achievement. With the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations reaching its climax, a liberal trading order, covering virtually all countries and almost all trade flows, is within the world's grasp. Yet some who should know better seem incapable of seeing what is at stake. Others who do know better seem incapable of meeting the challenge. But without a dynamic trading system neither the prosperity of the rich nor the hopes for prosperity of the poor can be ensured. Never have the fundamental principles of the Gatt - liberalism, non-discrimination and the international rule of law - been more enthusiastically embraced. From Mexico City to Moscow, liberalisation is the order of the day. The Gatt secretariat announced last April that at least 45 countries had liberalised their trade policies since the start of the Uruguay Round, which has also seen active participation by many developing countries that had previously insisted on unreciprocated benefits. Unfortunately, a comparable commitment is not being shown where it matters most: in the US, the European Community and Japan, which account for over half of world exports. Having lectured so long on the need for all countries to participate in the liberal international trading system, these countries seem unwilling to do what is needed to stop it foundering. The US has abandoned its long-standing commitment to non-discrimination and, as was demonstrated by President Bush's sales trip to Japan earlier this month, is increasingly addicted to bilateralism and managed trade. The EC has failed to rise above the twin imperatives of its corrupt farm politics and incompetent farm policies. The Japanese seem incapable of putting aside their attachment to geriatric farmers and gerrymandered politics. Yet it is on these hobbled giants that success depends. Faced with the demarche from the Gatt's director-general, Mr Arthur Dunkel - the Draft Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, released just before Christmas - they must now choose between a draft that all find unsatisfactory and no conclusion at all. Mr Dunkel has proposed Easter 1992 as the date for a conclusion, including to the market access negotiations. While that deadline could be broken, as too many have been before, the price would be US ratification after the forthcoming elections. The outcome agreed in Geneva would then become a political football. Contrary to some unscrupulous comment, Mr Dunkel's draft was not the product of his fevered imagination. Except for central parts of the proposal on agriculture, where no agreement could be reached, it is the fruit of five years of painstaking negotiations among 108 participating countries. It is attractive fruit. In its scope and in the principles that animate it, this document would bring to fruition the dream embodied in the Havana Charter of 1947, which called for the creation of the still-born International Trade Organisation. Combined with success in the negotiations to liberalise market access in goods and services, due to finish by March 1 1992, the final act would: bring within the Gatt framework two long-established and embarrassing exceptions - agriculture, and textiles and clothing - which accounted for 10.1 and 5.3 per cent of total world trade in 1990, respectively; create a general agreement on trade in services, which would extend the scope of the rules on multilateral trade to activities that account for another 18.9 per cent of world trade; establish an 'agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights' that would for the first time provide multilaterally agreed protection of intellectual property; strengthen the rules of the Gatt system to prevent abuse of existing provisions, remove the temptation to adopt 'grey area measures' outside the Gatt and increase the transparency of procedures used by national authorities to grant Gatt-legal protection to private supplicants; and establish a Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO), which would serve as an umbrella for the new agreements, end the long-standing anomaly of the provisional application of the Gatt, allow cross-retaliation within all areas of trade, and create both a uniform and far more binding system of dispute settlement. These are big advances. Not least among them is the strengthening of the rules of the system. The Gatt is a contract whose value depends on the effectiveness of its rules. The draft final act would eliminate a number of important anomalies. It would: elaborate and strengthen several articles, including the one dealing with emergency protection (Article XIX). This would limit the duration of emergency protection and, with a few temporary exceptions, eliminate 'voluntary' export restraints; and elaborate and strengthen a number of the codes agreed in the Tokyo round, notably those on subsidies, dumping and standards, as well as through a parallel negotiation on public procurement. Compromises have had to be made. But even in the case of the most sensitive of all, dumping, the rules have been tightened in ways that should limit the current tendency towards arbitrary decisions. Unfortunately, there is a dauntingly long way to go, while little time appears to be left. Yet timetables alone should not be allowed to destroy an agreement of such importance. The more important questions are those of substance. Agriculture is pivotal, not because of an American whim, as many in the EC seem to believe, but because it is the sine qua non for many other participants, both developed and developing. With the principle of reform of the common agricultural policy conceded by the EC, the agricultural negotiations are now over points of detail. The detail is important, but it is still detail and, as such, insufficient to justify derailment of the exercise. The outstanding issues are in ascending order of sensitivity: the 'tariffication' of existing barriers and concomitant commitments to improved market access; the EC's demand to 'rebalance' its protective regime, with less protection for cereals offset by greater protection against cereal substitutes, especially oilseeds; the American demand for quantitative limits on the volume of subsidised exports; and the EC's demand that the compensation payments proposed as the centre-piece of CAP reform by Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC's agricultural commissioner, should be included in the 'green box', as subsidies that do not distort production and trade. Mr MacSharry's payments do not get into the green box for a simple reason: they are not decoupled from production. The relevant text states that 'no production shall be required in order to receive . . . payments', while the EC's payments make that requirement. The possible solutions are two: either the EC separates its payments from the requirement for continued production, or the proposed payments could be put in yet another box ('blue' and 'two-speed amber' being under discussion), which would then differentiate the EC's proposals from the far more distorting American deficiency payments. The other agricultural issues are not as difficult. A limit on the volume of subsidised exports cannot be out of the question for a trading bloc that is itself so sensitive to dumping. Meanwhile, rebalancing is anathema to many agricultural exporters and has no hope of being agreed. Agricultural tariffication falls within the broader area of market access. A huge volume of work remains here - other issues being the bilateral tariff-line negotiations in manufactures and market access in services. But these negotiations are an opportunity, as much as an obstacle. Chances to re-open the draft final document itself must be limited, if it is not to unravel entirely. The best way to pay countries that have not obtained what they want in the existing texts, or are asked to concede more than they judge reasonable, is through the market access negotiations, the goal here being a one third average cut in tariffs on manufactures. The US, for example, may obtain more than is at present offered to it in intellectual property by making generous offers on market access. The immediate question is whether agricultural exporting countries decide that the EC's negative reaction to Mr Dunkel's agricultural text, which includes a proposal for reductions of 36 per cent in customs duties, makes the prospects for liberalisation too uncertain for them to engage in across-the-board market access negotiations. They should take the plunge, however, even if their offers remain conditional on agreed reductions in agricultural support. The private interests that need to fight for the results of this round in the US include service providers and the pharmaceutical industry. For this reason, offers on market access are also important in services. US service providers will not fight for an agreement that gives all foreign companies equal access to the relatively liberal US market, while US companies are merely promised access to relatively illiberal foreign markets. Meanwhile, the US pharmaceutical industry is making intellectual property an important obstacle to final agreement. It is concerned that the developing countries would have a transitional period of 10 years for the introduction of product patents. While some protection would be granted to products to be patented between the agreement's coming into force and the end of this transition period, no protection would be granted to existing patents. But since the US is isolated on the issue, it will have to pay a high price elsewhere, if it is to obtain agreement to retrospective application of patent protection. These obstacles are important. But far more significant is the goal to be reached. As a result of past trade liberalisation - both through seven previous rounds of Gatt negotiations as well as in the regional context, above all within Europe - trade has led the growth of output through each successive economic cycle (see chart). The world economy has grown progressively more integrated, with this integration being a principal source of growth for the market economies. Regional blocs provide no alternative to multilateral liberalisation. European countries do, it is true, do three quarters of their trade with one another and might consider the world well lost. But the countries of the Americas and of Asia send more than half of their exports outside their respective regions (see chart). Almost 40 per cent of all word trade, even including the huge volume of trade within Europe, is inter-regional. Regional blocs are not a sensible alternative to the multilateral framework. They are at best a complement. Whatever happens, the last hour of the Gatt has arrived. If the round succeeds, a new MTO will provide a secure foundation for extension of the trading system into such new areas as global competition and the environment. It will also underpin the global market economy and, no less important, help stabilise global political relations. But if the round fails, a gallant attempt at global co-operation will go out with a whimper. The big powers must make their choice. It is between the rule of the jungle and the rule of international law, between the belated slaughter of their sacred political cows and a dynamic world economy.</p>

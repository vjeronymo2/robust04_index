			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV CANCELS TRIP FOR NOBEL  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has canceled a planned visit to Oslo for  the presentation of his Nobel Peace Prize, Tass news agency said today.  </P> <P> Tass quoted the Soviet president's press office as saying plans to attend the  Dec. 10 presentation were changed because of the "crucial situation in the  country and the president's preoccupation with affairs that occupy his constant  attention."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, awarded the Peace Prize for his reforms that allowed the end of the  Cold War and the flourishing of democratic movements in Eastern Europe, has  been criticized at home for devoting too much time to foreign affairs and  overseas trips while the Soviet Union suffers serious shortages and domestic  problems.  </P> <P> "It is hoped in Moscow that the Nobel committee will understand the reason for  this postponement and agree to present the prize at a later date," Tass said.  </P></p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / EU rift takes steam out of energy taxes: Dispute on carbon levy weakens greenhouse gases campaign If this month's European Union summit in Essen put the lid on the coffin of a common energy tax, last week's meeting of environment ministers drove in the final nail. By allowing member states to follow individual strategies on energy taxation, rather than imposing a common tax based on a fuel's carbon content, the decision dealt an embarrassing blow to the EU's prestige ahead of the most important international gathering on climate change - due next March in Berlin - since the Rio de Janeiro earth summit of 1992. In Rio, western industrialised nations agreed to stabilise their emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO), which many scientists believe cause global warming. The Berlin conference is intended to take the process further. Progress was never going to be easy given the diversity of national positions. But preparation of a new protocol to go beyond the Rio commitment to stabilise CO emissions in the year 2000 at 1990 levels now looks less likely in view of the EU's internal dissent. A joint European front at Rio was a crucial element in pushing a reluctant US to accept CO cuts. It also sent a message to the developing world, which made no such commitment, that its turn would come. Discord within the EU will make it easier for both to seek a fudge in Berlin. Mr Michael Grubb, who heads the energy and environmental programme at Britain's Royal Institute of International Affairs, believes the writing has been on the wall for the EU for some time. While a carbon tax appealed to the most environmentally-minded member states, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, it was viewed with trepidation by others. For Germany, which generates most of its electricity from coal, a carbon-based levy was a boon to trading competitors, such as France, where electricity is derived predominantly from other sources. This explains Bonn's concern to turn the carbon tax into a wider duty on all energy sources. Under a compromise, the European Commission proposed the tax should be on a fuel's carbon content and its energy value. According to the German government, which was keen to head off criticism from the powerful Green lobby and prepare for the Berlin conference, that would discourage the use of polluting carbon and stimulate energy efficiency as well. Not all the member states thought likewise. While Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal all accepted the idea in principle, each demanded exceptional treatment to give it greater headroom for industrial development. British opposition, meanwhile, turned on the issue of sovereignty. The government argued that taxation was a domestic issue and that individual states should decide how to implement their Rio commitments. Not surprisingly, the outcome at Essen was an agreement to disagree. EU finance ministers were told to prepare criteria for a member state to apply a common tax 'if it so desires'. That leaves the EU facing a pot pourri of measures ahead of the Berlin conference. Denmark, along with Sweden and Finland, which are due to join the EU, already apply varying forms of wide-ranging energy taxes and special levies for carbon-based fuels. Germany and the Netherlands have also taken steps to impose duties. However, the German preparations for a carbon tax were dropped in favour of EU action, while the Netherlands, which has already imposed some environmental taxes, is committed to introducing some form of carbon tax by January 1996. The Belgian cabinet, meanwhile, decided recently in favour of a broad energy tax to meet CO targets. For some government officials, the carbon tax was nothing more than a sideshow from the outset given national differences and the string of exemptions agreed. 'The whole debate was just a distraction which was always going to be controversial,' says one. However, energy taxation may be more tenacious than its opponents think. France, which is about to take over the presidency of the Council of ministers, seems inclined to resurrect a German scheme to use existing excise taxes on energy, normally restricted to petroleum, as the basis for a new EU levy. Member states would first be required to impose a minimum EU level of taxation on petrol. That would be reviewed periodically to harmonise national tax levels. The tax would gradually be extended beyond petrol to other energy sources. Critics say the scheme is so riddled with exemptions that it is of little practical value. However, the fact that energy taxation remains on the agenda suggests that its coffin may not yet be at rest.</p>

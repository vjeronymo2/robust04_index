			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by AIM correspondent Santos Nhantumbo in Lisbon] </F>   [Text] In Lisbon, Finance Minister Dr. Eneas Comiche has  denied allegations that former Portuguese proprietors are  repossessing their property within the framework of the  (re)privatization process under way in Mozambique since 1987.    The Mozambican state has now (re)privatized about 300 small,  medium, and large scale enterprises since the reintroduction of  the market economy in 1987, replacing the centrally controlled  one which was in place until 1986.    Eneas Comiche, who has been on a working visit to Portugal  for two weeks now, told AIM [MOZAMBIQUE INFORMATION AGENCY] that  current legislation practically rules that out because it puts  foreign investors, including former Portuguese proprietors, on  equal footing.    He said everyone expressing an interest in investing in  Mozambique have been doing so under the terms of the current  law, through tenders. He noted that potential Portuguese  investors, including former proprietors, understand this factor.    The finance minister recalled Law 13-91, which confers on  former share-holders and proprietors of enterprises the means to  apply for the cessation of state intervention, with justifiable  reasons of a financial, technological, or commercial nature,  which they may be willing to render. They may be able to  propose the continuation of its activities in association with  Mozambican businessmen.    He said, "those who had any reason to benefit from what has  been stipulated in the current law certainly did so at an  opportune time."    Eneas Comiche said he expects Portuguese businessmen to be  more effective and that they will take advantage of their  knowledge of Mozambique and the common language, so that  Portugal may once again become the main investor in Mozambique.    He recalled that "a number of Portuguese nationals have been  involved in a study on agricultural and mineral resources among  others, to which we have no access," noting that "this study is  valuable."    Available figures state that the main foreign investor in  Mozambique is Great Britain, followed by South Africa and  Portugal. About 25 countries invested $700 million in Mozambique  over the past few years, of which some $27 million is Portuguese  capital.    Italy and France are also ahead in economic cooperation, and  Eneas Comiche argues that Portugal is not taking courageous  steps to advance further, that its political willingness has not  been characterized by concrete actions, but he believes that the  peace process will dissipate some concerns.    Comiche believes that South Africa, which occupies the  second  place in terms of the volume of direct investment in Mozambique,  could do much more if there were no foreign exchange  restrictions.    He said investors from that neighboring country, although  willing to invest in Mozambique, are unable to get authorization  from financial institutions for exporting capital.    The minister said this issue was discussed with South Africa  before the democratic transition and will still be discussed  with the South African authorities, particularly with the banks  so that restrictions on the transfer of capital, particularly  for investment in Mozambique are removed.    In terms of commercial transactions, Comiche said over the  past few years there has been an increase in trade with South  Africa, and there has also been an increase of imported goods  from South Africa, but, "unfortunately, not in exports to South  Africa."    He said, "it will be necessary to guarantee that there is  not  a big imbalance between what we are exporting and what we are  importing from that country."    If from a political standpoint the success of the democratic  process in South Africa confers stability to Mozambique and  southern Africa, it is also true that from an economic point of  view that historical event also creates conditions for a new  plan of regional development and integration.    Similar to what is happening all over the world, Eneas  Comiche gives priority to partners from southern Africa, "an  area of enormous future regarding natural resources and  competitive laborers, so that it may have a say in the continent  and the world."    He said the economic situation in the country was recovering  following the launching of the Economical Recovery Program in  1987 which sort to correct the decline in production which was  especially apparent between 1981 and 1986. The worst year was  1992 when GDP was only one percent. In 1993 GDP increased by 19  percent, the biggest rate since independence. Growth of more  than 6 percent of GDP between 1994 and 1996 is expected.    Comiche also said that a restrictive policy is underway to  reduce inflation from 44 percent in 1993 to 30 percent this year  and 15 percent in 1996.    This will also include products which are not traditionally  exported, such as electricity, which is scheduled to be supplied  to South Africa from 1996, and the production of natural gas in  Pande from 1998.    The finance minister also mentioned the National  Reconstruction Plan, which is aimed at strengthening national  reconciliation and democracy until 1994, and the normalization  of the lives of the refugees, displaced people, and demobilized  soldiers, for a period of about three years.    The minister says that it is estimated that $400 million  will  be spent per year on the National Reconstruction Plan.    Eneas Comiche has been in Portugal for about two weeks now  and has already attended two seminars in Lisbon and Porto on  opportunities for investment in Mozambique.    The focus of these meetings with Portuguese financial  institutions and businessmen has been the restructuring of the  business sector in Mozambique and the opening to the private  sector of agriculture, tourism, mines, and banking, as well as  the reduction of bureaucracy in the process of decision-making  on foreign investment and the establishment of fiscal incentives  for private investment within the framework of the economic  opening underway in Mozambique.</p>

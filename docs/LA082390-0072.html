			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: A MELLOWER MOUZON IS DUE AT HUMPHREY'S  </P> <P> During the mid-1970s, drummer Alphonse Mouzon pounded himself into the minds of  fusion jazz fans with his machine-gun attack behind guitarist Larry Coryell in  The Eleventh House band. Mouzon has diversified and mellowed since then. During  the 1980s, he turned out a series of light jazz recordings packed with lush  melodies and thick electronic instrumentation, but little of his former fire.  </P> <P> His newest album, "As You Wish," released this year, continues this lighter  mode. Mouzon plays drums, digital drums, electric bass, percussion and assorted  synthesizers, with saxophonist Gary Meeks doing the lion's share of the melodic  duties.  </P> <P> Mouzon is also engrossed in a legal battle with Optimism, his label from  1986-88.  </P> <P> Among his charges are that he received only $13,000 in royalties from his 1988  hit album, "Early Spring," which the label says sold 50,000 to 60,000 copies.  Mouzon said he should have netted about $70,000. Optimism also rereleased the  1981 "Morning Sun" album on compact disc in 1988 without Mouzon's permission,  making a new pirate master tape from the original vinyl LP -- the resulting  sound quality was horrible. After several stages of trial proceedings, Mouzon  has received $16,250 from Optimism for copyright infringement. He was awarded  an additional $28,000 earlier this month, but must wait six months while  Optimism appeals. Eventually, he wants a retrial, and he seeks a settlement of  at least $3 million, down from his original request of $14 million for a  variety of violations of his deal with Optimism.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he has discovered a new source of income -- licensing his music to  televised soap operas and sports programs.  </P> <P> "I made $8,000 in June from 'General Hospital' and 'One Life to Live,' and I  can make $4,000 during one weekend of golf on 'CBS Sports,' " he said.  </P> <P> Mouzon is mixing a new album for release later this year or early next, and he  also hopes to remake some of his '70s fusion music, record an acoustic jazz  album and maybe even a heavy metal session.  </P> <P> With all of his successes and experience, it seems odd that Mouzon would be  tabbed for next Wednesday night's "Rising Star Concert" at the Catamaran Resort  Hotel in Mission Beach. Mouzon will concentrate on music from his most recent  albums, including "As You Wish," "Early Spring," "Back to Jazz" and "Love  Fantasy," backed by his touring band.  </P> <P> Unlike the broad-minded Mouzon, veteran jazz drummer Louis Hayes continues in  the pure acoustic jazz vein he started out in during the 1950s, in bands led by  pianist Horace Silver and reed man Yusef Lateef, and continued in during the  1960s in bands headed by saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and pianist Oscar  Peterson.  </P> <P> Hayes plays Elario's next Monday and Tuesday nights with his own band,  including Charles Tolliver on trumpet, Clint Houston on bass, George Cables on  piano and John Stubblefield on sax.  </P> <P> Sets will include music from Hayes' "Una Max" album, released earlier this year  and named in honor of fellow drummer Max Roach. Hayes said being a leader  doesn't make him play drums any differently than he would on someone else's  session.  </P> <P> "The only difference is I'm more in control if I want to have certain things  featuring myself. A lot of times if the drummer is not the leader, people just  want the rhythm section to fit in." On "Una Max," Hayes gave himself three drum  solos, and promised several in San Diego.  </P> <P> Carlsbad ends its summer outdoor jazz series with a performance from 6 to 8  tomorrow night by Ira Liss and the Big Band Jazz Machine in Magee Park at  Carlsbad Boulevard and Beech Street. The program grew to nine shows this year  from six last year. Colleen Finnegan, the city's community arts coordinator,  pronounced the events "very successful," and said they drew at least 400 to 450  listeners to local parks each week. There were glitches, though. The most  glaring was the scheduled Aug. 10 appearance by Gene Perry and his group Afro  Rumba. Perry didn't show up for the date and sent stand-ins, including  multi-instrumentalist Turiya and keyboard man Joe Garrison. "I did not get five  guys in matching shirts banging out the Caribbean beat," Finnegan lamented. "I  got five musicians doing standards with a Latin beat."  </P> <P> RIFFS: Top jazz guitarist Lee Ritenour, a capable player in both straight-ahead  and lighter commercial modes, plays Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay at 7 and 9  p.m. Friday.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bo Jeppesen: "Liberals and Conservatives Split </F> on Fund Investments"]    [Excerpts] There appears to be broad majority support in  the Folketing for allowing more investments from the Labor  Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP) and the Wage Earners'  Cost-of-Living Fund (LD) in Danish trade and industry now that  Conservative Party leader Hans Engell is receptive to the idea.    The two government partners of many years, the Liberals and  the Conservatives, are deeply divided over allowing wage-earner  and pension funds to invest billions of kroner in Danish trade  and industry.    Conservative leader Hans Engell surprisingly signaled in  yesterday's paper that the party is now ready to allow ATP and  LD to have more influence:    "The wage earners' money is just as good as the firms' own  money," Engels said. [passage omitted]    Kirsten Jacobsen, the Progress Party's spokesperson on  business finances, was "totally unable to comprehend" Engell's  turnaround.    "He has launched an idea that former Industrial Affairs  Minister Anne Birgitte Lundholt, also a Conservative, fought  against tooth and nail," she said.    Sten Gade, Socialist People's Party (SF) group chairman,  cannot understand the Progress Party's opposition because he  recalls that the party supported such proposals in Glistrup's  day. [passage omitted]    Labor Minister Jytte Andersen (Social Democrat) is pleased  with the Conservative move because it ensures a broad majority  when the ATP and LD law is amended. [passage omitted]    The four parties in the government are about to fall into  step after some internal discussion. Yesterday BERLINGSKE  TIDENDE tried in vain to get a comment from Industrial Affairs  Minister Mimi Jakobsen, the leader of the Center Democrats (CD).  The party previously opposed raising the investment limit.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Letter: Innovation - the government's role and industry's challenge (2) Sir, Andrew Baxter's report ('CBI finds upbeat outlook on R&amp;D', April 23) implies a major conflict between the CBI's second annual innovation trends survey and the recent House of Lords' report on innovation in manufacturing industry. My own conclusion is that both documents present a similar picture  -disquieting yet challenging. The CBI report can hardly be described as upbeat when 37 per cent of the UK manufacturing companies surveyed considered their spending on innovation to be inadequate to meet future competitive pressures. Also, this figure understates the problem because: a further 8 per cent were apparently unsure about the adequacy of their spending on innovation; the survey reflects subjective judgments, when there is still too much complacency in many sections of British manufacturing industry about future foreign competition; if nearly half Britain's manufacturing should fail for want of investment in innovation, much of the remainder would be threatened because of interdependence. So although the CBI survey contains crumbs of comfort about investment in the development of new products, processes and services, it can hardly claim to rebutt the main thrust of the Lords' report, which is well researched, clearly written and worthy of proper study. The superficial rubbishing of the latter in the financial columns seems sadly to reflect social and political prejudices rather than constructive ideas and objective analysis.

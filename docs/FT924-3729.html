			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Going it alone Bernice Cohen's appearance in the July FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance inspired a record correspondence from our readers, who wanted to know more about her approach to private investment. In this article, she sets out the ground rules which started her on her course. I AM a Do-It-Myself investor. But why did I take this route? Coincidentally, the Weekend FT of July 18 - when the interview with me was published - provided a compelling reason. It gave the results of four share portfolios chosen in July 1991 on the basis of directors' share purchases, high-yield criteria, an experts' panel, and the FT darts team. Purely pour encourager les autres, no doubt, the experts registered serious losses. Indeed, all four portfolios revealed how easy it is to lose money when selecting shares. The experiment suggested that if ever there was an appropriate time for adopting a 'buy-and-hold' share philosophy, the 1990s is not it. Had the experts been allowed to behave like real, ever-anxious investors, eliminating the worst performers on a six- or even three-monthly review, they might have improved their results. According to Jessie Livermore, of 1920s' Wall Street fame, retaining a losing investment indefinitely is an act of blind faith closer to speculation than the sensible preservation of capital. So, it appeared I would have to settle for the mocking implications of staying a DIMI. I was daunted at first, but I stopped flinching when I recalled some bruising experiences snatching back rapidly dwindling funds from assorted shock-horror situations. These included unexpected profits warnings (Control Techniques, March 1991); rumours of fraud or malpractice (Polly Peck and Caird, 1989); and plummeting shares in a tension-driven market anticipating a Gulf war in January 1991 (Tomkins, autumn 1990). Of these, three were broker recommendations. These traumatic miscalculations convinced me to remain a DIMI, making my own decisions and trading whenever I believed it necessary. This approach injects an element of humility and cautions against the hubris lurking to trap over-confident investors. But does this mean one should play safe? I think not. The word 'safe' might simply be the mirage of money illusion. We ignore John Major's robber baron, inflation, at our peril because, sadly, this persistent villain enjoys continuous government patronage. Assuming the consensus post-devaluation rate of 4.5 to 5.5 per cent for annual price increases, the pound in our building society or bank deposit accounts will lose half its present purchasing power in 12 years. This remorseless shrinkage spans the time needed to build a sound business, support a child through school and college, or prepare for a comfortable retirement. Savings must grow by 5 per cent merely to stand still. After this catch-up percentage, the real growth for risk-free deposits is frugal. It scarcely covers rainy day reserves. So, investing in something riskier had to be considered, just to provide long-term growth prospects. This reasoning was not the only spur encouraging me to become a DIMI, however. I also wanted badly to rebuild our savings, depleted in the 1980s, so that my husband could retire within five years. Initially, I spent time considering my investment objectives. What did I want to achieve? How would I turn the aims into capital? Skimming through past FT articles on winners and losers, and through unit trust performance tables in Money Observer, I decided that doubling my initial capital over five years might be a possible, albeit ambitious, target. I would concentrate on capital growth but, nearer to retirement, the portfolio balance would shift gradually from growth towards secure income. Establishing primary objectives was easy; preparing a disciplined programme to achieve it took much longer. Steering the programme steadily, but often erratically, towards the optimistic objective has become a time-consuming weekly preoccupation. Six practical steps underpinned the programme: To read extensively on how to improve my investment skills by building a library of books on the topic. To invest in essential research material, including a daily FT and a weekly Investors Chronicle. To update the portfolio values every weekend, on the lines of Bearbull in the Investors Chronicle. To review mistakes and successes analytically as they happen. This is occasionally a source of intense aggravation - but there have also been some exhilarating moments in compensation. To divide the initial capital into four unequal portions, with cash predominating at the outset. To build a reference file of facts, statistics and charts, together with the relevant FT indices, on companies and markets as future investment opportunities. Dividing the initial capital was an intentional precaution while statistics, market awareness and confidence were accumulating. Cash remained above 60 per cent, to fund future pension premiums and a 10-year Skandia plan. This versatile savings plan allows unlimited free switching at bid prices between nearly 300 unit and investment trusts run by more than 18 fund management groups - just the investment freedom I was looking for. The maximum allowance went into two unit trust Peps, with monthly contributions to average out price fluctuations. The cash fund then declined further as I opened additional Peps. Initially, both Peps and savings plan were invested wholly in unit trusts. In the fourth slice of capital, additional unit and investment trust selections, plus three direct equity holdings, meant more than 60 per cent of my equity investments by value were being managed professionally until such time as I felt confident to manage a larger direct portfolio myself. Within six months, I had learnt a harsh lesson. Without employing risky put options, which need considerable expertise, few investments prosper in falling markets. My early losses had to be recognised as an unavoidable cost for obtaining hands-on experience. Accepting that one cannot always be right is an unpalatable truth. With these six practical steps, I am hopeful that being a DIMI will eventually improve my investment performance.</p>

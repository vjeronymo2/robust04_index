			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH ASKS CONTRAS TO TURN IN WEAPONS  </P> <P> President Bush said today he was asking U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contras to give  up their weapons in the long struggle against the leftist Sandinista  government, and expressed confidence they will do so.  </P> <P> Bush was asked by reporters if he is worried that the rebels might refuse to  lay down their arms despite the election victory Sunday of U.S.-backed  opposition leader Violeta Barrios de Chamorro over Nicaragua President Daniel  Ortega.  </P> <P> "No, I'm not worried, they will," Bush said as he left the Century Plaza hotel  for another stop on his California visit.  </P> <P> Asked if he was telling them to do so, he said, "Yeah, put it on the wire."  </P> <P> Chamorro has asked the rebels to lay down their weapons and return home. Ortega  similarly has asked for their disbandment. About 6,000 Contras, who were given  millions of dollars in U.S. aid over the years, have been camped in bases in  Honduras, which borders Nicaragua.  </P> <P> A rebel spokesman said Wednesday the Contras were ready to discuss their  position with Chamorro's party.  </P> <P> Later, Bush praised law enforcement officials as "unsung heroes" as he toured a  new 2,064-bed jail in Saugus that he said proved "tough talk is simply not  enough" in fighting crime.  </P> <P> Bush was given a tour of the not-yet-opened North County Correctional Facility  by Sheriff Sherman Block, who showed him the Spartan cells in the  maximum-security facility.  </P> <P> A major part of Bush's own anti-crime package is concentrated on prison  expansion.  </P> <P> The President said after his brief tour: "I will never forget it. It was long  enough to bring anyone face to face with the results of what institutions like  this represent . . . capacity for violence, the power of corruption, the  ability to turn our back on right and do wrong."  </P> <P> Addressing law enforcement officers outside the prison, Bush said, "All too  often you are the unsung heroes in the war on crime and our assault on drugs."  </P> <P> Facilities like the new $131-million jail show that 'tough talk is simply not  enough. If you're going to be tough on crime, you've got to be tough on  criminals," he said.  </P> <P> Bush then headed to address a luncheon gathering of the Republican Governors  Assn. and later was to speak at a dinner of the California Chamber of Commerce.  </P></p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Arts: Hobson's Choice - Birmingham Rep Hobson's Choice unites two men, each famous for one thing: Thomas Hobson for offering customers no choice of horse at his Cambridge stable in the 1620s; and Harold Brighouse (1882-1958) for writing this one play in 1915. Brighouse wrote 50 others, and eight novels, but Hobson is his gift to posterity. This blunt social comedy is treated dependably and wittily by The Birmingham Rep in a production which balances the finesse and the force of Brighouse's message. The play teems with Brighouse's own family connections and with familiar Lancashire life. Hobson, set in Salford, tells the story of a tyrannical father whose daughters rebel and take his matrimonial injunctions to the letter. They marry and leave home, Hobson takes to the bottle, and his termagant daughter Maggie gives him 'Hobson's choice' of terms for her return to save his failing health. Hobson (played by Brian Rawlinson) begins as a champion of commonsense inveighing against the 'gradual increase of uppishness' from his daughters. He delivers his prejudices tersely ('you're pretty, but you lie like a gas meter'), and agrees with his friends that 'a woman's foolishness begins where a man's leaves off.' His daughter Maggie, superbly acted by Janice McKenzie, is his opposite, the New Woman of the 1880s who proposes to her hapless quarry, Willy Mossop, with the words: 'I've been watching you, and you'll do.' Mossop (well judged by Tom Watt) grows in confidence alongside her independence. The play amounts to a series of non-choices constructed by Maggie on the kind of negotiation that puts others in a position where they cannot harm you no matter how badly they behave. But there are tender moments: she keeps her original brass wedding ring to remind herself how far she has risen in the world; and on her wedding night, fetches her quaking husband from the parlour couch (in 1915, the Censor's blue pencil hovered over this scene). The mid-Victorian ethos, all duty and self-help, belies the play's 1880 setting. But the Victorian middle-class concern for the inextricable issues of money, marriage and respectability persists in Brighouse and in Gwenda Hughes' solid direction. The design (Ruari Murchison) is, like Brighouse's prose, bold and straightforward. The acting elsewhere is brisk, if not always audible. Perhaps the time has come for a Brighouse revival, beginning with the 1909 Dealing in Futures.</p>

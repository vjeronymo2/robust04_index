			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: BT BT seems to be cast in the role of perpetual bridesmaid in the US telecoms business. The company was engaged to McCaw only to see the cellular operator marry AT&amp;T. It has also walked out with IBM and the US long-distance companies MCI and Sprint. Latterly, BT cuddled up to the computer company EDS, but the latter's attempts to divorce General Motors to move in with BT seem to have proved too messy. The difficulty in finding a suitable partner raises questions about BT's strategy. A desire to take part in the world's largest telecommunications market is understandable. Yet, if it were to attempt a link-up with one of the large US long distance operators such as MCI or Sprint, it would face large regulatory problems. Ties to the regional 'Baby Bells' might be less controversial, but being restricted to the areas around Atlanta or San Francisco might feel a little cramped. Buying computer companies would certainly be easier, but the telecommunications benefits are more nebulous and Byzantine arguments are needed to justify such deals. BT may chip away at the US market if it gets permission to lease capacity and resell it to other customers, but that hardly provides the critical mass for a serious North American challenge. One engine of BT's ambition is its financial strength. Yet it appears unable to use its balance sheet or swelling cash flow effectively in Europe or in the US. Perhaps it should widen its gaze and consider participation in basic telephony elsewhere, or even other areas such as credit card processing or smart card development in the UK. If all else fails, subscribers to BT3 will welcome the higher dividend payments that the limits of imperial ambition would bring.</p>

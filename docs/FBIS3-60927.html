A group of 12 Shining Path "terrorists" stormed a bank in  Lima and opened fire at point blank range against the seven  employees and some 12 clients who were there, killing five  people. A "terrorist" identified as Teodora Huamani Ramos also  died during the incident. The "terrorists" escaped after  scattering leaflets and planting two bombs on Riva Aguero  Avenue, and one on Tranquilino Velarde Street. Another two  groups of "terrorists" keeping watch outside the bank  machine-gunned a police pickup truck that went past the bank,  killing two plainclothesmen.

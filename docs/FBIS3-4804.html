The sources said that in its first year of operation, the  scholarship program will pay 100,000 yen a month to 100 South  Korean students each for up to one year of study at universities  in Japan.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will officially announce  the  program in talks with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam who is  scheduled to arrive in Japan for an official visit on March 24.    Japan's public and private universities have some 2,700  exchange agreements with foreign universities.    One source at the Education Ministry's student exchange  division said that of these, 142 are with universities in South  Korea, but because of the high cost of living in Japan, only 20  or 30 South Korean students a year study in Japan under existing  scholarship programs.    As a result, many universities have appealed to the ministry  to introduce some form of support for overseas students.    During a visit to South Korea in November, Hosokawa promised  Kim to expand the Japanese Government's intake of students.    The sources said the number of students covered by the  scholarships and the countries they come from will be increased  from fiscal 1995.    Applicants for the scholarships should apply through the  university of their choice from July.</p>

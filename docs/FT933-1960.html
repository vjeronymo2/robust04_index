			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Yield attractions The regional electricity companies (Recs) presented a lively front yesterday as Hoare Govett highlighted dividend opportunities in its weekly strategic overview. The house argues that the race for cyclical recovery stocks and the impact of enhanced scrip dividends has meant that a lot of the blue-chip high yielders have been left behind. Hoare says the Recs, as well as the health and household stocks and some of the prestige food manufacturers, will become sought after as income funds scramble for stocks which offer strong dividend growth. It adds that the inherent value in the National Grid has not been fully discounted. Among the risers were Eastern, up 9 at 553p, Norweb, 8 better at 595p, and Midlands, which rose 5 to 577p. Wellcome advanced 14 to 710p, helped by a reiterated recommendation at the morning meeting of Paribas's London arm. The house believes the group represents the best value quality play in the sector and is best placed to cope with changes that will result from President Clinton's health care reforms. There was also support from an alliance announced between Wellcome and Centocor, a cancer drug company. An improvement in first-half profits at Morgan Crucible brought a turnround in the fortunes of the stock. Having declined in nervous trading over the last few sessions, the shares improved 22 to 323p, one of the day's bigger gains. A slim recovery for condom maker London International Group after last week's profits warning and subsequent market savaging was restrained as Gartmore Investment Trust announced that it had reduced its holding to 2.48 per cent from 4 per cent. Prudential raised its stake to just above 5 per cent and LIG shares moved up 3 to 1254p. Community Hospitals rose 9 to 206p after announcing slightly lower full-year profits but a raised dividend. New issue VHE, a specialist contractor in land reclamation, made an impressive debut. Having been placed at 115p, the shares finished 4 ahead at 119p as volume reached 2.3m. Last week's advance in Tomkins, prompted by a positive annual meeting, came to a halt as profit-takers moved in. The stock closed 5 easier at 232p. General Accident was squeezed 10 higher to 686p in very thin volume. Magazine printer Hunterprint gained 4 before settling a net 2 up at 45p after announcing that it had won the contract to print a new weekly supplement for London's Evening Standard newspaper. Printer De La Rue put a brave face on its first day out of the FT-SE 100 Index. Having taken the pain on Friday, the shares recovered to close 15 1/2 dearer at 668p. Meanwhile, Schroders, the merchant bank, celebrated its first day in the index with a retreat of 9 to 1320p as a securities house argued that the shares were overvalued. Banks were firmer, with both Lloyds and HSBC attracting interest. Optimism for a cut in Japanese interest rates helped sentiment. Food manufacturing company Devro International, which came to the market earlier this year, continued to bask in the glow of last week's favourable interim figures. The shares gained 7 at 240p. Northern Foods closed 3 firmer at 266p ahead of a two-day visit by analysts to the company, beginning today. NatWest Securities reiterated its buy recommendation on J. Sainsbury yesterday following talks with the company. The shares rose 6 to 456p. Tesco put on 2 at 215p awaiting today's interim figures. Analysts expect profits to be up 7 per cent at Pounds 270m. Grand Metropolitan softened 2 to 425p after Smith New Court trimmed its profits forecast for the year to September 1993. It reduced its figure by Pounds 10m to Pounds 950m to reflect 'disappointing progress in the US spirits market'. Speculation continued that GrandMet is to sell its Chef &amp; Brewer public houses chain. Scottish &amp; Newcastle was mentioned by many dealers as the possible purchaser and shares in the brewer gave up 9 to 470p. A two-way pull was seen in Guinness, which reports interim figures on Thursday. Having declined to 458p at one stage, the shares rallied to end a penny ahead at 466p. Kleinwort Benson was said to be negative on the stock. British Aerospace shares put on a robust performance as talk that the company was in merger talks with defence electronics group GEC resurfaced. The stock gained 11 1/2 at 416p xd, and GEC rose 4 to 343p in trade of 2.3m. Japanese car manufacturer Honda, which has a 20 per cent stake in Rover, BAe's car manufacturing subsidiary, yesterday denied strong weekend press reports that it was to ask BAe to assemble cars with a Honda badge. Aerospace and medical equipment group Smiths Industries firmed 5 to 368p after confirming that it had won a contract to develop the electrical power distribution centres on the F-22, the next generation fighter for the US Air Force. Sentiment was further boosted by a recommendation from Strauss Turnbull for Smiths and the defence sector as a whole. Strauss's Mr Nick Cunningham said: 'Defence earnings are in the process of being rerated as defence cuts are now at the bottom. Smiths is an example of a company that has exercised cost controls. It anticipated and accommodated the downturn well.' Engineering group Meggitt disappointed the market when it reported a 7.8 per cent decline in interim profits, leading analysts to downgrade full-year figures. The shares lost 8 to 100p. Researchers reduced full-year estimates by about Pounds 4m, to Pounds 23m, and one warned: 'The market will continue to be placed on a negative rating because of suspicion brought about by the company's lack of full disclosure.'</p>

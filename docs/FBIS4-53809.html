			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia's deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim,  says there is a need for greater rapport and dialogue between  East and West on equal terms, and he thinks there are enough  elements in the West which are beginning to accept this. Datuk  Sri Anwar, who was in Singapore to attend an international  conference here, was speaking at a news conference before  returning to Malaysia. He said Asian countries should not just  talk about moral decadence of the West. Instead, they also need  to address their own excesses and to recognize growing demand  for greater openness and accountability. Datuk Anwar said he  was worried people would think that progress can be measured  purely by economic indices. He said the Asian renaissance he  has spoken of would also have a cultural and moral dimension.    Datuk Anwar also spoke informally with Prime Minister Goh  Chok Tong at a dinner last night. Referring to Mr. Goh's  comments that he would welcome the North American Free Trade  Agreement being extended to Asian countries, Datuk Anwar said he  would bring this up with Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed.    Turning to a suggestion for a link between the ASEAN Free  Trade Agreement [AFTA] and Australia and New Zealand, Datuk  Anwar said ASEAN needs to get AFTA set up first. Then only can  arrangements or synergy with others in the subregion be  considered.    Datuk Anwar also said Malaysia is supportive of the peace  process in the Middle East. Assuming the process continues and  there is a final settlement between Israel and the PLO, Malaysia  is open to an early recognition of Israel and normalization of  relations.</p>

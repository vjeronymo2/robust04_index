			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Bulgaria tunes in to the voice of America: US influence is growing, particularly among opposition groups REGARDLESS of the time of day or night, visitors to Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, will be struck by an English-language radio station which broadcasts a predictable menu of pop music and brief news items round the clock. This station is not one of the new genre set up by young, up-and-coming Bulgarians. It is the Voice of America, the US government-backed station which was recently allowed by the Bulgarian government to broadcast on Sofia's airwaves. The presence of this American radio station in Bulgaria, a country once regarded as Moscow's most loyal ally, is by no means an isolated example of the growing US interest in this small Balkan country of 8.9m people. Indeed, the opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), a loose alliance of 19 political movements, has forged close links with Washington - sometimes, it would seem, at the expense of strengthening its more natural political, social and cultural ties with Europe. Perhaps the UDF feels indebted to Washington. Organisations sponsored by the Republican and Democratic parties donated more than Dollars 1.7m to the UDF campaign during last June's elections - a lot for a small country which the US ignored for so long. Those funds were earmarked for computers, manifestos, leaflets, and other material to try to break the Communists' stranglehold over the media during the elections. The Bulgarian (former Communist) Socialist party still managed to win. The AFL-CIO, the US trade union movement, has funded Podkrepa, the independent trade union led by Mr Konstantin Trenchev, a declared supporter of Thatcherite policies. Western diplomats believe US officials helped Mr Trenchev manage the street demonstrations and strikes last December which toppled Mr Andre Lukanov's socialist government. And no sooner had the coalition government been formed, than Mr Trenchev immediately endorsed a 'social agreement' between trade unions, the government and employees. Such transatlantic influence is not appreciated everywhere in Bulgaria. In the words of one young Bulgarian journalist: 'It is a bit unusual that at a time when workers face privatisation, unemployment and factory closures, Mr Trenchev receives his advice from the AFL-CIO, and advocates such right-wing policies.' That turmoil was five months ago. Since then, US advisers have continued to flow in. One of them, from the State Department's Agency for International Development, exuded a sense of mission when asked what he was doing in Bulgaria. 'We give aid,' he explained. 'For free?' 'No. You can't give aid away. It would fall into the hands of the Communists. We give it to the private sector (which barely exists). Of course, there's no such thing as free aid.' Other officials said they had come to help with the local government elections, scheduled for the summer. Aid is one thing which is desperately needed in Bulgaria. But it appears to go hand-in-hand with political advice. A UDF official explained how US diplomats often advised the opposition about how to run their meetings and formulate policy. Because of its political diversity, the UDF is struggling to remain united for the forthcoming local and parliamentary elections. Two 'factions' now exist: the centre/liberal bloc, led by Mr Peter Dertliev, leader of the Social Democrats; and a right-wing bloc, which is susceptible to the growing influence of the Monarchists. 'Instinctively we support the right-wing of the UDF,' said one US official. 'But we are heading into big trouble if the Monarchists prevail.' The US also supports the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, the political organisation for the country's 1.5m ethnic Turks which has 22 seats in parliament. As local and general elections approach, the MRF has been brought into the ambit of the UDF. 'I would not deny that the US encouraged us to include the Turks into our movement,' said one UDF parliamentary deputy. 'Because of this, we could lose the elections. The anti-Turkish feeling is easily exploited in this country,' complained Mr Rumen Vodenicharov, a member of the UDF's centre bloc. Bulgarian Foreign Ministry officials admit the Turkish issue is very sensitive, particularly since the ministry is saddled with repairing the damage done by the Communist regime which attempted to assimilate the Turks by force in the early 1980s. Senior Bulgarian officials explain the disproportionately high US profile in terms of a reaction to years of heavy-handed Soviet influence. 'This influence is not something that the US wanted,' explained Mr Dimitar Popov, the prime minister. 'It is something that our people wanted. Our whole life was dominated by the Soviet presence. What is not certain is the extent to which the US can meet the expectations of the Bulgarian people.' Mr Dimitar Ludzhev, the deputy prime minister, said the US was more 'outgoing' than other western nations in its support of the Bulgarian reforms. 'The US was the first to endorse Mr Zhelev when he was chosen as president late last year,' he said. There appears, however, to be a rather different consensus among western diplomats and Bulgarian foreign policy experts. 'I actually think the US is interfering in the internal affairs of this country,' one senior diplomat said. He quoted a US official as saying that the embassy would strongly dissuade Bulgaria from signing any bilateral friendship treaty with Moscow which hinders its defence options. A veteran diplomat in Bulgaria believes the US may have long-term strategic interests there. 'We know the cold war is over. But Turkey, which borders with Bulgaria, is in Nato. The US may think that it is no harm to have an extra ally in this volatile region of Europe. I actually think Bulgaria's interests lie with strengthening its trade, cultural and political ties with Europe. The US is far, far away. Bulgaria could be dumped at any time.'</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBACORE CATCH CLAIMED IN SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> An angler on an overnight sportfishing boat out of San Diego Saturday claimed  the first albacore catch of the the year, an occurrence that usually happens in  the summer months.  </P> <P> An unidentified angler on the sportfisher Prowler landed a 12-pound albacore at  11 a.m., 72 miles south of San Diego on a course to Guadalupe Island.  </P> <P> The Prowler was following a tip from a private boat that reported catching  albacore in the same area a week earlier. Commercial net boats reportedly have  been taking numerous albacore out of San Diego and near Santa Rosa Island in  the Channel Islands west of Oxnard.  </P> <P> Albacore -- a popular fish also known as longfin tuna -- are the only tuna that  can be labeled "white-meat tuna" for commercial canning purposes. They prefer  warmer waters, and the peak season along the West Coast is usually during their  spawning run from July through October.  </P> <P> Jack Mahon of Fishermen's Landing in San Diego said Saturday's catch is not  necessarily indicative of an early run but more likely could be attributed to  unusual and temporary conditions.  </P></p>

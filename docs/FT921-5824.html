			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Survey of North Oxfordshire (5): Vacant possessions - Property development THE much-predicted burst of property development along the newly-opened stretch of the M40 between Oxford and Birmingham has still largely to take place. Cherwell District Council, which covers most of the area through which this segment of the motorway runs, estimates that before the final part was opened in January last year some 300 acres of land along the road had received planning permission for industrial and commercial properties, but not housing or retailing. This broke down into 166 acres in and around Banbury, 94 acres around Bicester and bits and pieces of land spread throughout the rest of the district including Kidlington. Assuming a low density of 20,000 to 25,000 sq ft an acre, which is the average for a B1 light industrial or office development with landscaping and car parking, this would mean at least 1m sq ft of commercial and industrial property or around a third of what could be built along the entire length of the M40 including Oxford and High Wycombe. It might also mean more than a doubling of the amount of new o f f i c e and light industrial space available north of Oxford. The Cherwell local plan says if all the land with planning consent were to be developed around Banbury alone, it could generate between 5,725 and 11,450 jobs. Many of the consents have been for B1 developments, but there are also some for B8-type development - warehouses or what property developers call sheds. There are few B2 consents for heavy industry. In terms of space taken up, B1 developments tend to be low density but more labour-intensive. B8 projects are usually the reverse. Excluding refurbishments and conversions, there has been only about 300,000 sq ft of new commercial and industrial property built between Oxford and Birmingham. The main developments in and around Banbury are the Banbury Business Park, which is three miles outside the town at Adderbury. Phase one of this B1 project amounts to over 120,000 sq ft and has been developed by the Church Commissioners for England. In Banbury itself Blenheim Court, a modern office block of 37,000 sq ft, has been built by Blenheim Land with the Alliance and Leicester, and Waterperry Court, another Blenheim Land development, in conjunction with Heron Hi-Tech. This has 15,800 sq ft of space. In and around Bicester, the 130,000 sq ft Talisman Business Park has been completed by the developers Scottish Metropolitan. Outside Kidlington, Wilson Connolly has built 65,000 sq ft in the first phase of the Oxford Spires business park, which could eventually spread over 15 acres. Many of these developments have yet to find tenants. Banbury Business Park considers itself lucky that Talkland, a cellular communications group, has taken 34,000 sq ft of space. Pearl Assurance has taken a smaller unit and two others are under offer. But none of the suites at Blenheim Court have been let, nor have those in Waterperry Court. The offices on the Oxford Spires estate have also to find their first tenants. It is not so much a question of price. Clients are wary of disclosing what they paid for premises. But Mr John Barton, operations manager of Talkland, said he paid less than Pounds 15 a sq ft for the space on the Banbury Business Park. That is cheaper than, say, Milton Keynes where B1 type property fetches Pounds 16 a sq ft. Blenheim Land is looking for rents of Pounds 18.75 a sq ft for suites at Blenheim Court. 'The offices are particularly well appointed. This rent compares well with similar quality properties in Oxford or Birmingham where you would expect well over Pounds 20,' claims Mr Marcus Hoskins, a director of the Oxfordshire-based developer. Until the vacant new-build is let, it seems unlikely that further sites will be developed at least on a speculative basis. Thus, two sites in Banbury - one of six acres with planning permission owned by Wimpey and another of five acres owned by Standard Life, the assurance group - await a better economic climate before sprouting buildings. Outside Banbury on the motorway, a 21-acre site, owned by local landowners, has planning consent. An eight-acre site of mixed ownership, including the Banbury cricket club, has permission for a hotel and other leisure uses. A further 30-acre site is owned by Amec, with consent for both B1 and B8 use. Outside Bicester, there is a 66-acre site which could become the Bicester Business Park. The developer, London and Metropolitan, owns 35 acres of this, on which it is possible to erect 750,000 sq ft of business space. There are no specific plans at the moment, but Mr Martin Conway of Chesterton, the estate agent acting for the developer, says it is considering the possibility of non-speculative design-and-build B8 warehouses. If action is taken to develop these various sites, does this mean that the M40 above Oxford will become a ribbon of property development? The answer is: probably not. Mr Donald Jelfs, the chairman of Cherwell District Council, says: 'We have taken good care to ensure that the area is not overdeveloped. We have not given too many planning consents in the towns and the developments on the motorway are in clusters rather than strung out along its length.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder because it is an automated procedure that will eliminate inefficient income processing by stock loan counterparties. The proposed rule change also is consistent with DTC's obligation under Section 17A to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible because the proposal provides reports and inquiry functions to participants for their review and reconciliation and provides for the termination of future DTC obligations upon a participants's voluntary or involuntary termination of its membership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DTC perceives no impact on competition by reason of the proposed rule change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DTC's plan to investigate the automation of stock loan income processing was announced to participants in the 1991 DTC Program Agenda which described a stock loan tracking system, similar to DTC's repurchase agreement tracking, that would monitor participant stock loan positions and automatically credit the lender instead of the borrower with dividends or interest due. The system was also noted in the 1992 and 1993 Program Agendas. DTC held a series of meetings with approximately ten broker and bank participants to solicit their comments on plans for the stock loan income-tracking system. These comments were incorporated into the final design of the proposed system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments received on the 1991 Program Agenda included comments from thirteen participants and others on stock loan income-tracking system. (No comments were received on either the 1992 or 1993 Program Agenda entry.) <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Two of those comments raised issues to which responses follow. In its November 27, 1991, comment letter, the Securities Industry Association asked whether DTC could assist participants with the monitoring of substitute payments by a special report. In response, DTC notes that in the proposed system income payments will be coded as stock loan payments on DTC's reports to participants, and the participant will have the ability to identify stock loan income payments on electronic files. In its December 18, 1991, comment letter, the New York Clearing House recommended that DTC develop access to the stock loan income-tracking service through DTC's computer-to-computer facility and mainframe dual host as well as through PTS. In response, DTC notes that the reason codes on DOs that will trigger stock loan income-tracking are accepted by all three means of DO input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These comment letters, all of which were favorable, are cited in Exhibit 5 to the filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Committee of Bosnia-Herzegovina for  Relations with the United Nations warns of a very serious  problem regarding the passage of humanitarian convoys on the  road leading from the Dalmatian coast toward central Bosnia and  Sarajevo. What is involved is the measure taken by the Ministry  of Traffic and Communications and the (?Roads) Public Enterprise  of the so-called Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna that -- in  conformity with the conclusion made by the government of the  so-called Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna on 5 April -- limits  the passage of vehicles of a certain weight along the said road,  introduces a road toll, and limits the travelling time and speed.    These restrictions make it completely impossible for the  UNHCR and its partners to continue supplying central Bosnia and  Sarajevo with food and other kinds of aid. According to the  Information Ministry of Bosnia-Herzegovina, (Karen Kong  abu-Zaid), head of the UNHCR mission of Bosnia, informed Dr.  Hasan Muratovic, chairman of the State Committee of  Bosnia-Herzegovina for Relations with United Nations, about this  problem and asked him for all available measures to be taken  with a view to lifting the said restrictions and enabling normal  supplies.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Insurers hope good publicity is their best policy THE life insurance industry, stung by adverse publicity about high commissions and early surrender of policies, is embarking on its first-ever image advertising campaign. The life company members of the Association of British Insurers are also rethinking their two-year opposition to new rules requiring greater disclosure of charges. According to a confidential memo obtained by the trade magazine Money Week, the ABI wants to 'adopt the high ground' to counter press allegations of high-pressure sales tactics. It says insurers are concerned that 'a number of key media representatives have attacked the industry by drawing attention to high surrenders, poor surrender values, apparent high commission and expense costs, and other areas'. Mr Tony Baker, the ABI's manager of public affairs, said yesterday: 'The industry has had a bad time for publicity over the past year, some of which has been well deserved. But the positive virtues of insurance haven't been stressed enough.' As a result, the ABI's Life Industry Council plans to spend more than Pounds 300,000 on advertisements in quality and trade publications which will warn that insurance is a long-term commitment and should only be purchased by those likely to keep up payments. 'You will think it is an ad that could have been placed by the Consumers' Association,' Mr Baker said. The advertisements might discourage some individuals from buying policies but it would help to ensure that those who do buy them intend to keep them, he said. The ABI memo urges life company members to stress in contacts with journalists and MPs that life policies 'provide support for family units and make women better able to exist independently in society'. Policies can also 'relieve stress caused by financial worries', particularly during a recession. In another effort to get across the 'positive attributes of the industry', the ABI tells members that it can suggest journalists and provide biographical information about them.</p>

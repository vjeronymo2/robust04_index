			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Electronics companies shun local suppliers Electronics companies based in Scotland are obtaining a sharply diminished proportion of their manufacturing materials locally. A survey shows that the share of Scottish made inputs fell from 12 per cent in 1992 to 5 per cent early this year. This is in spite of a 27 per cent rise in the value of the Scottish electronics industry output in the same period, taking it to Pounds 9.3bn. The survey, conducted by Speed (Scottish Partnership in Electronics for Effective Distribution) - a pressure group for better Scottish transport links - found that 37 per cent of inputs measured by value came from the Far East, compared with 24 per cent in 1992. The proportion of continental European supplies fell from 24 per cent to 20 per cent while products from the rest of the UK fell from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. US-made inputs rose to 27 per cent from 24 per cent. The cost of imported materials was Pounds 5.34bn compared with Pounds 4.9bn in 1992. The sharp fall in the proportion of locally made supplies will dismay electronics industry leaders, who last year launched a programme to increase the indigenous content of Scotland's electronics output.</p>

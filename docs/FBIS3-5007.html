			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The chief executive officer of a Pohang Iron and  Steel Co. subsidiary, selected as the major shareholder of the  projected cellular phone business, said yesterday that he would  choose foreign partners in a few months through consultation  with the Federation of Korean Industries [FKI].    "It will take one or two months to tap a few foreign  partners  for the second cellular telephone company," said Kwon Hyok-cho,  president of Sinsegi Mobile Telecomm. "We will soon have  contacts with the FKI and the Communications Ministry to fix the  timetable for our new service."    Sinsegi was awarded a 15 percent stake in the international  consortium for the project at the end of two months of intensive  screening by the FKI that ended Monday. Its rival, Kolon group,  will have a 14 percent interest.    The two large shareholders, which will share management,  have  to present a detailed business plan to the ministry by June 30.    Under an agreement signed by the FKI leadership and the  chairmen of Pohang Iron and Steel and Kolon, three to four  foreign companies will be given a combined share of 20.2 percent  in the "grand consortium" rearranged by the FKI and composed of  over 160 partners.    Kwon strongly suggested that Qualcom and Tactel, both  American companies, with which Sinsegi set up partnerships for  the 1992 and 1994 tenders would be assured of privileges as  "they have high levels of technologies" though their contracts  were nullified by the accord.    His remarks are likely to invite arguments from former  partners of other consortia which failed in the bidding.    The accord just stated, "Foreign enterprises that promise to  offer the most excellent technologies at the cheapest cost and  in more favorable terms will be selected as partners."    A total of 11 foreign companies in the three consortia, each  led by Pohang Iron and Steel, Kolon and Kumho, vied for access  to the business    Foreign partners will be excluded from management. They will  only have the right to recommend one member of the board of  directors who will be in charge of technological service.    The projected company will begin operation in 1996.</p>

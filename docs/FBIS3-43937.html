W. de Klerk have signed an  agreement marking the restoration of legitimate local  government. After addressing the local government summit at the  World Trade Center outside Johannesburg, the two leaders and the  2,200 delegates were presented with an agreement on finance,  services, and service rendering.    The agreement recognizes the recently promulgated Local  Government Transitional Act and commits signatories to promote  and expedite the normalization of local government. It says the  summit marks the start of restoring legitimacy and credibility  to local government finance, services, and service rendering in  particular.    Meanwhile, earlier in the day Mandela called for an end to  the rent and services boycott.</p>

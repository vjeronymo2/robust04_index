This ephemeral annual grass occurs in small, widely disjunct populations in California, Arizona, and New Mexico occupying desert springs or seeps. Parish's alkali grass is threatened by alteration of hydrologic flows due to spring or seep development, water diversion or impoundment, and groundwater pumping; loss of habitat from farming, grazing, and residential construction activities; limited distribution; and low population numbers. This proposal, if made final, would implement Federal protection provided by the Act for Parish's alkali grass. Critical habitat is not being proposed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments from all interested parties must be received by May 27, 1994.

It was described by A.S. Hitchcock in 1928. Parish's alkali grass has also been collected in Arizona and New Mexico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parish's alkali grass is a member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is a dwarf, ephemeral, winter-to-spring, tufted annual that flowers from April to May. The leaves are 1&hyph;3 centimeters (cm) (0.4&hyph;1.2 inches (in)) long, firm, upright, and very narrow. Flowering stems are 2&hyph;20 cm (0.8&hyph;8 in) long and number 1&hyph;25 per plant. The inflorescence is 1&hyph;10 cm (0.4&hyph;4 in) long, narrow, and few-flowered. Each division has 2&hyph;6 perfect flowers, 3&hyph;5 millimeters (mm) (0.1&hyph;0.2 in) long, that separate at maturity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parish's alkali grass is known from widely disjunct localities in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Its small populations occupy a very specific desert habitat of alkaline springs and seeps at elevations of 700&hyph;1,800 meters (m) (2,300&hyph;6,000 feet (ft)). This species is dependent upon continuous spring or seep flows. Population size fluctuates widely in response to climatic conditions and precipitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Arizona, Parish's alkali grass is documented from several historic locations on the Navajo and Hopi Indian reservations. These include a marsh near Tuba City in Coconino County (Phillips and Phillips 1991) and near Shato (Shonto), Navajo County. There are seven currently known sites in Arizona, all from the vicinity of Tuba City. It is unknown whether the historic and currently known locations near Tuba City are precisely the same. The 7 known populations total approximately 400 plants and occupy about 0.1 hectare (ha) (0.2 acre (ac)) of mesic canyon bottom seeps and natural springs. Associated riparian species include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Triglochin  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> spp. (arrowgrass),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Distichlis stricta  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (saltgrass), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Juncus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> spp. (rush). The Shato population has not been relocated; wetland sites may have disappeared in response to severe overgrazing (B. Hevron, Navajo Natural Heritage Program, pers. comm., 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parish's alkali grass presently occurs at two sites in the California Mojave Desert. The first site is located on a privately owned multiple spring complex in San Bernardino County. First collected at these springs in 1915 and later in 1950 (Phillips and Phillips 1991), the species was rediscovered at the spring complex in 1992 (T. Thomas and C. Rutherford, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993). An estimated 100&hyph;200 plants occupy a 50 square (sq) m (500 sq ft) area, 5&hyph;8 m (16&hyph;26 ft) downslope from a leaking earthen impoundment. Associated species include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Anemopsis californica  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (yerba mansa),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Carex  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> spp. (sedge), saltgrass,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperochiron pumilus,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mimulus guttatus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (monkey flower). It is uncertain whether Parish's alkali grass disappeared at this location or was merely overlooked; botanists had searched for it repeatedly (Rutherford, pers. comm., 1993). Alteration of hydrology and loss of habitat could explain why this species remained undetected for 42 years (Phillips and Phillips 1991). There is little historic information on the land use or hydrology of this spring complex from which to evaluate the present condition of the Parish's alkali grass population. However, it is evident that the spring complex was altered at some point to create several ponds for livestock use (Thomas, pers. comm., 1993). Development around this site may have contributed to lowering the water table to the point that the spring stopped or rarely flowed (Phillips and Phillips 1991). Jerrold Davis, of the Bailey Herbarium at Cornell University, noted that the spring itself did not appear to have flowed for a long time (A. Phillips, Museum of Northern Arizona, pers. comm., 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

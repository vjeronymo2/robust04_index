			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / N Korea to resume talks on nuclear programme North Korea yesterday indicated that it would resume talks with the US and South Korea over its nuclear programme in spite of postponing meetings following the death of its president, Mr Kim Il-sung. Mr Kim died last Friday as North Korea began high-level discussions with the US to resolve the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme and two weeks before he was scheduled to meet South Korean president Kim Young-sam in an unprecedented summit meeting. Pyongyang notified South Korea yesterday that an inter-Korean summit would have to be postponed, but it did not say that the meeting should be cancelled. This followed a message to the US suggesting North Korea would reopen talks in Geneva as early as next week, after Mr Kim's funeral on Sunday. The statements seemed to show that Mr Kim Jong-il, the son and designated successor of the late president, would continue to pursue the reconciliation with the west that his father adopted in recent weeks. The country's borders have reportedly been sealed off to foreigners until after Mr Kim's funeral. But the North Korean media reported messages of condolence from world leaders, including statements by US president Bill Clinton and former US president Mr Jimmy Carter, who met Mr Kim last month in an attempt to break the impasse over the nuclear dispute. Mr Clinton expressed confidence yesterday that North Korea will resume talks with the US after 'an appropriate period' to mark the death of President Kim Il Sung. Asked if he was concerned about the younger Kim's character, he said: 'I don't know the younger Kim. And I think you have to be careful in judging people by what others say about them, one way or the other.' South Korean officials suggested they welcomed a delay to the summit since they want to make sure that the political situation in Pyongyang is stable before restarting talks. They predict it might take six months for Mr Kim Jong-il to consolidate his power in the face of opposition from the military and other conservatives who distrust the young generation of technocrats he is believed to represent. North Korea's ruling Workers' party and parliament will hold emergency sessions this week and are expected to appoint Mr Kim as the country's new leader. South Korea said it could accept Mr Kim as North Korea's next leader, in spite of his alleged involvement in planning terrorist attacks against the Seoul government in the 1980s if his appointment ensures continued stability on the Korean peninsula. Officials in Seoul believe that Mr Kim may support gradual economic reforms and improved relations with the US and South Korea in an attempt to save his country from economic collapse.

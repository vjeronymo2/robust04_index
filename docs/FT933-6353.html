			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Schindler lifted by Also's first-time contribution SCHINDLER Holding, the world's second largest elevator manufacturer, said its operating revenues in the first half were up 4.3 per cent to SFr2.2bn (Dollars 1.48bn) due mainly to the inclusion for the first time of its Also computing trading subsidiary. The group said operating profit in the full year was likely to be similar to last year's SFr154.9m, in spite of continuing unfavourable market conditions. Net income would be significantly higher because of financial earnings. Revenues from elevators and escalators were down 1.1 per cent to SFr1.9bn, while rolling stock sales were flat at SFr137m. Also contributed SFr114m to revenues. Leu Holding, a private banking unit of the CS Holding financial services group built around Credit Suisse, has reported more than doubled consolidated net income of SFr92m in the first half. Leu said all divisions contributed to the jump, with profits from trading soaring 89 per cent to SFr89m. Commission income advanced 26 per cent to SFr123m and net interest income rose 17 per cent to SFr134m. Expenses were up 7 per cent to SFr182m, with the result that pre-tax profits advanced 60 per cent to SFr170m. Leu said the number of borrowers in difficulty was still rising, so it raised its bad loan provisions by 20 per cent to SFr36m.</p>

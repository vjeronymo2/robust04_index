			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hydro and Eni in fertiliser deal NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest stock market listed company, and EniChem Agricoltura, part of Italy's Eni group, are to merge their southern European fertiliser activities into a joint venture. The deal, subject to regulatory approval, should be ready by the first quarter of 1994. First-year sales for the new company, which will have some 800 employees, should reach about L800bn (Dollars 487m). The venture will comprise EniChem Agricoltura's two most efficient plants at Ferrara and Ravenna and Hydro's fertiliser unit in Ambes, France, as well as both groups' fertiliser marketing organisations in Italy, southern France, Spain, Greece and Portugal. The merger has been triggered by difficulties in Europe's fertiliser business caused by gross overcapacity and severe price competition. Matters have been exacerbated by lower demand from farmers and a sharp rise in imports, especially from eastern Europe. 'This has led to a substantial over-capacity in the European fertiliser industry, making structural changes necessary,' said Norsk Hydro. It estimates about 4m tonnes of European fertiliser production will be shut down throughout the continent by 1994. Both companies have experienced difficulties with their fertiliser activities. Hydro suffered operating losses of NKr237m (Dollars 32m) on fertiliser sales of NKr16bn in 1992. The previous year, it took a NKr1.5bn restructuring charge for its fertiliser activities. The group has shut down about 2.5m tonnes of fertiliser production capacity. EniChem has been restructuring, although its efforts have been hampered by political difficulties and Italy's tough job protection laws. Its Gela plant in Sicily has been sold, while a unit in Liguria is up for sale. Although the fate of its other facilities is unclear, observers say the two plants being contributed to the joint venture may represent EniChem Agricoltura's only capacity in the fertilisers field.</p>

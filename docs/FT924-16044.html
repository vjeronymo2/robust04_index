			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: EW Fact profit down by 15.4% Although pre-tax profit at EW Fact fell 15.4 per cent in the first half, it was considered a satisfactory result in current trading conditions. The USM-quoted group provides classes of tuition and publication of texts for students preparing for accountancy and banking exams. Turnover in the six months ended June 30 came to Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 2.43m) and the profit to Pounds 482,000 (Pounds 570,000). Earnings per share were 4.57p (5.15p) and the interim dividend is raised to 1.6p (1.21p) partly to redress the imbalance with the final. September term enrolments were marginally lower than last year, but a positive contribution was expected from Davies's College. The group was negotiating the purchase of a 45 per cent investment in Kensington School of Business for Pounds 99,000 cash.</p>

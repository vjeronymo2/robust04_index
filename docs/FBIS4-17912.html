			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by KAZTAG correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko for TASS] </F>   [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] 27 April TASS -- Premier of the  Chinese State Council Li peng said at a news conference in  Alma-Ata devoted to the results of his visit to Turkmenistan,  Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan that his talks with  leaders of these countries were successful and contributed to  further strengthening of friendship, mutual understanding and  the expansion of economic, political and cultural ties.    The Chinese premier pointed out that China accounts for the  smallest number of weapons of mass destruction possessed by  nuclear states. The existence of such weapons has a purely  defensive character and China pledged not to be the first to use  such weapons, the Chinese premier said, reminding of basic  principles of the Chinese military and political doctrine.    The Chinese premier pointed out, in particular, that a  document on the inviolability of existing frontiers was signed  between China and Kazakhstan for the first time. China expects  to sign a similar document soon with Kyrgyzstan, Li Peng said.    Touching upon Russo-Chinese relations, Li Peng described  them  as "useful and fruitful."    Late on Wednesday the Chinese premier had a one-to-one  meeting with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev.    On Thursday morning the Chinese premier and his entourage  will leave Alma-Ata.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (14): Avoid the stress - relax and enjoy it - Emerging destinations / Latin America 'Don't eat the fried chicken at Lima airport.' Seasoned travellers to Latin America are full of anecdotal advice such as this. Everyone who has been to the continent has at least one harrowing tale of 'Montezuma's Revenge'; of taxi touts quick to spot a naive foreigner unaware of the latest currency reform, knocking several digits off; or of a bureaucrat showing abnormal levels of zeal in performing an otherwise simple task. The most important piece of advice to any traveller - business or otherwise  -is: relax. Adopt a Zen-style approach to the whole experience, and it will be more rewarding, enjoyable and, ultimately, successful than might be imagined at first sight. The alternative - becoming stressed - will certainly do neither you, nor your mission, any good at all. Business travel to Latin America is as yet in its infancy, but it is rapidly developing, in the wake of the hundreds of privatisations that have taken place across the region. That means that many aspects of travel to the continent do not match developed world conditions, though anyone who has experienced travel in some parts of the former Soviet Union will find Latin America positively advanced. All generalisations disguise many local variations, of course, but there are certain unifying aspects to travel in Latin America. Those who have already sampled Lima airport's fried chicken may find much of what follows old hat; novices may find it useful. Language: Speaking Spanish - or Portuguese, in the case of Brazil - is naturally a particular advantage, though not an absolute necessity in the case of those with a grasp of English, as English is much more widely understood and used, certainly in a business context, where many top-notch personnel will have spent a period of study in the US. But even a smattering of Spanish (or Portuguese) will be received with great pleasure; Latin Americans are, on the whole, not language snobs, and greatly appreciate foreigners' attempts to speak their language. Security: Some cities, such as Buenos Aires, are astonishingly safe. Others  -including Lima and Rio de Janeiro - can be problematic for the unwary. But physical violence is extremely rare; theft of ostentatiously valuable objects and cash is the main aim of any unfriendly confrontation. Obvious rules apply; when in unfamiliar surroundings, carry minimum necessities, and never try to be heroic. While violence is rare, life is cheap, on occasion. Always carry a little money, since that will at least placate the robber. Avoid illegal drugs; most countries, even when renowned drug-exporters themselves, have very strict anti-drug laws. (See Health, below). UK-based travellers can call the Foreign Office Travel Advice Unit on weekdays between 9.30-4 for the latest information on destinations around the globe, including Latin America. However, that requires persistence as the lines are frequently engaged. But on the whole, the continent's trouble spots have considerably calmed in the last couple of years. Accommodation: Latin America is not overflowing with first-class hotels. Years of economic decline and political unrest have meant that little investment has, until recently, been channelled into a sector which hosted declining numbers of visitors. You can expect to pay developed world prices for what often feels like developing world accommodation and service. This is changing. US hotel groups in particular are fast expanding in the region, though some very important cities, such as Caracas, still lack a truly first-class hotel. Others, such as Buenos Aires, have a highly developed hotel sector, but you will be fortunate to find anything with all the comforts and services you require on a business trip for less than Dollars 200 a night. Some exotic-sounding locations - Montevideo, for example - still have primitive hotel accommodation, though fancy prices. Yet just up the road from Montevideo, at Punta del Este, are some fine hotels and the best beaches in the continent. Internal travel: Some internal airlines, generally those still in state hands, are now widely regarded as lacking perfect safety standards. While this area is clouded in controversy, it is best to check with the aviation authority of one's own country for a view about which airlines are viewed as maintaining all the safety measures required. The continent's rail network is sadly underdeveloped; buses are widely used and generally reliable, the taxi of course is ubiquitous. Hire cars are widely available but again, at developed-world rates and, in my experience, highly unreliable. Opt for taxis for city travel; most locally-based companies will be able to provide a chauffeur-driven car to help minimise hassles. Remember that the continent is a vast area; Argentina is geographically the same size as India. Health: Despite the opening comment from a traveller who has spent the last decade shuttling between the UK and the continent, seriously debilitating problems are very rare. The usual, obvious things apply as with any developing region: consider avoiding salads and fruit you do not peel yourself, stick to bottled water, eat food which is simple, bland and well-cooked. Some visitors regard the region's (highly variable) cuisine as delightful, others differ. Caracas, for example, might be a nightmare to get around in by car; but its restaurants are plentiful and excellent. In high altitude places such as Bolivia, consider chewing coca-leaf (not illegal from street vendors in small quantities) - it does help ease altitude sickness. Currency: Most Latin American countries - Brazil is an exception - have reined-in the rampant inflation of the 1980s, though whether it is simply a case of having trapped the devil in a jam-jar is yet to be seen. Stable, if occasionally over-valued, local exchange rates now generally prevail. In any case, the US dollar is the universal mechanism of exchange; take traveller's cheques for safety, of course. All major credit cards - and thousands of others - are widely accepted. Guides: Bookshops are now jammed solid with guides to the region, but only one is imperative, despite its occasionally infuriating tendency to lag behind recent developments. The book is the South American Handbook, published by Trade and Travel Publications. Potted histories, maps, hotel lists, advice are all there. Don't expect its price guides to be too accurate however; this is still a region of some volatility.</p>

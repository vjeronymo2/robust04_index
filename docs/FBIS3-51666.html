			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A PNP [Peruvian National Police] National  Antinarcotics Directorate (Dinandro) spokesman has said that  U.S. assistance in the fight against drug trafficking in Upper  Huallaga has been cut back, but not eliminated. The U.S.  Embassy also said that the U.S. Government has not suspended  that assistance.    Our source said that the fact that the 10 UH-1H and Bell 212  helicopters owned by the U.S. Department of State had been moved  to the Pucallpa base does not mean that helicopter operations  have been suspended.    It was reported that the helicopters have more space to  operate from Pucallpa.    The spokesman said that if required, four helicopters can  fly  to Tarapoto and take Dinandro personnel to the area chosen for  an intervention.    If helicopter support is required in Ciudad Constitucion  (Junin) similar trips can be arranged.    It was also reported that helicopters can depart from their  base in Pucallpa and easily reach the La Convencion (Cuzco)  valley or Palmapampa (Ayacucho jungle zone), which are areas of  intense coca production.    The sources reported that two planes that the U.S.  Department  of State had placed at the disposal of the Peruvian police for  the transportation of personnel and equipment from Lima to the  "Santa Lucia" antinarcotics base (Upper Huallaga) have already  returned to the United States.    That was the reason why the climate in "Santa Lucia" was one  of uncertainty and scarcity.    The Air Force was making regular flights to that base  carrying gasoline, food, and personnel.    The fuel for generators used in the Upper Huallaga base, as  well as food shipped to the PNP and FAP and the $90 per month  incentive for police personnel assigned to Upper Huallaga, have  also been curtailed.    The "Santa Lucia" base has, however, an FAP M-17 helicopter  with greater capacity for carrying personnel, which can be used  for helicopter antinarcotic operations.    It was reported, however, that those operations are  difficult  to carry out during these months due to the bad weather  prevailing in the jungle zone.</p>

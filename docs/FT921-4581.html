			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / International Company News: Cadbury SA expands by 33.5% CADBURY Schweppes South Africa, part of the UK confectionery, food and soft drinks group, reported a 33.5 per cent increase in earnings in 1991 despite the poor performance of the national economy. Turnover rose 13.4 per cent to R610m, while operating profit went up by 28.6 per cent to R60.6m. Attributable income was higher at R46.8m (R35.1m). Mr Peter Bester, managing director, said that there was a marginal fall in sales volumes, but benefits from rationalisation and integration of Chapelat-Humphries, the sugar confectionery business acquired in 1989, and improved internal efficiencies and a better product mix had contributed to the improved operating performance. The remaining 17.5 per cent minority holding in Chapelat was bought for R19.4m, effective April 1992. Benefits from the Chapelat-Humphries acquisition allowed Cadbury's to record considerably higher operating profits despite difficult trading conditions and some labour difficulties.</p>

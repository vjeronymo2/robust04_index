			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Grid shows tensions THE European Monetary System grid is a good indicator of where tensions lie in the exchange rate mechanism and has changed markedly since Friday night. Following its devaluation over the weekend, the Italian lira is at the top of the grid because it is the strongest EMS currency when measured by its central rate against the Ecu. The D-Mark is back at the centre of the grid, having been at the top for most of the last fortnight. As the hard currency of Europe, it should be at the centre when the system is operating properly, allowing the exchange rates and monetary policies of other countries to be altered around it. Sterling, at the bottom of the grid, seems increasingly under pressure. It is 81 percentage points below its central Ecu rate. A rule of thumb among EMS nations is that when a currency diverges more than 75 points from its central Ecu rate, its central bank should take measures to redress the balance.</p>

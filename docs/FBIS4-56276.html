			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Abraham Rivero Perez] </F>   [Text] While the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS), headed by  Senator Freddy Munoz, supported the proposal by Henrique Salas  Romer, the governor of the State of Carabobo, concerning  amendments to the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors,  Jose Miguel Uzcategui, the coordinator of Convergencia  [Convergence Movement], did not state his position. However, he  said that in the next few days he will review the situation with  the national leadership of Convergencia.    At a meeting held with Freddy Munoz, the MAS leader,  Henrique  Salas Romer, the governor of the State of Carabobo, repeated his  concern about the removal from office of Edgar Sayago and Ovidio  Gonzalez. He added that amending the Law on the Election and  Removal of Governors is an urgent matter, since the "spectacle"  of dismissing a state governor, in addition to cheapening the  will of the people and deepening the feeling that there is a  power vacuum, harms the prestige of the process of  decentralization.    Freddy Munoz, the secretary general of the MAS, stated that  the removals of governors from office are "a sign of insanity, a  sign of political machinations, a sign of illegitimacy" which  should be ended. He added that his party would be actively  engaged in preventing "the perversion of the democratic spirit"  and in amending the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors.    Salas Romer said: "The juridical foundations are solid  enough, and our proposals to all political parties have been  aimed at reaching agreement on a partial amendment of the Law on  the Election and Removal of Governors. Therefore, the necessary  constitutional urgency has arisen to place a more certain  juridical framework around the exercise of the functions for  which we were elected." On the other hand Deputy Jose Miguel  Uzcategui stated that, although the amendment of the Law on the  Election and Removal of Governments is important, his party will  decide what to do "to prevent more elements of uncertainty from  being introduced in connection with regional governments."  Although he recognized that he has a favorable opinion of Salas  Romer, he stated that he could give no guarantees regarding the  approval of his "Memorandum of Accounts," since it should be  reviewed and discussed with regional legislators. Salas Romer  stated that if a political agreement is reached with all of the  political parties, in a short time it will be easy to develop a  legally acceptable way of helping the governors to manage their  affairs on behalf of the people, without doing damage to the  power of the legislative assemblies, given the fact that their  functions "are important in watching over and checking on the  performance of the governor."    Salas Romer, as well as Jesus Rondon Nucete, governor of the  State of Merida, reviewed with the Committee on Regional  Development the political crisis caused by the latest removals  of state governors, agreeing that "there should be a  relationship of cause and effect in the removal of governors  from office."    The provision of a referendum for removing governors  appeared  to be a practical alternative, both for the governors as well as  for the legislative assemblies. Despite the fact that Salas  Romer has his reservations about the percentage of the vote to  be required in such a case, Rondon Nucete, the governor of the  State of Merida, indicated that it would be enough to add to the  Law on the Election and Removal of Governors a "democratic  standard" to regulate the referendum.</p>

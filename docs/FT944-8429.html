			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Over from Dover - Jill James recommends shops and eating places in north France Mary Tudor may have had Calais engraved on her heart but I shall have it tattooed on my Wellington boots. Arriving in a particularly nasty squall last month, for Le Shopping, I found it a little hard to explain to my family why we were forsaking the pleasures of London for a week in the Pas-de-Calais. The reasons were looking even ropier after two indifferent and expensive meals at recommended restaurants. But then came the turning point. At my 11-year-old's insistence we booked in to an old favourite, the Atlantic Hotel in Wimereux, a small resort a couple of miles from Boulogne run by Aron and Marie-France Misan. Here we ate some of the best food of our stay - including a dish that I thought it would be very difficult to make a success of - foie gras stuffed with lobster and spinach, which worked surprisingly well. Lobster is the speciality of the house and so, in season, is fruits-de-mer. Out of season the menu is commendably short. Expect to pay about Pounds 35 to Pounds 45 a head with wine. Hotel accommodation is modest. And now, for those of you on the annual drink-buying pilgrimage, here is a selection of the very best restaurants and food shops in Calais and Boulogne (see panel opposite). Necessarily it is entirely subjective, gleaned from many visits. Mostly I have either visited the shops and restaurants personally - and paid for meals and goods out of my own money - or they come highly recommended from friends and colleagues. I have concentrated on small, good quality businesses, many family-owned. Mammouth and the rest of the hypermarkets you can seek for yourselves. You should find all the shopkeepers I have mentioned happy to greet you - and for a very good reason: 'The British visitor represents 15 per cent of the general turnover of the trade in Calais,' says Gerrard Baron, chairman of the town's Chamber of Commerce. When I popped in to see him last month, a group of the town's shopkeepers were in a basement room busily honing their English language skills in order to provide an even better service to visitors. So good shopping and bon appetit.</p>

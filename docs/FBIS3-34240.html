			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] India has charged Pakistan with adopting a  conscious policy of ethnic cleansing of religious minorities.  In a hard hitting statement in Geneva, the finance minister,  Dr. Manmohan Singh said discrimination against the minorities is  in-built in Pakistan's Constitution. Terming Islamabad's record  on human rights as abysmal, he observed that Pakistan's  championship of the cause of Kashmiris lacks credibility. Dr.  Manmohan Singh said Pakistan continues to remain in illegal  occupation of one-third of Jammu and Kashmir in flagrant  violation of UN resolutions. The finance minister reaffirmed  India's commitment to peace and stability in the region. It is  in this spirit, he said, that New Delhi made six proposals,  including a draft agreement on peace and tranquility along the  Line of Control.    The Congress-I says Jammu and Kashmir cannot revert back to  the 1953 status. The party spokesman, Mr. Chandulal  Chandrarkar, told reporters in New Delhi today that the clock  cannot be put back. He said the accession of Jammu and Kashmir  to India is final and irreversible.    The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader, Mr. Atal Behari  Vajpayee, has welcomed the prime minister's suggestion to freeze  the Kashmir issue for the time being and to hold talks with  Pakistan to improve relations. Talking to newspersons in  Lucknow today, he said Pakistani propaganda against India should  be countered effectively. Mr. Vajpayee said the people in the  Kashmir valley are fed up with terrorist activities.</p>

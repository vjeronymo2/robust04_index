			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FILM FINANCING  </P> <P> Rani Josephine de Castille (Letters, Oct. 22) writes that she is producing a  black-oriented family film but that potential distributors and financiers are  urging she fill it with negative stereotyping.  </P> <P> I have a suggestion: Forget the big-name companies and seek out smaller, more  serious independent organizations that might be willing to back such an  unconventional project.  </P> <P> There is certainly a market -- millions of black moviegoers would find such  films a dream come true.  </P> <P> There are also plenty of individuals -- including this writer -- who have done,  or are working on, similarly positive projects.  </P> <P> Since Megabucks Hollywood has proven itself incapable of producing valid  black-oriented entertainment without Cosby, Murphy or Hall, the obvious  solution is to go to companies unbound by conventional restrictions.  </P> <P> I have often talked with enterprising souls about starting black distribution  organizations, and maybe even a black theater chain, but since that will never  be, the above seems the most logical way to go.  </P> <P> L.M.

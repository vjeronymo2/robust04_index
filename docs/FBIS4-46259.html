			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for </F> the Hamas Movement, by Samih al-Ma'ayitah in Damascus -- date  not given]    [Excerpts] Al-Ma'ayitah: The topical issue is  how Hamas will deal with the self-rule authority. The Movement  has to choose between confrontation, understanding, or a truce.  What option have the Movement's bodies adopted?    Ghawshah: This issue is complex and wide-ranging.  I will try to discuss the basic topics dealing with it. First,  let us say that the stage of theorization about what stand Hamas  will adopt if the Palestinian authority is imposed and the  Palestinian police enters the self-rule areas is over. All the  Palestinian forces, those who supported or opposed the peace  process which started in Madrid and ended with the Cairo  agreement are now treading on a minefield. They all should think  before taking any step to avoid an explosion that would destroy  everything. Hamas has taken measures to counter this stage.  The Hamas Movement has resorted to all that is in its power to  confront the march of capitulation which began in Madrid, and  succeeded in obstructing and delaying this march. There is a  mighty force behind this process, represented by the United  States, the Zionist forces, and the regimes loyal to them, and  these forces succeded in imposing the Cairo and Oslo agreement  on the Palestinian people. The hands of the clock cannot be set  back, but we can make proposals that would prevent the explosion  and at least limit the losses. We in the Hamas Movement  approach the Palestinian authority and the police force with  caution. We will judge them on the basis of their deeds and  not their words, especially sweet talk which is rife at the  present time. We believe that avoiding confrontation is a  national and religious duty by which all should abide.    The Hamas Movement has translated this into a political  stand  and decision not to confront the Palestinian authority and  police force. We will deal with them in a civilized and peaceful  manner by highlighting the mistakes, secrets, and loopholes in  the Cairo and Oslo agreements and mobilizing the masses and  forces in and outside the territories to reject this agreement  and foil it with civilized methods. This is the stand of the  Palestinian opposition, represented in the Alliance of  Palestinian Forces. The Palestinian police force is part of the  Palestinian people. Most of its members are from the Palestine  Liberation Army [PLA] and had fought the Zionists in many  places, particularly in Lebanon during the Zionist invasion of  that country. We are fully convinced and we know that this  police force has decided not to confront the Palestinian people  with bullets. But the overwhelming circumstances to which I  referred at the beginning of the interview have forced the PLA  to become a police force that carries out joint patrols with the  Jews, and whose members eat with the Jews and live with them and  normalize their relations with them. We are fully convinced that  the members of this police force will not open fire on the  children of the stones or the strugglers whose role has been  instrumental in achieving the partial withdrawal from the Gaza  Strip, and whose role will also be instrumental in achieving any  future withdrawal from the West Bank. This has taken place  thanks to the blood they had shed and their sacrifices and not  as a result of the intelligence and ability of the negotiators.  [passage omitted]    Al-Ma'ayitah: Major General Nasr Yusuf has made a  statement on the issue of arms collection. As for yourself, you  have said that this issue is taboo and a red line. Do you  believe that Maj. Gen. Yusuf's statement was meant to be  implemented? Or do you think it was made merely for media  purposes?    Ghawshah: [passage omitted on Yusuf's background]  The arms issue is indeed sensitive and important. It  constitutes a red line. There are various weapons at stake.  The most important of these are the weapons used by the  mujahidin affiliated with the al-Qassam Battalions and other  Palestinian forces. These weapons were only used in resistance  to occupation troops and settlers. Everybody is well aware that  weapons are dear to the mujahidin. The mujahidin's weapons are  sacred. They should remain in the hands of the mujahidin. The  mujahidin's right to bear arms is enshrined in all temporal  charters and heavenly faiths. Additionally, the collection of  arms from the Palestinian people is unacceptable. [passage  omitted]    Al-Ma'ayitah: What about the Hamas Movement's  military activities since the start of efforts to implement the  autonomy agreement?    Ghawshah: The Hamas Movement has explained that it  will uphold its principled Islamic jihad stand. Our jihad will  continue as long as the occupation of our territories is  maintained. [passage omitted] The selection of Zionist targets  for attacks is made at the operations room of the al-Qassam  Battalions in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian  territories occupied in 1948.    Al-Ma'ayitah: Has Hamas thought of launching an  opposition political party? Has it considered the idea of  cooperating with some forces and figures to launch such a party  so that it may deal politically with the self-rule authority?    Ghawshah: [passage omitted] As regards the Hamas  Movement, this issue is under consideration, particularly since  it was dictated by the developments of the current phase.  However, the launching of parties has its pros and cons; and  the cons might outweigh the pros. The launching of parties that  implicitly approve the Palestinian-Israeli agreement might be  facilitated. [passage omitted on Palestinian politics]    Al-Ma'ayitah: It is now three years since the  opposition was launched under the name of the 10 factions, and,  more recently, the Alliance of Palestinian Factions [APF] was  formed. Don't you think that this is as far as these factions  will go -- a ceiling that is not measuring up to the challenges?    Ghawshah: You may recall that in late 1993,  following the signing of the Oslo accord, Hamas pressed for a  provisional Palestinian leadership to take over. Regrettably,  however, a number of the Palestinian factions had their sights  set too low. We were so anxious for the 10 factions' formula to  get off the ground that we went along with a formula based on  political tasks rather than a political agenda, governed by a  majority consensus rather than unanimity. We knew that this was  not exactly the right formula, and hoped that it will be  developed. Hamas, however, found itself a loner in the field,  particularly regarding the intifadah and militarily. When they  demanded that a combined nationalist-Islamic command be  instituted inside the homeland, we demanded confidence- building  initiatives on their part. For example, having refused to  consider an alliance with Islamic forces in the elections for  the Dentists Association in Gaza so that we may beat the  capitulationist candidates, the democratic forces should not go  on to call for a unified command. How can can there be a  unified command if these other factions are not active in terms  of jihad and the intifadah. This and other obstacles have stood  in the way of refining the APF's formula. [passage omitted]    The APF formula needs reformulation in light of new factors.  It may be better to establish a wide opposition front during  the next stage--a front which has a definite concept and in  which every one in the occupied territories takes part with all  his might--and to activate the Palestinian diaspora. The  Palestinian people in the diaspora, however, are the big losers.    Al-Ma'ayitah: Is Hamas' decision to continue the  intifadah still valid or is it under study and reconsideration?    Ghawshah: There is no doubt that the new era, as  well as epitomizing the self-rule on the ground, will affect the  intifadah, which is aimed at ending the occupation. As a  result, the intifadah activity will drop in areas from which the  Zionist forces withdraw. However, the intifadah's activities are  numerous. Some activities are expected to reduce in the  self-rule area after the end of the occupation, and some other  activities will lead to friction with the self-rule authority  and its supporters. The Hamas Movement will study and assess  these matters, as well as intifadah activities, to secure the  desired results and eliminate negative factors. Hamas may call  for the reduction of some intifadah activities that have no  impact on the overall conflict with the Zionists, especially  within the self-rule area. But jihad and resistance will  continue against the occupation everywhere.    Al-Ma'ayitah: Is Hamas satisfied by the  interaction of Islamic peoples and movements with the intifadah  and Hamas' role?    Ghawshah: [passage omitted] The Islamic movements  in the cordon states have a basic role to play in supporting  jihad activity undertaken by Hamas inside Palestine. These  movements's political, popular, and militant performance has not  reached the level required in the Islamic and political arenas.</p>

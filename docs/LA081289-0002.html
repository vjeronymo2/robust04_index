			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILLIAM PRATER; JAILED FOR LIFE IN UNIONIST'S MURDER  </P> <P> William Jackson Prater, a former United Mine Workers official who was serving a  life term in prison for his role in the 1969 slayings of union dissident Joseph  (Jock) Yablonski and his family, died in his cell Friday, officials said.  </P> <P> Prater was found early in the morning at the State Correctional Institution at  Dallas in Luzerne County. A prison spokesman said Prater, who was 70,  apparently died of natural causes.  </P> <P> "He had been in poor health for some time," Roy VanWhy said. Prater had been  confined to a wheelchair since suffering a stroke in 1983.  </P> <P> Prater was sentenced in 1973 and was serving three life sentences for the  murders.  </P> <P> Yablonski, 59, was shot to death along with his wife, Margaret, 57, and their  25-year-old daughter, Charlotte, at their Clarksville home in southwestern  Pennsylvania on New Year's Eve, 1969. Yablonski had lost an election for UMW  president earlier that December.  </P> <P> His opponent, then-incumbent UMW President W. A. (Tony) Boyle, was later  convicted of ordering the assassination. Boyle's first conviction was  overturned and he was convicted a second time. He died in May, 1985, while  serving three life terms.  </P> <P> Prater, formerly of LaFollette, Tenn., was a mid-level union official accused  of helping to plan the killing and accumulating $20,000 in union funds to pay  the assassins. He later helped prosecutors convict Boyle.  </P> <P> The three men accused of carrying out the killings, Aubran (Buddy) Martin,  Claude Vealey and Paul Gilly, were all convicted and sentenced to life in  prison.  </P> <P> Prater served 16 years in a federal prison before being paroled, but then was  transferred to the state prison at Pittsburgh in September, 1988, to serve life  terms imposed under state law and was moved to Dallas later that year.  </P></p>

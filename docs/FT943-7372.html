			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Russia to sign pact with China Russia and China, for decades rivals for the leadership of the Communist world, yesterday took another step towards reconciliation when Russian officials announced that the two states will sign in September an agreement not to target strategic missiles at one another. Mr Mikhail Bely, a Russian foreign ministry official, said the missile agreement would be one of a number of deals to be concluded during a ground-breaking visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Moscow next month. The agreement echoes similar documents Russia has signed with the United States and the UK. The emerging Sino-Russian detente points to a lessening of military and political tensions between the two states, which reached a peak with border clashes in the 1960s. But economic competition between the two countries, particularly in the booming Pacific Rim region where Russia has restricted the entry of Chinese traders, is intensifying.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Baldwin shows advance of 8% to Pounds 2.47m PRE-TAX PROFITS at Baldwin, the holidays, printing and properties group, rose 8.2 per cent from Pounds 2.28m to Pounds 2.47m in the year to end-October 1992. The group also took a Pounds 1.1m extraordinary provision against Baldwin's legal battle over the value of a 6 per cent stake in London Clubs International. The company is suing other shareholders in London Clubs, who acquired Baldwin's 6 per cent investment, for substantial damages. They acquired the stake for Pounds 54,000 after the Gaming Board objected to the renewal of the casino company's gaming licence in 1991. In 1989 Baldwin paid some Pounds 900,000 for the holding. Any damages awarded would be recorded as an exceptional gain and included in pre-tax profits once the new accounting standard on exceptional and extraordinary items comes into force. When the 1993 results are reported, Baldwin will be obliged to restate its 1992 figures consistent with the new standard, including the provision in pre-tax profits. Group turnover increased 8 per cent to Pounds 29m (Pounds 27m), and operating profits rose by a quarter from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 2.3m. But net interest receivable dropped from Pounds 449,000 to Pounds 180,000. Tour operating activities increased profits by 50 per cent, from Pounds 1.49m to Pounds 2.23m. Profits from print fell from Pounds 271,000 to Pounds 123,000 and property profits fell from Pounds 218,000 to Pounds 76,000. Earnings per share rose 18 per cent to 9.8p (8.3p), and a dividend of 3p is proposed, an increase of 0.2p on the total for 1991 of 2.8p. No interim dividend was paid because of the 'unclear' position surrounding the investment in London Clubs.</p>

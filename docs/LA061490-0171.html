			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UNLV ATHLETIC DIRECTOR TO RESIGN DEC. 31;  </P> <P> COLLEGES: ROTHERMEL'S 'UNEXPECTED' MOVE IS NOT LIKELY TO INFLUENCE THE NCAA'S  INVESTIGATION OF BASKETBALL PROGRAM.  </P> <P> Brad Rothermel, the athletic director who has guided the Nevada Las Vegas  program for the past 10 years, has announced his resignation, effective Dec.  31.  </P> <P> "I just felt it was time for someone else to drive us into the year 2000,"  Rothermel said at a news conference Wednesday.  </P> <P> He will return to teaching as a professor in the UNLV School of Health,  Physical Education and Recreation.  </P> <P> Rothermel said a major goal had been to head a program involving a national  champion. That goal was accomplished April 2, when the Runnin' Rebels won the  NCAA basketball championship at Denver, defeating Duke in a lopsided title  game.  </P> <P> Rothermel said he decided Feb. 17 to leave the post, but withheld an  announcement because he wanted to mull over the decision.  </P> <P> His announcement came as UNLV awaits word on the results of an NCAA  investigation into the school's basketball program; the results are expected  this month.  </P> <P> Jim Haney, commissioner of the Big West Conference, called Rothermel's  resignation "unexpected" but said he did not anticipate that it would have any  effect on the NCAA investigation.  </P> <P> "I don't think the fact that there's been a change at the athletic director's  level will change their approach significantly, but I'm just guessing," Haney  said. "I think that because of the fact that he's planning to stay there and  remain in the same position until the end of year, there probably will not be  much impact."  </P> <P> The other members of the Big West Conference, among them Cal State Fullerton  and UC Irvine, are affected greatly by UNLV's fortunes because of the national  prominence and television revenue the Runnin' Rebel basketball program has  brought to the conference.  </P> <P> Rothermel and University President Robert Maxson addressed questions about the  possibility of UNLV leaving the conference, saying that becoming an independent  is not a viable option.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't rule out any different league alignments," Maxson said. "I am very  mindful we're very important to the Big West Conference and the Big West  Conference is important to us."  </P> <P> Haney praised Rothermel for maintaining balance between the interests of UNLV  and the interests of the conference during his tenure.  </P> <P> "Brad is highly respected among the conference directors and presidents," Haney  said. "He is held in very high regard."  </P> <P> Rothermel said that when he came to UNLV, the university had a $250,000 deficit  in its athletic program. He said the program has operated in the black every  year since then, finishing last year with a $1.5 million surplus. He said this  year's surplus will be even larger because of revenue from the Rebels' NCAA  appearances.  </P> <P> Rothermel headed the latest attempt to boost the school's football program to  national prominence, hiring Notre Dame assistant Jim Strong in December to  replace Wayne Nunnely, who was fired.  </P> <P> Maxson praised Rothermel's work and said he talked him out of taking an  athletic director's job at another major school three years ago.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by a staff correspondent with agency dispatches] </F>   [Excerpt] Jordan on Wednesday [8 June] described as highly  important and significant the agreement the Kingdom reached with  Israel to start negotiations on demarcating their borders and  water sharing, issues the Jewish state has been avoiding since  the begining of the Arab-Israeli peace process in September 1991.    Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said: "We have affirmed  one basic principle: The ceasefire lines will change to  international and recognised borders, which stress the unity of  Jordanian territories, preempt any designs on them and preserve  the Jordanian entity."    He said the two sides had based their agreement on two main  points: That the British mandate coordinates will be the  reference for defining the border and that the borders will be  delineated on the ground.    Dr. al-'Anani was talking to reporters after two days of  Jordanian-Israeli talks in Washington under the auspices of a  trilateral commission which also includes the United States  produced the agreements.    The information minister said another major breakthrough was  an agreement to work out a fair division of the waters of the  Jordan and Yarmuk rivers now being exploited by Israel at the  expense of Jordan. Regional and international conventions will  be the basis for determining the share of each side, he said.    "We also agreed to look at the Jordan Valley project as a  comprehensive project to discuss the development of its  infrastructure and to develop large projects which will be  discussed for the future," he said.    "We agreed to conduct a number of studies that will pave the  way to establish large development projects in the area," Dr.  al-'Anani said.    In this context the major project is a desalination project  linked to a Jordanian-proposed canal connecting the Red Sea to  the Dead Sea and this proposal will be studied closely, Dr.  al-'Anani said.    The minister said a Jordanian agreement to accept the  presentation of an American paper on the Jordan Valley did not  mean that the Kingdom was dropping its reservations over  launching such projects before the border and water issues are  settled. "In the framework of studies at the present time, we  cannot think of such projects except after reaching an agreement  on the border issue," Dr. al-'Anani said.    Regarding the economic issues, especially in light of the  agreement reached between the Palestine Liberation Organisation  (PLO) in April on banks and trade, the Jordanian side clarified  the implications of such an agreement on the Jordanian economy,  because it limits, to a certain degree, Jordan's freedom of  exporting its goods to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Dr.  al-'Anani said.    The Israeli side agreed to the expansion of Jordanian  exports  to the Palestinian territories and also agreed that if there  were any proposals in the future to issue a Palestinian  currency, Jordan would be notified before hand to give it  sufficient time to take measures to protect its currency.    "It also became clear that there were issues to be discussed  trilaterally: A proposal was made calling for a  Jordanian-Israeli- Palestinian economic committee to discuss  some of the issues in order to develop it and to finalise it in  a proper way," Dr. al-'Anani said.    "In my opinion, these are very important results for Jordan  because it achieves and contributes to asserting the geographic  and demographic unity of Jordan," the minister told reporters.    The delegates from Israel and Jordan signed three documents  setting out a detailed agenda for further talks.    The first text concerns water, energy and the environment,  the second addresses security and the third concerns the border  and other territorial issues.    The security text pledges that Israel and Jordan will draw  up  security arrangements and discuss confidence measures between  the two sides.    The two countries decided to begin negotiations on their  border dispute in July, together with talks on development  projects.    The final border decision must refer to the boundary drawn  up  in 1922 by Britain, which then held the Palestine mandate, when  it set the borders for Transjordan.    Jordan hopes to regain a strip of about 360 square  kilometres  from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Dead Sea, as well as two square  kilometres south of Lake Tiberias in the Jordan valley.

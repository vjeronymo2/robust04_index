			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria by </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given; from "The News"  newscast -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] How does a Pereira native, who began his  political career as a Pereira alderman, feel when he becomes the  OAS secretary general in Washington?    [Gaviria] Many things have happened throughout these years.  All I can say is that I truly did not prepare myself to be a  diplomat nor am I an expert in that area. I believe that what  has happened recently is that the world's agenda has changed  significantly. As a result, people like me, who are interested  in economic matters, have begun to stand out in the current  world.    [Reporter] You are leaving the Narino Palace to assume the  position of OAS secretary general in Washington. Is it possible  that you will be coming back from the OAS to the Colombian  Presidency?    [Gaviria] [laughs] I am not thinking of that now. It is very  difficult to think about my life five years from now. In any  event, I am not thinking of my political future in Colombia or  anything similar.    [Reporter] Do you know that yesterday, when people were  leaving the OAS headquarters, many Colombians who were carrying  the flag and singing the national anthem asked Noemi or rather  called on Noemi Sanin to be a presidential candidate?    [Gaviria] The truth is that yesterday's victory is  basically a victory for Noemi and the Colombian Foreign  Ministry. There is no doubt about that. This is why I am  somewhat bothered by references to pressure from other countries  and the United States. Yesterday's victory was a victory earned  by Noemi and the Colombian Foreign Ministry, as well as a  victory earned through her hard work and the way in which she  toured this continent so many times, making telephone calls,  working, calling, explaining our positions.    [Reporter] Do you see her as a person with the ability to be  a presidential candidate?    [Gaviria] She has the ability to become anything she wants.  If this hemisphere can recognize her ability and her great  victory, it is obvious that Noemi has the ability to be  president and many other things.    [Reporter] The United States invaded Grenada and nothing  happened. It invaded Panama and nothing happened. You will  have reached the OAS secretary general's office with the basic  support of the United States. Will you be able to stand up to  the United States the day the United States again attempts  something like this?    [Gaviria] These things happened because of actions --  actions  that the Latin Americans have rejected and do not agree with,  such as the actions you have mentioned -- but they also occurred  because of our lack of action. Both sides are to blame.    We have overlooked some of the problems that have occurred  on  this continent. We left them alone, as if they were the United  States' problems, and we ended up with the worst possible  solutions. Yes, these things happened, but the Latin American  countries are also to blame, because we viewed these problems  with a degree of indifference. Today, on this continent, the  defense of democracy is everyone's responsibility. We all have  to work to defend democracy on this continent.    [Reporter] Does this mean we will no longer see U.S.  unilateral shows of strength?    [Gaviria] I think unilateral actions are totally  undesirable,  and I believe that in today's post-Cold War period, no one is  thinking about unilateral actions. The actions of the United  Nations itself are the best demonstration that everyone is  thinking about multilateral actions, but, in order to take  multilateral actions, all of the countries involved must have a  willingness to act. In Latin America, we must build on this  will.    [Reporter] Let us return to personal questions. Do you  imagine groups of people from Pereira will now be going to  Washington?    [Gaviria, laughing] I do not think so. I think they must be  happy as many other people in Colombia are, but I do not think  they are going...    [Reporter, interrupts] The editorial in Pereira's LA TARDE  newspaper reads: Pereira, we are going [words indistinct].    [Gaviria, laughing] They are probably happier in my  hometown.    [Reporter] The people here in Colombia felt your victory was  Colombia's victory. Do you realize that? They did not feel it  was a victory for Gaviria but a victory for the country.    [Gaviria] That is right, and, in a number of ways, I believe  it should be viewed this way. Because we experienced the  problems of violence, guerrillas, and drug trafficking in recent  years, we began to feel uneasy. Within this same period of  time, however, we made progress in our international policy,  particularly in our effort to sell Colombia as a country that is  modernizing, that is changing, that is promoting political and  economic change. There is a general recognition of this  attitude and a recognition of Colombia's independent thinking on  a number international issues.    [Reporter] Are you not going to miss the people, the  country,  and the food?    [Gaviria] I will miss them. Of course, I do not think I will  miss the problems of the presidency. [laughs] I hope no one will  escape, and I hope the lights will not go out on me. [sentence  as heard]</p>

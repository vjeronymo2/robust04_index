			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Kim Boldokhonov] </F>   [Excerpts] Ulaanbaatar, 19 Apr -- The political  confrontation in Mongolia is heating up. Hunger strikes under  way on two of the squares in the capital, and people are getting  up on soap boxes, one group demanding the government should  resign, and the other defending it.    Opposition forces accuse the cabinet of ministers of  conducting an ineffective economic policy, and also accuse the  premier of corruption. The hunger strikers among the opposition  forces include Former Vice-President R. Gonchigdorj, leader of  the Mongolian Socialist Democratic Party. He deemed it  impossible to continue taking part in the work of the People's  Great Hural session, believing that parliament is delaying a  decision on a no-confidence vote in the government. Ts.  Elbegdorj, leader of the Mongolian Democratic Party, also gave  up his deputy mandate and left the parliament session for the  same reason.    Supporters of the present government, however, think it has  made important strides to stabilize the economy and implement  the transition to market relations, and that it should be given  the opportunity of working its full term according to the  Constitution. They have announced a mass rally for today in  support of the government. [passage omitted]    Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray and President Punsalmaagiyn  Ochirbat are expected to address the parliamentary session today.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by RPC reporter Leo Alvarado on interview with Ruben </F> Dario Carles, Cha;nge '94 Alliance presidential candidate, at a  hotel in Chitre, Herrera Province, on 14 April-- recorded]    [Text] [Alvarado] After listening to the statement made by  the president of the Republic via radio and television networks  and watching the video, we came to the hotel in Chitre where  Ruben Dario Carles, his working group, and a group of followers  were meeting. Carles will be touring Chitre and Herrera Province  tomorrow. After the networks ended, we asked presidential  candidate Carles for his views on tonight's network.    [Begin recording] [Carles] What can I say. It was the first  time I saw it, and I am flabbergasted [words indistinct].    [Alvarado] Do you believe this is a political strategy by  President Endara?    [Carles] I am telling you [words indistinct].    [Alvarado] Do you think there should be an agreement....    [Carles, interrupting] Damn it, didn't you hear me? [end  recording]    [Alvarado] That was all Mr. Ruben Dario Carles told RPC  Radio. We were shoved and pushed by Carles' bodyguards, who did  not allow us to complete our job at the hotel; we had to leave  the hotel. They did not let anyone else in. Mr. Carles remained  sitting and meditating on a sofa. We were able to see tears  running down his cheeks. We must stress, however, how poorly  they are treating the members of the press who are trying to  interview Carles, who is here in Chitre. If there is a question  you would like to ask, please do.    [Unidentified announcer] You said there were tears in  Carles'  eyes. Why? Is there any reason for this?    [Alvarado] We were not allowed to do our job. Mr. Carles  seemed to be angry after watching, on television, Mr. Endara's  presentation. Mr. Carles was unable to answer our questions.  We also saw other reporters try to interview him, but they were  also turned away. We do not know if the tears and anger are the  result of what he saw on television, or whether he felt  something else against the president for showing this via a  national network.</p>

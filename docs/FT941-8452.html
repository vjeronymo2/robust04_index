			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / International Company News: BCI earnings up 1.8% to L268bn for year Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), the commercial bank shortly to be privatised by IRI, the Italian state holding company, has announced parent company net profits up 1.8 per cent in 1993 to L268bn (Dollars 158.5m). The results reflected a heavy increase in tax provisions, up to L713bn from L290bn, and a large increase in the sums set aside for possible loan losses. The latter item has been increased to L554bn from L373bn reflecting the effect of recession in the domestic market. The proportion of doubtful loans in BCI's portfolio rose to 3.3 per cent from 2.9 per cent - but this was almost the average percentage for the Italian banking system. Operating profit increased to L1,901bn from L1,088bn, a 75 per cent increase. Net interest income for the year remained stable, marginally increasing to L2,822bn from L2,816bn. Total assets amounted to L115,813bn against L111,577bn at year end. Non-interest income rose 78 per cent to L1,738bn, benefiting from favourable market conditions. The directors are proposing unchanged dividends of L200 per ordinary share and L230 for savings shares still outstanding after the conclusion on February 11 of the offer to convert savings into ordinary shares paying L250 to BCI. Net profit for the group as a whole, to be announced in mid February, is expected to reflect an improved performance by BCI subsidiaries and allowing a better overall result than in 1992.</p>

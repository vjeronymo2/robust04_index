			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a statement made earlier today to Jordan  television's live program "Good Morning Jordan," Talal Sat'an  al-Hasan, Jordanian minister of state for foreign affairs  denounced the painful, criminal incident in the Ibrahimi Mosque  in Hebron. [video first shows picture of al-Hasan then clips  from program]    [Begin al-Hasan recording] First of all, I wish to express  the Jordanian Government's strong condemnation of the criminal  massacre committed this morning against innocent, unarmed  Palestinian citizens inside the Ibrahimi Mosque, a house of God,  and one of the most sacred places for the Muslim nation. This  condemnable crime, committed against worshipers in the middle of  Holy Ramadan, has shaken us and every single Arab, Muslim, and  individual in the world. It should not be allowed to go by as a  passing incident. The world must view it as a result of the  arming of fanatical settlers. Jordan has always warned against  the serious consequences that arming settlers would have on the  peace process. Israel, the world, and the international  institutions must bear their responsibilities and immediately  act to put an end to the terrorist acts of the settlers. This,  of course, means that, first, these criminals must be punished  and that they be disarmed to prevent such incidents in the  future, and even the removing of settlements all together from  the occupied Arab territories.    As we extend to our kinsfolk in occupied, steadfast Hebron,  and to the families of the martyrs our warmest condolences, we  in Jordan warn the world that this incident and several others  in the past only exemplify the consequences of the occupation of  the Palestinian territory and the prevention of the Palestinian  people from exercising theirs right on their soil. The world  must bear the responsibility to stop these incidents by ensuring  the achievement of an honorable, comprehensive settlement that  will lead to Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian  and Arab territories and granting the Palestinian people their  legitimate rights.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Fuerxer, Danielle Le Gourrierec: </F> "Telecommunications Techniques, Prospects"]    [Text]  <H5>  Perceived Need </H5>   In the Gulf War as well as in the landing in Somalia, news  reporters had extremely advanced communications resources, at  first glance, more advanced than those of the military. But  those two examples -- the tip of a deeply submerged iceberg --  are not representative of all the events and their diversity. To  set up their own communications, the military could not rely  upon the technical, political and economic opportunities that  made possible the extraordinary media coverage of recent  operations.    The military telecommunications system of the year 2010 will  not entail the mere transfer of civilian solutions in gestation  at France Telecom or in the research laboratories of the major  French, European, U.S., or Japanese industries.    Civilian telecommunications currently are already displaying  typical features of a basically market-oriented development.  Areas having heavy population density or generating large  volumes of traffic are and increasingly will be emphasized.  Investments, too, will be concentrated on the most "profitable"  communications services. In contrast, the military has to be  able to communicate from everywhere to anywhere and with  anyone . They will have to be guaranteed a full-spectrum  leading-edge service no matter how heterogeneous the resources  rendered operative. Defined in this way, their requirements are  too varied to be met fully and directly by off-the-shelf  purchasing of such products or civilian systems.    Civilian investments, however, are not comparable to those  authorized by the armed forces. For this reason, if the military  telecommunications system, a meta-system harmoniously and  effectively incorporating the "fixed" segment and the "tactical"  segments, relies on the humongous technological effort that the  telecommunications industry has made, it will incorporate  developments appropriate for meeting specific requirements.  <H5>  Future Trap </H5>   Technological progress will lead to an unprecedented  development of data exchanges. An easy way to conjure up  tomorrow's telecommunications is based on France Telecom's  Eurodisney attraction entitled It's a Small World .  In a scaled-down world, the latter displays a host of  individuals who spend virtually all their time on the telephone  or watching cartoons. Will technology enable everyone at any  time to have all the data that one could wish to receive at the  risk of no longer being able to choose among the data that will  be submitted to that individual? Will the military itself not be  overwhelmed by the load of available data and, mesmerized by the  data, become incapable of making decisions and taking action?  Will the world of telecommunications be the golden age that  humanity dreams of or will it be a nightmare?  <H5>  Reduced Distances and Technological Innovation </H5>   In the near future all transmittable signals will be in  digital form. The transfer rates necessary for the different  services will be highly varied, going from a few bits per second  to tens of megabits per second. The transfer rates needed for  different source codings will be heavily dependent on the  desired quality. Music coding will be done for transfer rates  varying in a ratio of 10. For speech, the ratio will approach  100. For images it will exceed 1,000, including videophone and  the high-quality television necessary for productive societies.  The transfer rate for data transmissions, in turn, will be  limited only by computer memory access times. The rapid  escalation of communications capacity will lead to a  considerable subjective reduction of distances. A distant  correspondent will be as easy to reach as the neighbor down the  hall.    Optical fiber is now being used in transatlantic cables. The  TAT 9 cable that was put into service in 1991 between Europe and  the U.S., makes it possible to transmit 560Mbits/s. In 1995, TAT  12 will make it possible to transmit 5 Gbits/s, that is, 60,000  telephone communications. In the laboratory, the National Center  for Telecommunications Studies [CNET] is experimenting with a 20  Gbits/s 108 km link. For sure, before the year 2,000, 100  Gbits/s will be realized with multi-color systems, that is,  employing several optical wave lengths.    Satellites will mainly be used for the broadcasting of  images. For data transmission or telephone channels, the  increasing congestion of the geostationary orbit and the  saturation of the spectrum will increasingly lead to reserving  the use of digital telecommunications satellites for covering  the oceans and desert areas. Possible development of clusters of  low-orbit satellites is not likely to check this trend.    It will be difficult to transfer this development into the  military sector, nor is it certain that there is a real need to  do so. The innovative technologies that will directly interest  the military and impact its transmission system will be those  being investigated for radio broadcasting and digital radio  telephony for mobile units.    In effect, the features of the modulation that is used make  it possible to counter radio channel distortions. Digital  Audio Broadcasting [DAB], undergoing experimentation, will  surely be the first application of that technology for digital  radio broadcasting. It will therefore be possible on a single  transmitter to multiplex six different stereophonic programs and  to transmit 1.3 Mbits/s in a 1.5 MHz channel.    What is more, all transmitters broadcasting the same group  of  stations will use the same frequency. That will noticeably  reduce the congestion of the spectrum and even do away with the  concept of frequency plan. The same principles will soon be  applied to television. It will be possible to transmit 5-20  Mbits/s in a current TV channel to fixed or mobile receivers.  There too, multiplexing of several programs on a single  transmitter will be possible.    Even if protection against electronic warfare might restrict  the effectiveness of the subsets of a military  telecommunications system using such solutions, the interest  that such techniques could afford for broadcasting data to  forces deployed in theaters of operation can be imagined.    Concurrently, mobile radio telephony will continue to  develop. Systems like Itineris, based on the GSM  [Global System for Mobile Communication] standard, will be  supplemented by new systems occupying other frequency bands.  Wireless telephones like Bi-Bop will be increasingly  used. Wireless local-network and private switches will emerge.    Ultimately, short-range links with mobile units will develop  around various applications: navigation and traffic control, as  with Prometheus, automatic toll collecting, or even  detection of stolen vehicles.    To be sure, military systems will resort to the same  techniques without necessarily realizing the same effectiveness  since they will have to be shielded against the occurrence of  electronic countermeasures and incorporate data security.  <H5>  Frequency Spectrum Management </H5>   Frequencies are a very rare commodity. Civilian pressure on  the military is already strong and could even intensify since  the new market shares that use of frequencies currently  allocated to the military represent for civilian operators are  quite sizable. Besides the scarcity of military bandwidths,  being side-by-side with a very large number of civilian systems  and involuntary disturbance phenomena will require the  introduction of a very strict management of frequency usage,  transmitting powers and a very precise definition of radio  equipment features.  <H5>  Forwarding of Data </H5>   Conceivably, use of rapid packet switching technology or  Asynchronous Transfer Mode [ATM], adopted in the  combined forces Socrate system, will become  widespread. All the data to be transmitted will be submitted in  a single fixed-length format that is especially well suited for  real-time switching. With the upsurge in data transmissions  among computers, the required transfer rates will be  increasingly large and sporadic.    The very broad heterogeneity of the channels making up the  military transmitting system -- optical fibers, satellite links,  Hertzian link-ups -- will be even further intensified by the  presence of degraded modes during electronic warfare.    The switching system capable of optimizing the use of all  such transmitting resources will be extremely complex. An  increasing amount of transmission channel capacity will be  dedicated to management data exchanges. In effect, it will  require transmission of all the data needed for operating the  services proposed for users and system supervision. In military  systems that are simultaneously adaptable, reconfigurable in  real time shielded against intrusions, the development of  switches will be especially difficult. In fact, the switching  system will be a major shared computerized application. Already  in Rita, the option made was to make the software  more complex in order to facilitate deployment of the system and  its operation. This trend will be continued with ease of  operation for the user always being the underlying parameter to  be emphasized.  <H5>  Civilian Sector Services </H5>   Standardization of transmission channels combined with  increasing software programming is going to lead to a  diversification of services. Initially, source coding will be  increasingly suited to each application: wide-band sound,  video-conferencing image coding, color facsimile coding, etc. A  number of those signals could be combined in a transmission  channel to create a multimedia service.    Subscriber mobility, a service originally offered by the  lone  tactical system Rita, will become a reality in  civilian systems and all military systems.    An apparently complete freedom of movement for subscribers  will result from the development of Hertzian link-ups.    At present, systems having a shorter range like Bi-Bop are  surfacing. Micro-cellular system design with a 200 m or less  close-in range is emerging. Its short range is offset by the  universal availability of terminals for connecting to an optical  fiber based wire system. Since users are unaware of the constant  changing of their connecting terminal they therefore have a  feeling of absolute freedom in their movement and the impression  of an unlimited range for their portable telephone.    To conjure up the impact that the telecommunications  development could have on our lifestyle, let us imagine a  Parisian on vacation somewhere in the heartland of France in the  year 2,010. His car's on-board computer takes him unswervingly  to the sight, described in his travel guide, that he decided to  go admire. On the way back to his hotel he decides to take a  route through the woods. Covering hardly 100 meters, an alarm  points out to him that he is no longer on a listed roadway. A  few meters further on, his radio telephone informs him that,  without a satellite terminal, he has lost all "civilized"  contact and will not be able to be rescued in the event of an  accident.    What will the effectively developed services be? Will they  help improve the quality of life? Those are the real stakes in  this impressive technological development. What will the  behavior and reactions of the military personnel be, who, in  civilian life will be "conditioned" by such an environment? The  outlook in this sector continues to be quite difficult!  <H5>  Specifically Military Services </H5>   In the military systems, the impressive transmission  capabilities made possible by the technology will facilitate  broadcasting to the lowest command levels, even to the troops,  intelligence in the form of texts, sounds, or images. Command  systems likewise will be able to receive all the data they will  need. In exchange, such systems will have to merge increasing  amounts of data.    An increasing de-localization of functions will be noticed  as  well as the emergence of shared weapons systems whose elements,  specialized by function, will cooperate for the extent of a  mission. Already, during operation Desert Storm,  computing the necessary elements for aiming the  Patriot missiles was done in the U.S. on the basis of  data collected by the various available sensors. Is it to be  feared that all decisions will be made by a staff, far removed  from ground truth? Be that as it may, telecommunications  flexibility will facilitate the development of designs for the  employment of forces. But it should never be forgotten that  electronic warfare will bare any blind alley or indiscretion  made in the design stage and that there is no allowance for  error.    If the geographic spread of conflicts requires increased  interoperability with civilian systems, it will also be  necessary to be able to dispense with local infrastructures that  have been destroyed or that are in the hands of non-controlled  elements.  <H5>  Standardization in the Civilian World </H5>   In upcoming years, the intense creativity of  telecommunications, on the digital signal processing level,  equipment or systems and systems and services will engender two  opposed movements. First, the proliferation of concepts will  lead to the development of mutually incompatible technologies.  It will be hard to choose among them. Second, the complexity of  the systems will require the new products to adhere to precise  standards enabling their introduction into the systems. That  holds for equipment as well as services even if the so-called  "smart system" structure will ease their introduction by making  it possible to export the necessary software in the servers.    In the civilian world, the "deregulatory" movement launched  in imitation of the U.S., could lead to a diversification of  technical options among competing operators. Absent a firm  policy aimed at requiring systems interoperability, the result  could be a lowering of the quality of service in the eyes of the  customers. If the operators are dynamic enough, the emergence of  de facto standards will be noticed, as in computers, and, with  the interplay of alliances, the establishment of very large  transnational groups on the international level. Otherwise,  initial commercial failure will delay development.    In London, for example, cut-throat competition among four  operators caused an initial attempt at introducing a BI-BOP type  service to flop while it enjoyed absolute success in Paris. In  turn, development of the pan-European GSM radio telephone  demonstrates that voluntary awareness by all the economic  players of the interoperability problems can lead to a major  industrial and commercial success while allowing operators to  multiply. Therefore, standardization is an extremely major stake  in the future of civilian telecommunications.    In military systems the interplay is unquestionably even  more  complex. To hold down development costs, it has to be able to  derive maximum benefit from the investments made in the civilian  world while allowing for military specifications: security,  confidentiality, shielding against electronic warfare. That is  possible only if the military, considered as a minority  operator, participates in one form or another in the elaboration  of civilian standards. Too frequently, a haphazard selection at  the commencement of the standardization process makes it easy or  impossible later to adapt the products to military requirements.  The basic options, therefore, should be made with an awareness  of the case.    Unlike what happens in other sectors, in telecommunications,  the definition of standards precedes the development of the  prototypes. Systems or services conjured up the engineers are  specified and then standardized before springing into existence.  Except in rare sectors not involving interoperability,  innovation no longer can arise from an individual initiative but  from a consensus that is all the more difficult to realize  because the interests of the different parties are frequently at  odds. The ability to persuade, therefore, is becoming an  essential quality in engineers, an indispensable supplement to  their technical expertise.    Telecommunications already have greatly impacted our  lifestyle. In the past, the telephone radically altered the  relationships among individuals. Presently, the fax is  transforming our work style by eliminating the mail carrier's  delivery routes and abolishing delays in the transmission of  documents. In the future, when the videophone becomes less  expensive, it too will alter social behaviors.    In the civilian world, development will occur because of a  compromise between the disorder stemming from the development of  new designs and engineering consistency that is the only thing  able to allow different correspondents wishing to communicate to  make themselves understood. Development will no longer be  limited by engineering possibilities, but rather by the slowness  of the standardization process, the investment burden to be  amortized or even the difficulty in realizing a threshold of  profitability for a new service.    Military systems should supply quality services comparable  in  all respects to those offered by their civilian counterparts.  Even more than in the past, those in charge of developing  military systems will not tolerate anything less than total  availability for the transmissions they will require.    Only military systems are designed to completely dispense  with the support of local infrastructures. Equipment manufacture  in small series and durable in a very hostile environment cannot  be compared to unshielded civilian systems. On the other hand,  they should be interoperable with them in order to be able to  afford the military optimum effectiveness under all  circumstances. Military telecommunications have to remain  operational in a major conflict. They will benefit from the  development of civilian telecommunications but there will be no  correspondence between the services offered by civilian  telecommunications and the requirements of the military.  Therefore, the systems cannot be identical.    In this article terminals have been dealt with only through  the intermediary of the services. By the year 2,010, what will  the user interface look like? In a period of office  communications what will the operational modes be that will be  deemed ergonomic by the next generation? A further unresolved  issue: besides civilian systems, with what others will it have  to be interoperable?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura denied  on 13 January the possibility of a cabinet reshuffle in the near  future, and stressed that "what happens to my job as chief  cabinet secretary depends 100 percent on what Prime Minister  Hosokawa thinks."    Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito have been  strongly critical of Takemura for maintaining covert contacts  with the Liberal Democratic Party -- from which he bolted in  1993 -- in connection with political reform and an anticipated  realignment of political parties. The two parties are reported  to have privately asked the prime minister to replace the chief  cabinet secretary.    However, Takemura, who enjoys the prime minister's full  backing, intends to resist such moves. Conflict within the  ruling coalition parties are expected to intensify as a result.    Allegedly, there have been recurring demands for Takemura's  replacement since late 1993. However, the prime minister  believes that the replacement of someone who has been a major  ally since well before the start of his administration, would  certainly unsettle the political base of the coalition, which is  built on a delicate balance between the Shinseito-Komeito bloc  led by Ichiro Ozawa, the Shinseito secretary general, and  Takemura supporters. He has, therefore, taken a cautious  approach.    However, Takemura himself has been afflicted by a growing  sense of crisis. On the evening of 12 January, he held a  meeting with officials of his Sakigake [Harbinger] Party while  maintaining telephone contact with the prime minister. He also  confirmed that "there would be no cabinet reshuffle yet" with  the prime minister's office on the morning of 13 January, and  announced this at a news conference shortly afterward.    Takemura said at the news conference, "I think I am the  target of all sorts of criticism." The comment showed his  concern at the strong criticism of him from the ruling coalition  parties.    However, he also said: "I will continue to work hard and  exert my utmost efforts to do my job." The remark showed he did  not seem daunted by calls for him to be replaced.    The issue of a cabinet reshuffle is expected to reemerge  after the end of the next regular session of the Diet.  Takemura, by subtly emphasizing that the power of appointment  lies with the prime minister, seemed to indicate that for the  time being, he would focus on maintaining his alliance with the  prime minister and continue his confrontation with the Ozawa  group.</p>

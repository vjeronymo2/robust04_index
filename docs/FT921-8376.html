			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: UMW improves 5% but warns of fall in car sales UMW, the Malaysian motor and heavy equipment group, yesterday reported a 5 per cent rise in its pre-tax profits to MDollars 208m (USDollars 79.4m) for 1991, but warned that the current year's car sales are likely to suffer 'in line with industry expectations'. The group's main business is assembly and distribution of Japan's Toyota vehicles. Many distributors have reported lower sales in the last few months mainly due to high interest rates and tighter credit. UMW's 1991 turnover rose by 6.5 per cent to MDollars 2.1bn from MDollars 1.9bn, and operating profit was nearly 5 per cent higher at MDollars 205m. Associates added MDollars 3m to pre-tax profits. Profits after tax and minorities improved 4 per cent to MDollars 113m, but fell 9 per cent to 52.8 cents on a per-share basis, partly as a result of an increase in equity from loan stock conversion to shares. The group has recommended a final dividend of 7.5 cents a share, making a total of 15 cents, unchanged from a year earlier.</p>

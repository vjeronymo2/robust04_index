			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Arts: Today's Television Tomorrow's World has always been a gee-whiz programme appealing particularly to children, but one characteristic made it attractive to anyone interested in broadcasting: it was presented live. This meant fizz and adrenalin, and that things could, and did, go wrong, a fact which could pull you in whether or not you were interested in widgets. Now, after nearly 30 years, they have finally chickened out and decided that, like everyone else, they will have a little collection of pre-packaged filmlets. Safety at last - but for me not worth watching any more (7.30 BBC1). Second Thoughts reaches its last episode without ever having impinged upon me more than incidentally: whenever I caught sight I thought 'Oh another sitcom about people not married to one another trying to live together'. Since it never passed the test of making me laugh within three minutes of switching on I never watched a whole episode (8.30 ITV). Conversely, anything starring Alexei Sayle receives instant attention. Paris is a new comedy series in which he plays French artist Alain Degout in the 1920s (9.30 C4).</p>

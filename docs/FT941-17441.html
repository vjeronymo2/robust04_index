			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Risk and Reward: An independent stands up to the pressure Locals, the independent traders who once dominated the futures pits of Chicago, are gradually being squeezed out of the market by the weight of capital of the world's largest banks and securities houses. However, a few of these traders, whose business grew rapidly in the profitable years before the arrival of the mainstream investment banks, have been able to expand into new areas. One such trader is Thomas Baldwin III, a self-made multi-millionaire who built his fortune and his reputation in the competitive rough and tumble of the Chicago Board of Trade's US Treasury bond futures pit. In a business where 80 per cent of new arrivals fail within a year, the 37-year-old son of a St. Louis, plumbing contractor is a heavy-hitter who regularly swaps Dollars 50m positions in the bond futures pit. Fellow traders say that Baldwin, who risks his own money in the pits, is one of the few locals who can stand up against the waves of trades made by international banks. Smaller locals often mimic his actions trade-for-trade, hoping to profit from his strategies. He came to Chicago 10 years ago with a degree in biology, Dollars 20,000 in savings and no experience in financial markets. After six months trading T-bond futures, he had rung up Dollars 8,000 of losses and was near quitting when his luck turned. Today, he declines to comment on his net worth, although friends estimate it at Dollars 50m. The road to riches hasn't been entirely smooth. For instance, on March 17 1989, he began an early-morning bond-buying spree that left him holding 6,000 T-bond futures contracts, or Dollars 600m worth of Treasury bonds. He expected US inflation data released later that morning to support bond prices and add to his profits. Instead, bond prices plunged, and he had to work frantically to reverse his position. By the time he had sold out, Baldwin was holding trading cards with Dollars 5m in losses. He returned to the market the following morning unruffled, and continued with his business. Baldwin has made enough money to allow him to retire from the strains of the pit. Instead, he is diversifying his business. He heads The Baldwin Group, comprised of a property developer, several charitable ventures, and a series of offshore futures funds. Last year he also became a director of the Chicago Board of Trade. Baldwin will continue to trade, he says, in part because the game is addictive, and in part, because he finds the chaos of the pit relaxing. There is a saying in Chicago that locals are only fit for the pits. Baldwin, however, has a taste for international business. In his first property venture with ING Bank of the Netherlands and Chevron Oil to purchase and develop a LaSalle Street landmark, the Rookery Building, for Dollars 100m. Seeing that managed futures was a growth industry with steady cash returns, Baldwin entered a joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation in 1989 to form MC Baldwin Financial, which administers six futures funds in Japan with collective assets of about Dollars 100m. Last month MC Baldwin was appointed trading manager of a Luxembourg-based futures fund to be marketed in Germany by Hypo-Bank. Hypo has committed DM35m to the fund in the first such venture of its kind in Germany. MC Baldwin also administers a futures fund for Heinhold in the US. Together, Baldwin says his funds are up 22 per cent for the year. He doesn't personally handle the funds' assets, but oversees the selection of trading advisers. He plans to keep the business small, picking partners such as Hypo and Mitsubishi to market the funds, and concentrating his management on risk control.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-HOSTAGE SAYS: DON'T FORGET OTHERS;  </P> <P> RELEASE: A SANTA ANA MAN FREED BY IRAQ BECAUSE OF HIS PHYSICAL CONDITION SAYS  HE HOPES TO HELP THOSE LEFT BEHIND.  </P> <P> Exhausted but elated, a Santa Ana man freed from Iraq after nearly three months  in captivity touched down in Southern California on Thursday evening with words  of thanks. But Jack Frazier said of the fellow captives he left behind: "We  can't forget them -- it's that simple."  </P> <P> "I know in their hearts, they were asking, 'Why not me?' " said the 53-year-old  Frazier.  </P> <P> The reason Iraqi officials gave in releasing Frazier earlier this week was his  physical condition: He is a diabetic who takes oral medication and has a  history of heart problems.  </P> <P> His release, along with 13 other Americans with medical conditions, was seen by  U.S. diplomats as a "goodwill gesture" by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, aimed  at defusing opposition to his regime under the guise of humanitarianism.  </P> <P> But when Frazier got off his plane shortly before 6 p.m. at Los Angeles  International Airport with his three children and grandchild, he did not want  to discuss politics. Instead, after greeting several in-laws and other family  members with tearful hugs, his focus was on the remaining hostages -- or  "special guests," as their Baghdad captors term them.  </P> <P> He pledged to make their release his highest priority now that he is back in  the United States. They must be kept "on the front burner," he said, in order  to "get them home."  </P> <P> Frazier, a construction supervisor at a Bechtel Corp. refinery project in Iraq,  had arrived in New York late Wednesday and spent the night there. Drinking a  beer with his two sons was one of his first acts as a free man, he said.  </P> <P> Passengers from New York who shared Frazier's plane stepped into the airport  terminal in a daze as they were met by TV cameras and photographers.  </P> <P> During a 10-minute press conference, Frazier said he appreciated all the media  attention but was too tired to talk at length.  </P> <P> "I've been on an emotional roller coaster along with a thousand other people  for the last 2 1/2 months, seven days a week, 24 hours a day," he said.  </P> <P> The nights were the toughest, he said.  </P> <P> While free to move about the "safe house" where he stayed, Frazier said:  "There's no such thing as eight hours' sleep. . . . You have no control of the  night. . . . You really don't know what to expect. You don't feel very  comfortable."  </P> <P> Still, he said, he holds no animosity toward the Iraqi people.  </P> <P> "I have no reason to be mad at them," he said. And when asked about his  treatment in the Middle East, he said: "I want to make that very clear -- I was  not mistreated at all."  </P> <P> Frazier said his future plans are somewhat uncertain. He said he hopes to  return to work at Bechtel and will know more about his physical condition today  after he goes to the doctor.  </P> <P> Family members, meanwhile, said they want to do everything they can to keep him  close to home. His fiancee, Deanna Frizelle, who had driven from Montana to  meet the plane, had even joked about bringing a minister to the airport to tie  the knot right there. In tears at the airport, a relieved Frizelle said: "I  have him physically but not quite mentally -- his mind is still back with his  friends."  </P></p>

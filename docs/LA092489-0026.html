			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-SAVINGS POLICIES  </P> <P> Concerning James Flanigan's column in August, as a baby boomer, I'm not going  to rely on Social Security just because the government says it's "safe." That's  like letting a drunk drive you home, just because he promises he will deliver  you home "safely."  </P> <P> Once you realize that the so-called cash reserves are really just paper, you  won't feel so secure. Here's how the government "invests" the Social Security  surplus. They just give this extra money to other government agencies that need  it. That agency then issues Social Security a bond (really an IOU).  </P> <P> Thus, the buildup of the Social Security "cash" reserves is really just a  buildup of the national debt. The money isn't in a bank account, waiting to be  withdrawn. When the baby boomers retire, the national debt must be converted to  cash to pay benefits. How will this happen? Either the government must develop  a surplus in other areas,or it must put a tremendous tax burden on our  children. Both of these aren't very likely. Most likely, Social Security will  cut our benefits.  </P> <P> I'm relying on my own savings for retirement.  </P> <P> STEVEN G. VERNON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Lithuanian  Seimas right-wing opposition, made a statement yesterday  concerning pressure exerted on Estonia by the Russian  militarists.    The statement reads: Now comes Estonia's turn, after Latvia  had been overtaxed. Open blackmail is used by the Russian  minister of defense, who threatens that if the conditions of his  country are not accepted, the remaining 2,500 foreign servicemen  will not be withdrawn from Estonian territory; even an  additional invasion [as heard] could not be excluded. This is a  challenge to the West, and at the same time is a test of how  Russia would be allowed to treat Estonia -- and before long,  Lithuania. Our nearest neighbors should come to the aid of  Estonia while reminding the Russian militarists and the world  that these troops have to withdraw from Estonia unconditionally.    If the troops remain deployed against Estonia's will, then  it  will prove once again that these troops remain occupational  troops and are being used for the preparation of a new  aggression. In turn, a big country threatening a small neighbor  with armed force should not even apply for acceptance into the  Council of Europe.    All this strangely coincides with the anniversary of the end  of World War II. It would be beneficial for the world to be  aware that this war has not yet ended everywhere. In Estonia,  the foreign troops that entered Estonia 50 years ago continue to  be deployed there against Estonia's will. In some capital  cities of Europe, embassy buildings of the Baltic states  continue to be seized by Russia," Landsbergis' statement reads.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> a. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to total assets to assist in the assessment of the capital adequacy of state member banks. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The principal objective of this measure is to place a constraint on the maximum degree to which a state member bank can leverage its equity capital base. It is intended to be used as a supplement to the risk-based capital measure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Supervisory risk-based capital ratios that related capital to weighted-risk assets for state member banks are outlined in Appendix A to this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> b. The guidelines apply to all state member banks on a consolidated basis and are to be used in the examination and supervisory process as well as in the analysis of applications acted upon by the Federal Reserve. The Board will review the guidelines from time to time and will consider the need for possible adjustments in light of any significant changes in the economy, financial markets, and banking practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> II. The Tier 1 Leverage Ratio <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> a. The Board has established a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> minimum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> level of tier 1 capital to total assets of 3 percent. An institution operating at or near these levels is expected to have well-diversified risk, including no undue interest-rate risk exposure; excellent asset quality; high liquidity; and good earnings; and in general be considered a strong banking organization, rated composite 1 under CAMEL rating system of banks. Institutions not meeting these characteristics, as well as institutions with supervisory, financial, or operational weaknesses, are expected to operate well above minimum capital standards. Institutions experiencing or anticipating significant growth also are expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions, well above the minimum levels. For example, most such banks generally have operated at capital levels ranging from 100 to 200 basis points above the stated minimums. Higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banks. Thus for all but the most highly rated banks meeting the conditions set forth above, the minimum tier 1 leverage ratio is to be 3 percent plus an additional cushion of a least 100 to 200 basis points. In all cases, banking institutions should hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of all risks, including the volume and severity of problem loans, to which they are exposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. A bank's tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing its tier 1 capital (the numerator of the ratio) by its average total consolidated assets (the denominator of the ratio). The ratio will also be calculated using period-end assets whenever necessary, on a case-by-case basis. For the purpose of this leverage ratio, the definition of tier 1 capital for year-end 1992 as set forth in the risk-based capital guidelines contained in Appendix A of this part will be used. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  As a general matter, average total consolidated assets are defined as the quarterly average total assets (defined net of the allowance for loan and lease losses) reported on the bank's Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report), less goodwill; amounts of purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships that, in the aggregate, are in excess of 50 percent of tier 1 capital; amounts of purchased credit card relationships in excess of 25 percent of tier 1 capital; all other intangible assets; any investments in subsidiaries or associated companies that the Federal Reserve determines should be deducted from tier 1 capital; and deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, net of their valuation allowance, in excess of the limitation set forth in section II.B.4 of this Appendix A. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> At the end of 1992, Tier 1 capital for state member banks includes common equity, minority interest in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, and qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In addition, as a general matter, Tier 1 capital excludes goodwill; amounts of purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships that, in the aggregate, exceed 50 percent of Tier 1 capital; amounts of purchased credit card relationships that exceed 25 percent of Tier 1 capital; all other intangible assets; and deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, net of their valuation allowance, in excess of certain limitations. The Federal Reserve may exclude certain investments in subsidiaries or associated companies as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Deductions from Tier 1 capital and other adjustments are discussed more fully in section II.B. in Appendix A of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> c. Whenever appropriate, including when a bank is undertaking expansion, seeking to engage in new activities or otherwise facing unusual or abnormal risks, the Board will continue to consider the level of an individual bank's tangible tier 1 leverage ratio (after deducting all intangibles) in making an overall assessment of capital adequacy. This is consistent with the Federal Reserve's risk-based capital guidelines an long-standing Board policy and practice with regard to leverage guidelines. Banks experiencing growth, whether internally or by acquisition, are expected to maintain strong capital position substantially above minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 225_BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND CHANGE IN BANK CONTROL (REGULATION Y)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

In addition, holdings of capital instruments issued by other banking organizations but taken in satisfaction of debts previously contracted would be exempt from any deduction from capital. The Board intends to monitor nonreciprocal holdings of other banking organizations' capital instruments and to provide information on such holdings to the Basle Supervisors' Committee as called for under the Basle capital framework.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Deferred tax assets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, net of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, that may be included in, that is, not deducted from, a banking organization's capital may not exceed the lesser of: (i) the amount of these deferred tax assets that the banking organization is expected to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projections of future taxable income for that year, <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  or (ii) 10 percent of tier 1 capital. For purposes of calculating this limitation, tier 1 capital is defined as the sum of core capital elements, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted). The amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences generally are not limited. The reported amount of deferred tax assets, net of any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, in excess of these amounts is to be deducted from a banking organization's core capital elements in determining tier 1 capital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Projected future taxable income should not include net operating loss carryforwards to be used during that year or the amount of existing temporary differences a bank holding company expects to reverse within the year. Such projections should include the estimated effect of tax planning strategies that the organization expects to implement to realize net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that will otherwise expire during the year. Banking organizations may use the future taxable income projections for their current fiscal year (adjusted for any significant changes that have occurred or are expected to occur) when applying the capital limit at an interim report date rather than preparing a new projection each quarter. To determine the limit, a banking organization should assume that all existing temporary differences fully reverse as of the report date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

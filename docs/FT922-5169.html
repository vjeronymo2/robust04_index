			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Anglo American rises 15% and sees economic upturn ANGLO American Corporation, South Africa's largest company, yesterday signalled optimism about the prospects for an economic upturn by lifting its dividend 6 per cent on the back of maintained earnings for the year to the end of March. Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said he was pleased with the results given the background of a quiet world economy and weak commodity prices. The result was testimony to the strength and diversity of the group's interests, in terms of location, commodities and industry, he said. Pre-tax income rose 15 per cent to R2.45bn (Pounds 472m), consisting mainly of R1.65bn investment income, R507m trading income, and R222m surplus from the realisation of investments. The increased surplus on realisation of investments, up from R47m in 1991, is the result of the sale of a number of holdings. The R630m realised from the sale of large stakes in First National Bank and Gencor was treated as extraordinary income, with R500m set aside as a general provision against the carrying value of investments and loans. Although attributable earnings were 20 per cent higher at R1.68bn, helped by the investment surpluses, the retained earnings of associate companies dropped by 22 per cent to R927m, leaving equity accounted earnings marginally higher at R2.61bn, from R2.59bn. A breakdown of earnings shows the main contribution - 24.5 per cent - coming from diamonds. Last year diamonds contributed 29.1 per cent. Other contributions came from mining finance (21.6 per cent), industry and commerce (14.3 per cent), gold and uranium (9.4 per cent), platinum and base metals (9 per cent), financial services and property (8.5 per cent) and coal (6.4 per cent). Investment surpluses and other net income contributed 6.3 per cent compared with 0.3 per cent in 1991. Mr Ogilvie Thompson said he was optimistic that there was scope for a 'nice pick-up' in the South African economy. Attributable earnings per share rose to 724 cents from 604 cents and the dividend was lifted to 345 cents from 325 cents per share.</p>

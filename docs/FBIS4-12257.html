			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, al-Tayr [April] 6 (JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY)  -- The Spanish foreign minister, Javier Solana, has expressed  his country's condemnation of the unjust harsh measures imposed  on the Great Jamahiriyah by the Security Council at the bidding  of the Western countries. He said that the Lockerbie incident  had caused a state of tension and instability in the region of  the Mediterranean.    After his meeting with Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, the  secretary general of the Arab League, the Spanish foreign  minister said that the secretary general had given him a  detailed explanation of the Arab League Council resolution  concerning the trying of the suspects by the International Court  of Justice in the [word indistinct] and had expressed his  satisfaction with this resolution. The minister said that the  resolution would ensure a just and impartial trial for the  suspects and complied with international resolutions.    He added that Spain strongly favoured this resolution and  would be calling on the countries of the European Community to  adopt it and to act to have it adopted in a serious and speedy  manner. He said that his country would be co-operating with the  Arab League in order to have this resolution publicised, that  Spain had a special relationship with the Jamahiriyah and all  the Arabs, and realised the importance of bringing an end to the  Lockerbie issue, given its concern for stability and security in  the region.    The Spanish foreign minister added that his country opposes  the arbitrary American Western stance of rejecting all solutions  aimed at defusing this crisis.    At the same time, he applauded the Great Jamahiriyah's  positive response in dealing with the crisis despite the  injustice it suffered as a result of the baseless measures  imposed on it.    He ended by saying that Spain would soon be calling on  France, Britain and the United States to realise the need to  respond to this peaceful initiative and to request that they  accept the Arab League's resolution.</p>

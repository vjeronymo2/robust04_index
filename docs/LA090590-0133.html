			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTES;  </P> <P> VICTORVILLE HATCHERY MAY GET A REPRIEVE  </P> <P> A victim of budget cuts, the Mojave River state fish hatchery was ordered  closed last month, its 200,000 pounds of rainbow trout earmarked for premature  release into Southland reservoirs. A new stocking schedule was drawn for future  plants: reductions by half at some locations, elimination at others.  </P> <P> It was sad news for trout fishermen.  </P> <P> But now comes word that the hatchery at Victorville, the primary facility for  Southern California waters, may not close after all. In fact, chances are good  that it won't, thanks to the legislature's last-minute passage Saturday of two  bills.  </P> <P> "If those bills are enacted (signed by the Governor before Sept. 30) and they  restore the amount of money that we were at the time estimating -- in the  neighborhood of $8-$8 1/2 million -- we would agree to allocate some of that  restored money back to keeping the Mojave hatchery open," said Vern Goehring,  legislative coordinator for the DFG.  </P> <P> Assembly Bill 3158, if signed into law, will set up a fee structure for  environmental reviews performed by the DFG under the California Environmental  Quality Act and bring to the department additional revenue from fine and user  increases, part of which would be an increase in the price of one-day fishing  licenses.  </P> <P> Starting Jan. 31, AB 3158 will raise about $4.6 million for the current fiscal  year. In a full year, the DFG estimates this source to be worth $10.6 million.  </P> <P> AB 2126 would take effect Jan. 1 and would increase commercial fish business  license fees and fishing fees and generate an estimated $3.5 million this  fiscal year. AB 2126 has a one-year life -- written as such to help gain its  passage -- and Goehring said another bill must be introduced next year to  assure this source of revenue.  </P> <P> Both bills were passed in the final hours of a legislative session that lasted  into the early hours of Saturday morning.  </P> <P> Goehring said the Mojave River hatchery would receive an estimated $800,000  annually from these added sources, representing 80% to 90% of the necessary  operating costs, and the department would allocate the rest.  </P> <P> About half of the hatchery's trout have already been dumped into various  reservoirs as the facility was trying to empty its ponds by the Oct. 1 closing  deadline. But now orders have changed and the hatchery is returning to "as  normal a stocking schedule as possible," said Ken Hashagen, hatchery  coordinator for the DFG in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Duck populations remain near all-time lows. Therefore the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service has proposed to continue restrictive hunting regulations this  fall, and Southern California figures to be one of the more restricted areas.  </P> <P> The projected fall flight index -- based on surveys of duck breeding  populations -- of 64 million ducks, about the same as last year, is the third  lowest since the FWS began making projections in 1969. Prolonged drought  conditions in prairie nesting areas and destruction of wetlands throughout the  continent are responsible for record low duck populations in the 1980s.  </P> <P> Hunters in the Southern California zone face the likelihood of a split season,  from Oct. 13 to Nov. 7 and from Dec. 6 to Jan. 6; shooting hours from a  half-hour before sunrise to sunset; a daily bag limit of four, including no  more than three mallards (only one hen), one pintail, and either two  canvasbacks, two redheads, or one of each. Hunters may have eight ducks in  possession.  </P> <P> Goose season figures to run between Oct. 13 to Jan. 13, with hunters allowed  six a day, six in possession, not more than three white or three dark, of which  not more than two may be Canada geese.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> SHARKS -- A record 328 tags from 19 species of sharks were returned in 1989 as  part of a 27-year-old National Marine Fisheries Program. Highlights -- as  printed in the International Game Fish Assn.'s bi-monthly newsletter -- for a  year in which 5,623 sharks were tagged include:  </P> <P>  -- A sand bar shark that had spent more than 24 years at liberty since being  tagged in Delaware Bay on Dec. 29, 1965. It was recaptured by a long-line  vessel in the Gulf of Mexico on Aug. 5, 1989.  </P> <P>  -- A bigeye thresher shark that had traveled 1,400 miles, and an oceanic  whitetip shark that was recovered 1,200 miles from its tag site.  </P> <P>  -- A blue shark that had traveled at a rate of 44 miles a day. About 10% of  blue sharks recaptured had traveled more than 1,000 miles.  </P> <P> Recreational fishermen accounted for 66% of the sharks tagged in 1989.  </P> <P> SALTWATER FISHING -- Albacore are still being taken by fishermen aboard San  Diego's overnight fleet, but the bite is anything but wide open. Those aboard  the Pacific Dawn returned Tuesday morning with 19 of the long-fin tuna in the  20-pound range, 30 yellowfin tuna to 30 pounds, 48 dorado and a few yellowtail.  John Shull, the boat's owner-skipper, said some of the floating kelp paddies  found 55 miles south of the landings are holding tremendous volumes of fish  underneath, while others are not. "It's just a matter of finding the right  paddy," he said.  </P> <P> FLY FISHING -- At Bob Marriott's store in Fullerton: Phil Eubanks teaches 1  1/2-day introductory classes each weekend in September; Charlene Hanson, basic  fly tying Monday nights and advanced classes Friday nights. Details: (714)  525-1827.  </P> <P> SHOWS -- Newport fall boat shows at Lido Marina Yachting Center in Newport  Beach: used boats, Thursday-Sunday; new powerboats and sailboats, Sept. 12-16.  </P></p>

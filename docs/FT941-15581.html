			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Labour attacks curbs on debate Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, yesterday rejected Labour's claims that the government was treating parliament with contempt by the repeated use of the guillotine to curtail debate on controversial bills. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, complained that the three pieces of legislation that had completed their passage through the Commons since the current session opened in November had been guillotined. She said: 'No other government has shown such disregard for parliamentary safeguards which have grown up with good cause over the years.' Her complaints came shortly before a debate on the Non-Domestic Rating bill, which went through the last of its Commons stages yesterday. The measure, which aims to cushion businesses from the impact of increased rates bills, gained its third reading without a vote after a stormy two-day passage. Mr Newton said Labour's campaign of procedural 'trench warfare' had left the government with no alternative but to guillotine yesterday's bill. He said that 'boring and repetitious' speeches by Labour MPs had prevented the bill being carried through all its stages on Wednesday as the government had planned. Mrs Beckett said there was no justification for the guillotine on the business rates bill, particularly when the government itself had brought Wednesday's debate to a premature end. She added that Labour had started its procedural campaign when ministers forced through bills to increase employees' National Insurance contributions and make employers fully responsible for statutory sick pay on successive days before the Christmas recess.</p>

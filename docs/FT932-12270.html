			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lottery sale restrictions may be eased RESTRICTIONS on the sale of lottery tickets in bingo clubs and other leisure outlets are to be reviewed, the government said yesterday, as the National Lottery Bill approached its third Commons reading. Mr Peter Lloyd, home office minister, told MPs he would undertake a 'complete review' of existing rules which prohibit the sale of tickets in betting shops, bingo clubs, casinos, and amusement arcades. The government 'may well' come back with proposals to amend the regulations, Mr Lloyd said. In particular it would 'give favourable consideration' to proposals submitted by Mr Peter Fry, the Tory MP for Wellingborough, that would allow tickets for local lotteries to be sold in bingo clubs. It would be up to the organisations running the lotteries to decide where their tickets should be sold if current restrictions were lifted, Mr Lloyd said. In the case of pubs, the government has said it will allow pub operators to decide whether or not to sell lottery tickets. The Home Office said the review would start 'within months'. The government was 'sympathetic' to the idea of tickets being sold in amusement arcades but clearing the way for them to be sold in betting shops would require primary legislation. Earlier, Mr Robert Key, national heritage minister, gave an assurance that the funds distributed by the national lottery - which is planned to start next year - would not act as a substitute for public spending. Mr Key refused to be drawn on where the headquarters for the lottery would be located, except to say it would be in the UK. MPs voted down by a majority of 90 (259 votes to 169) a proposal by Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP for Liverpool Mossley Hill, that the headquarters should be set up in an area that would suffer job losses directly attributable to the lottery. Liverpool MPs have repeatedly argued that the lottery will have seriously adverse consequences for employment in the football pools industry which is heavily based in Merseyside.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. D. Kozhukhovskiy, A. I. Litvin, Cherkassy </F> Engineering-Technology University, Ukraine; UDC 681.5:512.643. 8]    [Abstract] This article examines means of solving the  Dirichlet problem for the Helmholtz equation in singly-connected  nearly rectangular regions using Walsh-Pally transforms. The use  of fast Walsh transforms increases the solution speed (by a  factor of 1.5-2 over the fast Fourier transform) and reduces the  amount of computer memory needed. It is found that solving the  two-dimensional Helmholtz equation may be reduced to solving the  one-dimensional problem. Figures 2; references 12: 11 Russian, 1  Western.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kigali, 24 Jun (AFP) -- Rebel and Army gunners  pounded Kigali overnight and sporadic fighting continued early  Friday [24 June] as United Nations forces prepared to evacuate  hundreds of displaced people from the airport, a UN spokesman  said.    "The fighting was very intense last night," UN military  spokesman Jean-Guy Plante told AFP by telephone from Kigali.  "There was a lot of heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. It's  still going on this morning but it's sporadic."    Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels are pressing their  offensive to flush remaining government soldiers out of the  capital Kigali, apparently fearing that French troops may  forestall an all-out victory by the rebels who control about  two-thirds of the small central African country.    Major Plante said UN troops had established radio contact  late Thursday with French forces that arrived in western Rwanda  on Thursday in the first stage of a military intervention to  stem ethnic bloodletting. He said UN commander General Romeo  Dallaire planned to meet Army chief of staff General Augustin  Bizimungu later Friday to discuss the French military  intervention and the future UN role in Rwanda.</p>

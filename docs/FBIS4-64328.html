			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Wastell and Toby Helm: "Fowler Aims To </F> Curb Tory In-Fighting"]    [Text] Right-Wing Cabinet ministers are pressing John  Major to prepare a blueprint for reform of the European  Community, with which Britain can "go on the attack" in the next  round of talks on the EC's future.    Their move came as senior Tories urged MPs and European  election candidates to concentrate their fire on opposition  policies, amid growing concern that party infighting over the EC  is harming its local and European election campaigns.    Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, said yesterday:  "What the party should do is get on to the attack against the  Labour Party and the Liberal Party, and set out the fundamental  differences and the gap between our view of of Europe and their  view of Europe."    Senior Tories are furious at the way "fanciful" reports  claiming Mr Major was contemplating withdrawing from the  European Community have dominated the final stages of the  campaign for Thursday's local elections, and threaten to  overshadow the forthcoming launch of the party's European  electlon campaign.    But there was fresh confusion last night over the Tory  Euro-manifesto, which is being revised at Mr Major's insistence.  On Friday Mr Major said it would be published "in a few  days'time."    Yesterday, however, senior party sources said it would not  be  released until the third week of May.    Ministers on the party's Right say they are less concerned  with the detail of the manifesto than with the Government's  long-term plan to ensure that Britain's agenda wins the day in  the 1996 inter-governmental conference, which will hammer out  the successor to the Maastricht Treaty.    They want the Government to draw up detailed proposals --  including plans to reduce the EC's power and a new system of  voting within the European Council -- to be published well in  advance of the conference.    The Right will also seek Conservative manifesto commitments  for the next general election to keep Britain out of a single  currency, and to use the veto to block any further moves towards  a more federal EC constitution.    A radical plan to curb the powers of the Commission will be  published this week by the European Policy Forum [EPF], an  independent think-tank with influence in the Foreign Office and  Downing Street. The EPF proposes breaking the European  Commission's grip on policy by splitting it into three separate  bodies with responsibility for overseeing the single market,  financial programmes and international trade.    Euro-sceptic Tory MPs are furious with Douglas Hurd, the  Foreign Secretary, who on Friday accused them of being "out of  touch with reality." One prominent Tory backbencher said  yesterday: "It is not the Euro-sceptics who are out of touch  but Douglas Hurd. He is not only out of touch but out of  credibility. If his constant refrain that Europe is coming our  way is the sick joke of the decade."</p>

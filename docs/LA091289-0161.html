			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NCAA CHIEF ASKS DELAY OF BRADLEY BILL  </P> <P> The head of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn., pleading for more time for  the organization to act on its own, pledged today to lobby for a Senate bill to  require colleges to disclose the graduation rates of their athletes unless the  NCAA takes action on the matter at its January meeting.  </P> <P> However, that assertion by NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz at a Senate  committee hearing did not deter Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), a former NBA star,  who said he will continue to push the legislation and hopes to have it passed  before January.  </P> <P> The NCAA collects graduation data from its member institutions and issues it in  an annual report. However, the report is not broken down by individual  colleges.  </P> <P> The Bradley bill would require that the individual figures be reported publicly  to the U.S. Department of Education and that each institution also disclose its  own rates to prospective athletic recruits.  </P></p>

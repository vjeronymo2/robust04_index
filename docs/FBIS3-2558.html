It seems that the British side is  determined not to converge with the Basic Law. However, the  structure of three-tier councils of Hong Kong formed during  British rule will end on 30 June 1997. By doing this, the  British side will have to be totally responsible for all  consequences thus arising.    Chen Ziying, who attended a CPPCC panel meeting today, made  the above remarks when asked a question by reporters.    Chen Ziying said: Everyone sees very clearly that the  British side has already decided to refuse to cooperate with the  Chinese side on the political system issue by coming up with  another package which does not converge with the Basic Law.  This shows that they do not wish to have the through train.  "It seems that they are already determined about this, so it is  not strange (that they are tabling another part of the political  reform package to the Legco).    A reporter asked what he thought about some NPC deputies  from  Hong Kong preparing to make an official proposal to the  forthcoming NPC session that the three-tier councils be  reelected.    Chen Ziying said: I am not very sure of the contents of the  proposal, but I believe that after 1997 as China resumes the  exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, "we have the Basic Law  and we are completely able to and have the means to thoroughly  implement the relevant provisions of the Basic Law and to carry  out one country, two systems, and the rule of Hong Kong by Hong  Kong people. This is not to be doubted at all."    He said: Now that the British Hong Kong authorities are  determined to refuse to cooperate with the Chinese side on the  political system question and not to converge with 1997 during  the transition period of British rule, "the decisions they make  before 30 June 1997 under the British Hong Kong administration,  of course, will be valid until 30 June 1997, and this means that  the three-tier councils formed in Hong Kong under British rule  will end then. This is a very natural thing. By doing this,  the British side will have to be completely responsible for all  consequences thus arising."    Moreover, asked whether the Chinese side has taken a milder  attitude than in the past, Chen Ziying said there is no question  of being mild or not, the Chinese side's fixed position has  always been to maintain Hong Kong's smooth transition and  long-term prosperity and stability.    Regarding whether or not the fact that the British side has  ruined the foundation of cooperation will have an adverse  influence, Chen Ziying stressed: "We have always hoped that  China and Britain could have good cooperation on the question of  Hong Kong during the transition period as this is good for Hong  Kong's smooth transition. But this is only our wish. The  British side does not wish the same. In the last 17 rounds of  talks, we already made very great efforts, but in the end they  were ruined by them so easily. This was what we very much did  not want to see. The fact that they have ruined cooperation on  the political system issue, of course, has a very bad influence.  Therefore, we hope that the British side will not ruin  cooperation in other areas any longer and will not go against  the wishes of Hong Kong people any longer.</p>

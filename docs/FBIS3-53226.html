			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Year 1994 and Clinton's Dreams"] </F>   [Text] The United States had a very difficult year in 1993,  according to many. Most of the observers are unanimous on two  points:    --The United States is planning for the future and the  current uncoordinated policies are part of that planning.    --The Democrats as well as the people of the United States  have made a mistake in electing Clinton as their President.    In any case, in 1993 the United States passed through a  period in which it experienced problems inherited from the  Republicans, including the events in Somalia and the ambivalence  toward Russia.    However, in the Middle East the United States was successful  in implementing a compromise more controversial and more  treasonous than the Camp David accord. When 'Arafat--stripped  of his gunbelt--shook hands with Rabin on the White House  grounds, there were many who banged their heads against the wall  in sheer fury. Some were not even Palestinians but had realized  that the days of the Cold War had actually come to an end and  most of the terms of that era had lost their true meaning.    In the early days of 1994, the U.S. President will have two  very important meetings: with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in  Geneva and with Russian President Yeltsin in Moscow. The Geneva  meeting is of vital importance to the United States. If Hafiz  al-Asad joins the trend of compromise, the Gaza-Jericho accord  will be insured. In addition, if Israel makes peace with Syria,  it will be able to enter the Middle East markets and the  longstanding dream of the Zionists will materialize.    However, if Hafiz al-Asad insists on his former stance, the  Gaza-Jericho accord will meet with the same fate as the Camp  David accord. It will become the unsuccessful and isolated plan  of an individual named 'Arafat who has neither legitimacy nor  popularity.    Clinton will also have to empathize with Yeltsin and at the  same time beware of someone such as Zhirinovskiy as the trend of  events in Russia seems to be uncontrollable and unpredictable.  The Russians need billions of dollars of assistance and the  United States cannot hope to have such capital returned,  especially since it does not know what to do about the vacuum  created by the disbanding of the Warsaw pact in Eastern Europe.    Thus, it appears that the United States has difficult days  ahead in 1994, especially since a united Europe is economically  stronger than the United States. Even though it is not endowed  with the U.S. political strength, it has very strong industries  and considers rivalry in trade and commerce of greater  importance than politics. The United States is aware that if it  is hesitant in its approach toward countries such as the PRC and  if it takes political considerations into account in its  bilateral relations, Europe will immediately sign numerous  agreements and will conquer the markets.    All these circumstances are not completely subservient to  the  wishes, needs, and capabilities of the Democrat administration  in the United States, as Washington's cohorts and competitors  have gauged the conditions prevailing in the world and have  unconditionally demanded their rights. Therefore, Clinton will  not be able to see all his dreams come true in 1994.</p>

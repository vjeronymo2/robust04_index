			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: Stop press - Maxwell saved from the sea / A look at the world which greeted the first pink FT HIS NAME was Maxwell and he was dragged out of the sea after deciding to commit suicide. The date was January 2 1893, the report a tiny item in the Financial Times. Why Joseph Maxwell threw himself into what the FT described as Glasgow harbour is not clear, but in the event it availed his rescuers little, for the report ends: 'He afterwards jumped from a bedroom window and was killed.' Indeed, it is not just this tale, in the autumn of Queen Victoria's reign, that provokes a feeling of deja vu. There was also recession, endemic unemployment, home rule demands for Ireland, a Channel tunnel plan and Uruguay talks on trade. The issue's review of the year strikes a familiar note. 'It has been a year of death in life for the moneyed classes who have suffered very severely from the paralysis of commercial confidence, and from the general depression in trade.' Familiar too was the note that 'the Uruguay settlement' on trade with Argentina 'has pursued its course quietly in spite of all sinister prognostications'. But the first Monday in 1893 was memorable for another reason: it was when, overnight, a white newspaper transformed itself into a pink-tinted one - though not yet the bold salmon pink of modern times. Why the change? The brief answer is the fledgling FT, five years old, was struggling in the shadow of its older rival, the Financial News: and that it was almost certainly a last desperate gamble, an attempt to stand out on all those railway station news stands of late-Victorian London. No more than a line recognised the colour change in that first pink copy but there was a column entitled 'ourselves' which acknowledged that the paper had discovered a world outside the City of London. It said: 'A City man cannot afford to ignore political events when he attempts to gauge the markets, and even such apparently trifling matters such as a snowstorm or landslip are often of high significance to particular stocks.' The intention was to give 'all the news which can be of interest financially or otherwise to the intelligent business man.' But it insisted: 'We shall not attempt to compete with the ordinary newspaper in tales of sea serpents, or in discovering what to do with our girls. That sort of old maid's gossip has nothing of interest for business men.' Prurient Victorian interest in death and disaster proved irresistible however. On page three a one-line story said: 'Mrs (Lilly) Langtry is reported to be out of danger.' Another report said: 'In cleaning his revolver a journalist on the staff of an Edinburgh newspaper pulled the trigger, not thinking any of the chambers were loaded and shot his mother, who died from her injuries.' It was not a buoyant City that now abandoned dreary monochrome. Barely two years earlier, in November 1890, the Baring Crisis had all but seen the demise of its most august merchant bank, following over-involvement in the Argentine, and since then the foreign loans market had virtually dried up. Financial crises were brewing in Australia and the US, and there was not even help at hand from the volatile, highly speculative world of South African gold mining. which had hit technical problems not overcome until the development in the mid-1890s of deep-level mining. The City knew who was to blame: namely, the Liberal government headed by the octogenarian Gladstone, with the rumbustious, uncompromising Sir William Harcourt at his side as chancellor. The 'GOM' (Grand Old Man) had long enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the ever more rightwards-inclining City; but by now, in his fourth term of office, he was positively reviled, not least because of his plan to introduce Home Rule for Ireland. At one point, when Gladstone's resignation was rumoured, business came to a halt on the Stock Exchange as members cheered loudly. In fact, the City's darkest hour was before the dawn. In 1894 there began the 20-year period that is now viewed as the Square Mile's golden age, until its complacent assumptions were shattered in 1914 by the guns of August. These were the years in which the volume of world trade increased rapidly, the City was to the fore in servicing that trade, sterling reigned supreme, and a host of foreign banks, entrepreneures and outright adventurers all made their way to the undisputed international financial centre of the world. Inhabiting the City on the day the FT went pink were about a quarter of a million male clerks. The lady typist was still a fabled creature awaiting the new century. One young clerk at the Bank of England, was Herbert de Fraine, and years later he pictured the army of clerkdom to which he was proud to belong: 'What did we look like, outside the walls of the Old Lady? We wore the inevitable silk hat, with a strip of dull cloth, three inches wide, covering the silk band.' De Fraine's ultimate boss in January 1893, an acknowledged head of the City as a whole, was David Powell, governor of the Bank of England. Powell was a merchant, a reminder of the City's strongly commercial as well as financial character - and was one of five governors in the course of the 1890s, the office passing strictly by rota among the Bank's directors. The Bank was dictator of British monetary policy, with little or no interference from the government, but it was still run in an amateurish way. It was perhaps a shock rather than a surprise when the chief cashier, Frank May, was found guilty later in the year of having, in Powell's regretful words, 'engaged in Stock Exchange speculations which had placed him in serious pecuniary difficulties'. No-one denied the importance of the Old Lady, but increasingly the true City elite was to be found in the parlours of the best merchant banks Rothschilds was still a name to be reckoned with under the capable if overly cautious leadership of Lord 'Natty' Rothschild, Barings was bravely re-emerging from its trauma, and JS Morgan &amp; Co (soon to become Morgan Grenfell) was the top Anglo-American house. One merchant bank moving up rapidly on the outside was J. Henry Schroder &amp; Co, whose white hope for the future was Bruno Schroder, a 25-year-old from Hamburg, and nephew of the senior partner. The City was a world of its own, a Victorian public school writ large, with of nicknames, practical jokes and inviolable but unspoken codes. 'Beetles' were Colorado United Mining shares. 'Cream-jugs' were Charkov-Krementschug Railway bonds, 'Pots' were North Staffordshire Railway ordinary stock, and 'Sarah's Boots' were (of course) Sierra Buttes Gold Mine shares. A 'squirt' was someone who hung about the market with a paltry order, not dealing fairly, while to 'shoot' was to make a man a close price in a stock without knowing if there would be a profit or loss on the bargain; and to hear the cry 'Fourteen hundred' was to know that a stranger had been spotted in the House, invariable leading to a vigorous, even bruising 'rat-hunt'. By 1893 there were over 3,000 members of the Stock Exchange, or 'Gorgonzola Hall' as it was known to its inhabitants, on account of its distinctly veined walls and pillars. The markets were driven by rumours and counter-rumours creating a febrile atmosphere. One piece of news that darkened the mood was when King Alexander of Servia seized power in April though he was only 17. Markets slumped, and one member was quoted as saying 'when the bit burst comes for the European war, it will begin in just such a pottering way'. That eastern storm lay ahead but for the workaday brokers and jobbers of the Stock Exchange, the immediate problem was how to keep afloat until confidence was restored and, above all, prosperity returned to the 'Kaffir Circus' the name usually given to the South African mining market. One such member was Hugh E M Stutfield, author at about this time of an article entitled 'Celibacy and the Struggle to get on'. Temperamentally, though, the City has always been a bull rather than a bear; and at the end of 1893 the Financial News ran an anecdote attesting to that incorrigibly optimistic streak, a story that might even have prompted a smile from the editor of the FN's upstart pink rival: 'Overheard outside the Stock Exchange. Hungry Broker (scenting a possible Pounds 12 10s): 'Do you want to make a bit over the new year? Buy yourself 500 Milwaukees.' Client: 'But I was just thinking of selling 500'. Hungry Broker (eagerly): 'Well, not so bad either]'.'</p>

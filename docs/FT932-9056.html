			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc US arm settles dispute RHONE-POULENC Rorer, the US healthcare arm of Rhone-Poulenc of France, has settled a long-running dispute with Baxter International over the patents for the manufacture of ultra-purified Factor VIII, a product for haemophiliacs. Under the agreement, Baxter will pay Rorer Dollars 105m for past and future sales of its Factor VIII blood-clotting product. Rorer claimed in 1991 that Baxter had infringed its patents. Baxter receives a non-exclusive worldwide licence to manufacture the treatment, but the group has agreed not to license or transfer the technology to countries where RPR already has a patent. Baxter has also signed a contract to supply Rorer with Factor VIII. In February, Rorer settled a long-running dispute with Miles, Bayer of Germany's US subsidiary, over Factor VIII. Terms were not disclosed. A dispute with Chiron over the same product is still outstanding. Ares-Serono, the human fertility drug specialist, reports a 7 per cent slide in operating income to USDollars 35.4m on sales down 9 per cent to Dollars 180.6m, writes Ian Rodger from Zurich. Mr Fabio Bertarelli, chief executive, said the industry was being affected 'by a variety of economic measures which are, in part, reducing healthcare assistance to the patient'. Net income from continuing operations increased by 1.9 per cent to Dollars 16.9m or Dollars 4.51 per share. Final profit of Dollars 44.7m in the comparative period was enhanced by the Dollars 28.1m proceeds from the sale of the group's over-the-counter business.</p>

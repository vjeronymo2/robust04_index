Egyptian  militants have warned foreigners to leave the country for their  own safety, saying the next attacks will be extremely ferocious  and strong. Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin gave the Israeli  assessment to reporter Jack Katzenell:    [Begin recording] [Beilin] Well, we are of course following  the situation, but we are sure that the Egyptian Government is  able to handle this situation and to take care of those  developments which are, of course, not very positive, but still  are far from representing the general mood in Egypt.    [Katzenell] Do you think that Israelis can still visit  Egypt, or should still visit Egypt as tourists?    [Beilin] We are not calling on Israelis not to visit Egypt.  [end recording]</p>

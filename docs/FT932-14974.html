			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / G7 backs Yeltsin with Pounds 28bn: Package tied to continued economic and political reforms in Russia THE Group of Seven leading industrialised nations yesterday threw their weight behind President Boris Yeltsin and his economic reforms ahead of the Russian referendum with a financial package worth Dollars 43bn (Pounds 28bn). Although the bigger-than-expected package includes some existing commitments, it is explicitly tied to continued economic and political reform in Russia, strengthening Mr Yeltsin's hand against his opponents. The G7 package is also tacitly linked to continued Russian co-operation on foreign policy issues. It seeks particularly to ensure that Moscow does not stand in the way of western plans to implement tougher sanctions against Serbia in the attempt to resolve the deepening crisis in former Yugoslavia. 'Russian reform and progress towards democratisation are essential to world peace,' the G7 said. 'We assure the Russian people of our support in coping with the inevitable hardships of the transition period.' Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, warned that the 'world will be a considerably more dangerous place' if Mr Yeltsin and his reforms did not prevail. The package was 'in no way a programme of charity', he said. The latest effort by the G7 to prop up Mr Yeltsin came as the Russian leader went on the offensive in Moscow in his efforts to win popular support for his presidency in a referendum on April 25. He told supporters he would not obey the strict rules for the referendum set by his rivals in the Russian parliament and ordered a drastic cut in the privileges and duties of his rebellious vice president, General Alexander Rutskoi. The bulk of the multilateral aid package comprises existing commitments of assistance from international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund which have been brought together for the first time. The main new ingredients are confirmation of an innovative Dollars 3bn IMF loan facility which will be available in two tranches as Russia adopts policies designed to curb inflation and its budget deficit. In addition there will be a Dollars 300m small business development fund mainly financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The EBRD will also prepare plans for a Russian bank for small business development. The other main ingredients of the package are: A Dollars 15bn debt rescheduling deal agreed by Russia's 19 creditor countries in Paris on April 2. About Dollars 10bn in longer term loans from the IMF which were originally offered last year but not taken up by the Russians. The US, Japan and the UK between them made new bilateral pledges of aid worth more than Dollars 4bn. Much of this is expected to form part of a commitment from G7 countries to provide export credits totalling about Dollars 10bn. Loans from the World Bank to restructure Russian industry worth about Dollars 5bn, most of which will be made available over the next 15 months. The ministers also agreed to study a US proposal for a Dollars 4bn fund to promote the privatisation of large state run enterprises. US officials said they were not disappointed that the fund had not been agreed but they made it clear the US expects such a fund to be approved at the G7 heads of state summit due to be held in Tokyo in July. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the Russian deputy prime minister who attended the two days of talks with G7 foreign and finance ministers, said Russia was satisfied with the outcome.

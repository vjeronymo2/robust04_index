			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / IMF chief urges Bundesbank cut: Camdessus says way is clear for actions over interest rates INTERNATIONAL pressure on Germany to take further action to speed up European growth intensified yesterday when Mr Michel Camdessus, International Monetary Fund managing director, said a 'substantial decrease' in German interest rates was appropriate. Mr Camdessus did not specify when the Bundesbank should take necessary action but said because of the substantial slowdown in German economic activity 'a rapid decline in inflation' was likely in Germany, leaving the way clear for further monetary easing. Even though he acknowledged growth prospects for the industrial world had deteriorated in recent months, Mr Camdessus was generally upbeat about the possibility of a broadly based world recovery. This was on the grounds that several leading nations had already taken steps to stimulate economic activity and cut budget deficits. 'Among the industrial countries there is a sense of action,' Mr Camdessus said. At meetings in Washington this week leading nations would send a 'message of confidence' that the outlook was improving. An important stimulus to world growth was that many developing nations had performed 'brilliantly' in recording substantial economic growth and avoiding the slowdown in the industrial world. He singled out India for its 'admirable' recent actions in economic reform. Mr Camdessus was speaking before tomorrow's meeting in Washington of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.  The IMF's policy-setting interim committee, representing 24 countries, is meeting on Friday. Mr Camdessus's comments appeared substantially more optimistic than the tone of the IMF's twice-yearly report on the world economy which earlier this week painted a bleak picture of the immediate outlook. It was particularly gloomy about Europe and said prospects for a substantial increase in international growth were 'hesitant and uneven'. Although the US government should take extra steps to bring down its fiscal deficit in the longer term, Mr Camdessus welcomed the 'bold' action by the Clinton administration in announcing its budget consolidation plan. He was encouraged also by programmes in the UK and France to reduce government borrowing and by the Japanese package to speed growth. He welcomed clear signs in the UK that its recession was over, and while stressing that more action was needed had been pleased to see recent cuts in the Bundesbank's leading interest rates. The US hopes tomorrow's G7 meeting will 'lay the groundwork' for world recovery, Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, said. He said an important part of a world recovery programme would be further cuts in European interest rates. Mr Summers said inflation in almost all G7 countries was 'under control'. There was a less pressing need to take joint action to bear down on rising prices, leaving more leeway for steps to improve growth.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Observer: Dear John In philanthropic mood, Observer offers the following advice to John Major in his aim of cleansing government. Send the following round-robin letter to all Tory MPs. It's modelled on that sent to Tim Smith, accepting his resignation from the Northern Ireland office. Recipients with easy consciences could return it with the blanks unfilled. Dear X, I understand you may have had a relationship with ------ in the 1980s. At the risk of being obvious, was it something you are now a little shamefaced about? Did you manage completely to cover your tracks? If not, it will be no good going to the cabinet secretary and mumbling something along the lines of: 'Well, everyone else was doing it.' Please assist by tendering your resignation if you think anyone might get whiff of something nasty. I will, of course, regret your leaving because of the excellent beginning you have made in ------. Still, if we're to have a snowball's chance in hell of winning the next election you had better push off. Sharpish. Yours ever, John.</p>

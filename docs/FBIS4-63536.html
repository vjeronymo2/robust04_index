			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Zhilyakov] </F>   [Text] Krasnodar May 20 TASS -- "The fact that Nikolay  Yegorov was appointed (Russian) minister for ethnic affairs and  regional policies, has imbued us, inhabitants of northern  Caucasus, with hope," President Ruslan Aushev of Ingushetia told  ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview on Friday. He participated  in a conference of leaders of North-Caucasean regions, which  took place in Krasnodar.    "As for me, I have never concealed the fact that (the  federal  government) has no regional policy as yet. I have always  criticized the ministry led by Sergey Shakhray," he added.    Describing his attitude toward the newly appointed minister,  who previously led the Krasnodar territorial administration,  President Aushev said:    "He is a practician, a man, who -- to use a military term --  commanded the territory inhabited by people of all nationalities  represented in Russia. All of them are living in peace. I  believe Nikolay Yegorov merits reward for this."    President Aushev expressed hope that Yegorov would make use  of the experience he had gained in his economic and political  activities.    "We, leaders of North-Caucasian regions, will help him shape  regional policies," said the Ingushetian president.</p>

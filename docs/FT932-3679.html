			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Timing - the key to success - Doing the Splits / A trust with sound investment performance and simple structure FLEMING Income &amp; Capital investment trust was launched in March 1992, just before the general election. The stock market was then fairly depressed by the prospect of a Labour victory; as a result, the launch raised Pounds 92m, much less than the Pounds 246m achieved by M &amp; G Income (covered in this series last week). But, in terms of investment performance, the issue has turned out to be reasonably well-timed. According to manager Tony Nutt, the trust was launched 'sufficiently far through the recession that we had a better chance of spotting those companies which were going to cut their dividends.' FICIT has a relatively simple structure, by split capital trust standards. There are only two separate classes of share: zero dividend preference and ordinary income. This, says Nutt, should ensure no conflict of interest between the various classes of shareholders. At the launch date, the trust already had sufficient assets to repay the zero dividend preference shares. As a result, Nutt can concentrate on earning a good return for the ordinary income shares. The zeros pay no income but have first claim on the assets of the trust. Their capital entitlement, 30p at launch, increases by 11 per cent per annum to reach 85.2p by the wind-up date in 2002. Having been offered at 30p at launch, the zeros have jumped to 42p within 15 months, a gain of 40 per cent. However, the zeros were originally on offer only to institutions, so the bad news for private investors is that none will have enjoyed the full gain. At the present price, Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities, estimates that the zeros are trading on a gross redemption yield of 8.49 per cent. 'They are not the cheapest zeros in the world but they are correctly priced and they are very safe' says Aaron, noting that the trust has assets equal to 128 per cent of the final redemption price. The ordinary income shares are entitled to all the income of the trust and to the remaining assets once the zero shareholders have been repaid. At the Thursday share price of 74.5p, the shares had a gross yield of 8.1 per cent. Although they carry the title 'ordinary income,' it would be a mistake to view them as the same type of investment as shares in a conventional trust, such as Foreign &amp; Colonial. The existence of the zeros, rising remorselessly at 11 per cent per annum, means that the ordinary income shares are a geared investment. The share price performance of the income shares rather suffered in the early months of the trust's life, reaching a low of 47p in October. The sale of a substantial institutional stake proved a drag on the price during this period. But the stock market rally which followed the pound's departure from the exchange rate mechanism helped the income shares to rebound past 70p by the year-end. At a price of 74.5p, ordinary income shareholders have seen only a modest 6.5 per cent gain in price since the trust's launch. In part, this is because it has had to earn back the launch expenses of around 4 per cent. But they have also received a net dividend of 4.725p, taking the total return for personal equity plan investors past 15 per cent. The net asset value of the ordinary income shares, at the present repayment value of the zeros, was 75.97p as of June 9. Allowing for the final repayment value of the zeros, however, the asset value was only 24.95p. Warburg's Aaron estimates that the assets of the trust will have to grow at 5.2 per cent per annum for ordinary income shareholders to get back the present share price. If both assets and dividends grow at 5 per cent per annum, then Aaron estimates investors will get a gross redemption yield of 9.78 per cent a year. It was no coincidence that the trust was launched at the end of the tax year when investors thoughts' tend to turn to the need to use up their annual personal equity plan allowance. At the time of the launch, an investment trust new issue was the only way investors could get a full Pounds 6,000 annual Pep allowance into a collective fund. Accordingly, nearly 56 per cent of the ordinary income shares are held in Pep form. Such investors should note that the gross dividend could well fall this year because of the Budget changes which reduced the tax credit to Pep investors. In addition, there are units, which comprise one zero and one ordinary income share. These effectively resemble shares in a conventional investment trust. At the Thursday price of 117.5p, the units have a gross yield of 5 per cent. The assets per unit were 110.15p, putting the trust on a premium of around 6.7 per cent. The breakdown of the portfolio by sector is: financial groups (23.6 per cent); utilities (19.2 per cent); consumer goods (19 per cent); other groups (18.1 per cent); oil and gas (11.4 per cent); and capital goods (8.7 per cent). The portfolio yield is designed to be 30 per cent higher than that prevailing on the FT-A All-Share index. Accordingly, the present yield is 5.4 per cent, boosted by the trust's 11.9 per cent holding in convertible bonds and convertible preference shares. The 10 largest stocks in the portfolio at March 31 were: British Telecommunications, Commercial Union, South West Water, National Westminster Bank, British Gas, BOC, LASMO, Tomkins, Blue Circle and Shell. Nutt says the trust moved heavily into utilities following the launch and, later in the year, bought financial stocks, which tend to be beneficiaries in the early stages of the economic cycle. He adds that the trust will now look to move into stocks which have already cut their dividends to a point which gives scope for future growth. Warburg's Aaron says that the trust has, thus far, been one of the successes of the split capital sector because of a decent investment performance since launch and a less risky structure.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["People's Forum" by Mi Bohua (4717 0590 5478): "Is It </F> Possible To Check the Advance?"]    [Text] The prejudice of a few foreigners against the  Chinese people is quite deep-rooted. This is how we often feel.  The causes may be quite complicated, but they contain traces of  colonial ideas. As many Chinese residing abroad put it, behind a  gentle and cultured appearance is a kind of coldness and  contempt. For example, during a short-distance speed-skating  race at the Winter Olympics, all the spectators saw that an  athlete of a certain country used her arm to block Chinese  athlete Zhang Yanmei to gain an unfair advantage. However, when  the Chinese team leader lodged a protest, some went as far as to  say: "It is already pretty good that you won second place."  (See page 1 of the 26 February issue of ZHONGGUO TIYU BAO  [CHINA SPORTS NEWSPAPER]) It seems that the rules of  competition did not really matter, that the person already had a  pretty good idea of which country's athlete would be in which  place, and therefore, the enforcement of the rules differed with  different people.    We do not intend to comment on whether or not the foreign  athlete concerned harbored any motive in violating the rule.  The right and wrong are self-evident since there are rules, and  their were feelings expressed by the spectators. Nor do we want  to overly criticize the referees. It is understandable that, in  a hotly contested athletic competition, mistakes in judgment are  sometimes unavoidable. However, it would be quite wrong to say  that, because she was Chinese, even she was first in skill, she  could only win the second- or third-place medals and that she  had to thank the judge for his favor.    Such incidents have occurred more than once and are not  confined to athletic competition. However, that person had,  perhaps, talked recklessly and let the truth slip out. When you  cannot win a medal, people laugh at you and hold you up to  ridicule, and when you win a medal, they try to find fault with  you, and belittle and hurt you in an enigmatic manner. In their  minds, achievements and glory -- and gold medals -- should not  belong to the Chinese. However, things are going contrary to  their wishes. The Chinese have not been obstructed by hidden  obstacles, but have become champions again and again. It is  similar to the poem: "The wall cannot conceal the spring within  a garden, and a branch of red apricot flowers is stretching over  the wall." The branch of red apricot flowers that is China will  remain beautiful and fragrant.    The so-called "It is already pretty good that you won second  place" is a strange idea not worthy of refutation. However, it  is excellent material for teaching with negative examples. It  helps us see clearly the true color of the overbearing and  imperious nature of some people in the international family.    In the eyes of some people, China is poor, backward,  uncivilized, and not worth being mentioned at all. The Chinese  people are still the "rural flocks" who are physically weak and  have a wretched appearance. This is not strange. Since the  middle of the last century, the "great Westerners" have resorted  to beating and killing when dealing with China, signed many  unequal treaties which humiliated the Chinese people, and took  almost anything they wanted. Although this page of history is  now turned, that sense of racial superiority is hard to discard.  "When I eat the steamed bun, it is right and proper; when you  eat the steamed bread of corn, you should content yourself with  it." In the big international family, the Chinese people could  only be the henchmen, and henchmen ought to be included by the  great gentlemen. Of course, the great gentlemen are not willing  to face the progress made by China. Perhaps they will continue  to cling to their prejudice; or maybe they will become jealous  when they see that they can do nothing about it, and conclude  that they are unhappy anyway. This is not strange, for the rise  of a nation as big as China means the fall of hegemony. If we  link this historical background to "it is already pretty good  that you won second place," it is not difficult to see the  thoughts, ideas, and worries of some people.    The Chinese people can still remember, though not very well,  the Paris Conference 70 years ago. Concession did not win any  understanding and sympathy, but invited endless bullying. When  we look back, we can still see the storms and rains of this  century. There can be only one conclusion: Not relying on  heaven, and not relying on earth, the Chinese people can only  rely on themselves, and only a strong, stable, and prosperous  China can win the respect of the people of the world. We will  not beg the people who hold prejudices against China to change  their views, but we must stand up courageously in the face of  humiliation, work hard to become strong, make earnest efforts to  invigorate the country, and prove by our real strength that  China is great and strong and that the Chinese nation is an  excellent nation. Facts are most convincing.    The whole world can see that the Chinese people are heading  toward prosperity and rushing to a bright 21st century, and no  one can stop the trend, whether they like it or not. The  Chinese people have already broken their "zero" record of  Olympic medals, have won some gold medals, and will win more  gold medals as well. The page of the old history is turned.  "It is already pretty good that you won second place" is only  an outdated elegy of the old colonialism. The Chinese people,  who have already stood up, will surely be able to compile a most  beautiful and grandiose chapter. If you do not believe, wait  and see!</p>

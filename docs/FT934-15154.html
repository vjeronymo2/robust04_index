			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat receives financing approaches GREYCOAT, the property company struggling to fend off receivership, said yesterday it had received a number of approaches regarding a possible financial restructuring. One has come from the UK Active Value Fund, advised by corporate financiers Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian Treger and controlling 18 per cent of Greycoat's ordinary shares. Greycoat's adviser, N M Rothschild, said it had received at least two approaches, but that all but the UK Active Value Fund had declined to be identified. The company also said it had received notice from the Law Debenture Trust, trustee of Greycoat's Pounds 50m zero coupon bonds, that it had 30 days to rectify the breach of the gearing covenant. Greycoat's bond and shareholders last Friday rejected a Pounds 120m refinancing package from Postel, the UK's largest pension fund. The company has been in breach of its gearing covenants on the Pounds 50m of zero coupon bonds since Postel's offer was published in September. Rothschild had expected the Law Debenture Trust to issue the 30-day notice - which is not a demand for payment - on Monday. If after 30 days, the gearing is not reduced or an alternative refinancing plan is not forthcoming, the trustees of the zero coupon bond are likely to issue a default notice. This would trigger action from other creditors.</p>

He hoped therefore  that a peace agreement which was acceptable to everyone and  offered adequate guarantees for Bosnia would be possible.    The minister was questioned in Senate on the situation in  Bosnia by De Donnea (PRL) [Liberal Reformation Party] and De  Croo (VLD) [Flemish Liberal Democrats]. He called once again  for the European Union to speak with one voice and said it  should take the indispensable step of deciding its foreign  policies by a federal method, rather than the current  interministerial conferences at which any decision must be  unanimous.    The minister also reiterated that NATO's decision to set an  ultimatum for the withdrawal of heavy weapons around Sarajevo  was an inevitable step. The peace process had reached an  impasse and a new element was necessary. Claes saw the  ultimatum as a "stimulus" to the peace negotiations. He also  called for the ultimatum to be applied firmly. Thus he said he  was in favor of a clear definition of what was expected exactly.    For the minister, an effective peace agreement has to  involve  all the parties on the ground, the EU, the United States,  Russia, and the Islamic countries. As for Russia in particular,  the minister recalled that this country had voted in favor of  the Security Council resolutions which supported the NATO  decision. He also said Russia should be actively involved in  the peace negotiations in the interest of the regions concerned,  and also in the interests of democratization in Russia.    Finally, Claes said Belgium should accept making additional  efforts if NATO requested them.</p>

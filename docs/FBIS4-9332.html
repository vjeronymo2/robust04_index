			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 22 (AFP) -- The final UN military  observer held by Bosnian Serb forces was freed Friday afternoon  [22 April], said UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force]  spokesman Major Eric Chaperon. The observer, who was named as  Dutch Major Van Baal, was freed along with his Serb interpreter,  the United Nations Protection Force spokesman said. Van Baal  informed his Sarajevo headquarters of the men's release, the  circumstances of which were not detailed.    The two men went missing April 11, the day after the first  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air strike on Serb forces  besieging the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde.  Fifty-eight unarmed UN military observers were placed under  house arrest by Serb forces in areas under their control in  reprisal for that air strike and a second strike a day later.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / CBI wants jobs to take priority over pay increases SOCIAL STABILITY in Britain could be threatened if pay increases take priority over jobs when recovery gets under way, according to Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. Addressing a private meeting of senior industrialists earlier this week, Mr Davies warned that an acceleration of wage increases, prompted by skill shortages, could produce high inflation alongside high unemployment. 'In those circumstances, one has to have some concern about social stability,' he said. He also stressed the responsibility of employers in achieving a better trade-off between pay and jobs. 'Employers have a key role to play, by seeking growth opportunities, not just headcount reductions, and by investing in their workforces . . . businesses can only afford to do that, and will only be able to expand their markets, if they pay realistic increases.' Mr Davies also criticised executive pay in the UK. 'The recent record on senior management pay is not easy to defend in all companies,' he said. He pointed to the fact that pay awards for directors and managers were lying between 4 per cent and 6 per cent in the last half of 1992, compared with 2.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent for employees overall. But he welcomed the general fall in the size of pay increases, now running at below 3 per cent according to the CBI, and pointed out that unit labour costs were increasing less in the UK than in other leading industrial countries. Mr Davies said, however, that UK labour costs were still not as competitive as they needed to be and that real earnings for those in work had continued to rise throughout the recession. Pointing to the continued prominence of the inflation rate in wage negotiations, he also said: 'I am left with an uneasy feeling that we may have been here before, 10 years ago for example, and that we've let things slip away before.' Although Mr Davies criticised the uneven distribution of the 'pain of the recession' and said a slower growth in living standards would have meant fewer people out of work, he only tentatively welcomed workers' recent agreement to trade off a pay cut against job security at Sheffield city council.

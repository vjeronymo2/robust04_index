In their statements to  the judge in Elche the three accused denied belonging to the  Islamic Salvation Front, the FIS, as one of them had told  journalists. Tomorrow the judge will decide if the case is to  be referred to the National High Court.    [Correspondent Angeles Bandres] This was the moment this  afternoon when the three Algerian policemen were taken to  Fontcalent prison in Alicante. They were taken there after  making statements to the judge in which they denied any link  with the fundamentalist group FIS.    [Judge Juan Francisco Vives] No, no, no. They completely  deny  belonging to the FIS. There is nothing to indicate that they  are, and they consistently deny it.    [Bandres] However, this morning one of them told a number of  journalists that they belonged to the Islamic Salvation Front.    [Unidentified journalist] Do you belong to any political  group?    [Unidentified man] To the FIS, the FIS, but we are also  Muslims.    [Bandres] According to the judge, the detainees could be  accused of seizing an aircraft, but not terrorism, because they  were not acting as an armed group.</p>

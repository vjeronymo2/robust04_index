			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 28 (CTK) -- Slovakia has conducted  talks with new Hungarian leaders on the chances of concluding a  fundamental political agreement on good neighbourly relations,  Premier Jozef Moravcik said on television tonight, but did not  specify when the talks had taken place.    The agreement would guarantee the unchangeability of the  present borders and the status of ethnic minorities in the two  countries.    Moravcik said the Stability Pact proposed by French Premier  Edouard Balladur created very good conditions for the  confirmation of the existing borders.    "Territorial autonomy for the Hungarian minority in Slovakia  is ruled out, and this has also been accepted by the Hungarian  party during the talks," Moravcik said.    He was reacting to a statement by ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar  that the next Hungarian Premier Gyula Horn had made territorial  autonomy for the Hungarian community in Slovakia a condition for  the conclusion of the inter-state treaty.    About 560,000 Hungarians live in Slovakia, constituting  about  11 percent of its population. Some of their leaders, assisted  by certain forces in Hungary, have demanded territorial autonomy  for southern Slovakia heavily inhabited by ethnic Hungarians.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TOO SLOW IN GRABBING EUROPEAN MARKETS, EXPERT SAYS  </P> <P> Lord Cockfield, a former British Cabinet minister and architect of the planned  economic unification of Western Europe in 1992, said U.S. companies are not  moving fast enough to capitalize on emerging markets in the European Economic  Community.  </P> <P> "The window of opportunity for American companies is narrowing quickly as 1992  nears," Cockfield said in an interview Wednesday. "While Japanese investments  in the European Community have substantially increased in the last four years,  many of which have been in high technology, the growth of American investment  has been slow."  </P> <P> In the last two years alone, Japan's direct investment in the EEC tripled, from  $9.1 billion in 1988 to $30 billion last year. U.S. investment, although larger  than Japan's, has not shown any growth from about $126 billion in 1988,  according to Aidan St. P. Walsh, the international director of KPMG Peat  Marwick, the New York-based international accounting firm.  </P> <P> "Unless you act quickly," he said, "you'll find your competitor sitting on your  doorstep" because European Community companies are also expanding rapidly in  the international market, particularly in the United States.  </P> <P> Cockfield made his remarks in an interview before a speech at the World Trade  Center Assn.'s annual dinner meeting Wednesday night.  </P> <P> One area that Orange County companies can still capitalize on is Western  Europe's booming information technology market, he said. While the EEC accounts  for 30% of the world market in information technology, EEC companies have been  able to supply only 11% of the market, he said.  </P> <P> Cockfield developed plans for the European Community's economic unification  while serving as vice president of the European Communities Commission. He is  an expert on how economic and political policies coming out of the European  Parliament in Brussels will affect the international market. Since leaving the  EC Commission in 1988, he has been a special adviser to KPMG Peat Marwick  McLintock, the U.K. affiliate of the accounting firm.  </P> <P> Cockfield said he sees "no prospect" of the newly liberalized East European  countries joining the EEC.  </P> <P> He said U.S. companies trading with Eastern Europe should plan investments  there separately from their involvement in Western Europe.  </P></p>

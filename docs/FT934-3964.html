			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Retail worker 'forced into Sunday contract' A former employee of a London menswear chain claimed yesterday that he had been forced to accept a contract requiring him to work on Sundays against his will. The claim follows earlier allegations that leading retailers such as J. Sainsbury have put pressure on employees to work on Sundays. The claim was endorsed enthusiastically by supporters of Sunday shopping restrictions, who fear that wavering Labour MPs may swing the Commons behind partial deregulation in a crucial vote tomorrow. Mr Matthew Phillips, a former supervisor for the Mister Byrite chain, said he had been given an hour to sign a contract making Sunday a normal working day. The revised contract stipulates that Sunday is the first day of the working week, and that employees will be paid at the company's normal rates. Mr Phillips, who left the company voluntarily in April, said he signed the contract because he was told he would be made redundant if he refused. The details of Mr Phillips' contract were confirmed by Mister Byrite, which says that 350 other employees accepted the changes without complaints. Mr Mick O'Connor, general manager, said the contracts were issued to put all employees on similar terms when it became 'obvious' that the group would have to trade on Sundays to protect its market share. Mr O'Connor denied that employees had been forced to sign the contract. He said, however, that Mr Phillips was told that he should reconsider his future in retailing if he refused to sign. The pressure group Keep Sunday Special said the case illustrated the 'worthless' nature of employment protections in the government's Sunday trading bill, which was given a second reading last week. MPs will decide in a free vote between three options in the Sunday trading bill which would replace the widely ignored 1950 Shops Act. Keep Sunday Special claims majority support for tight restrictions, but is concerned that some Labour MPs may support a plan backed by the big retail chains allowing shops to open for six hours. A third option allowing unrestricted opening is supported by the prime minister and a majority of the cabinet, but is thought to have little chance of succeeding. The group's claims were supported by an analysis of the bill produced by Mr Keith Ewing, professor of public law at King's College, London, and Dr Simon Deakin, a Cambridge law lecturer. Their report says that clauses protecting workers who refuse to work on Sundays from dismissal or discrimination are too complicated and would be difficult to enforce.</p>

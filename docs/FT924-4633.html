			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STRONG mid-session demand sent Footsie futures soaring, helping the near-month contract breakthrough the 2,800 level for the first time this year, though profit-taking prevented the contract from closing at the higher level, writes Joel Kibazo. A two-way pull was seen at the market's opening as some dealers indulged in profit-taking while some chose to follow through on Friday's strength. A mid-morning seller brought the December contract back to 2,772, however it soon recovered and went forward to break through the 2,800 level when the day's high of 2,802 was reached at lunchtime. Sentiment was also boosted by UK money supply figures which were seen as another sign of recovery. More profit-taking saw December surrender earlier gains and the downward momentum gathered pace with the disappointing early performance on Wall Street. Dealers also pointed to the poor performance of the fixed interest markets for the decline. December closed at 2,797, around 17 points above its fair value premium to cash, which fell to around 4 points with the opening of the new account. Turnover was a modest 6,529 contracts. In traded options, volume reached 29,974 contracts, ahead of Friday's poor 24,489 lots. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was 6,456. Asda was the most active stock option with 4,514 contracts.</p>

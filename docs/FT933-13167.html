			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Mexico pressed to move against Canadian wheat THE US Republican leader, Senator Robert Dole, and Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate trade sub-committee, are putting pressure on Mexican President Carlos Salinas to bring a countervailing duty case against 'unfair Canadian wheat subsidies'. In a letter to President Salinas last week, the two senators linked the president's response to their support of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Bringing a CVD case 'would indicate a strong desire to guarantee that the Nafta will provide continent-wide trade, free of export subsidies,' they said. 'Failure to address this problem jeopardises the support for the Nafta among wheat producers and their congressional representatives.' They said a CVD case has the strong support of Mexican wheat farmers, who might otherwise get caught in a price-cutting trade war between US and Canada, 'placing them in a position where they could not compete with the resulting lower prices'. A Mexican trade analyst said complaining to the president is 'not the appropriate channel. . . it is for the Mexican farmers to go to the Ministry of Commerce.' If Nafta is approved, there would be a mechanism to address this kind of complaint, he said. US lawmakers have been furious that Canada has dominated the Mexican wheat market for the past three years and insist it is due to subsidies by the Canadian Wheat Board.</p>

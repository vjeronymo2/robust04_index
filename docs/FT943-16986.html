			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Iniquitous measure for pensions Sir, Lex ('Securing Goode returns,' June 24) described the initiative of the actuarial bodies formally to downgrade cash equivalent by assuming higher (equity-based) returns for all but older pension scheme members as 'nifty footwork by the actuarial profession'. What for shareholders and corporate management may look like nifty footwork will look like sleight of hand to cognisant scheme members. The government should not condone deception of scheme members based on esoteric (and unconvincing) argument. I believe I am not alone in the actuarial profession in thinking that equity-based 'cash equivalents' are iniquitous. They should be condemned as a false measure. It cannot be right for a value to be elastic according to the convenience of pension schemes for meeting minimum funding (solvency) standards and easing the burden of debt on employer liabilities in the event of winding-up. It is disturbing that when preservation in final salary schemes is still far from satisfactory, proposals should be countenanced which degrade an important early-leaver right, viz to a transfer payment properly reflecting defined preserved benefits. After all, most members will be early leavers and few full-term retirement cases. The government should by contrast be introducing clarifying legislation making it crystal clear that cash equivalents must be calculated by reference to comparable investments, ie on a gilt-edged basis with cautious allowance for reinvestment of income and full credit for the relief of schemes from expenses of future administration.

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: Departure delays leave investors counting the cost - Eurotunnel Eurotunnel's often strained relations with its shareholders took another knock last week when an ill-judged comment from its finance director, that revenue targets from the Channel tunnel would not be met, jangled investors' nerves. Coming just ahead of the company's announcement today of its first-half results, the news of the missed targets left Eurotunnel's shares down 20p on the week at 228p. That Eurotunnel was likely to miss its forecast of Pounds 137m revenues in 1994 has been obvious for some time as a result of delays in the launch of its freight and passenger services. But the casual way in which the company appeared to acknowledge this did little for its image. Eurotunnel says it is still within the financing limit agreed with banks in May at its Pounds 858m rights issue, but analysts are not so sure. The delayed start may have lopped Pounds 30m to Pounds 50m off revenues while the poor performance of its shares makes it unlikely owners will want to exercise their 300p warrants. Eurotunnel calculated in May that it had Pounds 419m for contingencies. But if the income from the exercise of warrants and the effect of a leasing deal are taken out then the margin was only Pounds 34m. The delayed start could put Eurotunnel in breach of its banking covenants though it is unlikely the banks would force the issue. Having come this far with the Pounds 10bn project they have no desire to bring it down. But this indicates that the company may have to make a third cash call next year on its bankers and shareholders. The picture is not entirely gloomy, however. The fares discounting between the ferries has eased in recent months while the sinking of the ferry Estonia has put into perspective fears voiced about the safety of the tunnel.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (12): Where the lights still go out - Electricity supplies have improved, but the problems remain THE DOMINICAN Republic's state-owned electricity company must be one of the world's strongest arguments for privatisation. Thanks to its inefficiency, power cuts are a daily fact of life. At the height of the country's economic crisis in late-1990, many users were without electricity for 20 hours a day, writes Stephen Fidler. As a result, there has been a huge shift to privately-generated electricity. Every important office building, factory and hotel in the country needs a private generator. This is not only hugely inefficient - it also raises the costs significantly of doing business in the country: a generator capable of producing 1,000 kilowatts costs Dollars 1m. Capacity in such microgenerators is estimated at around 600-700MW, equivalent to the capacity of the state Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE). At its worst, estimated generating capacity of CDE fell to around 400 megawatts. This compares with nominally installed capacity of 1,200MW and demand of closer to 800-900MW. The crisis prompted President Joaquin Balaguer to replace the head of the CDE, since when there has been an increase in capacity, helped by loans from the World Bank to rehabilitate some electricity plants. Loans from the Inter-American Development Bank are also ready for the rehabilitation of more. As a condition for their help, the international financial institutions insisted that outsiders be brought in to administer the company, a task to be taken over by Fenosa, the Spanish utility. Offers have been placed to provide a further 600-700MW of privately generated capacity, but it is not clear how much of this will be installed. Government officials make much of the country's hydro-electric capacity which it claims should fill the supply gap. Industry observers, however, reckon the priority use for the reservoirs is irrigation rather than electricity generation, and that hydroelectricity will only provide marginal input to the grid. For now, improved management and maintenance have raised capacity to an estimated 700MW. This is still insufficient to cover demand and blackouts remain common, but there has been a marked improvement from 18 months ago. The problem remains in the longer term, where there is nothing to stop future managers of the system once again running down capacity through abysmal management and maintenance procedures.</p>

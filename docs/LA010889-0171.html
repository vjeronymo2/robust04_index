			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RICHEST MAN IN SPAIN;  </P> <P> THE CITY OF MARVELS BY EDUARDO MENDOZA; TRANSLATED BY BERNARD MOLLOY (HARCOURT  BRACE JOVANOVICH: $19.95; 432 PP.; 0-15-118040-7)  </P> <P> As the Catalonians see it, it's no accident that their capital city, Barcelona,  will be hosting the Summer Olympics in 1992. Historically the most enterprising  and cosmopolitan corner of Spain, Catalonia took the Republican side in the  Spanish Civil War and paid the price in brutal reprisals and decades of  political and cultural repression. Now, a dozen years after the death of  Franco, Catalonia is at the forefront of the resurgence of regional identity in  Spain, and the verve of its revival has been captured in a novel by Eduardo  Mendoza called "The City of Marvels." Though historical in subject matter, this  story of Catalonian enterprise and Barcelonan ambition is thoroughly  contemporary in spirit.  </P> <P> In 1886, as Barcelona frantically prepares for its first World's Fair, we meet  the novel's central character, Onofre Bouvila, who, unable to find any better  job, is being paid by anarchists to distribute seditious literature. With  chilly purposefulness, Onofre moves from selling revolution to selling  hair-restorer, then on to pilfering from Fair exhibits and enforcing for  organized crime, aided throughout by various comic grotesques -- a virile  giant, a drag queen, a repulsive chambermaid with a cat named Beelzebub.  Occasionally, as during a gang war that paralyzes Barcelona for a week, the  narrative gathers terrific momentum and almost succeeds in making Onofre  sympathetic as he prepares to make his fortune.  </P> <P> Of the actual amassing of this fortune disappointingly little is shown -- a few  nifty real estate swindles, some hired hits, some passing years, some arms  sales in World War I. Onofre doesn't grow in character so much as simply become  amplified. In his capacity as "the richest man in Spain," he leads a life  replete with the whims, the cars, the girls, the airplane rides, the twisted  family life, and especially the hunger for still more that we expect from such  a phenomenon. It's all fairly interesting, but when the book ends, with the  launching of Barcelona's second World's Fair in 1929, what lingers is not the  memory of a real Onofre Bouvila but only the spirit of the hard, flamboyant era  he represents.  </P> <P> Paralleling this rags-to-riches story is a popular history of Barcelona,  beginning with an account of early Barcelonans admiring Hannibal's elephants --  "Just look at those tusks, those ears, that trunk or proboscis, they remarked"  -- and ending with a foreshadowing of the city's suffering under Franco.  Mendoza digresses and embroiders with supreme confidence. The lives of saints  and anarchists are deftly woven in, and Mata Hari is ushered through the book  to explain why "Quo Vadis," the world's first feature-length movie, never made  it to Spain. Just as often, though, for example in dull cameo appearances by  Lenin and Rasputin, Mendoza's touch is so light as to make no impression at  all. Frequent quotations from period newspapers, intended to cast sidelights on  the march of history, seem instead to cast unwelcome light on the author's  research methods. And though modern-day Catalonians may find fascinating his  account of Barcelona's architectural growing pains, the impartial reader  working through the 10th dense page of it may be forgiven for asking: Is this  book for me?  </P> <P> To the extent that Mendoza tries at all to answer this question and find  general truth in specific history, he does it as a cynic, highlighting in every  anecdote the ugly, the venal, the ridiculous, the cruel. At his best, he rises  to a limpid honesty of vision:  </P> <P> "With the thaw a tribe of Gypsies appeared, walking along the beach. The  workers' wives stood in the doors of their huts to block entry, for it was  widely believed that Gypsy women stole infants. This tribe was actually just  doing what it could to earn its daily bread by mending pans, clipping dogs,  telling fortunes, and making bears dance. The workers, having no pans, no dogs,  and no futures, were interested only in seeing the bears dance. And so it was  that the Civil Guard had to intervene."  </P> <P> But even a tone as satisfying as this gets old if it isn't modulated. And  although Mendoza at every turn protects his flanks politically by presenting  the masses as an unsentimental and undifferentiated martyr class, the world of  the novel remains the world of Onofre Bouvila, devoid of kindness and charity  and beauty, devoid of redeeming characters, devoid even of complicated ones. To  depict an entire epoch in this way is arrogant if we're meant to believe the  world has improved since then; profoundly diminishing if we're meant to believe  it hasn't. It's true that after two millennia of jealous persecution, Barcelona  and its chroniclers have earned the right to cynicism and also, having in  triumph outlasted yet another dictatorship, the right to a little arrogance.  Yet despite its intermittent virtuosity, and despite Bernard Molloy's able  translation, an American reading "The City of Marvels" may well feel like the  only foreign guest at a Catalonian all-class reunion.  </P></p>

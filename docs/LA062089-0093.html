			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRIVER CITED AFTER CRASH THAT HURT 7  </P> <P> The driver of a pickup truck that flipped over on Interstate 5 near San Juan  Capistrano Sunday, injuring seven people, including three children, has been  cited for turning too sharply onto the shoulder of the freeway, authorities  said Monday.  </P> <P> Lauro Montoya, 27, of Los Angeles was cited in the accident, which occurred  shortly after a tire on the truck blew out, according California Highway Patrol  Officer Carl Twigg.  </P> <P> Twigg said Montoya apparently panicked and swerved onto the left shoulder,  causing the truck to overturn and crack open the camper shell in which five  women and three children were riding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In Critical Condition  </P> <P> One of those passengers, 29-year-old Manuela Perea, was reported in critical  condition Monday at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo.  Elizabeth Perea, 3, was reported in satisfactory condition at the same hospital  with a fractured pelvis and right leg. Melissa Bailon, 10 months, suffered a  skull fracture but was listed in satisfactory condition.  </P> <P> Montoya and four passengers were treated and released at San Clemente Hospital.  One passenger, Janet Perea, 1, was in stable condition, according to a hospital  spokesman.  </P> <P> The group, all residents of Los Angeles, was headed to Tijuana for a shopping  trip, authorities said.  </P> <P> According to CHP spokesman Sam Haynes in Sacramento, state laws require minors  under 12 to be accompanied by an adult when riding in the rear of a truck, but  there are no safety restrictions on adults. If camper shells are permanently  attached, no adult supervision or safety restraints for rear passengers are  required under the law, Haynes added.  </P></p>

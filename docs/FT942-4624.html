			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Hungary lifts repo rate by 2% Hungary's central bank yesterday lifted its key repo interest rates by 2 per cent and has also announced a three point rise in the base rate to 25 per cent. Financial markets had expected a tightening of monetary policy after parliamentary elections last month but the scale of the move came as a surprise. The National Bank of Hungary said the measure was needed to curtail domestic demand and bring down a persistent external deficit. Figures released yesterday showed a worse-than-expected first-quarter current account deficit of Dollars 809m, little down on the record Dollars 900m registered in the same period of 1993. Hungary ran a Dollars 3.46bn current account deficit in 1993 as a whole, equivalent to about 10 per cent of GDP. But the central bank council, saying monetary restriction alone could not right the external imbalance, called on the new Socialist government to exercise parallel fiscal restraint and reduce a budget deficit forecast at Ft330bn (Dollars 3.2bn) for 1994.</p>

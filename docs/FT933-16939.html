			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / People: Carter for CU Tony Brend can take some pride in the fact that he will leave Commercial Union, the UK's biggest insurer, in a better state than when he took over the job of chief executive in 1986. CU had suffered consecutive years of losses when Brend was called in from the group's US subsidiary and it was regarded as the fallen star of the industry. Brend retires at the end of this year - just five months before his 60th birthday - with CU widely recognised as the most successful of the UK insurance companies. John Carter, 55, (right) will take over the top job. Carter, a mathematician and actuary, has been an integral part of Brend's senior management team since 1987, along with Tony Wyand, finance director. 'We've been very pleased we have managed to make a change,' says Brend, who says he will leave the 'ship in good order'. No change to CU's established strategy, which focuses heavily on increasing the size of life insurance business, is anticipated. Brend says he is 'not ingrained with the City and its foibles', does not maintain any business activities and will retire to the country, pursuing interests in military history and archaeology. He will also travel a good deal, visiting Australia as well as the 18 countries 'where he hasn't yet slept'. With Brend planning a trip to the Baltic states in the summer, that number should soon be reduced to 15.</p>

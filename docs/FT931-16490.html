			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium output reduced ALUMINIUM producers outside the former eastern bloc countries reacted to the continuing heavy flow of the metal to the west from Russia by cutting output by more than 4 per cent last year compared with 1991, according to preliminary estimates by the UK-based World Bureau of Metal Statistics. At the same time, however, western nickel producers, which have also been suffering severely from Russian exports, produced marginally more refined metal. According to the WBMS, western world consumption of aluminium, copper, tin and zinc rose last year whereas lead consumption fell slightly and that of nickel dropped sharply, by nearly 7 per cent, from the 1991 level. Nickel's fall followed one of more than 10 per cent in the previous year compared with 1990. It was caused by a de-stocking and a drop in demand from the stainless steel industry which consumes more than 60? per cent of the metal. All six of the most heavily traded metals showed a deficit in western world supply last year, the WBMS estimates. But net imports from the eastern bloc are likely to have filled the gaps. In the first nine months of 1992 net exports of aluminium from the eastern bloc to the west rose from 507,000 to 540,000 tonnes, according to the latest WBMS quarterly summary. Net imports of nickel are shown to have fallen steeply, from 81,000 to 21,000 tonnes. However, this total does not include huge quantities of nickel which is circumventing Russia's export controls by being sent to the west disguised as scrap. Net exports of copper from the former eastern bloc were marginally up after nine months of 1992 - despite substantial imports by China. The WBMS suggests they rose rose from 233,000 to 242,000 tonnes. Net imports of zinc, at 113,000 tonnes after nine months of 1992 compared with 73,000 tonnes, were above the 100,000 tonnes recorded for the whole of 1991.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WESTERN WORLD 1992 SUPPLY/DEMAND ESTIMATES ('000 TONNES)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ALUMINIUM                           NICKEL  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Production*       14,470    -4.3%   Production           600    +1.1% Consumption       15,400      +3%   Consumption          630    -6.9%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COPPER                              TIN  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Production         8,790    +3.1%   Production           133   -13.1% Consumption        9,070    +1.1%   Consumption          183    +1.1%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAD                                ZINC  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Production         4,310    -2.2%   Production         5,320    -1.4% Consumption        4,260    -1.7%   Consumption        5,470    +0.1%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Primary.

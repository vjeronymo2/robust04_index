			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Carlton advances 33% to Pounds 73m - Increases in television activities and continuing growth in video sales Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, may have picked a losing National Lottery ticket yesterday but he was still able to celebrate an unexpectedly high 33 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits. Carlton had a 10 per cent stake in the Great British Lottery Company, one of the seven losers in the battle for the National Lottery licence. Profits of Pounds 73.4m (Pounds 55.1m) for the six months to the end of March were boosted by growing profits from Carlton Television, holders of the London weekday ITV licence and continuing growth from the video sales market, which helped Technicolor's performance. Excluding the two month contribution from Central Television, the underlying profit increase was about 25 per cent. Ironically Carlton, which now owns the two largest ITV companies, will benefit from the launch of the National Lottery in November. It is likely to generate huge sums in television advertising. Most analysts were predicting profits of Pounds 65m to Pounds 70m for the half year and yesterday were raising their expectations for the full year from Pounds 170m to Pounds 180m. 'The first six months have shown good growth, both in trading, and progressing our strategy to expand and maintain our leading position in broadcast television and film and video services,' said Mr Green, adding that prospects for the next six months were encouraging. Turnover was Pounds 658.7m (Pounds 469.9m), an increase of 40 per cent. Earnings per share rose by 16 per cent to 21.3p (18.3p); the interim dividend is increased to 8.15p (7.4p). Turnover in broadcast television, including the Central contribution, rose to Pounds 202.6m (Pounds 64.1m) and pre-tax profits were up to Pounds 22.9m (Pounds 600,000). Pre-tax profits in the video and audio products division rose to Pounds 35.6m (Pounds 30.8m), largely because of the increase in demand for sell-through video cassettes. Turnover was Pounds 234.3m (Pounds 207.5m). The share price yesterday fell 22p to 901p. See Lex</p>

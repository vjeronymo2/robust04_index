			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Jazzing up the market It is strange that a Budget lauded for being tougher than expected should drive UK equities into such a frenzy. Worries about an attack on their tax privileges have kept pension funds on the sidelines, but it is difficult to believe that their return was responsible for yesterday's 2 per cent rise in the FT-SE 100 index. Investors caught short of stock going into the Budget are more likely culprits, in which case equities might now settle back. Relief that budgetary balance is being pursued through lower spending rather than higher taxes is certainly not a cause for celebration on the scale seen yesterday. Either way the impact will be deflationary. With the public sector constrained and tax rises slowly squeezing consumers, the corporate sector will have to perform exceptionally well for the chancellor's growth targets to be met. There is always scope for another cut in interest rates, but results from GEC and Argyll are reminders that companies are hardly brimming with confidence. The upward march of gilts looks more convincing. The position of gilts relative to overseas markets limits the scope for progress ahead of next week's Pounds 3bn auction. The yield differential between 10-year gilts and German bunds is already close to its recent limit. If the chancellor can maintain his new-found credibility, though, international investors will come to accept a smaller premium. Lower gilt yields could then provide some support for equities, too.</p>

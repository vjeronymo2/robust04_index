			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Commodities lift Sydney as Japan Tobacco plunges The market was unaffected by the sharp fall in Japan Tobacco, whose shares were listed yesterday, and the Nikkei average closed marginally higher on arbitrage buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 closed up 50.01 at 19,796.36 after a high of 19,919.88 and a low of 19,724.44. Dealers bought shares on the first trading day for November settlement, while overseas investors also supported prices. Volume was 210m shares against 215m. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 1.50 to 1,568.44 and the Nikkei 300 inched up 0.54 to 287.14. Advances led declines by 479 to 461 with 221 issues unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.30 to 1,292.90. Japan Tobacco plunged 23.5 per cent from its public offering price to Y1.1m. Early in the day, the stock failed to trade due to lack of buyers, but it changed hands in the afternoon at Y1.19m. Traders said investors who had bought stock at the lower end of the pre-offer auction were trying to take profits. Investors who had bought the stock on margin were also forced to liquidate their holdings when the offered price fell below Y1.3m. Traders said the focus for market participants was on corporate earnings and the currency market now JT was listed. 'We can now detach ourselves from JT,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Buying by overseas investors supported Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which rose Y6,000 to Y892,000. But East Japan Railway, the railway group privatised last year, lost Y3,000 to Y480,000, and Japan Telecom fell Y70,000 to Y3.68m. High-technology stocks were supported by prospects of strong profits. Sharp rose Y10 to Y1,790 and Toshiba Y6 to Y764. However, some issues fell on profit-taking, with Matsushita Electric Industrial down Y10 to Y1,580 and Mitsubishi Electric losing Y2 to Y723. Steel shares were firmer: Nippon Steel rose Y2 to Y394 and Sumitomo Metal Industries added Y10 to Y354. Mitsubishi Oil lost Y40 to Y1,020 on profit-taking. The stock had been supported by speculative buying on hopes of its oil digging project in Vietnam. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 13.27 to 21,965.36 in volume of 25.3m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y140 to Y5,290. Roundup Commodities-based gains in Australia and a continued buyers' strike in the embattled Taiwan equity market were the main features in the region yesterday. SYDNEY followed Australia's largest company, BHP, which reached an intra-day record high on the rosy outlook for mineral ores after the bull-run in base metals found new impetus on the London Metal Exchange on Wednesday. BHP rose 42 cents to ADollars 20.50 after peaking at ADollars 20.56. The All Resources index rose 18.4 to 1,422.9, towing the All Ordinaries to a gain of 14.6 at 2,032.2. Turnover was strong at ADollars 538.1m. The copper price, which jumped USDollars 41 to a four-year high of USDollars 2,627 a tonne, was said to be the source of BHP's strength, but other large miners were firmer on the back of much stronger base metals prices, and on support from domestic investors. CRA rose 32 cents to ADollars 18.90, Western Mining climbed 13 to ADollars 8.37, and MIM advanced 5 to ADollars 2.90. HONG KONG achieved a technical recovery but activity stayed thin, the Hang Seng index closing up 52.14 at 9,304.58, well off its 9,341.40 session high as turnover improved marginally from HKDollars 2.02bn to HKDollars 2.27bn. Wednesday's successful test of 9,200 on the Hang Seng and Wall Street's ability to avoid a heavy sell-off overnight, combined with news that Britain and China might be close to a financing agreement on Hong Kong's new airport, boosted flagging sentiment. Overseas buying lifted Hongkong Land, which rose 55 cents to HKDollars 19.10. Other property stocks also gained, with Henderson Land up 40 cents at HKDollars 48.80 and Cheung Kong by 30 cents to HKDollars 35.90. WELLINGTON thanked Telecom, once again, for a 12 cents gain on continuing demand to NZDollars 5.62 which accounted for around 13 points of a 21.10 rise to 2,090.42 in the NZSE-40 Index in turnover of NZDollars 47m. Fletcher Challenge also performed well, rising 5 cents to NZDollars 4.36, and Fletcher Forest closed up 1 cent at NZDollars 2.10 amid speculation about foreign demand. COLOMBO's all share index recovered for the first time after Monday's assassination of an opposition leader, widespread blue chip buying taking it up 9.41 to 1,087.56. Turnover rose from Rs47.21m to Rs187.36m. TAIPEI reversed small early gains to close sharply lower for the fourth consecutive session, and brokers expected the market to remain depressed. The weighted index lost 90.90 or 1.4 per cent to 6,594.97 in turnover of TDollars 44.4bn. Financials led the fall with China Bills losing TDollars 2.70 or 5.6 per cent to TDollars 45.90. Food and polyester shares performed relatively well, with Shinkong Synthetic Fibres gaining 30 cents to TDollars 26.90. President Enterprises rebounded after Wednesday's fall, gaining TDollars 1.50 to TDollars 58. Hualon fell TDollars 1 to TDollars 18.70 after the prosecutor's office started to investigate a TDollars 3.35bn share payment default related to the group. MANILA declined marginally ahead of a four-day holiday weekend, with Philippine National Bank leading the declines. The composite index finished 18.01 lower at 3,060.25 in volume of 2.95bn shares worth 1.34bn pesos. PNB, the country's largest commercial bank, fell 4.35 per cent to 385 pesos on news of a 28 per cent drop in its net profit to 1.2bn pesos in the first nine months against 1.67bn in the same period last year. Gainers were led by Jollibee Foods which advanced 8.6 per cent to 15.75 pesos followed by Bacnotan Cement which rose 4.6 per cent to 34 pesos. BANGKOK retreated but brokers expected the market to make headway today after the Bank of Thailand announced that inflation was under control and stringent monetary measures were now unnecessary. The SET index slipped 12.34 to 1,501.73 after fluctuating between 1,495.41 and 1,518.90 in turnover of Bt8.1bn. Bank of Thailand officials said the bank was sticking to its earlier estimate of a 4.8 per cent growth in the consumer price index for 1994. The finance sector was the biggest loser, falling 2.1 per cent on Bt1.2bn turnover.</p>

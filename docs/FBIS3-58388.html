			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F> Franz-Olivier Giesbert, Jacques Jacquet-Francillon, and Charles  Lambroschini on 11 January 1994 in Paris: "Following the NATO  Summit, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali Said to LE FIGARO: `I  Shall Not Hesitate To Use Air Strikes in Bosnia'" -- first two  paragraphs are LE FIGARO introduction]    [Text] According to Mr. Butrus-Ghali, the attitude of the  states involved has changed: "There is a genuine political will  to take action." However, in the face of all the various  conflicts around the world, he notes "a certain fatigue within  the international community."    Yesterday, in an exclusive interview with LE FIGARO, UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali expressed his satisfaction  with the conclusions of the NATO summit regarding Bosnia.  Visiting Paris, Mr. Butrus-Ghali, who had just held talks with  Defense Minister Francois Leotard, thanked France "for  contributing so much to the UN peacekeeping forces." France,  with 8,000 men in the former Yugoslavia, is the country which  has deployed the largest contingent of UN troops.    [LE FIGARO] NATO has just renewed its threat of air strikes  in Bosnia. Are these constant threats of intervention in Bosnia  by all the international institutions not becoming rather  laughable?    [Butrus-Ghali] I carefully read the NATO press release  before  answering your questions, and I think that, to be fair, there is  a change of attitude on the part of the states involved, and  that there is a genuine political will to take action.  Consequently, I am rather optimistic. People are now demanding  specifically that ways be found to open the airfield at Tuzla  and ensure the rotation [of UN peacekeeping troops] in  Srebrenica.    [LE FIGARO] With what in mind? NATO has always said that;  everyone has always said that. The ball is being passed around  between Europe and the United States, with one or the other not  wishing to intervene, explaining that this is due to the  other.... The United States is calling for air strikes, while  Europe is talking rather of intervention on the ground.... The  whole thing will take months to decide.    [Butrus-Ghali] No, I am telling you. My commentary is based  solely on the press release. Compared with other press  releases, this press release is, to my mind, more positive, and  expresses a political will to take action.    [LE FIGARO] What about the UN troops in the event of air  strikes? What will you do with them?    [Butrus-Ghali] Should we ever have air strikes, they will be  decided by the political authority, and we will have to accept  the risks involved.    [LE FIGARO] Will the UN troops have to be withdrawn at that  moment?    [Butrus-Ghali] No, not necessarily. The air strikes would be  specifically targeted, occurring only in certain places.    [LE FIGARO] If the time comes, who will make the decision?  Do you have the power to do so by invoking the resolutions  already adopted by the UN Security Council?    [Butrus-Ghali] It is the political authority that must  decide. I was given a mandate, but I also need a request by my  special representative for the former Yugoslavia, Mr. Yasushi  Akashi [name as published], who will himself have heard the  views and opinions of the military leaders on the ground, of the  co-chairman of the steering committee of the International  Conference on Yugoslavia, Mr. Thorvald Stoltenberg, and of those  in charge of the humanitarian action.    [LE FIGARO] These men being your representatives?    [Butrus-Ghali] Certainly. And in the event of a positive  verdict, I shall not hesitate to use air strikes to contribute  to the restoration of peace.    [LE FIGARO] Using whose air force?    [Butrus-Ghali] In principle, NATO's. However, I have no  authority over NATO. If NATO decides not to use force, then I  will be powerless to oblige them.    [LE FIGARO] When you say that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force] has to look into how Tuzla airport could be opened, is  this not another way of putting things off, because surely all  the necessary studies have been made since we have been talking  about Tuzla and Srebrenica as safe areas?    [Butrus-Ghali] We have not managed to implement this  decision  because we did not receive the 8,000 soldiers necessary. This  decision was adopted in May. Now it is January, and we have  only had about 1,000 more soldiers, who were sent by France. We  need another 7,000 troops and are still negotiating with the  states concerned with a view to obtaining these soldiers. It is  a case of a physical impossibility. According to our military  experts, we would need 8,000 more soldiers to take care of these  safe areas, this being a minimum number, for we could also do  with more men.    [LE FIGARO] Do you lack the soldiers to relieve those in  Srebrenica and open Tuzla airport?    [Butrus-Ghali] There, we are envisioning an air strike. I  cannot go into details on the basis of the press release. I  will be meeting with all my specialists and with representatives  of the military in Geneva either today or tomorrow with a view  to seeing exactly what we can do.    [LE FIGARO] The problem with these threats by the  international community is that the Serbs do not believe them.  They feel that we are acting in this way to make ourselves feel  better and ease our conscience. All the international  institutions, starting with NATO, are being accused of hypocrisy.    [Butrus-Ghali] The only comment I can make, having followed  these debates and been in contact with the responsible  individuals here in France -- and tomorrow, in Geneva, I shall  continue my contacts with the people in charge -- is that there  is a new political will to take action.    [LE FIGARO] Do you sense that the French, for example, are  determined to see this thing through to the end?    [Butrus-Ghali] Do not make me say such things. See this  thing through to the end? No. However, I am saying that there  is a new political will and, reading the NATO press release, my  impression is it contains something new. There is a new  political will, because something has to be done, although it  has taken us too long to reach this stage.  <H5>  Transition </H5>   [LE FIGARO] When you talk of air strikes, which you appear  to  think might be a possibility in Tuzla or Srebrenica, what does  that mean? Does it mean that UN people are going to say to the  Serbs: "Let us into this airport or let us relieve the forces in  Srebrenica? If you do not do so within such-and-such period of  time, then we will send in the air force." Is that what it  means?    [Butrus-Ghali] I do not know. I have no idea about that. I  cannot make any further comment.    [LE FIGARO] What does "air strike" mean? Technically  speaking, within what time frame?    [Butrus-Ghali] I have no idea. The only thing I can tell you  is that I think a new political will was expressed in Brussels  at a conference which ended one hour ago. How will this be  applied in practice? What difficulties will arise? I cannot  say. I must first consult the technicians.    [LE FIGARO] Is what is at stake in Bosnia, like in Somalia,  not the very principle of what is called the humanitarian war?    [Butrus-Ghali] No, I think that the real problem, in both  Somalia and Bosnia, is that the states involved are not ready to  send the necessary troops, that they are not ready to allocate  the financial resources required for these operations, and that  there is a certain fatigue dogging the international community  as a result of being faced with these various conflicts.    [LE FIGARO] Something about the system of organizing UN  troops is tainted, namely that people are being sent to the  firing line without being authorized to fire a shot.    [Butrus-Ghali] Let us be realistic. There is absolutely no  point in my talking of shifting up a gear when I realize that  the states concerned do not want to do so. It is a question of  not throwing ideas around if it will mean you losing your  credibility....    [LE FIGARO] Are we very far away from having a world  government?    [Butrus-Ghali] I am entirely in favor of having one, but we  are very far from achieving this. Moreover, I do not even know  if it is in the interest of the international community to have  a world government.    I would present the problem from a different angle: In 1815  there was the Congress of Vienna; in 1919 the Treaty of  Versailles; in 1945, San Francisco, and even Luxembourg. And  then...when the Cold War ended, there was no international  conference. So we are making no progress. We are going through  a difficult time, a period of transition.    [LE FIGARO] That is a reproach. Do you really think that an  international conference should have been held after the Berlin  Wall came down?    [Butrus-Ghali] I am merely saying that this is complicating  the situation. The transition period will last longer because  we do not know what the new standards are, what the new system  is, or the new balance of power.    What role do the states concerned want to confer on the  United Nations in this new, post-Cold War system?    My conclusion after serving two years as the UN secretary  general is that the states have not yet reached a decision on  this subject. Why? Because they themselves do not know what the  new balance of power is, nor what new system should govern  international relations.    That is where we are for now.</p>

Written by Professor Liu Yan and Professor Yang Shizhao of  the Zhou Enlai Research Office of Nankai University in Tianjin,  the book presents a large amount of historical data to show many  of his pioneering practices and theories during the periods of  new democratic revolution and socialist revolution.    They include the strategy for the Chinese revolution to  surround cities from the countryside, an important part of Mao  Zedong Thought, which could be seen from many of his speeches  during the agrarian revolution when he served as a principal  leading member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party  of China.    Zhou Enlai died on January 8, 1976.</p>

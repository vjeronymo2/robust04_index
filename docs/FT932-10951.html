			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Trafalgar Pounds 98m in loss following write-downs TRAFALGAR HOUSE reported a loss of Pounds 97.6m before tax in the half year to March 31 after Pounds 120m of provisions, largely relating to a write-down in the value of its property portfolio. Last time there was a pre-tax profit of Pounds 54m. Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive, said: 'It is not a question of kitchen sinking it; the provisions are realistic given the group's Pounds 1bn investment in property.' While he said there would be no need for future provisions, he could not guarantee that there would be no further property write-downs. Ordinary shares in the construction, engineering and property group rose 3p to 95p with the A shares up 2 1/2 p to 94p. The group confirmed that Hongkong Land, which has a 25.1 per cent stake, will provide the new chairman and finance director. The two posts will be filled by Mr Simon Keswick, who will continue to be chairman of Hongkong Land, and Mr David Gawler, finance director of Hongkong Land. Touche Ross, which was replaced by KPMG Peat Marwick as auditor, sent a letter to Trafalgar's shareholders rejecting criticism from investors over the 1991 accounts. These had to be restated after the Financial Reporting Review Panel said that property write-downs should be taken through the profit and loss account and not through reserves. Mr Gormly said the group would pursue its disposal programme in an orderly manner. 'I am not going to rush it.' There have been two serious indications of offers for the hotels, which include the Ritz and the Stafford, but Trafalgar did not find them satisfactory. The big property development projects have been put on the 'backburner', while property for letting will be slowly sold off. Since September 1992 the workforce has been reduced by 2,600 people and another 500 jobs are to go by the end of this year. Trafalgar made Pounds 22.4m before tax and exceptional provisions, on sales of Pounds 1.14bn (Pounds 1.21bn). The core businesses, engineering and construction, reported profits of Pounds 34.7m (Pounds 44.2m) and Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 9.1m) respectively. Construction projects were also responsible for the Pounds 2.8m of profits from associates. Property incurred a loss of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 6.6m profit), while profits from shipping and hotels fell to Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 8m). The group is hoping that its two worst performing divisions will benefit from the economic upturn. Net borrowings were Pounds 329m compared with Pounds 353m at September 30. After allowing for the rights issue proceeds of Pounds 205m, this represents an increase of Pounds 181m, some Pounds 68m of which was due to the weakening of sterling against the dollar. Losses per share were 18p (earnings of 6p). The interim dividend is cut to 1.25p (4.4p). See Lex</p>

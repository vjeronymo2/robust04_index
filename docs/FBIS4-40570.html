			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Yuriy Kozlov and </F> Boris Krivoshey]    Moscow June 16 TASS -- Russia is trying to maintain  friendly relations with not only the CIS country-members, but  with the Baltic countries as well, according to Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev.    Kozyrev, speaking at a foreign policy council meeting on  Thursday, said civilised dialogue was being strengthened between  Russia and the three Baltic states. The questions of human  rights violations and the rights of the Russian-language  population and other minorities in the Baltic region are still  on the agenda, he said. The Russian foreign minister noted that  the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic  countries would not lead to a decrease in attention paid to  those questions.</p>

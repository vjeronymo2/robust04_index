Interior Minister Major General Hasan al-Alfi authorized  generous rewards for the officers involved and the citizens who  gave information about the two factories. Twenty rifles and  revolvers, as well as weapons parts, and assembling machines  were found. The owners confessed to Major General Mansur  'Isawi, assistant interior minister for Cairo security, and  Major General Mahmud Wajdi, director of the General Intelligence  Directorate, that they sold weapons to outlaws at very high  prices. The prosecution ordered that they be remanded and the  two factories closed. [passage omitted]</p>

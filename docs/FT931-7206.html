			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Unlikely allies fight Canada's telephone war - Upheavals in the market will be increased by the battle's ferocity A FEROCIOUS battle between two pairs of unlikely partners is unfolding in Canada's long-distance telephone market. In one corner is an alliance between Stentor, the consortium of stuffy Canadian utilities which for years held a monopoly on domestic trunk services, and MCI, the Washington-based company which, in less than a decade, has captured 17 per cent of the US long-distance market. The nearest thing to MCI in Canada is Unitel Communications. Unitel had its origins more than a century ago as a telegraph service for Canadian Pacific and Canadian National railways, but last year gained regulatory approval to break Stentor's grip on long-distance phone calls. Unitel has hopped into bed with the grand old man of US telecommunications, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. AT&amp;T is buying a 20 per cent stake in the Canadian company, leaving Canadian Pacific with 48 per cent and Rogers Communications with 32 per cent. Rogers is Canada's biggest cable-TV operator. Besides testing the maxim that opposites attract, the alliances are bound to increase the upheavals in the Canadian telecommunications market. They will compete fiercely to bring new products and services to telephone users. Mr Perrin Beatty, Canada's communications minister, is confident the rivalry will stimulate what he calls 'our premier high-tech industry'. The cross-border partnerships are also likely to lead to closer integration of telephone services between the two countries. Both sets of partners plan to create 'seamless' data and voice networks across the border. 'Whether you're communicating with your affiliate in Canada or the US, it will look identical,' says Mr Richard Stursberg, Unitel's senior vice-president for government affairs. 'You'll have a single set of products, a single point of ordering for services and a single bill.' Regulatory barriers are crumbling in Canada. A ruling by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) cleared the way for Unitel to start offering long-distance service last November in competition with the Stentor consortium. Unitel, which claims to undercut Stentor charges by an average of 15 per cent, says it has signed up 65,000 residential customers and 'several thousand' business subscribers, mostly in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Although this is a minuscule share of the total market, Unitel is extending its services to more cities, and claims to be well ahead of its projections. Meanwhile, resellers, who lease lines in bulk from the telephone companies and then provide discount services to users have garnered a surprisingly high 6.5 per cent market share since the CRTC opened the market to them in 1990. It is rumoured that one of the resellers will soon link up with GTE Sprint, the third-biggest US long-distance carrier. The Stentor consortium is not taking the challenge lightly. Unitel subscribers require a 17-digit code to connect from the local network (owned by the Stentor members) to Unitel's long-distance lines. An abortive court challenge by Stentor against the CRTC decision has delayed by six to seven months Unitel's plans to offer direct access to the long-distance switches. In other areas of their business, Stentor's members are pressing for faster deregulation. Mr Bob Kearney, chief executive of Bell Canada which is the most powerful member in the Stentor consortium, says a phone company should be allowed to carry whatever signals its customers want. 'If the local video store wants us to carry its videos over the telephone line, why not?' Unitel suspects an ulterior motive for the phone companies' conversion to the free market. 'They think they can crush the competition before it gets out of the gate,' says Mr Stursberg. Unitel has criticised Bell Canada's request for the first increase in basic local-service charges in a decade. To compensate customers for the rate increase, Bell has offered to expand the local calling area in cities such as Toronto and Montreal. Unitel objects. 'They're trying to make up for what they lost in the CRTC proceedings by re-monopolising large parts of the market,' says Mr Stursberg. Each of the Canadian companies contends its US partner will give it a headstart on its rival. Stentor was attracted by MCI's low costs, its sophisticated telecommunications software and its aggressive corporate culture. 'They've come up the hard way,' says Mr Kearney. In a bid to bring some of that culture to the Stentor partners, MCI will participate in joint marketing teams and others. Mr Doug Cunningham, analyst at BBN James Capel in Toronto, notes that MCI's costs are almost one-third lower than AT&amp;T's, and its customer base is heavily concentrated in the lucrative big-business market. Stentor considered teaming up with AT&amp;T. But Mr Kearney says 'we wanted a more equal partnership than they were prepared (to offer).' He says MCI and Stentor favour building alliances with telephone companies in other parts of the world rather than, as he puts it, going 'toe-to-toe with the Bundespost' as AT&amp;T might do. But Unitel sees AT&amp;T's muscle as a plus. As part of the deal, it gets access to AT&amp;T's switches, transmission facilities and other network technologies. Unitel can also adapt AT&amp;T's US products to the Canadian market. As an example of what AT&amp;T can provide, Mr Stursberg cites sophisticated toll-free services which automatically route a call to the closest office from the point where the call originates, or roll over calls to offices in different time zones. AT&amp;T's stake in Unitel is limited by law to 20 per cent. But an indication of its influence is the recent appointment of senior AT&amp;T managers to top network, operations and marketing jobs at Unitel.</p>

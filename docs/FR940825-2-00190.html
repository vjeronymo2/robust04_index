			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Priority 1: Technology for Children With Orthopedic Disabilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Children who sustain traumatic injury, congenital anomalies or disease-induced anomalies may require prosthetic devices for missing limbs and orthotic devices for support and correction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because children are growing rapidly, their prosthetic and orthotic devices must be designed to satisfy their special developmental needs. Too often, children's devices are scaled-down versions of adult devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New composite materials such as graphite, carbon fiber/carbon matrix, and fiber-reinforced ceramics have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much to offer in prosthetic and orthotic design and practice because they are lightweight and durable. These factors are especially important for young children. However, composite materials require different manufacturing techniques than those used to form metals. The special configurations of these devices require special construction methods to produce devices that are safe and effective and competitively priced. In addition, most composite materials are hard to re-shape once they are made. This interferes with the fitting of devices that need to be adjusted for each child. Techniques for adjusting the shape of composite material devices need to be developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The neuromuscular and musculoskeletal development of growing children presents a significant challenge to those practitioners who provide children with prosthetic and orthotic devices. The devices must meet the prevailing needs of the child as well as adjust to the child's physical growth for a reasonably long period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most orthotic/prosthetic facilities have difficulty meeting these challenges. This is compounded by the fact that children who need these services are not evenly distributed throughout the country, and there are few service providers in some geographic areas. In addition, some practitioners and parents have limited access to a variety of devices. As a result, they are not in a position to sample a number of devices and select the one that is most appropriate. For example, the electric hand often appeals to a parent because it looks and acts like a real hand. An experimental fitting and practical comparison may persuade parents and child that benefits of hook design outweigh the cosmetic appeal of the electric hand. Inexpensive opportunities to try out various prostheses need to be increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An RERC on technology and children with orthopedic disabilities shall_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop and evaluate prosthetic and orthotic devices and related orthopedic procedures to meet the changing needs of growing children with neuromuscular and musculoskeletal impairments;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify and assess the suitability of materials for use in these devices, including composite materials, considering the weight, strength, durability, adaptability, techniques of fabrication, cost and cosmetic acceptability;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop improved methods for fabricating assistive devices for children, including those using composite materials;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Evaluate the effectiveness of the systems of delivery of prosthetic and orthotic devices and closely related assistive technology to children with orthopedic impairments and develop recommendations to improve the current systems;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify, develop, and evaluate models to enable children and families, as well as clinicians, to test prosthetic and orthotic devices for suitability prior to purchase;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify the unique barriers to effective service delivery for prosthetic and orthotic devices facing families of children with orthopedic disabilities from minority backgrounds and develop strategies for overcoming those barriers; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop and implement strategies to increase the participation of children with orthopedic impairments and their parents in identifying user needs for prosthetic and orthotic devices and future areas of research.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Priority 2: Technology for Low Vision and Blindness Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Center for Health Statistics and other authorities variously estimate the number of legally blind persons in the United States at 400,000 to 600,000, with another 1.4 million persons severely visually impaired. More than 10 million others have some visual impairment that cannot be further improved with corrective lenses. There are also large and rapidly increasing numbers of older individuals with impairments in contrast, binocularity, and adaptation, which significantly limit their performance in a wide variety of everyday tasks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technological innovations arising from the development of new scientific and medical knowledge can have a positive impact on the lives of persons with low vision or blindness. While progress has been made regarding educational and vocational aids, optical amplifiers for low vision, orientation and mobility aids, and improved functional vision assessment, the need remains for improvements in these areas. For example, there is a need for new and innovative adaptive devices and development of systems engineering solutions to assist in our efforts to prepare all children with low vision and blindness to enter school ready to learn through early identification, monitoring, and treatment of visual impairments in neonates and infants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A report of the Technology Research Working Group stemming from the NIDRR Project Directors Meeting in January 1994, identified the need for technology to improve access to visual displays, including flat panel displays and devices that use liquid crystal displays with low contrast. Research is also needed to maintain access to new products with advancing technology used in the home, workplace, and the community, such as solid state displays, keypads, and compact disc technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vision-related research is needed to provide access to public facilities and mass transit. One of the main problems for persons who are blind or visually impaired is locating the facility in question (e.g., the bus stop, the subway entrance, ticket vending machine, telephone, bathrooms, etc.), or for orientation and mobility in large open areas or closed crowded spaces. New techniques for orientation and mobility will increase independent mobility for persons with blindness and low vision and decrease dependance on others for information and assistance. There is also a need to research, develop, and evaluate new and adaptive technology for persons with deaf-blindness, including tactile communications for devices such as emergency alarms, doorbells, and TDD phones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Captioning technology and systems have been developed to provide audio information in visual form for persons who are deaf. A need exists for these same types of technology and systems to provide visual information in audio form for persons who are blind. As technology becomes increasingly graphic in nature, especially with the proliferation of computer-generated imagery, persons who are blind or who have low vision are increasingly at risk of being denied access to communication formats that are high in graphic content.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The feasibility of descriptive video has been investigated (Technical Viability of Descriptive Video Services, June 1990, prepared for U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs). A need exists to advance this technology in order to increase utilization of descriptive video by persons with low vision and blindness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

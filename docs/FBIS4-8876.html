			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Next Time Specifically"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava -- Provisions in the sphere of arms,  supplies of materials and equipment, and services for the armed  forces were the central issues discussed by delegations of the  Slovak and Ukrainian Ministries of Defense in Bratislava  yesterday. Possibilities of cooperation between military repair  plants were also discussed. As regards technical provisions,  the Slovak side expressed interest in, for example, purchasing  spare parts for tanks, infantry combat vehicles, and radar  systems. The Slovak Army also needs special fuel for missiles,  lubricants for the air force, and other special supplies that  used to be manufactured in the states of the former USSR. The  two sides agreed to work out lists of offers that they will  reassess under their own conditions. At their next meeting,  they will discuss specific requirements and proposals on the  basis of the two armies' potentials.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nord-Est Press report: "Russian Ultranationalist Leader </F> Vladimir Zhirinovskiy Will Not Receive Entry Visa to Romania"]    [Text] On 14 May the leadership of the PNT [National  Peasant Party]-Lambru, a small political group that withdrew  from the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party],  made public its intention to invite Russian ultranationalist  leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to visit Romania, parliamentary  sources announced. The reason for this invitation, according to  the PNT-Lambru, is the fact that the Russian politician is "a  person who has a thorough knowledge of the true history of  Romania." Authorized sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  informed us a few days ago that it is out of the question that  the Russian extremist can receive an entry visa to Romania. We  wish to remind our readers that a few months ago the Russian  leader sketched a "map of Europe" in which Romania is not  included at all as a state.</p>

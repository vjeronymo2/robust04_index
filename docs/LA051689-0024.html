			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> LA JOLLA'S RICH HARVEST OF 'GRAPES'  </P> <P> Actor Terry Kinney, playing Jim Casy, stands alone on a stage without color or  landscape and only a suggestion of barbed-wire fencing.  </P> <P> "The dawn came, but no day," he intones in a voice drained of emotion. "In the  air the dust hung like a fog. The men came out of their houses, and looked at  the land. And the women came out of their houses and watched the men, waiting  for them to break. . . ."  </P> <P> So begins the Chicago Steppenwolf Company's presentation of "The Grapes of  Wrath," which launched the La Jolla Playhouse's seventh season in the Mandell  Weiss Theatre on Sunday.  </P> <P> Adapted and directed by Frank Galati, a four-year company member (brief tenure  by Steppenwolf standards), it's a tough and richly poetic dramatization of the  John Steinbeck novel. Emotionally stark, visually bleak and aurally sustaining  (composer and musical director Michael Smith has created a mood-setting musical  frame performed on harmonica, a musical harp, banjo, fiddle and guitar), this  lament for the destitute farmers who left Oklahoma's Dust Bowl in the '30s in  search of work and survival in California has profound resonances in the  present. The Okies were the first homeless.  </P> <P> The echoes, however, run even deeper -- backward as well as forward. If the  itinerant Joads are the quintessence of displaced America, they're only an  extension of others: the displaced Native Americans and African Americans.  </P> <P> Thus the desperation of the Joads, trying to stick together and survive in a  country that (failing other ideas) can think only of exploiting them, informs  the larger story of a nation set on a socially tragic course, in which the  distance between the haves and have-nots relentlessly, endlessly widens.  </P> <P> Those are the general communications. But as the particular informs the general  best, this family's trials, their losses, their strength and their persistence  against horrendous odds is the beating heart of the play (and the novel). The  old truck that transports them becomes all the land they know. The fierce  matriarchal grip that binds them (Lois Smith as a valiant if perhaps too  calculated Ma Joad) becomes all the love they know. And the stillbirth of Rose  of Sharon's baby, symbolically the death of hope, is wiped away by the  regenerating final image: Rose (Sally Murphy, who knows how to be simple)  baring her milk-choked breast to feed a starving stranger.  </P> <P> Galati's text is, though not the first, probably the most effective  dramatization of the novel to date. (Terence Shank had created an only slightly  more sentimental one for L.A.'s Colony at the Studio Theatre Playhouse in 1980;  it was later featured at Louisville's annual Humana Festival of new plays.) It  understands something vitally important: that the only requirement for any play  is that it be true to its intent. In the case of an adaptation, that means the  original author's intent. On that level, the Steppenwolf "Grapes of Wrath"  succeeds better than its predecessors.  </P> <P> That is mainly because it doesn't compromise its bleakness and knows how to  convey the poetry within it -- exactly as Steinbeck has done. The acting of  this ensemble company ranges from excellent to good, hampered only when a  clumsier technology gets in the way. Gary Sinise as Tom and Kinney as Jim Casy  are the most individually memorable in the 35-member cast, which is to be  commended for being less rather than more distinguishable. This "Grapes" is a  testament to the rarely seen virtues of ensemble performance.  </P> <P> Also ensemble production.  </P> <P> The torn and faded costumes by Erin Quigley and Kevin Rigdon have the drab  authenticity of economic condition all over them. The spare lighting and set  designs by Rigdon create a deft, depressing mood, at once lyrical and stern,  with clotheslines replacing the barbed wire in the second half, isolating pools  of light, recessed bonfires, a waist-deep water channel representing the river,  white lightning and sheets of rain crashing down to the sound of apocalyptic  thunder during the rainstorm (Rob Milburn designed the sound) -- and of course  the truck.  </P> <P> This key player in the story has to be moved around on a special  radio-controlled frame. That's the only time that technology hinders rather  than helps. But theater is not about realism. It is about poetic illusion. And,  in this case, it is also very much about words.  </P> <P> Steinbeck's, distilled by Galati (who also did the film adaptation of "The  Accidental Tourist"), are as potent and invigorating as ever. At almost 3 1/2  hours, the impact of this transposed "Grapes of Wrath" remains undiluted.  </P> <P> At the Mandell Weiss Theatre on the campus of UC San Diego, Tuesdays through  Sundays, 8 p.m.; matinees Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m. Until June 17. Tickets:  $18-$28; (619) 534-3960).  </P> <P> </P></p>

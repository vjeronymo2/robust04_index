			<p>BFN     [Text] A provision on the confidence-building measures has  been included in a modified draft UN Security Council resolution  on the renewal of the UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] mandate in  Cyprus. Specifically, the draft resolution stresses the urgent  need to implement the confidence-building measures that are  mentioned in UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report  on the Cyprus issue dated 1 July 1993.    The draft resolution, which suggests the renewal of the  UNFICYP mandate for another six months, mentions that the UN  Security Council will reconsider the situation in Cyprus,  specifically the role of the United Nations, within the  framework of the UN secretary general's report of 30 May 1994.    The draft resolution calls on both sides to commit  themselves  to significantly reducing the number of foreign troops that are  in the Republic of Cyprus and to reduce defense spending to help  restore confidence, which is the first step toward the  withdrawal of all non-Cypriot forces as provided in  Butrus-Ghali's set of ideas.    The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent reported  from New York that the draft resolution will be presented for  approval to the Security Council either today or tomorrow.</p>

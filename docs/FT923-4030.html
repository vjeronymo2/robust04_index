			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Wimpey warns on homes market THE RECESSION in the construction industry could continue for another two years and would leave very few survivors unless the government took steps to help the industry, the chairman of Britain's second largest housebuilder warned yesterday. Sir Clifford Chetwood, chairman of Wimpey, was commenting after the company announced a Pounds 7.2m first-half loss and reduced its interim dividend by half. He said the recession in housebuilding had run for three years and could stretch for a further two. 'If we face a five-year recession with no assistance by government, there will be very few construction firms left,' Sir Clifford said. He appealed to the government to introduce measures to stimulate the housing market which, he said, would encourage greater confidence in the economy as a whole. 'Every day that their house is seen as a wasting, dwindling asset - a false, unwise investment - the longer we put off a return to consumer confidence,' Sir Clifford said. 'This does not just affect the housing industry. it hits motor cars, white goods, furniture, manufacturing right across the board. 'People will not spend when their safety-net, when the money that is invested in their property, has been seen to vanish from under them and threatens to diminish even further.' Sir Clifford, a former president of the Building Employers Confederation, criticised government economic policies which concentrated solely on defeating inflation. He said: 'The defeat of inflation is a laudable goal, but on its own will do nothing to rekindle confidence among those whose nest egg has disappeared and who will have to spend the rest of their lives paying off the liability which their investment has become.' He continued: 'There can be schemes devised which are neither short-term nor impulsive. It should not be beyond our wit as a nation to identify them and implement them to help the country as a whole in the most effective way at our disposal - by getting the housing market back to steady growth.' He said he did not want to say what measures he would like the government to introduce to assist home buyers. Previously he has advocated removal of stamp duty from house purchase and increased mortgage tax relief. Lex, Page 20 Wimpey results, Page 21</p>

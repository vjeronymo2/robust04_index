			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Poor management is blamed for staff dissatisfaction: Recommendations of the public-sector pay review bodies - Nursing and allied professions POOR MANAGEMENT rather than poor pay is the cause of greatest dissatisfaction among National Health Service hospital staff, according to the review body, which examined the pay of nurses, midwives and other allied professionals such as physiotherapists and radiographers. The review body recommended increases of 5.6 per cent to 6 per cent for the nearly 500,000 nurses and midwives employed by the NHS. The 43,000 belonging to the group of allied professions did slightly better, with increases of 6.2 per cent to 6.5 per cent. Increases for the 1992-93 pay bill are estimated at 5.8 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively. In practice this will mean an increase from Pounds 10,230 to Pounds 10,820 for a newly qualified staff nurse at the bottom of the scale and an increase from Pounds 12,995 to Pounds 13,750 for a newly qualified ward sister. Basic grades of the allied professions will be increased from Pounds 10,800 to Pounds 11,500; pay of top occupational therapists, for example, will go from Pounds 25,750 to Pounds 27,400. Staff retention appeared to have improved, the report said, and morale among nurses was found to be 'generally reasonably high'. But the review body was critical of the fact that more than 30,000 appeals arising from the 1988 clinical grading review were still waiting to be heard. 'Dissatisfaction about this backlog has infected the attitude of many staff to the pay scales themselves and has to some extent hindered us in assessing the effect of pay levels on recruitment, retention, motivation and morale,' the body reported. Many of the points raised by the staff in their argument for better pay could be 'addressed more effectively by management action than by increases in pay', the report said . The review body made no recommendations on possible future levels of performance-related pay and increased local pay flexibility, but emphasised that the two issues should not be confused. Proposals from the Department of Health have so far dealt with the two together. The staging of pay rises in previous years had led to widely and strongly felt 'disappointment and frustration' among all NHS hospital groups, the review body stated in its report's introductory remarks. The National Union of Public Employees, which represents, in particular, some of the lower-paid nursing staff, said the rises did not even make up for last year's shortfall through staging. 'After these rises over 100,000 nurses will still be paid less than the European Community 'decency threshold' of Pounds 5.16 an hour,' said Nupe. The Royal College of Nursing said awards left nurses 'treading water'. Ms Christine Hancock, RCN general secretary, said: 'The RCN supports the pay review body structure as a fair and independent method of settling nurses' pay but it is depressing to see nurses slipping down the pay ladder again. The award is well behind the average rise in earnings - currently running at 7.5 per cent and only just ahead of current inflation rates.' Cohse, the other main health service union, said the review body for nurses was 'in its death throes' because by 1994 all nurses would be working in trusts. That would leave nurses 'in the lurch, at the mercy of hospitals driven to cut costs by aggressive health market competition'. Review Body for Nursing Staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine. Ninth Report on Nursing staff, midwives and health visitors 1992, HMSO. Pounds 7.65. Ninth report on professions allied to medicine 1992. Pounds 7.95</p>

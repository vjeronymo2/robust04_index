			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Peace work woven into UK history: Gerald Cadogan visits a unique mill museum in Lancashire 500 horsepower, almost a century old - chugs and clunks to life; its beat steadily faster as the piston starts driving the huge flywheel. The engine is called Peace, and it is spotless. Brass gleams. Every part that needs oiling is oiled. Down below, in the weaving shed of the Queen Street Mill in Burnley, 50 of the thousand looms the engine once drove are hitched to the drive shaft, and begin to make cloth in an infernal clatter. The mill, now Lancashire's museum of weaving, is as special as the Historic Dockyard at Chatham in Kent, and as well worth a visit. It stopped working commercially only in 1982. As at Chatham, 'everything is still there.' Ersatz heritage is unnecessary. The mill is all real; it still produces cloth. Its power comes from the last steam engine still working in Lancashire - probably in Europe - in a mill. Invited to see the engine start, childhood memories of steam trains crowd back (but no driver had ever asked me on to the footplate). In the mill, entering the engine room was such a privilege that even the boss had to have the engineer's permission. If his clothes caught in the machinery, the engine could run amok or explode - and put everybody out of work. The engineer ruled by circumspection and cleanliness. (Carpet or polished wood floor round his engine made that clear - and visitors had to take their shoes off, the boss included.) The Queen Street Mill stands in Harle Syke, an industrial village on a hill on the edge of the countryside outside Burnley, once the cotton-weaving capital of the world. The first mill was built here in about 1855. In the 1860s there were four more mills, joint stock companies and co-operatives. The workers built their own houses; a proud, well-maintained village, then and now. The co-operative tradition, which began in 1844 in nearby Rochdale, enshrined a sturdy independence; an early version of property-owning democracy. Houses are in neat rows, their window surrounds all painted dark blue or black. Harle Syke and Lancashire cotton were at their peak when the Queen Street Manufacturing Company appealed to the villagers for Pounds 20,000 capital as a co-operative in 1894, offering 4000 shares at Pounds 5 each. Until it closed in 1982 it paid dividends to shareholders then scattered across the world: to children and grandchildren, gone abroad to seek work. Between the world wars the mill was surprisingly successful. It had to lease looms in the next-door mills, making large amounts of Lancashire 'grey cloth,' and flannelette. After the second world war, foreign competition made business hard: the narrow Lancashire looms wove cloth only up to 42 inches wide, thus ruling out, say, double sheets. And the only patterns the mill could manage were stripes. As a working museum the mill had a slow start. But its future is now assured, with large capital grants from English Heritage (Pounds 600,000), the National Heritage Memorial Fund (Pounds 200,000) and the European Regional Development Fund (Pounds 96,000) - a recognition that this place is unique. Lancashire County Council and Burnley Borough Council contribute to running costs. Retired millhands now work the machines powered by Peace, and produce cloth to sell. You can buy old fashioned 'granddad's shirts' in warm union cloth (68 per cent cotton, 32 per cent wool) at Pounds 29.50, and nightshirts in fine long-staple Egyptian cotton, which the mill still imports from Alexandria. Bread-and-butter business is making gauze for bookbindings and plasterer's scrim, at 5p a metre. But the mill also makes shawls to send to Jerusalem: top-quality, at Pounds 17.50 a metre. 'Something to do with religion,' says Jack Wood, the weaving supervisor. Nobody knew if the shawls were sold as 'Made in Lancashire.' In its heyday the mill had been an efficient business and, as a co-operative, free of labour troubles. There was only one fatal accident: to a cloth salesman in 1942. The mill was rebuilt after a bad fire in 1918 - and then, too, the engine's name was changed, from its original Prudence, to Peace, to mark the end of 'the war to end wars.' Pay was about Pounds 1 a week in the 1890s; by the outbreak of the first world war, in 1914, this had risen to one pound six shillings. Working hours were 6am to 6pm, with no shift work, and no working on Sunday. Arthur Martin, who was engineer when the mill closed in 1982, told me his working day was even longer: he started at 5am, 'to get up steam,' and stopped at 7.30pm. In 31 years he had had only one week's holiday. At its peak Prudence/Peace ran 1090 looms. Now driving only 50 looms, 'it does not have enough weight on it. It really needs 500-600 looms.' The clatter of the weaving shed is overwhelming; deafness must have been universal in Lancashire. The workers chatted by means of mouthing and lip-reading ('mee-mawing,' as it was called). They were paid by the piece - 'piece work' - and fined if their cloth had a fault. All cloth was labelled with the name of its weaver. In the 'drawing in' or 'knotting' room, the threads are drawn in and knotted to make the warp (the lengthwise part of the cloth). The shuttle then crosses back and forth, carrying the (shorter) weft or woof; the result is the woven cloth. Nowadays, mills move mobile knotting machines round the shop floor from loom to loom. The knotter points out: 'They have to stop the loom when knotting.' In the old system, the new knotted warp could be quickly put on, and the loom started again at once. I ask about the decline of Lancashire cotton. In Harle Syke, the knotter says, only one mill was in commercial operation; there used to be 12. 'We were always at a disadvantage.' Yorkshire had wool on its doorstep, and Northern Ireland had flax, but Lancashire had to import the cotton - unlike North Carolina, which grew it on the spot. The rain pours down - but cotton needs a damp climate to stop the threads breaking on the looms. Visiting the mill, it is easy to see how the tough, communal life of cotton working nurtured the co-operative movement. All depended on one other, and the weavers all bought shares and trustingly called the engine Prudence. Prudence/Peace and the mill are a unique part of UK history - something to be proud of. As she nears her centenary, the mighty machine is still going strong. She deserves a telegram from the Queen. The Queen Street Mill Museum is 10 minutes from Burnley centre: take a number 50 bus from Burnley bus station. The engine runs, and cloth is woven, on Wednesday-Friday from 10.30am-3.30pm.

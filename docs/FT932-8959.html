			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Books: A mixed child of creation GIFTS by Nuruddin Farah Serif Pounds 9.99, 242 pages AFRICAN WOMEN'S WRITING edited by Charlotte Bruner Heinemann Pounds 6.99, 211 pages A LONELY DEVIL by Sousa Jamba Fourth Estate Pounds 12.99, 154 pages THE SOUTH AFRICAN critic Lewis Nkosi once spoke fondly of the African novel as 'the bastard child of many cultures and genres.' The creative tensions of a mixed descent are clear enough in the latest novel by Nuruddin Farah, the expatriate Somali writer. Gifts is set in Mogadishu during the 1980s, before much of Somalia's seaboard capital was destroyed by clan wars. This is a love story, told largely through the reactions of the central character, Duniya, to a persistent and kindly suitor. Farah's fiction is rarely as simple as it seems. The puzzling arrival of a foundling child marks a hiatus, both in Duniya's life and in the plot of the novel. Duniya is happy to take on the baby but it dies soon afterwards and she is thrown back on her circumspect courtship. A clue to the foundling may well lie with that other bastard child, Nkosi's African novel. Gifts is an exemplary hybrid, in which the Somali habit of metaphor, grounded in oral tradition, gives depth and structure to a finely woven, rather English prose. The arrival of the child, followed by its death, opens an inquiry into the nature of the gift. To Farah, all gifts - from foundling children to overseas aid for poor African states - are suspect. Food donations, says one of his characters, undermine 'the African's ability to survive with dignity.' Those who accept a gift at face value may merely be conniving in their own misfortune. Caution is the answer, or part of it; candour must supply the rest. Duniya, who has already been given away in marriage as a young girl, can favour her suitor only in the absence of coercion. She makes the 'gift of herself' in the closing stages of the novel and, by doing so, retrieves a plausible innocence for love, if not for all forms of give and take. Farah has always written well about women. So, of course, do the contributors to Charlotte Bruner's collection. The book is well edited with detailed notes on the women writers in question, among them Bessie Head, the South African novelist who died in 1986, and the Egyptian author, Nawal El Sadaawi. Some of the best material comes from the Maghreb. Assia Djebar writes with wit and elegance about the stir caused in a conservative Algerian village when a man on his travels sends a postcard home to his wife. 'My father had quite brazenly written his wife's name . . . he had dared to refer to her in the western manner as 'Madame So-and-So'.' Henceforth the couple speak openly of each other and their little daughter has her first inkling of 'the possible happiness, the mystery in the union of a man and a woman.' So-and-so would be the best form of address for the hero of Sousa Jamba's novel A Lonely Devil, who ascends into the higher orders of wickedness on an imaginary island which has more than a passing resemblance to the author's native Angola. Nando, who is abandoned at the age of four and develops a reckless taste for cruelty, illustrates the axiom that those who are left in harm's way do harm to others. 'We deluded ourselves,' says Nando, at the end of a career in the torture chamber and the party caucus, 'with the idea that the glorious future awaiting us justified anything.' This novel is a pungent little fleur du mal; its scent clings obstinately to one's hands.</p>

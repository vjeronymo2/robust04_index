			<p>BFN     [Text] The resigning Robert Malval government says it is  alarmed by the surge of repression affecting the deprived  classes. It says it is alarmed by the extent of the recent surge  of repression hitting the most vulnerable classes of the Haitian  population and is warning all the authorities responsible for  maintaining order that they are acting against national  sovereignty by leaving unpunished those military and  paramilitary groups that are devoting themselves to open  violence, in defiance of the Constitution, the laws of the  Republic, and morality. According to the resigning government,  the insane acts reported by the international audio-visual media  cast discredit on the Haitian Armed Forces and risk opening the  way to interventionist attempts, as much as those brutalities  worry the national conscience.    The government asks the commander in chief of the Armed  Forces to advise the constitutional authorities on the measures  taken to protect the population, and to punish the guilty who  act with uncovered faces. Meanwhile, the government, which does  not enjoy the cooperation of the forces of order, expresses  solidarity with the families who are mourning their dead, their  injured, and their missing loved ones in all regions of the  country.</p>

The various unfair devices or means which may have been used include rebates, concessions, absorptions and allowances other than those set forth in applicable tariffs, misdeclarations and other similar practices, in violation of the prohibitions of section 10(a)(1) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1709(a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also has reason to believe that common carriers operating in the United States foreign commerce in the specified Trades, directly or indirectly, may have provided, or allowed other persons to obtain transportation of property at less or different compensation than the rates and charges shown in applicable tariffs or service contracts. These actions may have been accomplished by failure to file a common carrier tariff and by various unfair devices or means, such as rebates, concessions, absorptions and allowances other than those set forth in applicable tariffs and through misdeclarations and other similar practices, in violation of the prohibitions of sections 8 and 10(b) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1707 and 1709(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If established, such violations are subject to civil penalties not to exceed $25,000 for each violation willfully and knowingly committed, pursuant to section 13(a) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1712(a). Additionally, carriers who rebate or commit other rate malpractices in contravention of their tariffs or service contracts may have their tariffs or their participation in conference tariffs suspended by the Commission pursuant to section 13(b)(1) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1712(b)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to ensure the proper and effective administration and enforcement of the shipping statutes, the Commission is instituting a nonadjudicatory investigation to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to warrant informal compromise procedures or formal investigation and assessment proceedings for violations of the 1984 Act with regard to the transportation of property in the specified Trades.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission presently has in effect Fact Finding Investigation No. 16,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Possible Malpractices in the Trans-Atlantic Trades  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (``FFI No. 16''), and Fact Finding Investigation No. 18,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rebates and Other Malpractices in the Trans-Pacific Trades  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (``FFI No. 18''). Because the purpose and scope of FFI No. 16 and FFI No. 18 are included within the nonadjudicatory fact finding investigation instituted by this Order, FFI No. 16 and FFI No. 18 will be terminated by separate Orders at such time as final reports are submitted by the Investigative Officers and accepted by the Commission. Any outstanding subpoenas or investigative activities of FFI No. 16 and FFI No. 18 remain in force and are incorporated in this newly instituted fact finding investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, it is ordered, That pursuant to sections 8, 10, 11 and 12 of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1707, 1709, 1710 and 1711, and Part 502, Subpart R of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 46 CFR 502.281, et seq., a nonadjudicatory investigation is hereby instituted into the practices of common carriers and other persons with respect to untariffed transportation activity and the possible payment of rebates and any other devices or means of providing, or allowing persons to obtain, transportation of property at less or different compensation than the rates and charges shown in applicable tariffs or service contacts, in the trades between United States ports and points and ports and points in Europe, the Far East, South America, Central America or the Caribbean;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is further ordered, That the Investigative Officers shall be Wm.

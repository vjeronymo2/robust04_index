			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / China urges patents crackdown China, under strong pressure from the US to protect copyrights and patents, ordered its courts yesterday to wage war on violators of intellectual property rights, The Supreme People's Court of China issued a circular to all civilian, military and special courts to 'conscientiously study and research .. laws governing protection of intellectual property rights', the official People's Daily said yesterday. Foreign businessmen in China have expressed concerns over the abilities of courts to deal with the often highly technical nature of copyright issues. According to the circular, courts have been advised to select people with foreign language abilities and background in science and engineering to take part in copyright violation trials. The courts were also told to resist protectionism in local governments and other government agencies.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Confusion over rouble support The deputy chairman of Russia's central bank yesterday said it would no longer intervene on the foreign exchange markets to support the rouble - a policy it followed for much of this year at great cost. 'The reserves of the central bank are sufficient only to support five or six days of interventions on Moscow's Interbank Currency Exchange,' Mr Alexander Khandruyev told an international conference in London. 'In August, foreign exchange reserves were Dollars 5.2bn. Now we have Dollars 1.7bn-Dollars 1.8bn left. What do we do next?' However, his comments contradicted those made earlier this week by Tatyana Paramonova, the new head of the central bank, who succeeded Mr Victor Gerashchenko when he resigned after the rouble collapsed after the central bank abandoned its support. She pledged: 'Foreign currency reserves, of which the Central Bank of Russia is not the only holder, will be used to defend the rouble rate.' The rouble's 21 per cent plunge against the dollar on October 11 sent that week's inflation rate to a one-year high. Inflation jumped to 6.8 per cent, the highest rate since September 1993, up sharply from the previous week's rate of 2.7 per cent.</p>

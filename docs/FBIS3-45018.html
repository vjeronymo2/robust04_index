These changes will exert  far-reaching influence on future world economic growth.    The recovery of the Western economies was still weak this  year. After experiencing a "soft recovery" for two and a half  years, GDP growth topped 3 percent in the second half of this  year and annual growth will be around 2.8 percent. And yet, due  to many chronic afflictions, the U.S. economy is still troubled  by serious financial and foreign trade deficits. After dropping  for three consecutive years, the EC economy is likely to  register negative growth of 0.5 percent this year; with the  number of unemployed at 18 million, there have been frequent  strikes in various countries. The Japanese economy is still in  the doldrums and Japan will register its first zero growth since  World War II.    Some headway has been made in creating private enterprises  in  the CIS countries, but economic chaos has not been brought under  control. Industrial output will drop by 16 percent this year,  the inflation rate stands at 2,000 percent, and the people's  living standards are continuing to drop. The economic situation  in East European countries is different, with Poland, the Czech  Republic, and Hungary scoring some achievements in their change  toward a market economy and their industrial production tending  to stabilize or pick up.    Average economic growth in the developing countries was  about  5.6 percent but there were considerable differences among  different countries. In Latin America, most countries'  economies have improved for three consecutive years, their gross  output value has grown by about 3 percent, and they have  improved their ability to absorb foreign capital. In Africa,  the annual economic growth rate is about 1.6 percent, lagging  far behind its 3-percent population growth. The Asian economy  is still upbeat, with economic growth standing at about 7  percent. Economic growth in East Asia will reach 8 percent,  ranking first in terms of world economic growth for several  years running. East Asia is after all regarded as the area with  the most dynamic economic growth in the world.    The tide of economic reform is sweeping practically all  countries and regions in the east, west, north, and south. All  countries, developed or developing, are striving for development  through change. Soon after taking office, Clinton put forward a  whole set of programs for reforming and rejuvenating the  American economy. EC countries are focusing on changes in four  aspects, i.e. increasing employment, reforming their welfare  systems, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and  accelerating the shift from scientific research to production.  Japan is focussing on reforming its monetary system,  strengthening basic scientific research, and readjusting  existing employment and operational mechanisms, as well as  expanding internal demand and gradually opening up the domestic  market. The CIS and East European countries are expediting the  transformation of their economies. A number of new emerging  industrialized countries and regions, which are rising suddenly  in East Asia, are encouraging large numbers of developing  countries to explore modes suited to their economic development.    The trends toward regional economic blocs and world economic  integration are developing further, with economic competition  and mergers going hand in hand. Early this year, a big market  of 12 EC countries began to operate. Following the final  approval of the Maastricht Treaty after many twists and turns,  the construction of a European Alliance has started. The  European Economic Area pact will also come into effect in  January 1994 and the process of European integration is still  developing in accordance with the idea of three "concentric  circles." The United States, Canada, and Mexico have approved  the North American Free Trade Agreement in Congress. [as  published] Some time ago, a Seattle meeting of the leaders of  the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization, which  attracted widespread attention in the international community,  put forward the idea of open regional economic and trade  cooperation.    The sustained, high-speed development and sudden rise of the  Asian economy, especially the East Asian economy, has further  enhanced the region's economic status. The rate of Asia's  economic development this year is about three times that of  world economic development. Economic regional alliances,  subregional alliances, and other forms of development in the  Asian region are emerging one after another. In the face of  such a uniquely good economic situation in East Asia, the U.S.  Government has openly indicated, "looking forward into the 21st  century, no other region is more important to the prosperity and  stability of the United States than the Pacific rim region."    The world's finances are still weak. It is increasingly  difficult for the old world and regional monetary coordination  mechanisms to play their roles. The crisis in the European  currency system and the great appreciation of the Japanese yen,  which have come one after another this year, indicate a drastic  increase in the volatility of international finance. To  stimulate economic recovery, the United States has reduced its  short-term interest rates to a record low. Japan has basically  followed the trend in U.S. interest rates. To control inflation  and maintain the dominant role of the Deutsch Mark among  European currencies, Germany has kept its high interest rates  unchanged for a long time. Monetary turmoil has also found  expression in violent fluctuations of stock markets. Since the  bursting of Japan's "bubble economy," the Nikkei Index has  dropped continuously and so have stock markets in Germany and  France. [sentence as published]    State intervention has increased and economic diplomacy is  the order of the day. With the general slump of the Western  economy, there is turmoil in society. This has directly  affected the position of the ruling parties, leading to changes  in some governments. Consequently, developed countries have  extensively increased macroeconomic regulation and control and  formulated a series of measures and plans to stimulate and  develop the economy. They have further enhanced the status of  economic security in international relations and tried hard to  gain a favorable position in the midst of fierce international  competition. State intervention has also involved credits,  investment, foreign aid, trade, and even private investment.  These countries have kept exchange rates and technological  transfers under stricter control.    The world economy will still face many difficulties next  year  but favorable factors will also increase. The overall situation  is expected to be better than this year.</p>

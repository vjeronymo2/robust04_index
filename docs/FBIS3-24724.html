Addressing a rightwing gathering in Pretoria, Gen  Viljoen said such a decision, however, would have to be  accompanied by the greatest degree of responsibility as it would  have far-reaching implications for South Africa.    The assembly earlier adopted a resolution insisting on the  Afrikaner's right to self-rule in his own territory and that all  methods--including what was termed the "minimal use of  violence"--should be pursued as a last resort to attain this  ideal.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Zaventem revamp Brussels airport opens its new terminal building on December 11, completing a Dollars 674m revamp of an airport long criticised as outdated. The new terminal will raise the airport's capacity to 15m passengers annually, and 'will be one of the most beautiful and modern airport buildings', an official says. For years, Zaventem airport has been the butt of jokes, with long queues irritating passengers at the 40-year-old terminal building. Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene described Zaventem last year as 'a rather provincial airport' in serious need of renovation. Passenger numbers have doubled to more than 10m a year, and Sabena, the national airline, wants Zaventem to be a Euro-hub for business travel. The first stage of the modernisation and extension of the airport - a section of the new departure hall, a portion of the arrivals area and a new baggage-handling system - was opened last June. The project, initially budgeted at Dollars 257m, was started at the end of 1989 and was due to be unveiled at the end of 1992. It is supported by the state and private companies.</p>

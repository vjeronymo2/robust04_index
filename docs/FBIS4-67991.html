			<p>BFN     [Text] Asyut, Upper Egypt, 25 Apr (MENA)-- Four terrorists  were killed today in a clash with the security forces in the  al-Walidiyah cemetery in Asyut Governorate. The four were  involved in the assassination of Asyut Security Chief Brigadier  General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi and his guard last Wednesday.    The security forces were watching the terrorists' hideout,  to  which they were directed by terrorist Hasan Khalifah, who was  arrested after the assassination. When the security forces  stormed the hideout, they were fired upon. They had to return  fire, killing the four terrorists. Four weapons--including an  automatic rifle, a policeman's pistol, and a large amount of  ammunition--were found with the dead terrorists.    The terrorists are Ahmad Anwar Fahmi, 22 years, a student at  the faculty of commerce who comes from Mallawi, al-Minya; Amin  Shafiq Ahmad, 23 years, a student at the pharmaceutical college  who comes from Suhaj; Usamah 'Abd-al-'Al Muhammad 'Uthman, 21  years, a student at the faculty of law who comes from Tahta in  Suhaj; and Muhammad Mutawalli 'Atiyah, a student at the Higher  Institute of Agricultural Extension and Cooperation who comes  from Juhaynah in Suhaj.

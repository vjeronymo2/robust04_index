			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / US to send 2,400 troops to Kuwait THE US administration is preparing to send 2,400 soldiers to Kuwait in the coming days, the Pentagon said yesterday, AP reports from Washington. Soldiers with mechanized and infantry units from Texas and Georgia have been given orders to prepare for the move, said defence officials. They said the troops will be flown to Kuwait from Texas and Kentucky in an exercise which had been planned for later in the year. 'It's a message to Saddam. It's to show the flag,' one official said. The move follows the US administration's decision ' in light of the tension with Iraq over United Nations weapons inspections ' to send a battery of Patriot missiles to Kuwait, and another battery of the anti-missile weaponry to neighbouring Bahrain. Yesterday the state department rejected a UN inspector's suggestion that a confrontation with Baghdad over access to a suspected weapons site was a misunderstanding and charged that all of Iraq's hidden capabilities had not been uncovered. The state department said UN Security Council resolution 687, which sets out Gulf War ceasefire terms, requires Iraq to give UN inspectors immediate and unconditional access to any site that they believe may contain information about Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction. In addition to sending troops to Kuwait US navy and marines are expected to participate in a round of naval and amphibious exercises with the Kuwaiti military, beginning next week. The decision does not portend military action, according to the Pentagon. 'It's defensive. It's like an exercise,' he said. 'There is nothing going on there now that should raise anyone's level of concern,' indicating chances are extremely low that the Army troops would come under fire. The troops are expected to be dispatched in the coming days but the order could be reversed should the White House decide it isn't necessary. The Pentagon stressed that top military officials were treating the move as 'business as usual,' and that no great level of anxiety accompanies the decision.</p>

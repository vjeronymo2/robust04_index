			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Letter: Heseltine - an accountant bites back, and foul called Sir, Mr Heseltine was reported as saying that the UK has got the balance wrong in the creation of wealth ('Heseltine laments oversupply of accountants', February 6). He inferred that accountants and lawyers are too many in number and not crucial in financial strategy. In response to Heseltine (part qualified) a representative from the Institute of Chartered Accountants apparently spoke wearily and guardedly and the FT remarked in passing that the institute reports to the DTI on regulatory matters] As a chartered accountant in practice, weary and worn with regulation and compliance, sick of the recession, the grumbling and the resistance of clients to professional fees, I am not surprised that the standing of a chartered accountant has become denigrated. May I suggest some reasons for this unpalatable situation. (a) Some 30-40 per cent of my practice time is spent on compliance, regulation and form filling exercises for the government. I cannot therefore develop my expertise to the full or maximise my contribution and experience to the businesses of my clients. (b) I cannot offer a full and embracing professional service to client companies because I have to demonstrate to the Joint Monitoring Unit that as audit compliance partner I have carried out an audit, as wide in scope for a large public company, for small proprietorial companies. The scope of the work has become greater with additional man hours. (c) I can only employ the levels and calibre of staff, as dictated by my professional body, and the costs of practice administration and training have increased significantly. I have two sons aged 17 and 21 and I am thinking very seriously as to whether their futures would be better without professional qualification. Mr Heseltine's comments and the rather spineless reaction from the Institute of Chartered Accountants certainly add substance to this view.

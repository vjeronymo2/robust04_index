			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has reiterated that the  Turkish side has proved beyond any doubt that it does not have  the political will to permit an overall Cyprus settlement. This  lack of political will, he noted, contributed to the current  deadlock in the confidence-building measures.    Receiving the credentials of new German Ambassador to Cyprus  Friedrich Garbers, President Kliridhis said he appreciated  Germany's position in promoting a Cyprus solution and  maintaining UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus]. President Kliridhis  stressed: The people of Cyprus look forward to the day when the  Nicosia wall will be demolished, just like the Berlin Wall.    Presenting his credentials, the new German ambassador  expressed the conviction that mutual trust is necessary between  the two sides and added that it should be built soon through  measures such as those proposed by the UN secretary general. He  also said that the German Government welcomes the European  Union's [EU] recognition of Cyprus' European identity, thus  confirming the expectation of full accession to the EU. Garbers  is 62, and a career diplomat. He has served in Milan, Helsinki,  Nairobi, and Rome.</p>

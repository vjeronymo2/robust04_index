			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Move to reopen talks on Pool Re INSURERS moved yesterday to reopen negotiations with the government over Pool Re, the government-backed reinsurance company which covers business against losses from terrorist attack, Richard Lapper writes. On Wednesday Mr Ian Rushton, outgoing chairman of the Association of British Insurers, said member companies were reviewing their participation of the scheme, set up earlier this year after terrorism cover was withdrawn from commercial insurance policies. Mr Alan Bridgewater, who takes over as association chairman next month, said he was concerned 'to engage in a constructive discussion with the DTI to review the whole scheme as quickly as possible'. Mr Bridgewater, however, said he 'felt strongly concerned' about the lack of consultation by the DTI on the issue. The row between insurers and the government follows protests earlier this week from the Confederation of British Industry and other business organisations about planned increases in premium rates at Pool Re. Rates for some of the largest buildings in most-exposed areas, such as central London, will rise more than 300 per cent next month. Businesses in less vulnerable parts of the country will benefit from rate reductions, however.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Warner Howard up 9% on rentals growth WARNER HOWARD, the hot air hand dryer and commercial laundry equipment company, reported full-year pre-tax profits up 9 per cent to Pounds 6.24m, compared with Pounds 5.7m. Turnover for the year to February 28 rose to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 22.2m). Rentals, more popular in recessions, contributed about Pounds 12m. Hand dryer rentals improved to Pounds 4.49m (Pounds 3.81m) and laundry equipment rentals climbed to Pounds 7.56m (Pounds 7.34m). Catering rentals fell to Pounds 409,000 (Pounds 470,000). Sales of laundry equipment rose to Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 1.86m) bringing the division into break-even compared with losses last time, mainly because of a contract with a 1,200-bed hotel in St Petersburg, Russia. Sales of hand dryers fared less well, falling to Pounds 1.73m (Pounds 1.82m). Profits declined about Pounds 100,000 because of extra marketing costs. Catering sales fell to Pounds 3.84m (Pounds 4.37m), because of 'weakness in equipment sales' which hit Eurolectrics. Service contracts improved to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 2.46m). The company made an extraordinary provision of Pounds 337,000 for liability on a lease assigned to a third party in 1980 which went into liquidation in 1991. The company generated about Pounds 1.7m net cash, ending the year with a Pounds 400,000 positive balance, after two small rental contract acquisitions. Capital expenditure was Pounds 3.4m and depreciation was Pounds 2.4m. Interest payments fell to Pounds 9,000 (Pounds 135,000). The board proposes a final dividend of 0.38p (3.975p). It paid a second interim of 4p on April 5 after an earlier 2.12p (1.925p), because of increased advance corporation tax. The total for the year is 6.5p (5.9p). Earnings were 18.74p (17.16p) per share.</p>

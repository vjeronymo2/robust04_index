			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [14 May RENMIN RIBAO commentator's article: "A Rare and </F> Serious Case, a Profound Lesson"]    [Text] Beijing 13 May (XINHUA) -- The judicial organ has  made a judgment in accordance with the law on the fraud case of  swindling $10 billion worth of letters of credit, which happened  in Hebei's Hengshui Prefecture. This serious case seriously  encroached upon state interests and disrupted financial and  social order. If we do not punish those involved, we will be  unable to calm down people's indignation and exercise state law.  The judgment of this case has demonstrated the fairness and  seriousness of our country's legal system.    We have learned a profound lesson from this case, in which a  few foreign swindlers created a bid fraud involving $10 billion.  This is indeed a frightening thing. Had our country's judicial  organs and concerned departments not taken immediate and  effective measures, the economic losses and political impact  would have been unbearable. This case reminded us that, in the  course of establishing and developing a socialist market  economy, we must have a sound legal system to guide and protect  us. It is wrong to think people can do as they wish and defy  laws human and divine because China is now practicing a market  economy. All sovereign countries, including the Western  countries where the market economy is highly developed, will not  allow criminal activities such as fraud to happen in their own  countries.    We must have some vigilance against swindling activities  carried out by "foreign businessmen" such as Mei Zhifang  [Francisco Hung Moy] and Li Zhuoming [Raymond C. Lee]. They  came to China not to genuinely help China develop the economy  but to pillage for private gains with wicked minds. They came  here not to do normal business but to swindle and bluff.  Foreigners must observe China's laws, and Chinese should also  observe foreign laws in foreign countries. All people should do  things in accordance with the law and all people are equal in  the face of law. Punishing them in accordance with the law is  to protect our country's normal rights and interests and is also  to protect foreign businessmen's normal rights and interests. It  is certain that the overwhelming majority of foreign businessmen  are friendly, come to China to do business, and observe laws and  discipline. Swindlers such as Mei Zhifang and Li Zhuoming are  extremely few among foreign businessmen. The opening China will  not give up eating for fear of choking [yin ye fei shi 0936 0888  1683 7380], and will, as always, welcome friends from the five  continents and receive guest from the whole world.    What brought on the $10-billion swindle, besides the  deceitfulness and craftiness of the swindlers, was the ignorance  and greed of those who were deceived. Ignorance and rash  actions, failure to abide by the laws, failure to observe rules,  and abuse of authority will definitely lead to a law violation  and the committing of crimes. Ignorance plus greed could not  have been a worse combination. Maybe they wanted fame or status  and maybe they wanted money or other personal benefits, but they  were blinded by lust for gain and they brought calamity to the  country and people. We should draw a profound lesson from what  happened.    When it comes to constructing the socialist market economy,  many of us are just like primary school students who do not even  have some of the very basic general knowledge. Only through  serious study can we adapt the new situation's demands. Leading  cadres at all levels and comrades who are involved in economic  work, particularly that which is related to foreign nationals,  should, in particular, seriously study the basic law, general  knowledge, and laws and regulations governing market economics.  What we are afraid of are people who know nothing but pretend  that they do and who regard state property as a trifling thing  -- that is very dangerous. This year, the overall situation  concerning work of the whole party and nation is to seize the  opportunity, deepen the reform, open up wider, promote  development, and maintain stability. When comrades from all  regions, units, and departments want to ask questions or handle  affairs, they should have the cardinal principles in mind and  take the overall situation into account, and should never harm  the interests of the whole for the sake of partial and local  interests. Still less should they forget righteousness in the  face of profits; they should not forget the fundamental  interests of the country and people just because they want a  small profit for their localities or units. We should correctly  handle relations between reform, development, and stability;  seriously complete all tasks in a responsible manner; ensure  that we have sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development;  and promote all-round social progress.</p>

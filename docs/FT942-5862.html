			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Harrods agrees deal with former director Harrods, the Knightsbridge department store, has 'resolved amicably all differences' with its former managing director Mr Peter Bolliger, whose departure from the company in April provoked a bitter war of words. Mr Bolliger insisted he had resigned after it became impossible for him to work with Mr Mohamed al-Fayed, the store's 'hands-on' co-owner. 'He likes to feel he is running the store. He will even go behind a counter and cut salami,' Mr Bolliger said at the time. Harrods claimed Mr Bolliger had been sacked for his unsatisfactory performance, in particular in his running of the Kurt Geiger shoe chain, and handling of the dismissal of a senior manager. The company later said it was suing Mr Bolliger for breach of contract and lodged a writ with the High Court. Mr Bolliger moved out of his Knightsbridge home and returned to his native Switzerland, but his solicitors have released a statement saying that 'Harrods have resolved amicably all differences with Peter Bolliger on terms acceptable to all parties.' Neither side would comment on the terms of the agreement. Harrods had also passed on a dossier detailing alleged irregularities by Mr Bolliger to Chelsea CID, but it is thought the police investigation is unlikely to proceed.</p>

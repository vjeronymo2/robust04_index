			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, [no date as received] -- Kostyantyn  Hryshchenko, head of the directorate for control over armament  and disarmament of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine,  and Ihor Kharchenko, head of the directorate for political  analysis and prediction, held a meeting with journalists on 9  December, which was devoted to the consequences of ratification  of START I. According to information from Kharchenko, Andrey  Kozyrev, [Russian] minister of foreign affairs, "resorted to  conscious distortion of several specific facts" at a recent  briefing at the Russian Foreign Ministry. In particular, he  maintained that Russia had supposedly virtually received  agreement to conduct peacemaking actions on the territory of the  former USSR, although really only the necessity of carrying out  peacemaking actions in general was stressed at the CSCE session  in Rome. It does not correspond to reality that CSCE ministers  supposedly unanimously condemned aggressive nationalism, and  also that one had supposedly managed to isolate Ukraine from the  world because of its stance regarding nuclear disarmament, [no  closing quotation marks as received] -- noted Kostyantyn  Hryshchenko. According to information from the Ukrainian  diplomats, Russia itself in fact ended up in isolation after it  was to blame for disrupting the signing of a package of  documents in the sphere of defense planning, which suited all of  the delegations apart from the Russian one. The Ukrainian  diplomatic corps links the latest statements by the Russian  foreign minister with the clear line of Russia's government,  which was previously concealed and was made out to be the  opinion of parliament. A UNIAN correspondent has learned that  Borys Tarasyuk, deputy minister of foreign affairs, made  observations on 8 December regarding the Kozyrev's position,  when Tarasyuk stressed that it is Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's idea to divide the Black Sea Fleet.</p>

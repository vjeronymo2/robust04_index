			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUESTIONS ASKED YOUNG SURVIVOR  </P> <P> In response to "Silent Statement: Prosecutor Uses Dramatics to Sum Up in  Manslaughter Trial," Metro, Feb. 7: Well, I think I've finally heard it all!  Don't they teach ethics in law school?  </P> <P> Here we have an intoxicated man who slams into innocent people killing four and  mentally injuring one young man.  </P> <P> Yet the defending lawyer has the gall to interrogate the survivor as to whether  he had 1 or 2, or even 5 seconds to try to warn the victims of the approach of  the speeding car!  </P> <P> Who is the victim and who is the criminal? I know it is up to the lawyer to  defend his client to the best of his ability, but this is over and above the  call of duty! In fact it is tantamount to child abuse!  </P> <P> Don't you think that this young man is going to relive over and over again what  happened that tragic day, without trying to also make him feel that he was a  contributing factor in some way?  </P> <P> I would like to say to the young man, "I am terribly sorry for your horrible  losses, you did nothing wrong and I hope that time will heal your wounds."  </P> <P> DEBORAH R. ISHIDA  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

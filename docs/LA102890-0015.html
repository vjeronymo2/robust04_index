			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSIDERING ART  </P> <P> Re Hilary de Vries' Oct. 21 article "All the Rage," about performance artist  Karen Finley:  </P> <P> The Times has twice quoted the artist -- who smears various substances over her  partly naked body -- as saying, "I consider good art that which destroys the  last generation's hopes."  </P> <P> Well, I consider "performance art" to be all performance and no art, unless  gaining attention and publicity is an art. If so, "Gabor and the Cop" is the  highest example to date.  </P> <P> It is what those do who have mastered no art whatsoever.  </P> <P> FRED SCIFERS, Downey  </P></p>

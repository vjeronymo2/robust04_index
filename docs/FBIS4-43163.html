			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] As early as Tuesday [17 May] morning,  [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua insisted on making it known  that he was not "aware" of the arrival in Paris of Libyan  Foreign Minister `Umar al-Muntasir. This visit, revealed by  Europe 1 television, provoked the protests of the families of  the victims in the explosion of the UTA aircraft.    The interior minister's statement is all the more surprising  given that the Libyan eminence did not spend his Parisian  weekend in a suspect little hotel, but at the Crillon Hotel on  Place de la Concorde, some hundreds of meters away from his  ministry. A Parisian palace where this type of visit rarely goes  undetected by the Directorate of Territorial Security (DST)  counterespionage agents.    It is the French Embassy in Tripoli that granted a visa to  the Libyan minister who wished to transit Paris, on his way to  South Africa and back. The granting of the visa was the object  of a telegram addressed by the French ambassador to the Foreign  Ministry, which sent a copy to the Interior Ministry and to the  air and border police, as stipulated in administrative  procedures.    Therefore, there are just two hypotheses left: either  Charles  Pasqua is fooling us, or he does not read the reports of his own  services. Both hypothese are not very reassuring with regard to  someone who once upon a time was most concerned about  "terrorizing the terrorists."</p>

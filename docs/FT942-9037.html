			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo sees public investment as solution Japan should invest more in domestic public infrastructure to prepare for its ageing population and reduce the country's widely criticised current account surplus, according to the government's 1994 white paper on trade, reports Michiyo Nakamoto from Tokyo. Japan's current account surplus has largely been recycled overseas, but given the rise in Japan's elderly population, the surplus should be invested at home to create the national assets necessary to support future public life, the white paper points out. By 2025, the number of Japanese over 65 compared with those between 15 and 64 will rise to 43.2 per cent against 17.3 per cent in 1990, says the white paper, published annually by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Public infrastructure investment in Japan is still very low. Sewage penetration, for example, is lower in Japan than in Singapore, which invests 41 per cent of GDP at home. The white paper calls for greater investment in housing, public infrastructure, including information infrastructure and in service industries. Increased housing investment, in particular, should contribute significantly to cutting the gap between savings and investments. It also points out that price differentials between Japan and the rest of the world stem not only from differences in quality and distribution costs but from different business practices. This has kept prices high even as the yen's value has been appreciating, the white paper says, forcing Japanese companies to move manufacturing overseas.</p>

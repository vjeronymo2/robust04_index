			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 10 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Parliament  Upper House President Radmilo Bogdanovic assessed on Friday that  the time for easing the sanctions against the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) was approaching, judging by statements  supporting a cessation of hostilities in the former Yugoslavia  made by U.S. President Bill Clinton and the European Union.  Bogdanovic said this during talks with representatives of the  "Min" mechanical engineering factory in Nis (Serbia).    The United Nations in May 1992 imposed comprehensive  sanctions against Yugoslavia for its alleged involvement in the  civil war in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    President Clinton was actually threatening the Bosnian  Moslems when he spoke of the lifting of the sanctions against  Yugoslavia, according to Slobodan Rakitic, opposition Depos  [Democratic Movement of Serbia] bloc deputy in the Yugoslav  Parliament. "The sanctions against Yugoslavia will be softened  if a Moslem-Croat federation rejects a peace plan," a statement  signed by Rakitic on behalf of a group of Depos MPs said.    Clinton's statement could be understood as a kind of  confession that neither the introduction of sanctions had  depended on Serbia, Montenegro and the Bosnian Serb Republic  (R.S.), the statement also said. "If the lifting of the  sanctions is announced now as punishing the Moslems for  disobedience, then the introduction was a reward to a  Moslem-Croat coalition for their war option," the announcement  said.    Delegations of the Moslem-Croat Federation and of the  Bosnian  Serb republic signed on Wednesday in Geneva a one-month  ceasefire accord, althouth the Serb side was for a one-year  cessation of hostilities, estimating that a one-month ceasefire  is too short for finding a political settlement to end the  Bosnian war.</p>

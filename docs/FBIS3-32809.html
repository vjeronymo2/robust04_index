Both agencies estimate  that returns on the illegal business with alevins (newly-hatched  fish) amount to $2.4 million per week.    The Pastoral for Indigenous Communities of the Upper  Solimoes  contends that former members of the gang of Colombian drug  kingpin Pablo Escobar, who died recently, might be members of  the band of fish smugglers.    According to Father Joseney Lira, the Colombians leave their  country through the city of Leticia, enter Brazil through  Tabatinga, and go to the cities of Atalaia do Norte and Benjamin  Constant, Amazonas State, using the Javari River. Lira said:  "Most smuggling occurs in these two municipal districts. The  Colombians purchase alevins at puny prices and resell them for  600 real cruzeiros each."    The smuggled fish reportedly enter Colombia through Leticia,  are flown by airplane to Bogota, and then to Miami (United  States of America). Amazonas PF [federal police] Superintendent  Mauro Sposito said the smuggled fish are also used to camouflage  cocaine shipments from Leticia to the United States.</p>

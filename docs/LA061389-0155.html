			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ORDER TO IMPOUND SAILBOAT STARS AND STRIPES IS LIFTED  </P> <P> An order to impound the America's Cup catamaran Stars and Stripes for  nonpayment of a debt has been lifted, the U.S. marshal's office reported today.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the marshal's office said a court order was received late  Friday to lift the lien placed on the boat and other property of Sail America,  which organized the defense of yachting's premier trophy last year.  </P> <P> Several containers of equipment, including the disassembled catamaran used to  defeat New Zealand 2-0 last September, were seized on June 5 by the U.S.  government for nonpayment of a $225,000 debt owed to North Sails Group Inc.  </P> <P> Jay Hansen of North Sails said the board of directors had unanimously voted to  drop the lawsuit and attempt to work out a payment plan with Sail America, now  called the America's Cup Organizing Committee.  </P> <P> A court later disqualified Stars and Stripes and awarded the cup to New  Zealand's Mercury Bay Boating Club. That action is under appeal.  </P></p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Royal Oak Mines lifts offer to CDollars 2.4bn in fight for Lac Royal Oak Mines, the pugnacious Vancouver-based gold producer, yesterday lifted its takeover bid for Lac Minerals, the much larger Canadian mining group, by about 14 per cent to CDollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.12bn). The latest offer substantially raises the amount of cash available to Lac shareholders. Mrs Peggy Witte, Royal Oak's chief executive, said she was encouraged by the support her company had received since its first offer a month ago. Nevertheless, the chances of Royal Oak winning the battle for Lac remain slim. Analysts predicted yesterday that American Barrick, which has submitted a rival CDollars 2.2bn bid, would sweeten its package, or that other offers would surface. Barrick shares, which comprise a sizeable part of its bid, are widely regarded as being of higher quality and more liquid than Royal Oak paper. Royal Oak also has the disadvantage of drawing heavily on Lac's resources to finance the takeover. Lac said last night that it would consider the revised Royal Oak offer. The Toronto-based company has so far said that its favoured option is to retain its independence. It has responded to criticism of its management by replacing its chief executive, unveiling USDollars 600m (Pounds 387m) in new projects, and substantially raising estimates of reserves at its mines in Canada, the US and Chile. Mr Rick Cohen, analyst at Goepel Shields in Vancouver, said that with a bidding war now in full swing, Lac was unlikely to survive in its present form. Its directors 'have to recognise that the company is history', Mr Cohen said. 'The best thing is to put it up for auction.' Lac is widely owned, with most of its shares held by North American institutional investors. Royal Oak's latest offer comprises CDollars 5 cash and two Royal Oak shares, with a total value of CDollars 16.50, for each Lac share. Alternatively, Lac shareholders can take 2.87 Royal Oak shares for each Lac share. The offer expires on August 19. Royal Oak said that it plans a CDollars 120m equity issue to help finance its bid. A group of banks earlier agreed to provide a long-term credit facility of USDollars 700m. Lac shares rose 38 cents to close at CDollars 14.63 in Toronto yesterday.</p>

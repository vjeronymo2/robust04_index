			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: ONGC sticks to Euro-issue plan India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) intends to go ahead with planned domestic and Euro-issues despite the decision earlier this week by Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), the telecommunications monopoly, to postpone its planned Dollars 1bn Euro-issue, the company chairman said, Reuter reports from New Delhi. 'We are going to place in the market shares valued at Rs30bn. Half of it will be in the domestic market and the rest in the international market,' said Mr SK Manglik, ONGC's chairman. State-owned ONGC, one of Asia's largest oil exploration firms, was converted into a public limited company on February 1. Formed in 1959, it employs 48,000 and has assets of Rs89.4bn. The company made a record net profit of Rs20bn in 1993-94, a 153 per cent increase over the previous year. It produced 24.21m tonnes of crude during the year. Mr Manglik said the company hoped to make its domestic issue around June or July. 'We are thinking of going in for the international GDR (Global Depositary Receipt issue) in the latter part of the year,' he said. 'As of today, we have no intention of changing our plan but we will be alive to the environment and keep a watch,' he said. 'After all, who expected VSNL, which is a very good company, to bomb like this?' he added. The VSNL Euro-issue of GDRs, certificates representing domestic equity, was to have been priced on Tuesday after roadshows around the world. However, the ambitious offering, riding on the back of India's economic liberalisation programme, fell victim to falling global interest in emerging markets after the US Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates. ONGC sources said the domestic price for a share was expected to be fixed around Rs140 to Rs150.</p>

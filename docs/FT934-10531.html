			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Danish sell-off confronts two obstacles - Hilary Barnes examines the politically troublesome privatisation of Tele Danmark Correction (published 8th November 1993) appended to this article. THE privatisation of Tele Danmark, the state-controlled monopoly telecommunications group, is proving politically troublesome and there are still no assurances it will go ahead successfully. The privatisation is due to begin in the first half of next year with the government aiming to reduce the state shareholding from 93.7 per cent to 51 per cent. The sale, open to both Danish and international investors, could raise between DKr2.5bn (Dollars 369m) to DKr3bn. Tele Danmark is a relatively new concern. It was created by merging three regional phone companies, Copenhagen Telephone, Jutland Telephone and Funen Telephone, with the state's telephone service, which controlled international communications traffic. The result of the merger is a group with a turnover of DKr15.6bn for 1992, pre-tax profits of DKr1.36bn, assets of DKr27.1bn and equity capital of DKr7.3bn. At the end of 1992 it employed 17,300, but rationalisation is bringing about a steady reduction in payroll. The regional phone companies enjoyed regional monopolies, but competed fiercely with each. An OECD study in 1990 found that both in terms of price to subscribers and quality of service Denmark was surpassed only by Iceland. Subsequent OECD comparative reports show Denmark may have slipped back a little on price to subscribers, but charges nevertheless remain among the lowest in Europe. Legislation for the sell-off is due to be presented to the Danish parliament before Christmas. There are, however, two potential obstacles to the sale. The first is a European Commission investigation into the terms of the proposed sell-off. There is a suspicion that the the way the privatisation is being structured - with the company effectively buying shares below market value and then selling them at a substantial profit - involves a hidden state subsidy. Mr Jorgen Stig Andersen, the civil servant at the Communications Ministry in charge of the telecommunications sector, says he believes that the Commission is satisfied with the answers the government has given and that the Commission will shortly give the green light to the privatisation. How will international investors will regard the company? The published equity capital gives the company an equity-to-assets ratio of 27 per cent. But its balance sheet does not include pension liabilities of DKr8bn. This is 'a bomb under Tele Danmark,' says Copenhagen-based American financial adviser, Mr Todd Johnson. Under US accounting law, Mr Johnson points out, pension liabilities must be included in the balance sheet. If this were applied to the Tele Danmark balance sheet the company's equity capital would be negative, he says. Although Denmark's regional telephone companies have been long dominated by the state, they include some private shareholders, some of whom have bought in recent years in the hope of making a profit on Tele Danmark's move into the private sector. Their continued presence among Tele Danmark's shareholders has proved a thorny problem for politicians. Earlier plans to privatise the group came to nothing because the government wished to retain a right in perpetuity to redeem the privately held shares at 125 per cent of par and to impose a dividend ceiling of 10 per cent. The proposals were not satisfactory for Tele Danmark, because on these terms it would not have been able to raise the capital it urgently needs to improve its financial position. In their place the government, deeply imbued with socialist principles, has come up with a complex scheme. This aims to provide Tele Danmark with new capital and at the same time stop existing private shareholders from profiting from the flotation. Tele Danmark is to buy the the 42.7 per cent stake the government is putting up for sale along with the privately-held shares in the company. It will redeem them at DKr170 per share, the market price of Tele Danmark on June 14 this year. The company will then write down its share capital by the value of the shares purchased and a new class of shares will be issued for the same nominal value as the value of the shares written down. The new shares will be classed as B shares. The B shares will then be sold to the public. But by effectively buying the shares for DKr170 and then selling then for DKr500 or more apiece, it has clearly opened the company to accusations of state financial assistance. The EC Commission's verdict is eagerly awaited on all sides. This is the fourth in a series on the privatisation of Europe's state telecommunications operators. Earlier articles appeared on October 11, 26 and 28. The next article in the series will appear on November 10.  --------------------------------------------------              TELE DANMARK (DKr bn)  --------------------------------------------------                                    1992     1991  -------------------------------------------------- Net turnover                      15.58    15.28 Profit before financial items      2.05     1.93 Pre-tax profit                     1.36     1.15 Net profit                         0.01     0.64 Assets                            27.10    27.65 Equity capital                     7.32     6.50 Share capital                      1.31     1.16 Investment                         2.65     2.81 Workforce                        17,300   18,077  -------------------------------------------------- CORRECTION The 1992 net profits of Tele Danmark were DKr0.916bn and not DKr0.01bn, as wrongly stated on Thursday.</p>

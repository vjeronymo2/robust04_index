			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SEC PROPOSES PENNY-STOCK CURBS  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission today proposed stiff new rules to  protect small investors from high-pressure sales tactics often used in the sale  of so-called penny stocks.  </P> <P> The commission voted 5 to 0 to propose requiring stockbrokers to obtain written  customer agreement and make a documented "suitability" determination before  completing the sale of such stocks in most cases.  </P> <P> Penny stocks are inexpensive securities sold over-the-counter. They are not  listed on any major stock exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ over-the-counter  system.  </P> <P> SEC staff members said the rule was deliberately crafted in a narrow way to  avoid hurting the ability of small companies to use the markets to raise  capital.  </P></p>

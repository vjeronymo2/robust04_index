			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Energy giants caught in quagmire  -The continuing turmoil in Canada's oil sector IMPERIAL Oil, Canada's biggest oil company, is set to take the knife to itself within a few days in some of the most radical surgery ever inflicted on a Canadian company. If the analysts are correct, Imperial, 70 per cent owned by Exxon of New York, will announce it is closing two, and possibly three, of its six refineries, eliminating a quarter of its 4,200 filling stations, and laying off more than 1,000 workers. Imperial's restructuring, and similar measures now under way at its arch-rival Petro-Canada, confirm that the turmoil enveloping the exploration and production side of Canada's oil industry for the past few years has now spread to the downstream refining and marketing sectors. The shakeout, in the form of acquisitions, asset disposals and partner buy-outs, is profoundly changing the shape of the Calgary-based oil and gas industry. The brunt of the blow is being felt by the integrated giants of the industry, such as Imperial, Petro-Canada and Shell Canada, which is 78 per cent owned by Royal Dutch Shell. Amoco's Canadian subsidiary is also struggling to digest its acquisition five years ago of Dome Petroleum, the crippled giant of the western Canadian industry. 'The big guys are toast and investing in them is not what you do for growth,' says Mr Verne Johnson, president of Lasmo Canada, a subsidiary of the UK-based oil and gas group. Narrowing operating margins and hefty writedowns have recently put all three of the integrated companies in the red. Imperial's CDollars 36m (USDollars 30.8m) operating loss last year was the first in its history. The pain is only partly due to the dip in oil and natural gas prices and weak demand at the pump. The protracted North American gas 'bubble' and a 10 per cent drop in sales of refined petroleum products over the past two years have probably hastened what was the inevitable. The recession has highlighted the high costs of maintaining a diverse portfolio of exploration and production properties, and a coast-to-coast retail network. 'What pays the bills are the discoveries (the integrated companies) made in the '50s and '60s,' Mr Johnson says. 'Their bureaucracies are not able to exploit the opportunities that remain.' The pace in the industry is being set by a band of smaller and more nimble operators. Headed by a new generation of entrepreneurs, they have snapped up the assets put on the block by the industry's giants. Unlike the bulk of US independents, many of the aggressive newcomers are publicly listed, giving them wide exposure to institutional and retail investors. Corporate finance has become a fast-growing business in Calgary. Among the names that are mentioned most often are Chauvco Resources, Morgan Hydrocarbons, Morrison Petroleums, Tarragon Oil &amp; Gas and Canadian Natural Resources. While the big energy companies are looking for ways to slim down, Chauvco, for instance, boosted oil and gas liquids output by 72 per cent in the first nine months of last year. Chauvco's cash-flow and earnings doubled. These companies get their headstart from lower costs. According to the federal government's Petroleum Monitoring Agency, junior oil and gas producers had operating costs of CDollars 26.93 per cubic metre in 1990, compared with CDollars 38.74 per cu metre for the senior companies. The seniors' costs climbed by 6.6 per cent that year, compared with 2.9 per cent for the juniors. Many of the newcomers are foreign-controlled. Despite lingering restrictions on foreign investment in the Canadian energy industry, the stake of US, European and Far East investors has risen markedly. Mr Johnson says Lasmo is still looking 'quite greedily' to buy light-oil properties. The trend throughout the industry is towards specialisation. On the upstream side, producers are increasingly concentrating on specific products, such as conventional oil, heavy oil or natural gas. Mr Jack Pelletier, a corporate finance consultant in Calgary, notes that many companies are also moving away from the joint ventures which were popular in the 1960s and 1970s, preferring to operate a smaller number of properties themselves. In the overcrowded refining and retail businesses, the most successful companies are those putting the emphasis on a regional rather than national strategies. They include Ultramar in eastern Canada, Suncor in Ontario and Chevron in the west. Last week, Pay Less Holdings, a small company which has waged a fierce petrol price war on Vancouver Island, paid well above prevailing market prices for Canadian Turbo, another regional marketer in the west. Mr Frank Sayer, president of Sayer Securities, a Calgary firm which specialises in the oil and gas industry, says that 'changes in the downstream are just starting to match what's been happening in the upstream sector'. Mr Sayer predicts that it will be another year or two before the deal-making begins to subside.</p>

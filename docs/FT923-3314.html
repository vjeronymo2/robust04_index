			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Property: The appeal of working in your garden A NEW breed of small garden buildings has allowed an increasing number of Britain's self-employed businessmen and women to stop running their companies from the back room and decamp into the garden. Former England cricket team tour manager Peter Lush gets down to work in his 5.5m diameter round garden room with its conical thatched roof developing the sports marketing company he runs from home. He moved into the building, which cost him Pounds 11,000 plus VAT, two years ago. Not only did this free an upstairs room in his house in Sonning near Reading, but it also gave him a lot more space and an interesting and unusual building in which to work. 'It was a wonderful move,' he said. 'I had looked at all sorts of garden buildings and this one immediately appealed. I have electricity and a phone. It is very warm in winter, and in summer I cool it by means of a ceiling fan. It is surrounded on most sides by glass so I have an outlook onto our large garden and all the peace I could want.' Lush's thatched office was supplied by Thatching Advisory services of Wokingham, who sell the thatched round houses in several different sizes. 'More frequently we sell open-sided versions of these buildings for use as summer houses and tennis club pavilions but I also have one in my garden that I have used as my office for the past three years,' said managing director Bob West. At Godstone in Surrey, Miles Pinniger runs his lighting design and advisory company from a 12 ft by 18 ft semi-portable building by Homelodge of Winchester, who adapted it specially for his 6ft 7in frame. Pinniger installed the building in his garden three years ago when he found he was outgrowing his cottage home. The prefabricated one-room building, crowned by a small clock tower, has enough room for himself and the designer and part-time secretary who work for him. 'The building is sturdy and well-finished. There is no doubt that it adds to the value of the property, especially as it has electricity and phone lines. But if we should move and a future owner decide to have it removed, this is quite easy as it was erected in two days,' Pinniger said. 'It can also be lifted quite easily by crane. Eventually I am hoping to buy some land at the rear of our garden. I plan to have the Homelodge lifted over the hedge into the field.' A Homelodge building like Pinniger's costs Pounds 11,150 plus VAT erected, carpeted and decorated. If such a building is within five metres of the house however it qualifies as an extension and planning consent may be required. Before you instal an office in your garden seek advice from your local planners. A Surrey woman who installed a prefabricated garden building with the intention of running a retail business from her garden fell foul of both local planning regulations and her neighbours' desire to protect their outlook. No such problem confronted retired professor Graham Solomon, when, he installed his 12ft diameter octagonal summer house with cedar shingle roof 30 ft from his house in his garden in the East Sussex village of Waldron. He saw the Jubilee model from Amdega of Darlington at the Chelsea Flower Show, and immediately realised it was the solution to his problem of an overcrowded study in his house which was overflowing with books and journals. Amdega installed bookshelves when they erected the building and the total cost, including VAT, was Pounds 9,500. 'For me it has proved the perfect solution,' Prof. Solomon said. 'I have power and electric storage heaters so I can work out there all the year round. 'I spend most of my time writing and rewriting text boooks, so the solitary situation of the building suits me well. I have a portable phone which I take with me if I think I shall need it, or if I am expecting a call. If I want complete solitude I leave it in the house.

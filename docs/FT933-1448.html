			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: West's support urged MR Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, yesterday suggested that industrialised nations should give bilateral financial support to Russia in anticipation of the IMF resuming its lending. He told a press conference that the Fund was working continuously with the Russian authorities to get their economic reform programme back on track. The political crisis of the past week was a reason for working still more closely with the Russians, he said. However, the IMF could not at this stage provide Russia with financial support because of the deterioration in Russia's economic policies and performance and the disruption of the economic reforms agreed with the Fund in the summer. At the end of June, the IMF provided Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 974m) of support for Russia under its new temporary systemic transformation facility. A further transfer of Dollars 1.5bn is due under the STF, while talks have been held on providing more support through a stand-by arrangement. Mr Camdessus yesterday indicated that this money would not be forthcoming before early next year. He stressed that the IMF support was not determined by the political calendar or political events in Russia. Developments in Russia will be discussed by finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations tomorrow. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary and G7 host, disclosed yesterday the Mr Boris Fyodorov, the Russian finance minister, would join the group for part of the discussions. Mr Bentsen said the US would like to see Russia obtaining the second Dollars 1.5bn of the STF money from the IMF this year, provided it was able to get its reform programme back on track. Mr Camdessus's suggestion that industrial countries should consider interim finance received a fairly cool response at the US Treasury. A senior Treasury official said he thought it was unlikely that the industrial countries would provide new finance to Russia in anticipation of IMF loans. Reuter adds from Washington: The US Senate last night approved a 1994 foreign aid funding bill containing Dollars 2.5bn for the former Soviet states after linking aid to Russia to withdrawal of its troops from the Baltics. The Dollars 12.5bn bill, passed by 88-10, must now be reconciled with a previously passed House measure before being sent to President Bill Clinton for his signature.</p>

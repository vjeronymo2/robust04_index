Fernandez de Cossio made  this statement to the Mexican press when asked about the  situation in Chiapas State. PRENSA LATINA reported that the  Cuban diplomat in Mexico said that the Chiapas State incident is  strictly a domestic matter and that the Cuban Government  supports all efforts being made to find a peaceful solution to  the problem. Regarding specific charges aimed at linking Cuba  with the so-called Zapatist Army of National Liberation [EZLN],  Fernandez de Cossio said that they are groundless. The  ambassador said that those making these charges only want to  cast a shadow on the relations between Mexico and Cuba, adding  that, for the longest time, these relations have been based on  the principle of non-intervention.</p>

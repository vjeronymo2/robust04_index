			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [``msl/DW''-signed report: ``Bomb Threat Against Israeli </F> Embassy'']    [Excerpt] Bonn -- A large area near the Israeli Embassy in  Bonn has been sealed off for several days following bomb threats  against Israeli institutions. German security authorities have  been informed of Palestinian groups planning terror attacks on  the embassy.    There is ``very serious evidence'' of possible bomb attacks  ``by Hizballah'' on Israeli targets in Germany, a police  spokesman said in Bonn yesterday. He did, however, not indicate  whether the threats came from the pro-Iranian Hizballah  operating from South Lebanon or from another group. A terror  commando is said to have already entered Germany.    The Israeli Embassy itself has not received any threats.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils strong Oil majors, particularly Shell Transport, performed strongly as investors bought on hopes of asset disposals. There was also a feeling that US investors, who have been keenly picking up domestic bulk chemicals shares with a view to cyclical recovery, are now moving further afield. About 20 per cent of Shell's asset base is in chemicals, although NatWest Securities argues that most of the company's exposure is in Europe where the industry's problems are far from over. The shares gained 11 to 592p on turnover of 11m. BP, dragged up by the price of its US traded ADRs and its rival's perfomance, rose 7 1/2 to 316 1/2 p on hefty turnover of some 14m shares. HSBC moved ahead 19 to 606p in response to a strong Hong Kong market. Rothmans International improved 13 to 661p on the back of a steady dollar and a realisation that the company was not greatly exposed to US tobacco price wars. Turnover in international trading group Lonrho jumped to 12m on continued speculation of impending disposals and a strong metals sector. The shares gained 6 at 114p. One view is that South African group Gencor may wish to lift its stake in Lonrho's platinum mining interests in South Africa in which it currently holds a 27 per cent interest. Building materials group Redland improved 13 to 506p as UBS upgraded profits and earnings forecasts on the basis that the UK construction industry appears to be recovering faster than expected. The results season in the drinks sector got into preliminary swing with Greenalls Group reporting figures at the bottom end of market forecasts. The shares, which have performed well in recent weeks, declined 13 to 414p. Kleinwort Benson moved from a buy to a hold. Whitbread was the subject of profit-taking ahead of its results expected next week, the 'A' shares shedding 9 1/2 to 495p. Good figures from LVMH, the French luxury goods group, lifted Guinness 14 to 489p. The two companies have a 25 per cent cross-holding. Transport Development Group eased 8 to 241p after several brokers trimmed forecasts following a meeting with the company. UK airports operator BAA firmed 5 to 755p after reporting a 4.8 per cent increase in traffic for the month of April compared with the same period a year earlier. A positive annual meeting boosted TI Group and the shares improved 12 to 337p. A warning of an operating loss for the first half at Simon Engineering sent the shares tumbling 26 1/2 to 73 1/2 p. Recommendations from Salomon Bros and Smith New Court were said to have been the reason for a rise in BICC of 11 to 375. A sense of relief greeted results from Body Shop, the anticipated fall in profits to Pounds 21.5m from Pounds 25.2m at the top end of forecasts. The shares, which have underperformed recently, rose 6 1/2 to 204 1/2 p. Edible oils group Acatos and Hutcheson jumped 8 to 219p in late trading as it was announced that a major shareholder had sold its entire 16.8 per cent stake.</p>

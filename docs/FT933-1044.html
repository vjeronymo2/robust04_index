			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Union faces pressure to support Labour leader: GMB stance on voting reforms seen as crucial PRESSURE was mounting last night on the GMB general union to abandon its opposition to plans by the Labour leader, Mr John Smith, to reform his party's links with the trade unions. Mr Smith indicated yesterday he was confident of victory at next week's Brighton conference, but senior officials said he still faced the threat of defeat unless one or more of the leading unions reversed their opposition. With the conference emerging as a crucial power struggle between the party's so-called modernisers and traditionalists, the dispute over the union link also threatens to spill over into a row about economic policy. Party officials said yesterday that two-thirds of the constituency parties had backed Mr Smith's proposed one-member, one-vote system for the selection of parliamentary candidates. That means Mr Smith might just scrape home if unions such as the Nupe public service union, UCW postal workers and Usdaw shopworkers all wriggle out of conference commitments to reject the reform, and back him. But for Mr Smith to avoid a humiliating defeat he probably requires a large union like the GMB to support him or abstain. 'There is a lot of unease among senior union officials about what John Edmonds (the union's leader) is doing on one-member, one-vote,' said one GMB official. Mr Edmonds says the difference between his union and the party leadership is now 'no more than a constitutional tiff' but he is not prepared to offer anything more than discussions about a last-minute compromise. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU, also said there would no 'horse-trading, no smoke-filled rooms, and no nudge nudge' on one-member, one-vote. But the TGWU may indirectly aid the Smith camp by not backing any motion against one-member, one-vote except its own, in which case all such motions may fall, making it easier for Mr Smith to impose a solution. On economic policy, the decision by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, to abandon the spending and tax policies on which Labour fought the 1992 general election faces attack in Brighton from union leaders and leading left-wing MPs. But Mr Brown, who yesterday rejected any attempt to commit a future Labour chancellor to higher spending and borrowing, intends to pre-empt his critics with a detailed rebuttal of charges that he has abandoned the party's principles. Party officials said all the main unions had given their backing to his revamped economic strategy earlier this summer. Mr Smith's aides said the initial returns from the constituency parties on the one-member, one-vote plan showed that he could count on the support of around two-thirds of their votes after Wednesday's debate. The constituencies, however, hold only 30 per cent of the overall votes at conference, with the remainder held by unions. The Labour leader appears determined not to allow the issue to provoke a public slanging match with the leading union leaders. Union reform is test of Smith's leadership, Page 8</p>

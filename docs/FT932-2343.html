			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Efim liquidators reportedly close to sale of SIV The liquidators of Efim, the Italian state industrial holding company, are reported to be close to selling SIV, its glassmaking business, for L150bn (Pounds 70m) to Pilkington and Techint Finanziaria, controlled by the Argentine-based Rocca family, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Pilkington said last night it had not had any confirmation from the liquidators that its offer, made 50:50 with Techint, had been accepted. SIV, a supplier of glass to the car industry, has turnover close to L550bn but is thought to be loss-making.</p>

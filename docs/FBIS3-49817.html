			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Jan 16 (TANJUG) -- Fierce inter-Moslem  fighting continues in the autonomous province of western Bosnia  (APWB) between supporters of provincial leader Fikret Abdic and  forces loyal to Bosnian Moslem hardline leader Alija  Izetbegovic. Although Izetbegovic's troops are attacking  western Bosnia from all weapons at their disposal, the western  Bosnia defence lines have remained intact, the local news agency  ZBIA reports on Sunday and adds that there are casualties on  both sides. Strongly opposed to the proclamation of autonomy of  western Bosnia four months ago, Izetbegovic has ordered troops  loyal to him to restore his rule there by force.    Bosnian Serb military sources say that Moslems and Croats  are  mercilessly fighting each other along the Lasva, Rama and  Neretva rivers in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  fiercest fighting has been reported in the areas of Vitez, Novi  Travnik and Busovaca in central Bosnia, and at Blagaj near  Mostar in Herzegovina, with each side suffering heavy  casualties. Serb military sources say that no major changes  have been reported on the Moslem-Croat frontline.    The Zagreb-based Croatian radio confirms reports about major  fighting near Novi Travnik on Saturday, where it says Moslems  shelled Croat positions. The same source reports that ten Croat  refugees, fleeing before the Moslem terror in Bugojno in central  Bosnia, arrived to the Croat town of Livno in the south-west by  passing through Serb-held Kupres. The refugees say that about  3,000 Croats and 500 Serbs are still detained in Bugojno which  the Moslems took over from the Croats last autumn.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Clinton seeks Gatt fast-track extension THE US administration asked Congress yesterday to move swiftly to grant it eight more months to complete the Uruguay Round of world trade talks under an extension of the vital 'fast-track' negotiating authority. The request would allow President Bill Clinton to notify Congress no later than December 15 that he intends to enter a Uruguay Round agreement before April 15 1994. In giving 'fast-track' authority, Congress must vote for or against a Gatt package as a whole and not try to amend it. Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said in Brussels: 'This is excellent news for the Uruguay Round. . . The time allowed is sufficiently long for the remaining negotiations to take place but sufficiently short for it to put the necessary pressure on all concerned.' While the eight-month extension request was expected, there was surprise that the White House was seeking a 'clean' fast-track bill with no amendments. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, had previously indicated no objection to attaching additional tough 'market-opening' measures. But an official said that, 'given the urgency of the Round,' the administration decided the fast-track request should 'not be encumbered' by more controversial legislation.</p>

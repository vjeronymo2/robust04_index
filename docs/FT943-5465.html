			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Profit-taking trims rises after strong week Corporate profit-taking ahead of this month's interim book closing supported volume and the Nikkei 225 average, caught between buying and selling, finally closed almost flat, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index rose 10.90 to 20,653.83 after moving within a narrow band between 20,615.52 and 20,675.54. Dealers supported telecoms-linked shares, while domestic institutions bought steels. However, arbitrage-linked selling and profit-taking eroded most of the gains. Volume totalled 359m shares against 341m. The Topix index of all first section stocks inched up 1.23 to 1,641.14, and the Nikkei 300 by 0.15 to 299.37. Advances led declines by 514 to 440 with 216 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.10 to 1,340.46. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, added Y4 to Y385, a new high for the year, and NKK gained Y2 to Y294. Kawasaki Steel, however, fell Y4 to Y430. Contractors were sought by overseas investors. Obayashi gained Y10 to Y758 and Shimizu Y40 to Y1,100. Telecoms stocks were higher on purchases by dealers. NTT gained Y10,000 to Y930,000 and NEC Y40 to Y1,250. DDI, on the second section, fell Y2,000 to Y998,000 on foreign selling. Suzuki Motor rose Y20 to Y1,260 on reports that the company will supply Fuji Heavy Industries with vehicles manufactured in Europe. Nippon Shoji, the drug wholesaler and manufacturer, ended unchanged at Y1,440 in spite of the government's suspension of its production facilities for 105 days starting Monday. Mr John Wilson, pharmaceutical analyst at James Capel, said the suspension was damaging to the company's earnings, and the stock, on a p/e ratio of 24, had still further to fall. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 22.32 to 22,899.37 in volume of 85.9m shares. Roundup Profit-taking also affected much of the region after firm performances during the week. KUALA LUMPUR was mixed on profit-taking after a strong week as investors shrugged off the detention in Thailand of Ashaari Muhammad, leader of the banned Islamic group Al Arqam. Prices fell sharply a week ago on rumours of Ashaari's return to his native Malaysia. The composite index rose 4.54 to 1,160.88, for a 4.4 per cent rise on the week. Ekran, the builder, soaring MDollars 2.50 or 12.4 per cent to MDollars 22.70 after winning Securities Commission approval for a bonus issue. BANGKOK closed higher on buying of blue chips, led by communications and banks, in spite of occasional profit-taking during the day. The SET index closed 13.22 higher at 1,539.06, up 6.1 per cent on the week, in heavy turnover of almost Bt15bn. Cathay Finance, making its debut, finished at Bt82.50, compared with its offer price of Bt66, but down from the Bt90-95 at which it had traded in the grey market. WELLINGTON remained at a five month high, helped by a buoyant forestry sector, and the NZSE-40 capital index ended 11.73 up at 2,187.75 in volume of NZDollars 67.2m. TAIPEI reversed early losses to close slightly above the 7,000-point resistance level as plastics regained strength to lead the market after consolidation. The weighted index closed up 36.48 at 7,010.63, for a 1.9 per cent rise the week. Turnover shrank to TDollars 68.59bn from Thursday's TDollars 99.61bn. SEOUL closed lower in moderate trading following three straight days of advances, although some primary blue chips continued their rally. The composite index lost 4.71 to 944.52, for a 0.7 per cent fall on the week. HONG KONG finished slightly higher after a day of slow trade as investors were sidelined ahead of the weekend and key US non-farm payroll data. The Hang Seng Index rose 10.66 to 9,901.56, for a 5.3 per cent rise on the week. SINGAPORE finished mixed with the Straits Times Industrials index losing 6.22 to 2,330.61, for a 1.6 per cent rise on the week. Cycle &amp; Carriage lost 30 cents to SDollars 11.90 after an announcement denying rumours it was in discussions to buy a prime commercial building.</p>

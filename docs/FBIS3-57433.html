			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Oleg Falichev report: "The Fall `93 Draft Was Very </F> Difficult. What Will Its Extension Be Like?"]    [Text] There is hardly any sense in discussing again in  detail the difficult situation among the troops due to the  shortage of personnel. Much has already been written about  officers doing sentry duty, about the inordinate physical and  psychological burdens leading to incidents, accidents, and human  fatalities... The prime cause of this lies in many ways in the  hitches in the induction of citizens into service and the rapid  increase in legal nihilism among the population. Finally, there  is the fact that some provisions of the new Law "On Military  Duty and Military Service" are not fully operating.    All the same, until recently there was no sufficiently full  and generalized factual picture of the 1993 draft for Russia as  a whole. The draft's final results were recently compiled in  the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff. What do  these results suggest?    Around 70 percent of the planned number of draftees were  sent  into the Armed Forces and the military formations of other  ministries and departments. That is to say, the draft quota was  fulfilled by roughly two-thirds. A considerable number of  citizens received deferments or exemptions on lawful grounds, so  to speak. For example, 50 percent of the draftees [as published]  were granted deferments to continue their education, 3 percent  for family reasons, and 4 percent to work in the spheres of art,  education, or health. But there are also those who found  themselves at odds with the law and simply dodged the draft.  There were 70,000 such people in 1993. Criminal proceedings  have been instituted in 1,531 cases, more than 90 persons have  been sentenced, and 20,053 have been fined...    Figures are dispassionate. But imagine 70,000 unoccupied  combat posts, weapon operators' positions, and chartrooms...  How hard it is for the troops to fulfill their appointed tasks  and maintain combat readiness in such conditions. But, of  course, this is not the first year that such a picture has been  observed. Perhaps this is why the government was forced to take  an extreme measure: to extend the fall-93 draft into the new  year. It was decided to conduct it in two phases. The first,  main phase, was completed by 1 January 1994. The second is  linked with the Russian Federation president's decision on  drafting into military service all citizens of induction age  studying in elementary and secondary vocational education  establishments, including those doing final courses. They must  be issued with secondary education certificates early, so as to  be inducted and sent to join the troops by 10 March this year.  This in turn will help somewhat to compensate for the release  of enlisted men and NCO's from two service periods at once in  the fall of 1993.    This is a forced measure, let us stress. After all, in 1993  we managed to induct fewer than 22 percent (!) of the total  number of citizens on the military register. Is that a lot or a  little? By way of comparison let us state that, for example, in  Germany 50 percent of total induction resources are drafted into  the Armed Forces and a further 25 percent perform alternative  service. In France the figure is 58 percent, in Italy -- 85  percent, in Spain -- 75 percent, in Turkey -- 84 percent. It is  not surprising that the manpower levels of our troops today are  barely more than one-half of requirements.    Alas, the quality characteristics -- including the state of  health -- of the young replacement forces being sent into the  troops and fleets have not improved. The number of persons  unsuitable for military service for medical reasons has grown  from 5 percent in 1988 to 22 percent in 1993. Why?  "Unfortunately, the state has neglected this question in recent  years," Major General of the Medical Service V. Zolotov, chief  of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Central Commission  of Military Doctors, stated bluntly. "It is not surprising that  during the induction process more and more drug addicts and glue  sniffers are found among young people...." Not to mention the  decline in educational standards and the increased number of  convicts....    A situation has come about where the military themselves  first and foremost are obliged to tackle the draft. Many  citizens have formed the stereotypical idea that is a military  prerogative. But it is not the Ministry of Defense or the  General Staff which carry out the draft but local government  bodies. The military commissariat officials of are only members  of the induction commissions. I mention this because  maintaining the strength of the Armed Forces is a statewide, not  a departmental concern. In this respect there are examples of  good work by local military directorate organs and  administration heads. Colonel General M. Kolesnikov, chief of  the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, for example,  singled out for special commendation the military commissariats  of Udmurtia, Bashkortostan, Yakutia, Stavropol and Maritime  Krays, and Vologda, Kamchatka, Kurgan and Kaliningrad Oblasts.  The draft is less well conducted in the republics of the North  Caucasus, Tatarstan, and Kemerovo, Chelyabinsk, and a number of  other oblasts.    Of course, today contract-based service is resolving to a  considerable extent the problem of maintaining the manpower  levels of the Army and Navy. Some 120,000 contract-based  servicemen are already serving among the troops. But so far  this has enabled the manning levels of units to be increased by  only 10 percent. The Russian Federation president's edict "On  Recruiting Citizens for Military Service in the Russian  Federation Armed Forces on a Contract Basis in 1994" was signed  18 January 1994. Under this edict the Russian Army is granted  the possibility of accepting a further 150,000 people for  military service on contract. The corresponding funds for this  in 1994 are also allocated. In the past, for example, 6 billion  rubles has been allocated for contract-based servicemen.    Incidentally, about money. It is becoming increasingly  difficult to come by, although there are quite a lot of people,  it turns out, who wish to serve on a contract basis: There are  thousands of application forms lying on military commissariat  desks. Hence, in view of the difficult economic situation in  the country, the Ministry of Defense has submitted a proposal to  the Russian Federation Council of Ministers not only to reduce  the Armed Forces but also to cut their table of organization.  The T/O had already been reduced by 500,000 in 1991-1992. The  reduction process is proceeding now, so to speak, ahead of  schedule by 350,000. Right now the Armed Forces' T/O is over 2  million. All these measures, and also the replacement of a  number of military positions by civilians, are expected to  resolve the problem of manning levels in the Armed Forces by the  end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995. Col. Gen. Kolesnikov  stressed that by that time manning levels could stand at 90-95  percent. By that time it looks as though optimum numerical  levels will finally be established. That does depend, however,  on what tasks the state sets for the Armed Forces.    One last point. The figures for the 1993 draft provide food  for thought on many questions raised by our stormy times. These  include: What will be the Russian Army's social makeup in the  future? Does the state have sufficient funds to maintain its  strength on a contract basis? Will it be possible to maintain  the prestige of military service among young people and in the  country as a whole? Difficult questions which, obviously, only  time will answer. But we must all reflect on them together.</p>

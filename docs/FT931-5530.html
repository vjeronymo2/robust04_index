			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Branson and the bounds of silence: Confidentiality clauses have limits If Mr Richard Branson, head of Virgin Atlantic Airways, is debating whether to sign a pledge of silence over BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign as part of a final settlement of the airlines' bitter dispute, he could do worse than talk to Mr Freddie Laker, founder of the now defunct Laker Airways. As part of the settlement terms of his US anti-trust lawsuit against BA in 1984 over its campaign against Laker's Skytrain, he agreed to be bound by a confidentiality clause never to talk about the affair in public again. Nine years later, industry friends say he still regrets the decision. Mr Branson says he is happy to agree with BA not to rake over the past, but is understandably nervous about signing away his right to defend the airline if it comes under attack over the row with BA in the media. The attempt to silence Mr Branson and Virgin staff is said to be the only outstanding issue between the two companies. BA has offered a Pounds 9m cash settlement and a signed commitment not to indulge in any further anti-competitive practices. 'In high-profile settlements, confidentiality clauses are the norm,' says Mr John Wright, a litigation partner with City solicitors Warner Cranston, 'certainly in any case which is a matter of public record, or where a professional or a company's reputation is at stake.' Dr Karl Mackie, director of the Centre for Dispute Resolution, an industry-backed organisation dedicated to resolving commercial disputes by mediation and conciliation, says they are particularly common in cases 'where there is a risk of commercial damage to a business reputation at a future date if the issues are aired again'. Frequently, they form part of a more general agreement that all the terms of a settlement should remain secret. 'In most settlements of disputes there is usually some restriction about what can and cannot be said by the parties. It's not uncommon for that to include a restriction on commenting on the underlying dispute,' says Mr Robert Anderson, a partner of City solicitors Lovell White Durrant. Lawyers point out, however, that the current talks between Virgin and BA do not constitute a settlement. The dispute was settled when BA apologised in the High Court and agreed to pay Pounds 610,000 damages and Virgin's costs, thought to be about Pounds 1.6m. There is no outstanding litigation between the two companies, only the threat of possible legal action in the US. 'What they are negotiating now is effectively a new commercial agreement because it is concerned with their future commercial relationship,' Mr Wright says. The confidentiality clause would be a crucial element of the new contract. The terms of the clause itself are fairly standard and often signed by senior executives when leaving companies. Mr Branson cannot mention the 'dirty tricks' campaign again unless Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, agrees, or unless the High Court permits it. A standard confidentiality clause would also include a penalty for breaching it. Without one, the clause would carry no weight. In the BA case, lawyers suggest, a possible sanction might be for BA automatically to recoup its Pounds 9m if Mr Branson breaks his word. BA might also be able to obtain a court injunction for breach of the agreement, thus preventing Mr Branson from making further reference to the dispute. Alternatively, lawyers add, it could sue him for any damage to its commercial reputation caused by reviving the affair. The knowledge that breach of a confidentiality clause could result in fresh litigation means that pledges of silence are rarely broken. But would the courts uphold this particular attempt to stop discussion of a matter of public interest? Mr Branson has one possible defence to any attempt to obtain a court injunction, lawyers indicate. He could argue that breaking his silence was in the public interest. Mr Branson might also note that if there were further instances of dirty tricks by BA, despite its assurances, he might be entitled to argue in court that he was no longer bound by the agreement and was thus free to make any reference to past events he chose. So while the immediate effect of signing a pledge of silence might seem draconian, it will not necessarily affect his ability to defend himself or Virgin in the future. 'Some people may see it as gagging,' Mr Wright says, 'but as a lawyer I don't. They are free to enter into this agreement or not as they wish. It's all about freedom of contract.'</p>

According to the regional electoral  commission, only 12.5 per cent of the electorate went to the  polls by 15:00, local time, on Sunday (elections are considered  to be carried out if at least 25 per cent of the electorate  participates in them).    Only nine per cent of registered voters went to the polling  stations in the regional centre where the bulk of voters live.    Taking into account that there is foul weather in  Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy (strong cold wind), the electoral  commission granted a right to all the aged to vote at home where  members of the electoral commission come with balloting paper  boxes. The commission has not recorded for the time being any  incidents or election violations.    Servicemen are voting at city polling stations for the first  time (earlier, they voted at their units). Regrettably, many  soldiers and sailors went to the city for a walk but do not go  to polling stations.    Their argument is reasonable enough: It is difficult to make  a choice right away if you arrived to serve on the Kamchatka  Peninsula quite recently from another region. Besides, there  was no time to follow the election campaign.    Orenburg -- a total of six per cent of registered voters  went  to the polls in the Orenburg region two hours after the opening  of polling stations, and the figure stood at 15-21 per cent in  the Sorochinskiy, Dombarovskiy, Krasnogvardeyskiy and  Aleksandrovskiy districts.    Chairman of the regional electoral commission Yuriy Andreyev  told ITAR-TASS that he is confident that "the elections to the  regional legislature will be held in all 47 constituencies".    Chita -- the turnout at the elections to the Chita regional  council is very low this Sunday. According to information  received by 14:00, local time, voting is active only in several  countryside districts where between 40 and 50 per cent of voters  went to the polls.    Urban residents are in no hurry to vote. In Chita, for  instance, only 15 per cent of the electorate participated in the  polls by 14:00, while in the city of Krasnokamensk -- only 11  per cent.    The situation is quite different in the Aginsky Buryat  Autonomous Area which is also holding elections to the Chita  regional and area councils. Over 40 per cent of voters went to  the polls there by 14:00, local time.    Smolensk -- the lowest turnout at the local elections was  registered in the regional centre by 10:00. The local  administration spared no effort to open snack bars and to stage  entertainment shows at polling stations.    This notwithstanding, voters are in no hurry to participate  in voting. All in all, 820 polling stations opened in the  Smolensk region on Sunday for the elections to the local council.</p>

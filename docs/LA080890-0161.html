			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAMES BOND RIGHTS UP FOR AUCTION  </P> <P> The owner of the exclusive rights to novelist Ian Fleming's James Bond  character is putting the super-spy on the auction block after a long run of  movie hits that has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, it was reported  today.  </P> <P> Variety, the entertainment weekly, said the decision was made by veteran film  producer Albert Broccoli because revenues from the "007" films have been  slipping.  </P> <P> The latest film, "License to Kill," released last year, cost $30 million to  make and has grossed only $16 million in domestic theatrical rentals so far.  </P> <P> Variety described the 81-year-old Broccoli's decision to "protect and  modernize" his franchise on James Bond as a "bloodless coup" within the MGM/UA  empire, which has made all but one of the 17 James Bond productions.  </P></p>

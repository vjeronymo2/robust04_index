			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Johny Lahure, minister of social security, </F> sports, and youth: "What the DP Election Program Does not  Mention"]    [Text] The DP [Democratic Party] election program states  that "the government and its administrations have to confine  themselves to their core tasks." The DP's goal was "to cleanse  the welfare state and to reconstruct it on a more solid  foundation".    In order to achieve this, "more flexibility and a  differentiation of jobs are needed in the job market," and "the  entire retirement benefits system should be subjected to a  critical analysis" and "more selectiveness must be applied in  the area of health insurance plans as well." That means that "a  return to real necessities and a resolute curbing of any abuse  are absolutely essential."  <H5>  How To Cleanse the Welfare State </H5>   The DP has not yet answered the question of what this  "different welfare state", this "other model of social  solidarity" should look like.    Should the legal minimum wage be lowered or even completely  abolished and the unemployment protection be reduced?    Will the index be called into question? Or will retirement  benefits and pensions no longer be indexed to the price and wage  development when the DP election program talks of "bounced  checks"? In Parliament, the leader of the DP group has denied  any such intentions of his party. But what else do the general  statements of the DP platform mean? Or has the leader of the DP  group already distanced himself from the DP election program?    It would be a welcome development if the DP, as the party  "with new ideas," would tell its voters the plain truth before  12 June.  <H5>  Health Care Expenses </H5>   In the paper JOURNAL, at least, the DP has given us a first  taste of its actual intentions and begun to lift the veil. The  health policy spokesman of the DP, who is traded as the DP  candidate for the post of minister of health as well, examines  the constantly rising health care expenses in a series of  newspaper articles and suggests drastic cost-cutting measures.    In his view, the state and the health insurances should  continue to pay but should beware of meddling too much in the  health care system. After all, hospitals and physicians are the  ones who know best what is good for patients.  <H5>  Patients To Foot the Bill </H5>   The DP health policy spokesman further demands:    -- abolition of the third payer    -- take-over of all small risks by patients    -- the introduction of a financial contribution from  patients  for hospital and laboratory fees    -- a limitation of the cost reimbursement to a maximum  amount  per year or even the establishment of an annual amount  (franchise) up to which there will be no reimbursement of costs.    Those who wish to insure the remaining risks should rely on  a private health insurance.  <H5>  DP for Two-Class Medical Care </H5>   The above-mentioned DP spokesman consequently suggests  restoring the two-class health care and to divide patients into  two camps: on one side those who can still afford medical  treatment, and on the other side those who, for financial  reasons, have to do without or are dependent on the support of  the "welfare offices."    Those who will vote for the DP on 12 June will know now what  to expect.    But who would vote for their own slaughter?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Juan Carlos Santoyo from </F> San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas]    [Text] [Announcer Jose Cardenas] We will soon contact Juan  Carlos Santoyo, our special envoy in San Cristobal de las Casas,  Chiapas State, where Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis  arrived today after attending a meeting yesterday at Los Pinos  Presidential Residence, where President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari met with cattle ranchers and small Chiapas landowners to  discuss land seizures.    Yesterday, the president was very clear when he called on  all  participants in the conflict to sit down and negotiate by Monday  at the latest and agree on a solution to all problems and  conflicts that could worsen the already tense situation in  Chiapas State.    Nevertheless, aside from the negotiations which will take  place on Monday and which have caught the attention of the  entire country, something else occurred today that has caused a  great stir. Francisco Martin Moreno, a journalist and the author  of "Mexico Negro" and "La Disculpa," today published on  EXCELSIOR's frontpage an article entitled: "The Reason I  Resigned: The Rules of the Political Game." In this article in  today's edition of EXCELSIOR, Francisco Martin Moreno, without  mentioning any names -- this must be made clear -- and always  writing in the first person, as if it were a letter, says: It  has been said that the commissioner for peace and reconciliation  in Chiapas State has decided to resign from his post for the  following reasons:    1. His peace efforts have been considered a factor of  political distortion, which affected the candidacy of Luis  Donaldo Colosio and could do the same to the candidacy of  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon.    2. It also has been said, according to Francisco Martin  Moreno's article, that he garnered more headlines than the PRI's  [Institutional Revolutionary Party] very own presidential  campaign, thereby hurting his party and Mexico. The author  continues by explaining that if this was indeed the case, it was  because events in Chiapas State monopolized the attention of all  Mexicans.    3. Nearly a month after he was considered a political  cadaver, he is still said to harbor ulterior motives in his  dialogue with the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army]. In  this connection, Martin Moreno explains in his article, which is  fiction [de ficcion], that it has been perversely said that the  peace commissioner resisted resigning in the hope that an  electoral triumph by the PRD [Party of the Democratic  Revolution] on 21 August would create the possibility of a  provisional presidency that would require special elections in  which the winner could be the peace commissioner. Martin Moreno  says that for this reason, the resignation was needed to  demonstrate that the peace commissioner in Chiapas was not  attempting to take advantage of a post-elections conflict.    The peace commissioner supposedly said, according to  Francisco Martin Moreno in this fictitous article, that on two  occasions he lost his candidacy for presidency by playing by the  rules of the game of Mexican politics, even though he cannot  stop asking himself why it was not him instead of Colosio in the  first place, and later, instead of Zedillo. For all of the  above reasons, says Francisco Martin Moreno's article in  EXCELSIOR, the peace commissioner reflected and arrived at the  conclusion of presenting his alleged resignation to avoid that  his name destabilize and encourage uncertainty within the PRI.    This is the end of a brief summary of the article that  appears today on EXCELSIOR's frontpage, which, as we said at the  beginning, Manuel Camacho Solis' name is never mentioned, even  though it is perfectly clear that it is a hypothetical  resignation, which Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace  and reconciliation in Chiapas State, should present.    This article is by Franciso Martin Moreno, who, you will  recall was among other things our consul in Barcelona.  Francisco Martin Moreno was a Finance and Public Credit  Secretariat official, until one day he decided to leave  everything for peace and do what he likes best -- to write and  investigate. He became a full-time investigator. This yielded,  among other important works, his book called "Mexico Negro,"  where he tells all about the black history of Mexico's oil, and  everything that Lazaro Cardenas' had to do with oil  expropriations and the oppressive actions of the so-called Seven  Sisters -- those companies that exerted pressure on the Mexican  Government from all sides -- both politically and economically.  "Mexico Negro" is a splendid book and a splendid bit of  investigative work carried out by Francisco Martin Moreno -- a  man who was a bureaucrat and became an intellectual.    Now, Francisco, a man I hold in high esteeem and respect  because he is my friend, published in the EXCELSIOR newspaper  this alleged resignation by Manuel Camacho, and all hell has  broken loose.    Juan Carlos, how are you?    [Santoyo] Good afternoon. You are right, an uproar has  been created, and naturally there is reaction. Of course,  Camacho Solis has reacted. He is here in San Cristobal de las  Casas, and today he met privately with San Cristobal Bishop  Samuel Ruiz. Since the start, the question was: What about the  letter? Was it his? In the beginning, he did not want to say  anything. Later, he said he did indeed have something to say,  and this is what he said:    [Begin Camacho recording] Someone told me about an article  that outlined my reasons for resigning. This person then asked  me: Are you resigning from the commission? The article,  however, was not signed by me, but by Francisco Martin Moreno, a  friend of mine. We are dealing with an editorial written by  someone else -- someone who, by the way, writes very well and is  an intelligent man.    I will comment on the article, because it may represent the  opinion of not only Francisco, but also of someone else. It is  very worrisome to me that at this stage there are still people  who are unaware of what is going on in the state of Chiapas.  The negotiation process in the state of Chiapas is being taken  lightly. [end recording]    [Santoyo] Camacho also said: The situation in Chiapas has  not  yet been settled. The deep-rooted causes of the problem are  still there. We are still not in a position to determine terms  for resuming the talks. Camacho, smiling and at ease, also  said: Casting doubts on the dialogue process would be  politically irresponsible.    [Begin Camacho recording] The problem has not been resolved.  The deep-rooted causes of the problem are still there. We  cannot even determine terms for resuming the talks. Casting  doubts on the dialogue process would constitute political  irresponsibility, which, fortunately, is not shared by any of  the country's political forces -- all of which have backed the  negotiations. This position also is not shared by Dr. Zedillo,  who summed up this subject and offered full support for the  negotiations process. Neither is this position shared by the  Catholic Church, which supports the efforts to resume the talks,  or intellectuals, or members of civilian society. Francisco's  opinion must be respected, as must every writer's opinion, but I  am concerned about such a cursory analysis of what is going in  Chiapas. [end recording]    [Santoyo] Camacho continued: First of all, let us see how  the  talks will be resumed. If we succeed in resuming the talks,  that would be good news for the entire country. Moreover, I  think this is the time to figure out what is truly important in  Mexico. Camacho said there are two basic concepts in Mexico:  first, to promote peace and uphold public opinion; and second,  to continue to nurture democracy. These two things go hand in  hand. I will continue to work on these things from my humble  home in San Cristobal de las Casas, Camacho concluded.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia's state mining chief forced to depart THE PRESIDENT of Bolivia's state mining corporation, Comibol, has been forced out in a surprise move by the Bolivian Government. No date has been set for the departure of Mr Alberto Ono Villegas, but his replacement has been named as Mr Marcelo Perez Monasterio, a former under-secretary in the foreign affairs ministry and president of the inter-American commerce and production committee. Mr Perez does not appear to have any previous experience of the mining industry. This undignified end to Mr Ono's ten-month tenure as Comibol president has been linked to continuing pressure from the World Bank. The bank recently forced Comibol to undertake an extensive redundancy programme by withholding a Dollars 22m credit intended for restructuring the corporation, part of a Dollars 35m credit committed to the modernisation of the Bolivian mining industry. The departure of Mr Ono, perceived by many to favour a slower pace of change than the World Bank was willing to put up with, combined with the latest round of redundancies, signals the beginning of the end for Comibol. Mr Perez is believed to be a committed free marketeer who is unlikely to stand in the way of what Bolivian mining unions are calling 'privatisation through the back door'. Comibol, at present employing about 6,000 workers, may soon number its staff in the low hundreds as it winds down its mining operations and concentrates on administrative joint ventures.</p>

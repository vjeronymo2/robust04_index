			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Clarke seeks radical rejig of police control PLANS FOR a radical reorganisation of the police, amounting to the virtual nationalisation of police authorities in England and Wales, are to be considered next week by a special cabinet committee chaired by Mr John Major. The proposals, produced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, have aroused strong dissent within the government and are vigorously opposed by local authorities and most chief constables. Mr Clarke's scheme would in effect abolish the current arrangements for police management, which balance local and national control. Government appointees and not local councillors would form the majority on police committees. Funding would be transferred wholesale to Whitehall in place of the current half-and-half arrangement. The number of police authorities in England and Wales would be reduced from the current 43, possibly to as few as 25. The Association of Chief Police Offices will this weekend hold an emergency conference to consider the proposals. It is almost certain to express reservations to the Home Office, with some members concerned at the constitutional implications of increasing the home secretary's powers to direct the police. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, is believed to oppose the plans, considering it undesirable to weaken local authorities further. A cabinet committee could not agree on the issue before Christmas, necessitating the prime minister's intervention. The associations representing the local authorities affected, both Labour and Tory-controlled, have written to the prime minister urging him to reject the proposed changes. Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-dominated Association of Metrpolitan Authorities, said: 'These proposals would virtually create a nationalised police force, run by unelected and unaccountable placemen, with budgets totally controlled by the government. This would be dreadful for the policing of our communities and for our democracy.' Under the existing so-called 'tripartite system', elected councillors fill two thirds of the places on police authorities with the other third going to magistrates. Of police funding, 51 per cent comes from central government and 49 per cent from local government. The government is calling on businesses to fund schemes aimed at cutting crime. Business and industrial leaders will be recruited to a new National Board for Crime Prevention, which will welcome ideas and funding from the private sector in what is hoped will be a fresh approach to tackling urban crime.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Care reform charter urged THE GOVERNMENT should develop comprehensive criteria for judging the success of this year's community care reforms as a matter of priority, the Commons health committee said yesterday. The committee recommends a community care charter as part of the Citizen's Charter initiative to provide 'an indication of the level and quality of service which citizens are entitled to expect'. It says the responsibilities of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, for ensuring community care success are 'substantially more extensive' than the government recognised when it responded to a previous health committee report in March this year. Then, the government stressed local authority responsibilities and said it had 'no direct management function'. But although the reforms have made local authorities the lead agencies for co-ordinating community care, the committee says the government had ignored Mrs Bottomley's statutory responsibility for personal social services. It calls for a 'more explicit recognition' of the government's responsibilities for ensuring that local authorities fulfil their tasks. The committee notes the view of voluntary organisations that their activities in the community care field were under strain because of financial pressures, including loss of funding from the government's Urban Programme, which is being phased out. A proposal that the committee should recommend 'withdrawal of the cuts in the Urban Programme in view of their impact on community care' was defeated only on the vote of Mrs Marion Roe, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee. It was likely, says the committee, that the new arrangements would lead to a shakeout of independent providers of residential and nursing-home care. This would be painful for home owners and could be traumatic for residents if they were uprooted. It calls for local authorities to be given support in managing reductions to minimise the impact on residents. The committee's call for a community care charter was generally well received in the care sector. But Mr Toby Harris, who chairs the Association of Metropolitan Authorities social services committee, said it would require a revolutionary change in government policies and guidance. 'These currently urge local authorities to conceal from potential users what the local authority believes to be their need for service,' he said.

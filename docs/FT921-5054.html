			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Kravchuk ends delay on move to free market MR Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, took his first decisive step towards the market after three months of hesitation yesterday, naming a reformer, Mr Volovymyr Lanovyi, as minister for the economy with a brief to prepare a programme of radical change. Government officials hinted that Mr Lanovyi's powers might be enhanced by also making him deputy prime minister and creating a special presidential economic reform team under his direction. Mr Lanovyi, who as minister for privatisation offered an ambitious privatisation package which was finally approved by parliament earlier this week, has the credentials and the ambition to become a Ukrainian version of Poland's Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, spearheading radical reforms. However, he could be hobbled by a lack of real authority and opposition within what remains a largely conservative cabinet. As minister for privatisation, Mr Lanovyi clashed with the prime minister, Mr Vitold Fokin, who clings to the attitude he developed as Ukraine's central planner. Hardliners have also been promoted in Ukraine's slow motion cabinet shuffle and yesterday a reformer, Mr Oleksandr Savchenko, lost his job as deputy governor of the Ukrainian National Bank in a struggle with its conservative head. The balance of power lies with Mr Kravchuk, whom parliament granted expanded executive authority yesterday. Mr Kravchuk may be spurred to reform by the deterioration of the Ukrainian economy, which he described to the legislature yesterday. He said that in the past year GDP has fallen by 21 per cent, the government deficit has climbed to Rbs60bn and the rouble overhang - money in savings accounts which consumers are unable to spend - has risen to Rbs130bn. Mr Kravchuk is also beset by a crisis in agriculture, traditionally the mainstay of the economy. Complaining that shortages of fuel and spare parts are jeopardising the spring sowing, deputies from five agricultural regions protested in parliament yesterday, threatening civil disobedience if prices for industrial goods are not cut and the fuel shortage not averted. Parliament pledged that the Ukrainian National Bank would lend Rbs20bn to farms this season.</p>

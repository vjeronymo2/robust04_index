			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 18 Mar (PL) -- Cuban Vice President  Jose Ramon Fernandez reported here today that the United States  is exerting "all kinds of pressure" against foreign investors  interested in doing business with his country.    While attending a meeting of the Pan American Sports  Organization in Mar del Plata, 400 km from the capital, Ramon  Fernandez said the U.S. State Department has threatened those  businessmen who intend to trade with Cuba.    After saying the blockade applied by Washington against the  island for more than three decades was criminal, the vice  president of the Council of Ministers said that despite U.S.  pressure, the number of potential investors in Cuba is on the  increase.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA and an Argentine television  station, Fernandez noted there has been an increase of  partnerships with foreign firms in the areas of tourism,  petroleum exploration, and others.    Regarding a recent UN resolution on alleged human rights  violations on the island, Fernandez explained the resolution  resulted from a "political vendetta" by the United States, which  cannot forgive us for Cuba's example to the rest of Latin  America.    The Cuban leader discussed the progress made by his country  in the area of human rights. He described the functioning of  participative democracy in Cuba and affirmed that the people  play an active role in the current ongoing process.    Also, Fernandez cited the existence of important rights in  Cuba, such as the right to have access to health facilities,  education, food, social security, and assistance. He cited  statistics that showed the island in a favorable light when  compared to the most developed countries.    Since the victory of the revolution in 1959, there has not  been one single missing or tortured person in Cuba, Fernandez  emphasized.    When questioned about relations between Havana and Latin  America, Fernandez said these ties were broad-based, and he  insisted on the need to work toward regional integration.    Cuba, he concluded, is seeking to strengthen everything that  unites the region and to overcome insignificant issues that  separate us.</p>

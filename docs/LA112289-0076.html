			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WORK BEGINS ON BURBANK CANCER CENTER  </P> <P> Officials at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank marked the start of  construction on a $70-million cancer treatment center Tuesday with a ceremony  preceded by a celebratory Mass.  </P> <P> The Most Rev. Armando Ochoa, auxiliary bishop in Los Angeles, officiated at the  ceremony and blessed the ground on which the six-story, 170,000-square-foot  Robertson Tower will be built.  </P> <P> A North Hollywood businessman and his wife who donated $7 million toward  construction of the center were among about 150 people who attended the 11 a.m.  ceremony at the entrance to the hospital, at Buena Vista Street and Alameda  Avenue.  </P> <P> Big Bear residents Jack Robertson, 51, owner of Robertson Honda, and his wife,  Diane, 52, said their contribution was made in honor of their late parents.  </P> <P> "The Sisters of Providence are such a wonderful and dedicated group of women  that we wanted to do something to support them," said Diane Robertson, whose  parents died of cancer.  </P> <P> The Sisters of Providence founded the nonprofit hospital in 1944. With 647  beds, it is the largest health-care facility in the San Fernando Valley and the  largest Catholic hospital in the state, officials said.  </P> <P> The new center will feature state-of-the-art facilities for cancer detection,  treatment, education and research, said Richard E. Horowitz, the hospital's  director of pathology. Hospice and family counseling facilities will be  included in the expansion, scheduled to be completed in early 1992, he said.  </P> <P> 'It's estimated that one in four people in our service area -- some 300,000  citizens -- will encounter cancer in their lives," Horowitz said. "The expanded  cancer program will allow us to significantly enhance the medical center's  already strong cancer program."  </P> <P> Also planned are new intensive care and mental health units, a laboratory for  diagnosis of vascular diseases and expanded facilities for diagnosis in  radiology and nuclear medicine.  </P> <P> With the Robertsons' contribution, the hospital foundation has raised nearly  $13 million of its contribution goal of $15 million for the cancer center,  hospital officials said.  </P> <P> Tax-exempt bonds and hospital operating fees will generate the balance of the  $70 million, officials said.  </P> <P> Also attending the ceremony were Burbank Mayor Robert R. Bowne, City Manager  Robert Ovrom, and Councilmen Michael Hastings and Michael Flavin.  </P></p>

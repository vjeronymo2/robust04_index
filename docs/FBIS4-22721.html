			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Statsenko and Ilyas Vasipov: "The </F> `Signal' Came Through Loud and Clear"]    [Text] Yesterday's briefing at the GUVD [Main  Directorate of Internal Affairs] was devoted to the results of  the two-week-long active and preventive operation  "Signal-2."    According to Arkadiy Kramarev, chief of the St. Petersburg  GUVD, the operation produced quite good results. Militiamen  worked 12-hour shifts; about 9,000 people participated in  operational and preventive efforts daily. Not only militiamen  but also soldiers in compulsory military service and militia  functionaries from Murmansk, Vladimir, Kaliningrad, Kirov,  Pskov, Smolensk and other oblasts took part in the effort. The  operation was controlled directly by the MVD [Ministry of  Internal Affairs] of Russia.    In the course of "Signal-2," 4,907 inspections of hotels,  dormitories, and other facilities for the temporary residence of  citizens were effected; 7,190 locations for the storage and sale  of material valuables were checked out, along with 1,164  facilities of the licensing system.    The results of "Signal-2," which lasted only two weeks, were  two times greater than the statistics of militia activities in  the previous month. Some 3,513 crimes were solved, including 43  murders, 90 cases of grave bodily injury, 58 bandit assaults,  282 robberies, and 213 cases of theft of motor vehicles and  carjacking.    A total of 3,360 criminals were apprehended, of whom 1,815  were "while the trail was hot." Some 292 crimes committed by  criminal groups were uncovered. A total of 313 firearms and 681  units of cutting and piercing weapons, 16 grenades, 48 stolen  motor vehicles, about 48 kilograms of drugs, money and valuables  totalling 718 million rubles, $29,000, and 110 tonnes of  rare-earth metals were confiscated from criminals.    Lieutenant General Leonid Chervotkin, commander of the  Northwestern District of the Internal Troops of the Russian  Federation MVD, who was present at the briefing, assured those  in attendance that St. Petersburg would be "cleansed" before the  Goodwill Games.    Among other issues, journalists were interested in new  information concerning the talk about the dismissal of Arkadiy  Kramarev, which had not died down in two weeks.    Without starting a discussion, General Kramarev said: "There  has not been an official document to this effect yet."    A briefing at the SZ UVDT [Northwestern Directorate of  Internal Affairs for Transportation] was held on the same day.  The results of the "Signal-2" operation were also announced  there.    The leadership of the SZ UVDT is particularly concerned  about  the process of preparations for the Goodwill Games. The  Organizational Committee of the games still has not familiarized  the SZ UVDT with the schedule for the arrival and departure of  the guests.    However, despite the difficulties the directorate is already  developing a plan of measures for the period of the Goodwill  Games. Thus, it is planned to set up 13 operational protection  lines at railway terminals and airports effective July. Some 910  people will be used to man them along the travelling route of  the participants and guests of the Goodwill Games.    According to SZ UVDT Chief Viktor Vlasov, the average number  of crimes committed on transportation conveyances has so far  dropped by a factor of two.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: NTT warns on effects of telephone charges war NTT, the Japanese tele-communications company, yesterday warned that pre-tax profits for the year to next March would plunge 67 per cent to Y50bn (Dollars 480.7m) if it went ahead with a planned reduction in long-distance rates. The group previously forecast profits of Y150bn for the period. Mr Masashi Kojima, president of NTT, made the warning for the parent company. He cautioned that it might even be forced to post a pre-tax loss if it did not raise rates for city calls. He added, however, that the company planned to maintain its dividend by carrying over about Y86bn in profits from fiscal 1992. NTT shares yesterday suffered a fall of Y11,000 to Y930,000. NTT yesterday applied to the ministry of posts and telecommunications to lower its rates for long-distance calls. The move was an attempt by the company, which was privatised in 1986, to compete more efficiently with its rivals, which have taken about 30 per cent of the long-distance market. NTT's competitors, however, responded by threatening cuts of their own. The planned rate cuts by NTT, which average 21.4 per cent and are to be implemented in October, would trim revenue by Y270m on an annual basis, according to Mr Kojima. At the same time, NTT hopes to increase rates on short-distance city calls, basic charges, and directory services. All these areas have posted losses. Kleinwort Benson estimates that a rise in NTT's local call rates could double the company's profits by 1994. However, the ministry of posts and telecommunications is unlikely to approve NTT rate rises without strong evidence that the company is cutting costs substantially or indications that its profitability has deteriorated dramatically.</p>

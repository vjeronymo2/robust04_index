			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou returned satisfied  from his trip to the United States. In a statement shortly  before leaving New York for Athens, Papandreou said that his  trip had specific goals that have been partially achieved. He  added that some issues will be evaluated later.    Asked whether his expectations from the visit were  fulfilled,  Papandreou said: I cannot say that the flow of history has  changed. In any case, we managed to make our positions  understood and interlocutors were responsive.    Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias described as completely  unfounded rumors that he had met with Stevo Crvenkovski, his  counterpart from Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM], adding that he is ready to return to New  York if talks on Skopje require it.</p>

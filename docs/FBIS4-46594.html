			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Conclusion of article by Vladimir Ilin and Mikhail Levin: </F> "Practically the Only Strategic Aircraft (Tu-160)"; beginning of  article in KRYLYA RODINY, No 12, 1993]    [Text] The aircraft is controlled in pitch using an  all-moving stabilizer, in roll by flaperons and interceptors,  and in yaw by an all-moving fin.    There is an automatic system for restriction and warning  about moving to threshold regimes.    The Tu-160 is equipped with a hose/cone aerial refuelling  system. When not in use, the boom retracts into a compartment  ahead of the pilots' cockpit in the fuselage nose. Initially,  when Il-78 and 3M tanker aircraft were equipped with an aerial  refuelling system having a heavy cone, a massive "firing" boom  was installed in the bomber, but since the appearance of lighter  cones, the Tu-160 has had lightweight booms of a simpler design  since 1988.    An option also examined at Air Force insistence was that of  outfitting the aircraft with a nonretractable boom accommodated  in the slightly upturned fuselage nose (as in the 3M), but such  a solution subsequently was rejected.    The bomber is equipped with a sighting and navigation system  supporting automatic flight and combat employment. This includes  a number of systems and sensors which permit engaging ground  targets regardless of time of day, region or weather conditions.    An inertial navigation system, astronavigation system,  satellite navigation system, multichannel digital communications  system and developed ECM system are installed. The latter  permits detecting enemy radars in a wide band and conducting  active and passive jamming.    The navigation and fire control radar mounted in the  fuselage  nose has a parabolic antenna and is capable of detecting large  naval and ground radar-signature targets at a great distance.  There is an electro-optical bombsight supporting high-accuracy  bombing under daylight conditions and with a low level of  illumination.    The tail cone accommodates numerous pods with decoy flares  and chaff. A thermal direction finder which detects enemy  missiles and aircraft approaching from the rear hemisphere is in  the extreme rear of the fuselage.    The overall number of digital processors aboard the aircraft  exceeds 100. The navigator workstation is equipped with eight  digital computers.    The pilots' cockpit is equipped with standard  electromechanical instruments similar to those installed in the  Tu-22M3 bomber, but the aircraft is controlled not with the help  of the control yoke traditional for heavy aircraft, but by means  of a "fighter" type of stick (the Tu-160 largely is obligated  for the control stick's appearance to Reshetnikov, who helped  convince numerous "conservatives" of the benefit of using it on  a heavy bomber).    The Tu-160 armament is located in two large fuselage bays  and  may include a wide assortment of guided missiles, guided and  free fall bombs, as well as other weapons both with nuclear as  well as conventional filling. This permits using the aircraft  against essentially all types of ground and naval targets.    Missile armament includes up to 12 Kh-55 cruise missiles  created in the Raduga MKB [Design Bureau] and accommodated in  two rotary launchers. The cruise missiles are for engaging  stationary targets with preset coordinates, input to the cruise  missile "memory" before the bomber takes off.    The Kh-15 aeroballistic missile may be included in the  armament for engaging targets of no lesser range. An antiship  version of this missile with a radar homing system operating in  the millimeter band and an antiradar version with passive homing  have been developed. Use of other types of advanced missile  weapons also is possible.    Bomb armament of the Tu-160 bomber is viewed as a "second  priority" weapon intended for engaging targets remaining after a  first missile strike by the bomber. It also is accommodated in  the weapons bay and may include various types of guided bombs,  including the most powerful domestic munitions of this  class--series KAB-1500 with a caliber of 1,500 kg.    The aircraft also can be equipped with free fall (including  nuclear) bombs of various caliber, expendable cluster bomb  dispensers, sea mines and other armament.    One possible area of employing the Tu-160 is to use it in  the  Burlak system intended for inserting light satellites into  near-earth orbit. A need for such satellites may arise in the  course of combat operations in case the enemy succeeds in  destroying or substantially weakening the orbital grouping and  the Baykonur and Plesetsk space launch facilities have been  knocked out. In addition, Burlak has enormous potential for  commercial use for launching domestic and foreign satellites for  the most varied purposes.    The system consists of the Tu-160 platform aircraft and a  solid-propellant cruise missile being created in the Raduga MBK  [sic; probably MKB].    Burlak Aircraft System Characteristics   Weight of payload to be inserted into  low circular orbits, kg:   polar                                     300-500   equatorial                                500-700   Weight of payload to be inserted into  circular orbits 1,000 km high or  elliptical orbits (perigee 200 km,  apogee 8,500 km), kg:   polar                                     50-150   equatorial                                120-220   Maximum payload dimensions, m:            1.3 x 1.2 x 1.2   Volume of payload bay, m[.sup]3[/]         1.75.      Employing the aircraft system precludes the need for  creating  new costly ranges and ground launch complexes or leasing  existing ones. It supports formation of an orbit in practically  any plane and launches from any place on earth suitable from the  standpoint of safety regardless of time of day and climatic and  weather conditions. Compared with traditional launch vehicles,  specific energy costs for launching an equivalent payload are  reduced by 2-3 times and the unfavorable effect on ecology is  diminished.    Equipment for preparing the missile and system are  autonomous  and mobile and support prompt launch of a mission-specific  payload.    Despite very major achievements of domestic designers in  creating bombers, our country's Long-Range Aviation has remained  a very small component of the strategic nuclear triad for many  years. When the START I Agreement was concluded in 1991, the  USSR had 162 strategic bombers carrying 855 nuclear weapons,  which was 8.3 percent of the overall number (10,271) of the  USSR's nuclear weapons. Heavy bombers in the U.S. strategic  forces always were given a substantially greater role: in that  same 1991 the United States had 574 heavy bombers with 2,353  nuclear weapons (22.3 percent), i.e., aviation had approximately  the very same weight as ICBM's, although it was behind submarine  missile forces.    But the situation may change substantially in case of  realization of the START II Treaty, which provides for a radical  restructuring of strategic nuclear forces. This inevitably will  involve an increase in the role of heavy bombers in the  country's defense system (by 2003 the limit for bombers will be  750-1,250 nuclear weapons, with 3,000-3,500 nuclear weapons  overall).    While the main emphasis previously was placed on creating  weapons intended for combating the main potential enemy, the  United States, now various scenarios of armed conflicts are  being examined, and it is not a nuclear "apocalypse" that  appears most likely, but limited local wars. In this case  Long-Range Aviation remains the only part of the strategic triad  capable of universal employment (using both nuclear as well as  conventional weapons), which significantly elevates its role.    The domestic and foreign press has noted that the Tu-160  presently is the most powerful strike aircraft in the world. One  can become convinced of the soundness of these assertions by  comparing it with the U.S. analogue, the Rockwell B-1B strategic  bomber. The common feature of fourth-generation aircraft is the  integrated aerodynamic configuration distinguished by the smooth  joining of wing and fuselage, which because of its  unquestionable advantages (increased aerodynamic efficiency,  increased internal volumes, a decrease in the area flowed around  and in radar cross-section) has become widespread in modern  combat aviation. It also was adopted for many fighters of the  1970's and 1980's (Su-27, MiG-29, G-16, F/A-18). The closeness  of requirements (possibility of penetrating enemy air defense at  low altitude and transonic speed and at high altitude and  supersonic speed while providing intercontinental flight range  and a considerable combat payload) predetermined the choice for  both aircraft of a variable-geometry wing supporting  multiple-regime flight [mnogorezhimnost poleta].    But their similarity ends with these configuration features  common to both aircraft. The Tu-160 is considerably heavier than  the U.S. aircraft (maximum takeoff weight 275 t compared with  216 t of the B-1B) and possesses a much greater maximum  load-carrying capacity (design weight of combat payload in  weapons bays is 45 t as against 34 t for the B-1B).    A certain advantage of the Tu-160 in specific weight  indicators of thrust-to-weight ratio also leads to better  specifications and performance characteristics: it has a greater  flight range (12,300 km compared with the B-1B's 10,400 km). It  should be taken into account that the Tu-160 has a high  supersonic flight speed at which it is capable of flying for a  lengthy time, while the maximum Mach number for the B-1B is  reduced to 1.25 because of the rejection of variable-geometry  intakes and a decrease in the proportion (by weight) of titanium  alloys in the construction from 21 to 17.6 percent.    In the assessment of Russian Air Force Commander P. S.  Deynekin, expressed in a conversation with the authors,  maneuverability and controllability characteristics of the B-1B  and Tu-160 aircraft are approximately identical. The "empty"  B-1B (with a takeoff weight of around 150 t) in which Deynekin  flew in the United States made sharp turns with up to a 40  bank and a steep climb and descent. But in the commander's  words, it also would have been possible to fly a Tu-160 with an  incomplete fuel load in a similar manner.    Advantages of the Tupolev aircraft were dictated by a number  of its fundamental design features. In contrast to the B-1B,  which uses a system of supplementary moving airfoil surfaces in  the aircraft nose for damping elastic vibrations of the fuselage  in the pitch plane when flying in a turbulent atmosphere, there  is no need for such devices in the Tu-160. Increased rigidity of  the aircraft's construction is achieved through a lesser  elongation of the nose with developed wing root leading-edge  extensions. Realization of an original wheel well  configuration--without disturbing the fuselage's load-bearing  unit, while in the B-1 the fuselage is greatly weakened (in the  figurative expression of aircraft chief designer V. I. Bliznyuk,  it is "cut in half" by the wheel compartments)--permitted  getting by without using a supplementary electronic system. The  increased resonance of joints for rotating the Tu-160's moving  wing panels (the relative length of the center section beam is  0.25 with unfolded wing compared with 0.19 for the B-1B) reduces  trim losses at transonic speeds as a result of a lesser shift of  the center of aerodynamic pressure when reversing the wing. Use  of an electro-remote control system in the Tu-160 provides a  fundamental capability to reduce trim losses even more by  reducing the aircraft's static stability.    In creating the Tu-160 and B-1B, designers were given the  task of sharply reducing radar cross-section, the main indicator  of radar signature. But while the United States sacrificed a  number of very important performance characteristics for the  sake of this (above all speed, which turned the bomber from  supersonic to transonic), the Tupolev firm achieved similar  results without "worsening" the aircraft. In contrast to the air  intake with S-shaped baffles used in the B-1B, an ordinary  variable-geometry intake was installed in the Tu-160, providing  high characteristics in all flight configurations, and radar  cross-section was reduced by using "low-signature" engines. A  reduction in radar signature also is facilitated by a more  "integrated" configuration (from a front view, the Tu-160's  lines resemble the U.S. Northrop B-2 low-signature aircraft), a  cockpit not extending beyond fuselage lines (in the B-1B it is  situated above the wheel wells and forms a unique hump in the  aircraft nose section), and an all-moving fin (the slot formed  between the B-1B vertical tail and rudder provides an additional  splash of reflected radar emission).    Armament of the bombers also differs substantially. The  Tu-160 is capable of carrying a wide assortment of both nuclear  as well as conventional munitions (guided and unguided). The  presence of an optical bombsight provides high precision of  high-altitude bombing. The B-1B presently is equipped only for  delivering B-61 and B-83 nuclear free fall bombs. The SRAM  short-range guided missile was removed from the armament since  storage periods of solid-propellant rocket motors had expired,  and work on the SRAM II advanced missile stopped in 1991.    It has been written repeatedly that the B-1B is capable of  carrying ALCM cruise missiles. It fact, tests were conducted  confirming the possibility of accommodating such weapons on the  aircraft, but as of the present time the B-1B bomber fleet does  not have the necessary equipment permitting use of cruise  missiles. (A large amount of additional funds, which the U.S.  Defense Department does not have, is required to manufacture  such equipment and install it in the aircraft.) Only in 1991 did  the U.S. Air Force begin work to arm the B-1B with conventional  225 kg free fall bombs. The B-1B can perform only "carpet"  bombing of areas because of the absence of an optical bombsight.    At the same time, the U.S. aircraft has more sophisticated  cockpit instrumentation, particularly monochron CRT indicators  installed in front of each pilot, which makes flying the  aircraft easier, especially in low-altitude flight.    Comparing the Tu-160 and B-1B, it is impossible to ignore  the  higher engineering professionalism and elegance of design of the  Tupolev aircraft, which favorably distinguish it from the  Rockwell creation. Thus, the deflecting root sections of flaps,  which provide smooth joining of the rotating and stationary  parts of the wing, improve aircraft aerodynamics when flying at  high speeds by performing the role of additional fins. In a  cruising regime they form a smooth transition between wing  surfaces, ideal from the standpoint of aerodynamics and radar  signature. This elegant, clever solution contrasts with the  cumbersome, "nonaerodynamic" system of joining used by the  Americans and including hideous (from an aesthetic standpoint)  deflecting panels and complicated and not very reliable seals.  In general, in the authors' opinion, a unique "superiority  complex" (in the good sense of this word) was displayed in  creating the Tu-160, which formed in the best part of the  engineering design corps of the OKB [Special Design Bureau]  imeni A. N. Tupolev (a rather rare quality for our days).    The multiple-regime combat aircraft, harmoniously combining  low signature with high performance characteristics and powerful  defensive and offensive weapons, has good chances of "surviving"  in the skies of the early 21st century. It is obvious that of  all the strategic supersonic bombers created as of the present  time, specifically the Tu-160 most approaches the ideal of such  an aircraft.

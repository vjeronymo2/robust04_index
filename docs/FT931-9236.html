			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Channel ferry groups seek to co-operate CROSS-CHANNEL ferry operators P&amp;O European Ferries and Sealink Stena Line will today ask the government for permission to join forces on the Dover-Calais route. They want to keep their identities but pool resources to present a united front against the Channel tunnel, due to open at the end of this year. The ferry companies believe their best chance of surviving the competition is to co-ordinate their timetables, prices and booking systems and to rationalise capacity. When the two companies last proposed a pooling arrangement on the short sea routes in 1989 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission concluded that an agreement would act against the public interest. However, Mr Nicholas Ridley, then trade and industry secretary, said it would be open to the parties to make a fresh approach to the Office of Fair Trading closer to the tunnel's opening.</p>

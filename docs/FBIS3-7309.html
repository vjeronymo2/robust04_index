In the meeting, the  committee decided to send its members to Kumamoto Prefecture  next week to investigate whether any illegal transactions took  place when the prefectural government authorized the  construction of a major resort facility at the foot of Mt. Aso  during Hosokawa's term as Kumamoto governor.    At today's meeting, the committee discussed ways to promote  investigation from now on. Noting that Kumamoto prefectural  government changed its regulations when it authorized the  construction of a resort facility near Mt. Aso during Hosokawa's  term as governor, the members agreed that this move was unusual  and should be investigated.    The committee decided to send four members, including  Committee Chairman Matsunaga, who is former international trade  and industry minister, to Kumamoto on 31 March. The four will  interview prefectural officials about details of the regulation  changes and visit the resort facility in question.</p>

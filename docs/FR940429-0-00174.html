			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> After calculating all of Sam's possible refunds, TCC must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use the calculation which provides for the largest refund. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this case, the largest refund is provided by the State refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation: $2187. This refund amount must be returned, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sam's behalf, first to the Title IV, HEA programs and then to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sam, in accordance with the allocation priorities in &sect;668.22(g);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no portion of the refund due can be used to pay Sam's unpaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charges to TCC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Example  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Fair and Equitable Refund: Nonterm Institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Institutional Profile. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Nonterm Technical Institute (NTI)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offers 900-hour and 1200-hour programs, measured in clock hours,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and its academic year is 30 weeks long. NTI participates in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Pell Grant program and the Federal Family Education Loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FFEL) programs. NTI charges by the program and requires payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> up-front. The institutional costs of the 900-hour program are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $3000 for tuition; $520 for equipment, books, and supplies; and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $100 administrative fee. Institutional costs for the 1200-hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program are: $4000 for tuition; $740 for equipment, books, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplies; and a $150 administrative fee. Noninstitutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charges include: living expenses and meals (NTI has no on-campus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing or food service), transportation, and personal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> miscellaneous expenses. (Noninstitutional costs vary by student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> budget, depending in part upon the educational program in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student enrolls.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Applicable Refund Policies. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The State in which NTI is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located provides a 90 percent refund to students who withdraw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before completing 10 percent of the program; students who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdraw after the 10 percent point but before completing 25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the program receive a 70 percent refund; students who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdraw after the 25 percent point but before completing 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the program receive a 45 percent refund; and students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who withdraw after the 50 percent point but before completing 75  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the program receive a 20 percent refund. (Students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawing after completing 75 percent of the program receive no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund under State guidelines.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NTI's accrediting agency gives an 80 percent refund to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students who withdraw before completing 15 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program; students who withdraw after the 15 percent point but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before completing 45 percent of the program receive a 50 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund; and students who withdraw after the 45 percent point but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before completing 60 percent of the program receive a 25 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund. (Students withdrawing after completing 60 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program receive no refund under the accrediting agency policy.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Student Profile. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Susan the Student, who lives in an off-campus apartment, enrolled in a 900-hour program at NTI and began  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attending classes. Susan made a cash payment of $800 toward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Financial Aid Package and Disbursements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Susan's financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aid package for the program consisted of a $2000 Federal Pell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grant and a $2325 Federal Stafford Loan. Susan's first Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pell Grant disbursement ($1000) and the first disbursement of her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Stafford Loan ($1081_loan and origination fees have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtracted) were credited to her institutional account. At the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of the academic year, NTI determined that Susan had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unofficially withdrawn. The last record of Susan's attendance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was a midterm exam she'd taken after completing 450 hours of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Step One: Figuring the Educational Costs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional costs are included in the refund calculation. NTI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must use the institutional costs as charged, by the term, for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total of $3620_$3000 tuition, $520 for equipment, books, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplies, and $100 for administrative costs. Noninstitutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs are treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Step Two: Figuring the Totals Paid to Institutional Costs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NTI's records show that Susan paid $800 in cash toward her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional costs, and that a total of $2081 in student aid was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paid toward institutional charges [$1000 Federal Pell+$1081  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Stafford=$2081].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total paid to institutional costs (student payments and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial aid) is $2881 [$800+$2081=$2881]. Only funds paid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to institutional charges are included in the refund calculation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aid disbursed to the student for noninstitutional expenses are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Step Three: Checking for Pro Rata Eligibility Under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Law. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  To determine whether Susan is eligible for a statutory pro  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rata refund calculation, NTI must determine if she's a first-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student and if she withdrew on or before the point in time when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she had completed 60 percent of the clock hours scheduled for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of enrollment for which she was charged. Susan enrolled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last year in the same program at NTI, but she never began  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attending classes and so was entitled to a 100 percent refund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with the regulatory definition in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.22(c), Susan is a first-time student. Susan's last recorded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of attendance was at the point of having completed 450 clock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours; 900 clock hours are scheduled for the program, and 60  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the scheduled hours would be 540 clock hours [900  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours&times;.60=540]. Because Susan is a first-time student and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she withdrew before completing 60 percent of the hours scheduled,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she is entitled to a statutory pro rata refund calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Step Four: Calculating the Unpaid Charges. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Because a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student's unpaid charges impact the refund calculation, NTI must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first calculate Susan's unpaid charges (as defined in &sect;668.22(c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (f)) using the following formula: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> Total Institutional Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ^Total Aid Paid to Institutional Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=77 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> =Student's Scheduled Cash Payment (SCP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ^Student's Cash Paid to Institutional Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=77 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> =Unpaid Charges <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> To calculate Susan's unpaid charges, NTI subtracts the $2081 in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total aid paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total institutional costs of $3620 (from Step One, above).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The resulting scheduled cash payment is $1539 [$3620^$2081=$1539]. From that total, NTI subtracts Susan's cash payment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $800 (from Step Two, above) and Susan's unpaid charges equal $739  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [$1539^$800=$739]. This amount ($739) will be used in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three refund calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

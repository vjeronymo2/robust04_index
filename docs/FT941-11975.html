			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Legal move in Canadian mining bid A small Vancouver-based exploration company fighting a hostile takeover bid from Metall Mining, the international mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, has alleged that a Canadian securities firm unlawfully supplied information to Metall. International Musto Explorations is seeking damages and a permanent injunction to prevent Metall receiving any further allegedly confidential information from McLean McCarthy, the Toronto-based securities dealer. Musto alleges that Metall has used information supplied by McLean McCarthy to canvass support for its proposed CDollars 232m (USDollars 175m) bid for Musto. The securities firm, which is wholly-owned by Deutsche Bank, previously acted as an adviser to Musto, but is now retained by Metall. Metall has offered to buy all Musto's outstanding shares as a way of gaining control of Bajo de la Alumbrera, a copper and gold deposit in Argentina. Besides controlling McLean, Deutsche Bank is the biggest single shareholder in Metallgesellschaft.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- The dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il received a letter of solidarity from Werner  Schulwese, chairman, and Hans Wauer, vice-chairman, of the  Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, supporting  the struggle of the Korean people to defend the dignity of the  nation and the sovereignty of their country.    Expressing full support to the policies of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea to cope with an armed intervention of  imperialists, the letter said that the members of the Communist  Party of Germany would stand firm on the side of the Korean  people determined to defend socialism at a time when the  imperialists are becoming undisguised in their campaign for  pressure on Korea.    In a message to Comrade Kim Chong-il, Genaro Ledesma  Izquieta, chairman of the People's Front of Workers, Peasants  and Students of Peru, expressed deep apprehensions for the grave  danger of war created by the United States on the Korean  peninsula recently after totally reversing the agreed  conclusions reached between the DPRK and the USA in New York,  and extended full support and solidarity to the Korean people in  their struggle for the cause of socialism.</p>

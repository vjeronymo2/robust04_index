			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka wound up a weeklong demonstration  against Pittston Coal Group Inc. at Charleston, W. Va., by promising to broaden  the two-month-old miners' strike. "There's no doubt in my mind that it's going  to expand," Trumka told a rally of about 12,000 strikers and their  sympathizers. He would not say whether he would take the strike to other parts  of the country, such as Kentucky, where about 200 Pittston miners remain on the  job. On the final leg of a six-day march, Trumka led supporters to the state  Capitol, where Gov. Gaston Caperton urged a compromise in the dispute over  wages, benefits and work rules.  </P></p>

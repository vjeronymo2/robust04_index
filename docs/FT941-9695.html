			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / City jitters greet Clarke's cut in rates 'It's the first mistake Clarke has made,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, currency strategist at Swiss Bank Corporation. The rest of the City seems to feel the same about Tuesday's quarter-point cut in interest rates. Not only has the FT-SE 100 share index ended the week 40 points lower than before the cut, but the pound has lost more than three cents against the dollar and four pfennigs against the D-Mark, and gilts are down three points. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, may be riding high in the opinion of Tory backbenchers. But after a tax-raising Budget that delighted the markets, the City has this week lost some of its confidence. Mr O'Neill added: 'We're all entitled to one (mistake), but it undermines the idea that he and Eddie (George, governor of the Bank of England) have got it all worked out.' Mr Derek Scott of Barclays de Zoete Wedd said: 'Eddie George and Ken Clarke do not have the credibility of Alan Greenspan (the chairman of the US Federal Reserve). It all depends now on whether Clarke will take pre-emptive action to stamp out inflation.' The cut, which came hard on the heels of inflation-beating pay rises of about 3 per cent for public-sector workers, raised fears that Mr Clarke's overriding priority was no longer to get inflation down but to go for recovery - both in the economy and the government's popularity. The City remembers all too clearly that Mr Clarke came to the Treasury expressing concern about manufacturing, the unemployed and Britain's role in Europe. But if the City is jittery, Tory backbenchers are more confident about his stewardship of the economy - whatever they feel about his politics. Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, said yesterday that the Budget statement was 'about right' and well- presented. Like many at Westminster, he admires the chancellor's direct style. But Mr Watts is also concerned about the chancellor's approach - he can occasionally 'charge into a room and drop a scatter-grenade', said Mr Watts. He believes the chancellor was unwise to tell a recent meeting of his committee that the Budget had put an additional 7p on income tax. It played into the hands of the opposition, he said. Mr Clarke may have made a more serious blunder by recently admitting on television that he would resign if Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the sale of arms to Iraq finds that he had acted improperly as a minister in the late 1980s. On the right of the party, Mr Clarke attracts criticism from those who who see him as the main challenger to Mr Major from the left. What this week makes clear, however, is that the markets are too concerned about Mr Clarke's macroeconomic strategy now to start worrying about his departure.</p>

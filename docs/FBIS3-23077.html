			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Madrid RNE-1 Radio Network in Spanish at  1349 GMT on 28 February 1994 carries further reportage on a  hijacking of an Algerian aircraft to Spain. In a report from  Alicante airport, RNE's reporter said that "three hijackers with  small arms are holding 121 passengers, including a baby, and the  crew of seven, demanding political asylum in our country." The  reporter says that the Civil Governor of Alicante is talking via  an interpreter to the hijackers from the control tower; a  "diplomatic representative of the Algerian Government" arrived  at the airport a few moments ago, the reporter adds.</p>

Create the ruble zone in an accelerated manner. Continue  financial aid to nearby foreign countries. Introduce a fixed  exchange rate of the ruble.    6. Support large investment projects carried out jointly  with  leading foreign corporations with the participation of  interested departments.  <H5>  Projected Results by the End of 1994 </H5>   1. Budget deficit--10.5 percent of gross domestic product  (GDP). Inflation--7 to 9 percent per month. Market exchange  rate--7,000-8,000 rubles [R] to the dollar.    2.

Technological dependence on multinational corporations  being enhanced.    7. Social explosions on account of hyperinflation.  <H6>  A. Shapovalyants </H6>   1. Budget deficit in the range of 45-50 percent of GDP.  Inflation--45-50 percent per month. Market exchange  rate--R13,500-14,000 to the dollar.    2.

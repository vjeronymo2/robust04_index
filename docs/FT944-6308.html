			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: BTR BTR's trading statement contained no information so startling as to bring the shares back into favour - that would be a tall order after three months during which they fell 28 per cent. But the fact that it was issued at all is encouraging: it shows that BTR is becoming responsive to investors' concerns about its communications policy, or rather lack of it. Without such a statement there would have been an information void between the interim statement in September and the full-year figures next March. A trading statement alone is not enough, however: the group needs to find a way of improving day-to-day contact with investors and analysts without infringing anti-insider dealing rules. If that helped to assuage the City's anxieties about the group's future, it would be a worthwhile investment of senior management time.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Joyous Palestinians dance in the streets of Jericho JOYOUS Palestinians hung out flags, honked car horns and danced in the streets of the Israeli-occupied territories yesterday. The celebration of what they said was their 'first day of independence' on their long march to statehood was marred only by isolated incidents of tyre-burning by opponents of the treaty and clashes in Lebanon in which seven demonstrators died. Guerrilla songs and the Palestinian anthem were sung in Jericho's crowded town square, which burst into uproar when Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, were shown on television shaking hands. Children in the Gaza Strip handed out balloons in the red, green, white and black colours of the Palestinian standard and more than 50,000 people poured into the rubbish-strewn streets of Gaza banging drums, laughing and talking to Israeli soldiers with whom they have clashed for nearly six years. Thousands of flags, still technically banned by Israel, emerged from under mattresses and cupboards to be hung from roofs, car bonnets and bicycle handlebars. Posters of Mr Arafat emerged across the West Bank and Gaza, including one depicting him being plucked by a celestial eagle from an aircraft which crashed in the Libyan desert two years ago, killing others aboard. Police and soldiers kept a low profile and there was only one report of minor violence between Palestinians for and against the agreement. But in Gaza, Palestinians and Islamic fundamentalists who reject the peace accord mounted a general strike until mid-afternoon and set tyres ablaze on the roads. There were clashes in Beirut where Lebanese troops shot dead seven pro-Iranian militants and Palestinian refugees demonstrating against the peace agreement. A further 31 people were wounded when soldiers opened fire on demonstrators in Beirut's southern suburbs. In Israel, where the public largely supports the peace agreement but remains sceptical and concerned about its long-term effect on Jewish security, a few hundred pro-peace demonstrators draped in the blue and white Israeli flag danced in Jerusalem. About 50 rightwing opponents of the deal, some in sackcloth and ashes, said prayers of mourning and burnt the Palestinian flag. Israelis said the atmosphere in Jerusalem was much more sombre than in 1978 when joy erupted after Israel and Egypt signed the Camp David peace accord.</p>

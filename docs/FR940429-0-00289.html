The commenters believed that students should have their loans discharged, and the Secretary should reimburse guaranty agencies for such discharges, even if the borrower's debt is legally unenforceable by the holder of the loan. Of particular concern to some commenters were cases where the school signed the borrower's name on the loan documents or check. While the commenters generally recognized that the borrower technically does not owe the amount of the unenforceable debt, they were concerned that borrowers may not have the resources to pursue a legal or administrative determination of loan enforceability. The commenters also believed that even if the borrower did pursue that avenue, it could take many years to reach a resolution, during which the borrower would be subject to collection activity, damaged credit rating, and if in default, would be considered to be ineligible for additional federal student financial aid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a related area, some commenters expressed concern that, under current federal regulations, a borrower would not receive a closed school or false certification discharge if federal reinsurance on the loan had been lost because of violations of due diligence or other programmatic requirements committed by the lender or the guarantor. The commenters believed that Congress intended to help a borrower who was victimized by a school's closing or false certification of eligibility to borrow, events that are beyond the control of the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary is persuaded that the term ``falsely certified,'' as used in section 437(c)(1) of the HEA, should be defined to include certain cases where a school signed the borrower's name on the loan application or promissory note. The definition of the term ``falsely certified'' is extensively discussed in response to comment 48. Because of the similarity of such cases to those involving the execution of the application or note by the school in the name of the borrower, the Secretary concluded that cases in which the school improperly endorsed the borrower's signature on the loan check or the authorization for electronic funds transfer should also be addressed under these regulatory procedures, although such misconduct is not by itself a false certification. Under these final regulations, therefore, the Secretary will provide relief to borrowers in cases of unauthorized endorsements, but except for the instances in which the school both falsely created a loan application or promissory note for a student and then endorsed the student's name on the loan check, the lender is responsible for ensuring the authenticity of a borrower's signature on the lender's loan check, and should continue to bear the risk of an improper endorsement. In those instances, although a borrower may under the procedure as modified here receive a discharge of any obligation to repay that portion of a loan disbursed by a check which he or she neither endorsed nor received the proceeds of, the lender will not be permitted to receive or retain a claim payment for that amount. Because the Secretary considers the lender to have not had routine access to the written authorization for electronic funds transfer, on the other hand, the lender would not have occasion to know of an unauthorized execution of that authorization in the name of the borrower, and would not be held at risk for such unauthorized disbursements under these procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

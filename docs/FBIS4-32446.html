			<p>BFN     [Text] London, June 23 (TANJUG) -- The international  "Contact Group" for Bosnia-Herzegovina is expected by Tuesday  [28 June] to complete the maps for the division of the  ex-Yugoslav republic into a Moslem-Croat and a Serb part, it was  learned in diplomatic circles in London on Thursday. The same  sources recall that Russia and the United States will have the  final say on conditions for peace in Bosnia at the G-7 summit in  Naples from July 8-10.    There are indications that Russia and the United States  could  present their own peace plan independently of the "Contact  Group," although they, themselves, are represented in it. This  creates further confusion in connection with the international  community's anyway frail initiative for peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. British political analysts on Thursday said  they were surprised by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's  statement that he did not rule out the possibility of the  exemption of the Bosnian Moslems from the U.N. arms embargo.    The change in the Russian stand has increased fears that the  arms embargo could be lifted, which would almost certainly lead  to the continuation of the war, according to British  assessments. It is recalled in London that the U.S. Senate is  on Thursday to adjust its decision on the exemption of the  Bosnian Moslems from the arms embargo with a similar decision  taken by the House of Representatives.    The U.N. protocol and, indirectly, U.N. Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali, himself, have made it impossible for U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina  Gen. Michael Rose, who is best acquainted with the situation in  the field, to explain to the U.S. senators how disastrous such a  policy would prove to be. Under the U.N. protocol, only the  head and the commander of the U.N. Protection Force for the  former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) can present their views on the  matter.</p>

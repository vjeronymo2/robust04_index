			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / As They Say in Europe: Faking a grand occasion There are many kinds of foreign correspondent. There are those who say, in effect: 'Dreadful things go on here but I'm going to do my best to tell the story straight.' Such people, those who divorce themselves from their own prejudices, were found in Johannesburg yesterday and are in Beijing today. Then, there are those who try to convince their readers that their patch is not only important but also diverting, however harsh and unattractive it might seem - Moscow or Tokyo for example. Another group, which I call the 'Paris Club', attempts to combat long-held prejudices back home. Its members recount, all too often, how well the French do things ('The-metro-runs-on-time' is a favoured theme). In Bonn, meanwhile, the foreign press corps does its best to make Germany exciting - and usually fails. Which brings us to the Frankfurter Allgemeine's man in Rome, Heinz-Joachim Fischer. He has the most envied job among German foreign correspondents. Italy provides the nearest thing to the German idea of paradise on earth. Fischer, however, rarely succumbs to the country's charms and, in fact, finds it rather objectionable. But he is always a good read, and a must for anyone seeking to come to grips with the Italy of today. Fischer's curtain-raiser before last week's summit in Naples reflected perfectly his approach, an amalgam of erudition and contempt. He noted how lucky it was that reports of parliamentary investigations did not get read. For, if they were, the seven leaders might have thought twice about holding a summit in Naples. The report produced last December on the workings of the Neapolitan Camorra made the Mafia seem like a Rotary Club. The Naples region produces twice the national average of murders, more than twice the number of officials driven from office as in Sicily, and an industrial structure based on fraud and corruption. Yet, Naples was dressed up for the summit. Had not the authorities done a good job? Not according to Fischer. 'Chancellor Kohl and President Clinton, like the Tsarina Catherine II on her Crimean trip with Count Potemkin in 1787, are expected to praise the order and prosperity of Naples, a city where drivers prefer to print the image of a seat belt on their shirts rather than actually use a real one.' The idea of Naples as a Potemkin village, where everything is faked for the grand occasion, provides an insight that adds to one's understanding of summits. It also, unconsciously, came to dominate much of the comment on the event itself. There was far less in it than met the eye. Le Figaro's editor, Franz-Olivier Giesbert, pursued the theme with reference to France which, he said, 'freely confuses the cosmos and the farmyard'. There followed a quotation from Cocteau: 'What is France? I ask you. A cock on a dungheap. Take away the dungheap, the cock dies.' The summit had played a vital dungheap role, and sending troops to Rwanda meant France could crow as the conscience of the world. 'France exists, the G-7, sorry G-8 (Russia included), have recognised it. That is one of the lessons of the summit . . .' Charging on through his thicket of metaphors, Giesbert concluded that it was 'a summit of the seven dwarves. Without Snow White'. A different view was expressed in La Stampa, which headlined its comment: 'The chimera of a world government.' It argued that while the G-7 was the pinnacle among international bodies designed to construct a better world, it should, in fact, do nothing at all. According to the newspaper, the very act of trying to govern the world was doomed, for it made things worse. There was a 'big bang' in 1914 when old empires started to explode into new states, and that had not settled down. Neo-nationalists and neo-fundamentalists resented anything that smacked of trying to impose any order, new or old, and G-7 political declarations were, therefore, a waste of time. I once knew a house in Devon where the hall was full of 18th century painted figures cut from wood panels. The lone inhabitant found it comforting to join these guests from another world. With modern technology, it should be easy enough to construct a Potemkin summit which would be no less impressive than those we enjoy today. Next year's venue, a spot known as Halifax, Nova Scotia, would be an excellent place to start. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

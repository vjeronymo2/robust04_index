			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 27 KYODO -- North Korea has rejected a  request from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to  sample and analyze fuel at a key nuclear facility, a South  Korean daily reported Wednesday [27 April].    Pyongyang told the IAEA Monday that the IAEA's request to  inspect a 5,000-kilowatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, some 90  kilometers north of Pyongyang, is inappropriate, the TONG-A ILBO  said.    The IAEA is insisting that North Korea allow a full check of  North Korea's nuclear stockpiles, in addition to monitoring  replacement of fuel rods at the nuclear plant.    In a front-page story dispatched from Vienna, the daily  quoted North Korean diplomat Yun Ho-chin as saying that he  notified the IAEA it would not be granted permission to conduct  eight tests when the fuel rods are exchanged at the nuclear  reactor.    The IAEA says the inspections would reveal the current level  of North Korea's nuclear program and how much plutonium has  already been recovered from the spent nuclear fuel.    Yun, a counselor at the North Korean Embassy in Austria,  said  the IAEA can ensure that nuclear materials are not being  diverted to military purposes when it observes the removal of  the reactor core, according to the report.    North Korea has nothing more to say to the IAEA, Yun was  quoted saying.    The Yongbyon reactor was started up in 1986. Its fuel rods  are almost exhausted and are due for replacement. The reactor  was previously shut down for 100 days in 1989 for unknown  reasons.    The nuclear complex at Yongbyon has been the focus of  Western  allegations that North Korea is engaged in a covert nuclear arms  development program.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Trust Bank ahead of forecasts Trust Bank, New Zealand's fifth-largest and only locally-owned national bank, yesterday reported a 17 per cent increase in after-tax profit to NZDollars 72.8m (USDollars 42.8m) for the year ended March 31, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. The company was listed on the New Zealand stock exchange in March, and the result was NZDollars 5m better than prospectus forecasts. It came after writing off share issue expenses of NZDollars 7.5m and a gain of NZDollars 2.9m from property revaluations. The charge for bad and doubtful debts fell to NZDollars 1.4m from NZDollars 22.8m. Shareholders' funds rose to NZDollars 467m from NZDollars 311m. Trust Bank is New Zealand's largest lender to the home mortgage market, but is seeking to expand into commercial and rural lending. Lending on home mortgages was up 6 per cent to NZDollars 4.4bn, to the commercial sector by 17 per cent to NZDollars 1.1bn, and to the rural sector by 30 per cent to NZDollars 577m.</p>

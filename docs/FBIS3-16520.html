			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Mar 16, BNS -- The Latvian parliament's  Latvia's Way faction maintains that Russia will be bind to stick  to Aug. 31 as the troop pullout deadline after the initialing of  draft agreements, its Deputy Chairman Indulis Berzins told BNS  Wednesday [16 March].    The faction won't take any decisions on the ratification of  the draft agreement before all deputies acquaint themselves with  the text of the documents, Berzins said.    The ratification of the agreements depends on whether  President Guntis Ulmanis will sign them and on the course of  events in Russia, Berzins noted.    Concord for Latvia's Edvins Kide said his faction favored  the  agreements because "if there is no agreement there is no  instrument to press on Russia if it does not withdraw its  troops."    The Homeland and Freedom faction, however, claims that the  government delegation violated the law on ratification of  interstate agreements, faction head Maris Grinblats told  reporters.    The faction proposes to organize a public opinion poll May  29  on the functioning of the former Soviet radar installation at  Skrunda. The date coincides with the local government elections.    The poll should include only one question: "Do you agree to  the functioning of the Skrunda radar after Aug. 31?"    The factions of the Farmers Union, the Democratic Party and  the Christian Democratic Union Party have not discussed the  withdrawal agreement yet.</p>

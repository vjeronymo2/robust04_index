			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edward West] </F>   [Text] Cape Town -- The SA [South African] Development Bank  was positioned to disburse R1bn [billion rand] in development  aid to meet the goals of the reconstruction and development  programme [RDP] in the financial year to end-March 1995, CE  [chief executive] Andre Le Grange said yesterday.    He said at the launch of the bank's annual report that in  the  past financial year about R716.7m of project finance was  disbursed, a 59 percent increase from the previous year's R446m.  New project approvals for the year amounted to R1.7bn. By the  end of March the bank had approved a cumulative total of 1,475  programmes and projects worth R8.9bn over 11 years, while a  further 246 projects were under consideration with an estimated  loan value of R2.1bn.    Le Grange said regarding the return flow of maturing loans  that no zero performing loans were reported in the year. Loan  repayments, which would increase as the years passed, would play  an important role in the continued financing of projects and in  the repayment of capital market debt, he said.    The Development Bank is essentially a wholesale national  development finance institution owned by government. Le Grange  said the bank would maintain its "arms's length" approach to  government so as to avoid political prescription at the cost of  economic soundness.    Proposals had been made to increase the shareholding of the  bank to include the nine provinces, but it would take time to  implement. About 10 percent of the bank's current loan profile  was for the funding of projects and policy development projects  outside SA's borders, but inside the southern African region.    Most of these projects would benefit SA in the long run,  such  as the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. The bank worked closely  with the Southern African Development Community and preferential  trade agreement organisations on projects outside SA, and would  continue to do so, he said.    He believed SA should not blindly accede to pressure to join  regional trade agreements. SA should instead adopt a functional  approach, starting possibly with bilateral agreements, before  deciding on which institutional approach to take.    As a result of problems with the implementation of projects  in the past financial year arising from political violence and  uncertainty, the bank's liquidity was 39 percent. Le Grange  said the bank aimed to reduce this to 25 percent of loan  disbursements, which would probably result in a small surplus of  R200m this financial year.</p>

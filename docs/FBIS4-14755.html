While addressing the Congress, Zhirinovskiy criticized the  policy of Russia's present government and noted that "the longer  they stay at power the more votes the LDPR will receive."

Zhirinovskiy declared that President Boris Yeltsin should  refuse from the services of his advisers who had organized his  meeting with Yegor Gaydar, leader of the party Russia's Choice  which does not exist yet. "Mr Gaydar should be in a prison but  not in the Kremlin because he is guilty of the fact that the  majority of the Russian population is living in poverty for the  third year already," declared Zhirinovskiy.

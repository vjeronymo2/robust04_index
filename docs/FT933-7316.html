			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Ford warns further losses would hit investment FORD of Europe will be in loss in 1993 for the third successive year, and the company has warned that further losses next year would begin to hit its future investment and product development programmes. The company has told its workforce that it may have to cut more jobs 'if conditions in Europe continue to worsen', in addition to the 14,400 jobs it is already eliminating by the end of this year. Ford of Europe warned that the industry faced excess capacity of about 7m units by the mid to late 1990s. At the same time, an industry forecast released today predicts that west European new car sales will fall by 16 per cent this year to only 11.3m from 13.5m in 1992. Mr Jacques Nasser, who was appointed chairman of Ford of Europe late last year to end two years of losses, has told employees, 'clearly we have not yet achieved the turnaround we require' despite the 'most radical restructuring in our 25-year history'. In a message broadcast to employees on the company's internal television service, Mr Nasser warned that a failure to return to profitability soon would start to endanger 'core competencies'. 'This means you start to take out the muscle of the organisation as well as the fat. If that happens, we will have been forced to limit our capability of competing.' Ford's European automotive operations, including Jaguar and excluding financial services, have suffered total losses of Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in the past two years. In the first half of 1993, losses totalled a further Dollars 257m compared with a profit of Dollars 107m in the corresponding period a year ago. The company is already aiming to slash the workforce of its European automotive operations (excluding Jaguar) by 14.8 per cent to 83,000 by the end of 1993 from 97,400 last October. The workforce will have been cut by 28 per cent from 115,000 in 1990. Mr Nasser warned: 'If we cannot improve our financial results both in the short and medium term, we will not be able to introduce the new products that we need to maintain or improve our position in Europe's automotive industry.' He said that Ford of Europe losses were mounting as a result of: the 18 per cent fall in new vehicle sales across Europe in the first seven months; unfavourable exchange rate movements; higher marketing costs; declining market share, with particular losses for the Escort/Orion and the Fiesta ranges offsetting the gains made by the Mondeo, which was launched earlier this year. Ford of Europe is intensifying the squeeze on its components suppliers, and Mr Nasser said the group was now seeking to cut the costs of purchased materials by 10 per cent over two years instead of over three years as before. He warned that the problem of overcapacity was 'a major strategic concern' for all carmakers in Europe. Ford did not expect new car sales in west Europe to return to the trend level of 1990-91 until the late 1990s. An overcapacity of about 7m units by the end of the 1990s would pose 'severe structural problems' for the European auto industry, which would be compounded by a rising market share gained by Japanese carmakers. This 'may result in continued losses or severely depressed profitability for many manufacturers'. Car sales to slide, Page 2</p>

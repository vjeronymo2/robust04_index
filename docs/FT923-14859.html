			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Mayhew says aim is self rule for Ulster SIR Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, has said he would like to devolve wide-ranging powers to a new Northern Ireland administration - 'at least' to the same degree as the Stormont government that was suspended in 1972. British government policy for the last two decades has been to help society in Northern Ireland to develop and, 'enable it once again to become self governing, to the extent at least that it was when Stormont had jurisdiction. That is our objective,' Sir Patrick said in an interview with the Financial Times. The government is committed to finding agreement with the main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on new forms of government for the province. But Sir Patrick's comments give the clearest insight yet into his own thinking since he took over the job three months ago. They contrast with the support of some unionists and Conservative MPs for an 'integrationist' policy, in which Northern Ireland would by ruled much like other parts of the UK. Unionist and nationalist politicians are due to begin talks on Monday with the Irish and UK governments on 'strand two' of the nine-week-old inter-party talks process. This is the point at which the Irish government enters negotiations to talk about relations between north and south Ireland. Before the imposition of 'direct rule' of Northern Ireland from Westminster in the early 1970s, Stormont had responsibility for most policy areas, including, critically, internal security. Westminster retained control of national defence, foreign affairs, major taxation items, and customs and excise. Sir Patrick has also indicated that he would not oppose a bill of rights for Northern Ireland - a proposal backed by all the main constitutional parties in the province during the talks process. There is, however, a dispute between unionists and nationalists about what such a bill of rights might contain. Sir Patrick said he opposed incorporating the European convention on human rights into English and Welsh law but added: 'It doesn't flow from that that I would necessarily oppose a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.'

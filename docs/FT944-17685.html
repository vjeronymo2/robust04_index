			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Greek 'spies' lose appeal An Albanian appeals court yesterday upheld guilty verdicts on five ethnic-Greek minority leaders convicted of spying for Athens but reduced their jail sentences for reasons of clemency. The move failed to appease the Greek government, which called their original trial a political farce. The five were arrested last April after Greek-speaking gunmen killed two Albanian soldiers in a conscript camp near the border. Since their trial began in August, Greece has vetoed an Ecu35m (Pounds 27.54m) loan to Albania, effectively sealed its border and sent back about 70,000 illegal Albanian immigrants.</p>

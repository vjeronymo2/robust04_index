Henrietta D. Amezcua repeatedly complained about the supervisor, who  eventually was fired.  </P> <P> But Amezcua was forced to quit the El Segundo office because "there was no  possibility of advancement" after she was labeled a troublemaker and ostracized  in her department, she said. A Hughes spokesman said the company has not seen  the suit. (Filed April 26, 1990. Case No. 90-2097)  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It is the duty of the Czech Republic to insure the  safety standards of the nuclear power industry on its territory,  and Austria has neither the right nor the duty to intervene in  this matter. This was the indirect reaction of Vladimir Dlouhy,  minister of trade and industry, to claims made by Peter  Rosenstingl, the Austrian Freedom Party spokesman, that the  Czech nuclear power industry was becoming an ever-more-serious  safety hazard for the whole of Europe.    According to Minister Dlouhy, the causes of the fire at the  Dukovany nuclear power station were of a routine nature and  therefore should not be interpreted as evidence of the Czech  Republic's obsolete technology and its failure to insure nuclear  safety. Such a breakdown could happen anywhere. The fact that  it has happened just now is rather unpleasant, added Vladimir  Dlouhy.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nissan faces a strategic dilemma  -A look at the Japanese group's attempts at recovery WHEN Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest vehicle maker, announced Y21.99bn (Dollars 180m) parent company net interim losses this week, Mr Atushi Muramatsu, executive vice-president, gave a telling clue about the terrible dilemma the company faces as it charts a path to recovery. According to Mr Muramatsu, Nissan lost domestic market share partly because Nissan dealers were not discounting vehicles enough to match the competition. Instead, they were attempting to boost profits by maintaining a reasonable margin on each sale. In the future, Mr Muramatsu suggested, prices would have to be cut to prevent Nissan losing even more customers. His remarks are an ironic turnabout for the company. Just half a year ago, Mr Yutaka Kume, then president and now chairman, said Nissan would stop placing so much emphasis on market share and would attempt to sell vehicles by stressing high quality, not low prices. In six months, the strategy appears to have run its course. With unit sales plummeting 12.5 per cent at home and its domestic market share falling by 1.2 points to 22.2 per cent, Nissan is in no position to dictate prices to its customers. The fact remains that Nissan manages a capital-intensive, volume-driven business, in which the economies of scale, and therefore profits, collapse rapidly when sales decline. While Nissan's short-term difficulties are no doubt caused by the collapse in consumer spending in Japan, the sales volume versus profit margin choice reflects a deeper difficulty facing the company: how to position itself between Toyota, with a commanding 40 per cent share of the market, and company's such as Honda, Mazda and Mitsubishi Motors, which are smaller and more nimble. For years Nissan tried to take on Toyota, selling a full range of middle-of-the road vehicles designed to appeal to a mass, high-volume market. Nissan, however, could never match Toyota's economies of scale and never approached Toyota's super-efficient management style. It watched its market share erode steadily from 30 per cent to 24 per cent by the mid-1980s. Mr Kume managed to stem the slide for several years by introducing a proliferation of radically-styled vehicles that brightened the image of the company among consumers. Unfortunately, however, where Nissan led, Honda, Mitsubishi, Mazda and to some extent Toyota, followed with great success, virtually wiping out any gains for Nissan. Nissan now finds itself with a broad slate of models on the market, about the same number as Toyota, but with only half of Toyota's volumes. And its consolidated debt has risen dangerously, to a net Y3,568bn, or 147 per cent of equity, at the end of March. More fundamentally, Nissan's strategic dilemma is unsolved: should it be the general motor manufacturer offering a full range of models to serve all needs, or should it be more like its smaller rivals, which have very successfully targeted individual models to well-defined customer groups? For the time being, Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, appointed Nissan president in June, appears content to straddle the line between these two choices while focusing his attention on reducing costs. Mr Tsuji, who came out of the engineering side of the business, believes Nissan's cars are too complicated to build, and he has set a goal of raising labour productivity by 10 per cent a year for three years. Nissan is adopting other measures to cut costs, such as banning overtime, reducing new hiring, and shrinking the size of the workforce by 4,000, or 6 per cent, in three years. The question, however, is whether Nissan's competitors and its customers will give it this much time to adjust. Nissan says it should be able to break even in the second half of the year, but this appears optimistic given the steep plunge in its sales in recent months. While vehicles sales in Japan fell by 14 per cent in October, Nissan sales plummeted by 23 per cent. At the same time, Toyota has shown no sign of wanting to lift its margins by raising prices. Rather, its value-for-money approach to serving customers is riding through the recession unscathed and this directly increases the pressure on Nissan. The fact is that with Toyota, Nissan and Mazda recently building new factories, Japan has far too much manufacturing capacity. Most analysts reckon the market is unlikely to regain its 1990 peak in sales volume until after 1995, and is unlikely, for demographic reasons, ever again to show sustained, rapid growth, following the surge of the late 1980s. Thus manufacturing capacity will have to be severely pruned and given Nissan's weak balance sheet and poor profitability, it could easily be forced to make unpalatable choices in the months ahead.</p>

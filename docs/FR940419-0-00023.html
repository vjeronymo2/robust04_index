			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Acquisition by PHAs of HUD's single family acquired properties must routinely follow the established current procedures used by HUD's Division of Single Family Property Disposition (SFPD). This includes the process by which all other nonprofit organizations and government agencies purchase properties. After a PHA receives notice of property availability, the PHA has 5 days to indicate interest and then an additional 15 days to submit a signed sales contract. Upon execution of the contract by SFPD, the PHA will close the sale within the Field Office closing timeframe, generally 30&hyph;60 days. During this remaining period, all regulatory and statutory regulations must be met by the PHA before the transfer of title to and payment of funds by the PHA or the contract is null and void. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD would like to expedite sales to PHAs and encourages PHAs to contact the Director of Housing Management in the HUD field office having jurisdiction over the area in which the PHA has authority to determine the availability of HUD-owned single family properties, and the status of HUD-held mortgages which may be in the process of being foreclosed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purchase of Properties Owned by the Veteran's Administration (VA) and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement between the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, a framework will be established for a continuing working relationship between HUD and VA to coordinate the sale of VA-acquired properties to PHAs. Upon request, the local VA field office will make available a list, by computer or otherwise, of single family (one to four units) properties owned by VA and located within the PHA's jurisdiction. PHAs will have a right of first option on these properties for a period of time from the date the list is furnished to the PHA, and the PHA and VA will follow an agreed upon procedure for the property purchase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to RTC properties, RTC sells foreclosed single family properties in conjunction with its responsibilities for resolving failed financial institutions. Under the RTC's Affordable Housing Disposition (AHD) Program, public agencies, nonprofit organizations and low/moderate-income buyers have an exclusive right for a period of time to purchase lower-priced single family properties that the RTC has placed on the market. RTC offers these properties at their fair market value and publicizes the availability of these properties through various state and local housing agencies and Federal Home Loan Banks, which serve as property information clearinghouses. PHAs are to contact the Affordable Housing Disposition Department Head at the local RTC field offices in order to be placed on the RTC property mailing list. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has determined that the changes made by this rule should be adopted without the delay occasioned by requiring prior notice and comment. These changes primarily constitute a change in the Department's own review procedures and the elimination of a requirement to obtain prior approval of the Assistant Secretary before a PHA may acquire certain properties. As such, prior notice and comment are unnecessary, and the rule is exempt under 24 CFR part 10 from notice and comment requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Findings and Certifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Federalism <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule do not have federalism implications and, thus, are not subject to review under the Order. This rule removes a layer of prior HUD review and approval and allows Field Offices to exercise more discretion at multiple processing stages for the acquisition of certain properties. It will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationships with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Family Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this rule will have only an indirect, though beneficial, impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, since it should simplify the development of housing by PHAs, and thus, is not subject to review under the Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 56402) under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 941 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grant programs_housing and community development, Loan programs_housing and community development, Public housing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Department amends 24 CFR part 941 as set forth below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 941_PUBLIC HOUSING DEVELOPMENT <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

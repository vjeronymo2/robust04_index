			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Political, Economic Situation and Finances"; </F> for related reporting on this topic see FBIS-LAT-94-016 p. 3]    [Text] The first discussions have begun among labor union  leaders and workers to analyze the country's economic situation  and the way the resulting financial imbalance is affecting it.    In this process, it is clear that the basic intent is to  examine, from the standpoint of each workplace, the true causes  of economic inefficiency and its impact on the financial  imbalances, and to suggest methods of combining economic and  political considerations in the actions the country must  undertake.    Stimulated by the call of their union leaders, the workers  must be cognizant of their active role in the country's economic  reorganization, and must be willing to accept the financial  measures that are ultimately adopted, even if they involve some  sacrifice.    It is obvious in these discussions that the most important  thing in our economy is to be efficient in every possible way,  and the only reasonable means of achieving that goal is to cut  costs, boost labor productivity, and get the most out of the  inputs we have.    With the authority of those who do not abandon their posts,  the speakers are demanding more than ever before that we  maintain a high degree of labor discipline, which at a time like  this depends on attitude, awareness of social duty, and  patriotism. What is at stake, more than anything else, is the  defense of the workers' most genuine interests.    We must not wait for any external measure, but must adopt  those measures we can implement right now to make our economy  more effective. Those measures are in areas where we have raw  materials and where the productive processes have not been  halted and top-quality service is being provided for the  country: the sugar harvest, sugarcane and agricultural  production, fishing, mining and mineral processing, tourism,  pharmaceuticals, science centers, and vital activities such as  health and education, among others.    Few imaginable financial proposals do not involve real or  apparent conflicts of interest or differences of opinion.    Thus, when a worker proposes to raise the prices of certain  products, another worker may remind him that there are  relatively low wages in a wide range of occupations, while a  third may argue that it would be better to accept increases in  certain items that the family budget can afford rather than  having to pay for vital services such as education and health,  which are difficult to pay for on an individual basis.  ks it is better to give subsidies to low-income people than to  subsidize the sale of products at below-cost prices, another  will explain how difficult and complex such subsidy mechanisms  are.    Among the workers' concerns are the intolerable presence of  crime, its relationship to the black market, and its impact on  social and labor discipline. The workers want to find ways of  eliminating the theft and diversions that are driving up costs,  demoralizing the collectives, and enriching money hoarders and  traffickers. They demand that the authorities take drastic  measures that will set an example at all levels.    In connection with the above, they have expressed the need  to  readjust and properly enforce the financial requirements for  collections and payments between enterprises. The present  situation is in fact promoting a lack of discipline and may  actually cover up crime. In any event, the workers and their  unions must monitor efforts in the field to solve this problem.    Another frequent topic of discussion is the tax system: what  it consists of, how it may be expanded, what economic activities  may be sources of additional funding for the state, and how  citizens can increase their support for it.    These and other issues are debated. The fact is that the  workers are fully involved in the consideration and solution of  the problems that affect them the most.    After four years of heroic resistance, the people of Cuba  are  entering a phase that is in significant ways more aggressive in  the struggle to safeguard the sovereignty of the fatherland and  the socialist nature of the revolution.    It is hoped that in 1994, signs of economic recovery will be  seen in some vital activities and areas of production, thanks to  the process of financial adjustment based on a high degree of  political consensus.    Once again, we hail the wisdom of the National People's  Government Assembly in postponing decisionmaking and  categorically denying that the intent is to formulate a  so-called "packet of measures."    The truth is that the idea of a "packet of measures" smacks  of Third World capitalism, of neoliberal policies under which  the workers wake up one day to the news that prices have  skyrocketed, enterprises are being privatized and half the  employees are to be laid off, wages are falling, and social  benefits have been abruptly eliminated.    Reality forces us to make an economic adjustment, but we  will  do it in the socialist way, the Cuban way, with democratic  formulas that are truly unimaginable for other societies.    We are aware, of course, that the harsh situation of an  economy that has had to withstand devastating blows, as ours  has, causes many people to lose their patience and to yearn for  "rescue measures."    Considering the complexity of our problems, however, we  realize that it is naive to expect that measures can act like a  magic wand, graciously granting every wish.    We urgently need to improve our economic efficiency, but we  must not rush into technical solutions without first reconciling  them with their political repercussions.    Hence the importance of continuing to expand and improve  this  democratic and educational process that is so aptly named the  Workplace Parliament, without allowing the slightest hint of  ritual or formalism to taint it.    The workers' voice must be heard loud and clear everywhere.    It is imperative that management be forthcoming with  accurate  information so that the economic and financial situation of each  workplace can be assessed.    Trade union leaders must devote their energies to carrying  out this lofty political task, the true path to the economic  efficiency that Cuba needs to triumph.</p>

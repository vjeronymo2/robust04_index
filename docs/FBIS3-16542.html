			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Kondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 16 March -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev intends on 17 and 18 March to visit military formations  and units in Kaliningrad oblast. He announced this today at a  meeting with journalists.    The head of the country's defense department denied reports  by some of the foreign mass media that he had not left for  Leningrad military district because of extreme social tension in  society requiring, it is claimed, the presence in Moscow of a  "strong hand." He also said that the reports that troops in  Moscow military district had allegedly been put on an enhanced  readiness footing were false.    At the ITAR-TASS correspondent's request Pavel Grachev  explained that he is one of those in possession of a so-called  nuclear button. One button is with the Russian President, who is  at present in Sochi; the second button is with himself; and the  third is with the Chief of the General Staff, who has gone to  France on a working visit. Pavel Grachev emphasized that,  although the president has in his possession a control system  for the strategic nuclear forces in the form of a "small nuclear  case," there should always be one of the military leaders in  Moscow at the permanent control point.    "This evening, the Chief of the General Staff is returning  from Paris, and tomorrow I shall be leaving for Kaliningrad in  accordance with the plan for visiting troops", Pavel Grachev  stated in conclusion.</p>

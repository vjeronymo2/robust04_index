			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An experts panel which probed the failure of the  maiden PSLV [polar satellite launch vehicle] launch last  September says that a software error in the pitch-controlled  loop of the guidance and control processor led to the setback.  According to the chairman of the panel, Mr. N. Pant, the error  occurred when the control command exceeded the maximum limiting  value. The panel, however, confirmed that all the major  systems, including the giant solid booster and the liquid  propulsion systems of the PSLV worked as planned. There is no  lacuna in the rocket design also.    The finding of the panel was released by the Indian Space  Research Organization in Bangalore today.</p>

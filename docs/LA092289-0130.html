			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT AND THE ARTS;  </P> <P> THE MAN WHO WOULD BE ARTS KING  </P> <P> At a pace more appropriate to a forced march than a gallery tour, John E.  Frohnmayer was showing a small group of visitors the 20th-Century art  collection that adorns the two floors of his downtown law firm.  </P> <P> As might be expected of the man who is to appear in Washington today for the  opening of his confirmation hearings as President Bush's nominee to head the  National Endowment for the Arts, Frohnmayer was a member of the law firm's art  selection committee when the works were bought.  </P> <P> In almost perfunctory fashion, he recited the names and backgrounds of the  mainly Oregonian artists. On reaching "Yuba 4," a tall copper-clad redwood work  by sculptor Mel Schuler in the 17th-floor reception area, he suddenly laughed  heartily -- an unabashed, genuine laugh from deep down in the gut.  </P> <P> Given the nature of his nomination and the ugly political crisis in which the  national endowment finds itself over its indirect support of artworks that some  call obscene or sacrilegious, he had realized that he might be well advised to  issue a disclaimer.  </P> <P> "There's a very phallic piece down there," Frohnmayer said finally to his  guests. And then he laughed again.  </P> <P> He is like that. He is a genuinely informal yet deeply introspective attorney  -- who happens to also hold a degree in theology. He is a veteran of the  Vietnam War, rows competitively on the local Willamette River, has studied  voice extensively and once had the option, which he declined, of pursuing an  operatic career. He seems a man of consummately lowbrow exterior but highbrow  insides.  </P> <P> He is a moderate Republican -- though he insists he detests political labels --  whose personal tastes in music span an entire range of classical to Broadway  and 1960s folk, and in art favor the abstract over the representational.  Politically, he is close to Oregon's Republican senators, Bob Packwood and Mark  Hatfield, and to liberal Democratic Rep. Les AuCoin too.  </P> <P> Sitting in his 18th-floor office with a view straight out at the west hills of  Portland, where he lives with his wife, Leah, and two teen-age sons -- one of  whom is in college and the other a high school senior -- Frohnmayer paused for  a second to focus on this most crucial current question for not only the  endowment's chairman but the organization as a whole.  </P> <P> "My response to people who argue that the federal government has no legitimate  role in supporting the arts is that we're not here just to be protected," he  said finally. "The government doesn't exist just to put an impregnable ring of  missiles around the United States, because there has to be something in the  middle there -- something we're protecting.  </P> <P> "And that is the ability of Americans to exercise artistic freedom. To learn  through the arts that there are a number of different ways to look at things,  which is the fundamental basis of a cooperative society."  </P> <P> He has met with Bush only once -- briefly -- before being nominated for the  post in July. But he expects Bush to support the arts endowment  enthusiastically -- if only because, at a funding level of about $171 million  next year, it represents a cheap way to make a highly visible political  impression.  </P> <P> He is unashamedly an Oregonian. He makes no apologies for being a stranger to  the Beltway -- the highway system that more or less surrounds Washington. He  emphasizes his respect for the essential role of major East Coast cultural  institutions but sees the arts as much less elitist than bluebloods of what  could be called the nation's Ahhts Establishment.  </P> <P> "The fact that I'm not from any of those places (in the Northeast corridor  including Washington, Philadelphia, New York and Boston) and the fact that I am  from Portland, Ore., I think will do something toward changing the perception"  of the arts endowment as an elitist preserve, he said.  </P> <P> "But I'm certainly not unmindful of the major, high-budget institutions in the  country. They are absolutely critical in terms of our long-term artistic  health."  </P> <P> With his brother Dave, who is Oregon's attorney general, Frohnmayer started a  singing group called Frohn's Tunes that performs popular songs with lyrics  rewritten as political spoofs each year at a forum for Oregon Republicans  called the Dorchester Conference.  </P> <P> A recent example was a devastating satire on the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, whom  Dave Frohnmayer had played a large role in running out of the state. Sung to  the tune "Ghost Riders in the Sky," the chorus went:  </P> <P>  "Give me a Rolls  </P> <P>  Give me a Royce  </P> <P>  The life of a guru is choice."  </P> <P> But behind this studied informality, there is a side of John Frohnmayer that  believes passionately in the federal government's role as a catalyst for the  arts. It is what first led him to seek the job eight years ago from  then-President Ronald Reagan, who chose a career bureaucrat, Frank Hodsoll,  instead.  </P> <P> If a swing through Washington last week, in which Frohnmayer met with 20 key  members of Congress, is any indication, the Portland trial lawyer and First  Amendment expert can expect an easy time in his confirmation. He even had a  cordial half-hour meeting with Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), author of an  amendment to the national endowment's 1990 appropriation bill that would ban  federal support for any art that is "offensive, indecent or sacrilegious."  </P> <P> In an interview here this week, Frohnmayer declined to describe the encounter  with Helms, but the senator is said to understand that his amendment may not  survive a House-Senate conference committee.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer has likewise been circumspect in discussing details of the overall  political unpleasantness surrounding the endowment. He has adhered to a  strategy that relies on him keeping his thoughts about such things private  until senators who vote on his confirmation have an opportunity to ask such  questions themselves.  </P> <P> However, Helms also is said to have made it clear that he believes he has  increased his own political capital by pressing his campaign against the  endowment. Helms, who did not respond to calls seeking his comment, is said to  believe that, while there will be a viable national endowment for Frohnmayer to  run when he takes over next month, the period of confrontation with  conservatives over what is -- and is not -- appropriate subject matter for  government-supported art may have only just begun.  </P> <P> "We in the endowment need to mend our fences," Frohnmayer said. "By that I mean  with the Congress. And we need to let them know that we are an agency that is  responsive and responsible and is really going to do something for our society  which is exemplary.  </P> <P> "I don't think one necessarily has to agree with every criticism that's  leveled, but I do think that one has to take (the criticism) seriously and  responsibly. Where we really need work is in emphasizing the positive of the  agency."  </P> <P> Frohnmayer, 47, was born in Medford, Ore., one of three sons and a daughter of  a lawyer father and music teacher/arts patron mother. Dave and John Frohnmayer  became lawyers -- though John flirted with a religious calling, attending Union  Theological Seminary in New York as a Rockefeller Fellow. He holds a master's  degree in Christian ethics from the University of Chicago.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer's two other siblings, Mira and Philip, are musicians and music  teachers. But music has been a common vehicle for the whole family. John  Frohnmayer mastered the guitar as a teen-ager and has kept up his voice  instruction throughout his legal career. Dave Frohnmayer, who describes himself  as the least accomplished musician in the family, still managed to win a  celebrity "battle of the batons" benefit for the Eugene Symphony.  </P> <P> Although John Frohnmayer's theological background has drawn little attention,  it may turn out to be directly relevant to the endowment crisis. One of the  works that got the endowment into trouble was an image of a photograph, "Piss  Christ," of a crucifix immersed in urine, by New York photographer Andres  Serrano.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer has consistently refused to discuss his personal feelings about this  image or the homoerotic and sadomasochistic photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe,  which make up the other immediate cause of the controversy. But it is known  that, regarding "Piss Christ," his personal theological reading of the image is  that it is not sacrilegious but could be seen as a legitimate commentary on the  brutal persecution of early Christians that the cross first symbolized.  </P> <P> He is said to find the body of Mapplethorpe's work -- most of which was  well-received art photography -- a significant contribution to the medium but  to question the choice of subject matter of the photographer who died of AIDS  this year at 43.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer served in the Navy aboard the light cruiser Oklahoma City off the  coast of Vietnam in the late 1960s. A lawyer in Eugene and then in Portland  beginning in 1972, he has specialized in civil litigation. Frohnmayer has a  special interest in First Amendment law and has represented Oregon newspapers  and television stations.  </P> <P> He was a member of the Oregon Arts Commission for seven years and president for  four. He is on the board of Chamber Music Northwest; has sung in New York,  Chicago and Palo Alto; directed a sculpture competition in Eugene in 1974, and  was on a committee to select sculpture for a new Capitol in Salem in 1977.  </P> <P> It was the Capitol sculpture that may have been Frohnmayer's first brush with  the rough and tumble of politics, Dave Frohnmayer recalls. At the time, Dave  was a state representative who had opposed financing of the sculpture John had  helped to choose. This development was not well received in Salem, but John  defused the controversy by inviting an articulate sculptor to testify about  acquisition of the artwork.  </P> <P> "A strength of his is his real steadiness," Dave Frohnmayer said of his  brother. "He's very cool under fire. He has a very engaging sense of  self-effacing humor. He's not full of himself and he's not going to be one to  lose his cool at the first setback."  </P> <P> These are attributes that likely will be important in John Frohnmayer's tenure  at the national endowment.  </P> <P> "I think he'll have a real good sense of where he wants to end up," said Dave  Frohnmayer. "He has a good sense of vision and goal-setting. That's very  important instead of just blowing in the political wind."  </P> <P> John Frohnmayer will need all of those skills in his new job; he is all but  certain to be confirmed by the Senate. He will take over a demoralized  endowment wracked by political crisis and decimated by a series of resignations  and imminent resignations of key staff members.  </P> <P> By the time Frohnmayer is expected to arrive next month, the national endowment  will be without its deputy chairman, director of policy and planning, general  counsel, director of administration and the heads of four of its programs,  including the crucially important theater and music divisions.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer is expected to move quickly to shape his own new management team --  which, because of the extent of the vacancies, is expected to reshape the  direction of the national endowment virtually overnight. He talks about a new  era of openness and responsiveness at the arts endowment -- apparently,  endowment insiders say, after Frohnmayer received a torrent of complaints in  his visits to Capitol Hill last week that the agency is stuffy, aloof, arrogant  and just plain snotty.  </P> <P> "I would hope that the endowment would be a very open place," he said. "I think  accessibility is often a problem if you're a federal agency. I'd even like us  to have an 800 (toll-free telephone) number and to see if there are ways we can  be more visible around the country."  </P> <P> Frohnmayer is also expected to move almost immediately to start exploring  financing methods the endowment has not previously attempted. He noted that the  endowment has never attempted to function as a true endowment would. He said  his own analysis of the endowment's enabling legislation has led him to believe  it could accept private donations, make loans and perhaps even hold investments  -- all operating tools common to endowments.  </P> <P> Clearly, Frohnmayer believes he can overcome the political and management  problems and get on with his vision of the arts endowment's role in American  society. It's an inclusionary, grass-roots, even populist arts philosophy.  </P> <P> "One dream scenario," he said, "would be that, in every community in the  country, there are imagination celebrations and art teachers in the schools who  really turn kids on to creativity and music teachers who can work with the kids  as alternatives to gang life.  </P> <P> "The objective is to see the U.S. as a nation where people are really  practicing the arts. It's not corny to sing. It's not wimpy to paint. You  shouldn't get derision if you do ballet. There needs to be a sense that  creativity and the arts are normal things to do. That's the ultimate of a  creative society."  </P></p>

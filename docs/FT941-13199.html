			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Boots demand Fresh speculation erupted over the future of Boots' pharmaceutical division, prompted this time by a press report, and the shares were actively traded. A feeling among some brokers - UBS and Panmure Gordon among them - that the shares were looking oversold from recent weak sessions also contributed to a rise for the stock, which touched 567p before closing 1 1/2 up at 563p. Turnover was a busy 3.7m. Boots denied that it was planning to sell its drugs arm. Speculation over such a move has been rife since the company's well-publicised and costly abandonment of its Manoplax heart drug last summer. However, analysts remain convinced that a restructuring at Boots will lead to the sale of the prescription drugs business, while leaving the over the counter medicine division intact. Pearson, the media conglomerate and owner of the Financial Times, rose 11 to 655p against the market as word leaked out that agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite was preparing a strong buy recommendation on the stock. Turnover of 7.2m was one of the highest on record. The house is believed to be citing the stock's underperformance against the market last year and improved performance at satellite broadcaster BSkyB, in which Pearson owns almost 18 per cent. Reuters Holdings remained strong ahead of figures due on February 8. Buying from the US lay behind a rise in London of 28 to 1933p. Some leading pharmaceutical shares were influenced by a research document from Credit Lyonnais Laing which recommended Zeneca, SmithKline Beecham, Wellcome and Medeva. But the sector trickled back later, with internationally traded stocks led down by selling in the US. Zeneca lost 2 to 808p, SmithKline 4 to 428p and Wellcome 12 to 670p. Medeva held at 168p, Glaxo shed 6 1/2 to 654 1/2 p as dealers noted that US investors had continued to sell the stock. The US holding fell to 18.55 per cent of the total, from 19.8 per cent just before Christmas. Fisons firmed 2 to 140p after the troubled pharmaceuticals and scientific instruments group announced a Pounds 35m savings plan and analysts raised 1995 and 1996 forecasts. The savings figure is Pounds 10m more than Fisons announced as a target last month, and Mr Ian Smith of Lehman Brothers adjusted his forecast of 1995 profits to around Pounds 170m, against Pounds 164m previously. Bank shares succumbed to the market-wide selling pressure, with the Hong Kong-influenced stocks affected by the decline in the Hang Seng index and strong rumours that the Hong Kong market may tumble again this morning. HSBC dropped 24 to 954p and Standard Chartered 35 to 1310p. Lloyds Bank, the first of the big four to report preliminary results, suffered from a bout of determined profit-taking and fell 19 to 637p. Sun Alliance (5.2m traded) and Royal Insurance (5.6m) were the big turnover stocks in a composite insurance sector hit by strong profit-taking. Royal settled 11 off at 330p in spite of some low key but ever present support from influential marketmakers, while Sun slipped 4 to 400p. GEC, sustained by a Hoare Govett buy note giving the stock a target price of 370p, managed a minor improvement at 336 1/2 p. Costain, still boosted by stories that Hanson, among others, is about to bid for the company's US coal interests, rose 3 to 38 1/2 p as turnover in the shares rocketed to 14m. Better than expected results that were accompanied by an upbeat analysts meeting pushed conglomerate Lonrho up 8 to 153p in strong trading of 13m shares. Overseas buying continued in British Steel, once again leading to hefty turnover of 31m, as the shares eased with the market to finish a penny lighter at 131 1/2 p. TI Group slipped 8 to 421p after UBS downgraded its recommendation on the stock from a buy to a hold. It was 'take profits' advice from SG Warburg that left GKN trailing 6 at 596p. Lucas Industries put on 2 at 214p. The stock is one of a basket of seven engineering shares on which Morgan Stanley, the US investment house, has issued a two-year call warrant. The warrant was issued at 18.08p. Public relations group Shandwick rose 2 to 35 1/2 p on announcing that it was back in the black with a full-year profit of Pounds 4.8m, against a previous loss of Pounds 2.5m. Among food manufacturers, Booker, off 18 at 455p, and Hazlewood, down 2 at 167 1/2 p, suffered from 'take profits' advice from Strauss Turnbull, which recommended Northern Foods, 3 ahead at 261p. Cadbury-Schweppes, up 15 at one stage, had its progress checked by a negative note from Salomon Brothers and closed unchanged at 531p. Burton Group eased 2 3/4 to 68 1/2 p on nervousness ahead of results expected tomorrow. Talk of a beer price war in the retail trade rumbled on for a second day and cast further gloom on the big domestic brewers. Bass retreated 11 to 579p, Whitbread 'A' 10 to 604p, Allied-Lyons 9 to 650p and Grand Metropolitan 11 to 469p.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: WELL-TRAVELED CHEF TRIES HER OWN PLACE  </P> <P> Cindy Black has cooked in many different contexts over the years.  </P> <P> She started off as an apprentice at the legendary Madeleine Kamman's Chez La  Meaigure Madeleine in Boston, then worked at places as diverse as the respected  Le Cabanon in Mages in far southwestern France), Apley's in the Boston Sheraton  and Sheppard's at the Sheraton Harbor Island West in San Diego. Subsequently,  she became executive chef of the San Diego-based Piret's group of delis and  bistros, for whom, among other things, she supervised the opening of the  short-lived Piret's in Beverly Hills in 1987. When San Diego's Paragon  Restaurant Group took over Piret's, she became corporate chef for the whole  organization, developing dishes and menu concepts for such Paragon properties  as the Hungry Hunter, Rusty Pelican and Monterey Whaling Company restaurants.  </P> <P> Now, for the first time in her life, she has opened her own restaurant --  called simply Cindy Black's. Located in the Bird Rock area of La Jolla, the  place serves Black's interpretations of country French dishes, with occasional  Italian and American touches. Typical specialties include barbecued eggplant  salad, chicken liver rillettes, spaghetti with pancetta and a fried egg,  Provencal-style chicken stew, and roast leg of lamb with garlic mousse. Cindy  Black's is open for dinner only, Tuesday through Sunday, with a special  fixed-price dinner on that last day, featuring what Black calls "Sunday-dinner  sort of food."  </P> <P> THE BRITISH ARE COMING: Is Beverly Hills going British-club crazy? It was  reported recently in this space that London-based entrepreneur Peter  Stringfellow plans to open a local branch of his Stringfellow's  "restaurant-clubs" in the Golden Ghetto's new Two Rodeo Building later this  year. Now comes word that another Londoner, veteran club owner Alfred Barnett,  is coming to town. Barnett, who has owned and operated such London hot spots as  the Four Hundred, the Curzon House, the Palm Beach Club and the Ad Lib Club,  plans to install an establishment called Madeleine's on the corner of Roxbury  and Little Santa Monica. Like Stringfellow, Barnett promises that his dining  room will be "among the best restaurants in L.A." Both will also feature piano  music and "touch dancing." Madeleine's will have a cozy, intimate atmosphere,  it is promised, giving Angelenos "a place to go where they can dress to the  nines without attending a society fund-raiser or opening." There is nothing, of  course, that Angelenos have been crying out for more plaintively in recent  years than a place where they can go "dressed to the nines." That's the L.A.  style, all right. . . .  </P> <P> NOT SO BOUZY: Bouzy Rouge in Newport Beach has instituted an "under-indulgence"  policy, offering half-size cocktails and after-dinner drinks (at half-price)  for customers who might wish to sample something alcoholic without making a  serious commitment of blood alcohol. Here's another idea along the same lines:  In Germany, wine is sometimes packaged in 500-milliliter bottles, halfway  between a half-bottle and a full one. Though our own Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco  and Firearms, which establishes federal policies for alcoholic beverages  (including labeling laws and bottle-size limits), won't approve 500s for the  American market, there's nothing to stop restaurateurs from offering  500-milliliter carafes of decent house wine. Carafes are almost never used in  U.S. restaurants for anything more than bulk wines, and I think that's a pity.  A 500-milliliter serving of decent sauvignon blanc or zinfandel, pinot grigio  or chianti would be a perfect accompaniment to a light meal for a sensible  couple of diners.  </P> <P> WHAT'S COOKING: Opera in Santa Monica has remodeled and reopened as Opera on  Ocean, with two of the original investors in the place, Lou and Bernice Weider,  as new owners. Chef Steve Neveaux continues in charge of the kitchen, with a  menu that includes items from the original Opera menu as well as a number of  new dishes. . . . Rannock Moor venison on a pickled walnut and game glaze, and  a dessert of oatmeal, heather honey, and hazelnuts soaked in malt whiskey are  among the contemporary Scottish specialties to be prepared by Billy Campbell,  executive chef of the legendary St. Andrews Old Course Hotel in Scotland,  Monday through Saturday at the Newport Beach Four Seasons. . . . Kurt Niklaus  reports that he has entered negotiations to build a third Bistro Garden with  the developers of the forthcoming Water Garden office in Santa Monica. That  development will include 1.26-million square feet of floor space, a 1.4-acre  lake, a health club and a day-care center. . . . And Tony Roma's in Beverly  Hills has closed, the victim of (as is so often the case in that community  these days) escalating rents.  </P></p>

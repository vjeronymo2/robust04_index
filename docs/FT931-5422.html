			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Volatile Mexico keeps a careful eye on Clinton - Big reactions to small events One week ago, Mexico's stock market was in trouble. Down 18 per cent from the January 6 high of 1,836, the market had been rocked by President Bill Clinton's equivocal commitment to the North American Free Trade Agreement, and subsequent higher interest rates. But just as despondency was about to set in, the market shot up 2.8 per cent last Friday, and in one week has gained around 6.5 per cent. The market seemingly decided, after last Friday's set-piece speech by Mr Clinton on international relations, that stocks were cheap, and that the US president was, after all, solidly behind Nafta. Always one of the world's more volatile markets, Mexico has this year hit new records for its sensitivity to small events. Whereas in the past, volatility may have been affected by news in individual stocks, recently, as Mr Roberto Barrera, of the brokerage Invermexico, points out, almost all Mexican stocks have gone up or down together, mainly in reaction to news about Nafta and movements on Wall Street. The day Mr Clinton's administration slapped duties on imported steel, the bolsa fell 2.2 per cent, fearing protectionism from the White House. When Mr Richard Gephardt, the leader of Democrats in the US House of Representatives, complained about a Dollars 3.75m Mexican government investment in a fund that bought US companies and moved them to Mexico, another 2.1 per cent was lost. When Mr Brian Mulroney announced his intention to resign, the Canadian problem suddenly became current and the Mexican market shed a further 1.75 per cent. While such falls partly reflect Wall Street's negative reaction to Mr Clinton's economic plan, fears over Nafta were crucial. The treaty's prompt approval matters so much, analysts argue, because it will encourage more direct investment into Mexico, and improve expectations of such investment. This should allow interest rates to fall since pressure to attract short-term money market investment to finance the fast growing trade deficit will have subsided. Lower interest rates will increase growth and corporate earnings, and on top, make the equity market more attractive relative to the money market. Further still, says Mr Jorge Mariscal of Goldman Sachs, the safe passage of Nafta should allow a significant increase in government spending to coincide with next year's presidential elections. The perceived dependence on a single event outside the Mexican government's control explains the full extent of the bolsa's reaction to nuances of US economic and trade policy. And since foreign, mainly US, investors dominate trading in Mexico's liquid stocks such as Telmex, there is nothing the Mexican authorities or institutions can do to reduce their exposure. But unlike last June, when the market tumbled for similar reasons, there has yet to be any pressure on the peso, which has devalued by far less than the 40 centavos a day permitted by the Bank of Mexico. Mr Jacques Levy, head of the international side at Banamex-Accival, Mexico's largest financial institution, says: 'While people talk about the current account deficit problem, Nafta and so on, I have to sell dollars to the central bank every day.' Foreigners have simply switched their investment from the equity market to money markets and CDs. The 28-day interest on Cetes, Mexican government paper, is now at 18 per cent, about 15 percentage points above the equivalent paper in the US. The higher yield for most investors more than offsets the risk of a devaluation against the dollar. For the rest of the year, analysts are expecting still more volatility while news about Nafta remains unclear. Nevertheless, 'this could change very quickly if the US sends a strong positive signal about Nafta', says Mr Mickey Schlein of Morgan Stanley. All eyes are thus focused on March 17, when US, Canadian and Mexican negotiators meet in Washington to discuss the proposed parallel agreements on labour, the environment and import surges.</p>

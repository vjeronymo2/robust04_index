			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: High-yielding sectors come under selling pressure MONDAY'S gains following the Bundesbank's interest rate cut and the devaluation of the lira were retraced yesterday as high-yielding markets came under heavy selling pressure. The sell-off in the markets perceived to be most vulnerable to devaluation, such as Italy, the UK and Sweden, came in spite of the results of two private polls commissioned by banks, which showed a narrow Yes majority for Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. ITALIAN bonds shed 1 1/2 points as the lira came under renewed pressure, despite Sunday's 7 per cent devaluation. The market lost most of the gains recorded on Monday, in the wake of the Bundesbank's interest rate cut. Far from being able to cut their own rates, as the Italian authorities had hoped, the Bank of Italy had to intervene in the foreign exchange market to support the lira. Fears that a second devaluation may be needed sparked a further crisis of confidence in the Italian bond market yesterday. 'There were no buyers yesterday, and there will not be any at least until the end of the week,' said one Italian bond trader. Rumours, later proved false, that Mr Guiliano Amato, Italy's prime minister, was to resign, further unsettled the market. The Italian BTP future on Liffe ended at 92.02, down from 93.63. UK GILT prices ended a point lower, after sterling came under renewed pressure. The weakness of the lira, and rumours of a devaluation of the Swedish krona fuelled fears over sterling. The short-sterling contract on Liffe ended at 89.15, discounting almost a full point rise in the base rate, as dealers speculated that a hike of as much as one percentage point could come by the end of the week. Weak producer prices data did not restore spirits, though attention was focused on the foreign exchange market. SWEDISH yields jumped in nervous trading on fears that the central bank would lose the battle with the foreign exchange market over the krona. Dealers said the market was looking for an early devaluation of the Swedish currency by up to 20 per cent. Talk of a capital outflow of SKr40bn on Monday prompted rumours that the central bank would have to reverse Monday's cut in the marginal lending rate to 20 per cent from 75 per cent. Official currency flow figures are due today. Dealers said that overnight money rates were more than 100 per cent and that one-month rates jumped from 17 per cent to 47 per cent. Three-month T-bills closed up 850 basis points at 27.5 per cent and 11-year bond yields were up 43 points at 11.23 per cent. DUTCH bonds closed about 15 cents higher after erasing modest morning losses. The release of a deficit-cutting budget contained few surprises and did not affect trading. The 8.25 per cent bond due June 2002 ended up 15 cents at 102.55 while its yield fell to 8.01 per cent from 8.04 per cent. The gap between 10-year Dutch and German yields fell further to 41 basis points from 43 earlier in the day. GERMAN bonds overcame a slightly easier start, as the market consolidated Monday's gains and the Treuhandanstalt issued DM4bn of 10-year bonds to end steady to slightly up. In the cash market, the benchmark 8 per cent Bunds due July 2002 rose 0.03 to 102.64 to yield 7.60 per cent, while the Liffe December Bund future traded at 90.21 late in the day after Monday's close of 90.16, in volume of 46,580 lots. FRENCH bonds drifted for most of the day to end slightly lower. The Treasury announced it was seeking between FFr12 and FFr14bn at its forthcoming auction of new two- and five-year notes, slightly more than the market had expected. The 8 1/2 per cent OATs of 2003 closed down 0.14 at 98.92 to yield 8.65 per cent compared with 8.63 per cent, while the 8 1/2 per cent OATs of 2023 fell 0.18 to 98.66 to yield 8.62 per cent. On the Matif, the September bond futures contract closed at 107.46, down 0.10 on volume of 135,650 lots. US Treasury bonds suffered a double blow yesterday as profit-taking combined with a reassessment of the significance of Germany's interest rate cut to produce a sell-off that pushed the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue nearly a full point lower. By late afternoon the 7.250 per cent paper maturing in August 2022 had fallen by of a point to 99 7/32 , to yield 7.309 per cent. Shorter-term maturities were less affected, although 10-year bonds were  15/32 lower at 99 15/16 to yield 6.370 per cent. Ms Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, said Treasuries were under downward pressure because of the hedging of US corporate positions as well as outright selling by institutional investors in what appeared to be profit-taking in the wake of Monday's highs. Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Securities said there was also 'creeping concern' in the bond market about the possible effects of a Clinton presidency. 'Clinton's spending programmes are front-ended, while his plans to generate revenues would come later,' Mr Hale said.</p>

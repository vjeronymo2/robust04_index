			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHILD PORN BAN EXTENDED TO HOMES  </P> <P> States may outlaw all possession and viewing of child pornography -- even in  one's own home, the Supreme Court ruled today as it imposed new limits on  freedom of expression and privacy.  </P> <P> By a 6-3 vote, the court upheld an Ohio law that makes it a crime to possess  so-called kiddie porn. The decision extends a 1982 ruling in which the justices  said production and distribution of sexual depictions of children can be  outlawed.  </P> <P> The justices had been told the Ohio law is the toughest kiddie porn legislation  in the nation.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the court, on narrower grounds, struck down the conviction of  Clyde Osborne of Columbus.  </P> <P> The justices said the jury was not instructed properly. They ordered a new  trial for Osborne, who had been sentenced to six months in prison and fined  $100 for possessing nude photos of a boy believed to be 13 or 14.  </P> <P> The case pitted the sanctity of the home against the safety and welfare of  children.  </P> <P> Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said Ohio legitimately seeks to  "destroy a market for the exploitative use of children" by making possession of  child pornography a crime.  </P> <P> "Given the importance of the state's interest in protecting the victims of  child pornography, we cannot fault Ohio for attempting to stamp out this vice  at all levels in the distribution chain," he said.  </P> <P> White also said Ohio's law is not too broad because it specifically forbids  possession of lewd material or material that focuses on genitals.  </P> <P> A prosecution could not be based on possession of innocuous photos of one's  children wearing no clothes, he said.  </P> <P> White was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Harry A.  Blackmun, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.  </P> <P> Justice William Brennan, the court's leading liberal and a major free-speech  advocate, said in dissent that the law was too broad, extending far beyond  child pornography.  </P> <P> "Pictures of topless bathers at a Mediterranean beach, of teen-agers in  revealing dress and even of toddlers romping unclothed, all might be  prohibited," he said.  </P> <P> "Pictures of fashion models wearing semitransparent clothing might be illegal,"  he said.  </P> <P> "Mr. Osborne's pictures may be distasteful, but the Constitution guarantees  both his right to possess them privately and his right to avoid punishment  under an overbroad law," Brennan concluded.  </P> <P> Joining Brennan's opinion were Justices Thurgood Marshall and John Paul  Stevens.  </P> <P> The court for over 30 years has allowed states to outlaw the sale and  distribution of obscene materials, ruling in a series of cases that it is not  constitutionally protected.  </P> <P> But the court in 1969 barred states from outlawing the mere at-home possession  of obscene materials.  </P> <P> The court in 1982 carved out its newest exception to free-speech rights. It let  states outlaw material depicting children in sexual performances or poses --  even if not obscene.  </P></p>

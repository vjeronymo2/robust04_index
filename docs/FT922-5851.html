			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Berry aims to sue Manpower for Pounds 1/2m THE FORMER chairman of Blue Arrow is to sue the company for about Pounds 500,000 in connection with his legal fees for the two Department of Trade and Industry inquiries into its activities, John Mason writes. The move by Mr Tony Berry follows the issuing of a writ in the High Court by City law firm D. J. Freeman. The firm, which acted for Mr Berry during the inquiries into the 1987 Blue Arrow rights issue, is claiming Pounds 234,817 in unpaid fees. Mr Berry will contest the action and also sue his old company, which has been renamed Manpower, for his total legal costs. Mr Berry says he has paid Freeman approximately Pounds 300,000. The money sought by Freeman is a balancing item. Although indemnified by Manpower for the DTI inquiries as a condition of his resignation in 1989, Mr Berry says he has yet to be reimbursed for any of the legal fees incurred. Mr Mitchell Fromstein, Manpower's chairman, said the company's decision on how much and when to pay Mr Berry depended on the outcome of the still unpublished second report. He believed the company had met Mr Berry's legal fees from the first inquiry.</p>

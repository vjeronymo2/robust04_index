			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: All-round growth helps Macfarlane rise 18% WITH EACH of its three divisions contributing improved results Macfarlane Group (Clansman) was able to lift profits from Pounds 4.55m to Pounds 5.35m pre-tax for the six months to June 30. The 18 per cent advance came on the back of a Pounds 4m rise in turnover from continuing operations to Pounds 46.3m. The Glasgow-based group's activities take in packaging, plastic moulding and development. Earnings emerged at 4.74p (4.04p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted from an adjusted 1.253p to 1.44p. Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, chairman, said yesterday that there were now 'a few signs of growth in the economy'. He was confident that trading conditions would improve by the end of this year. He added that this should lead to substantial investment opportunities. In order to ensure that the group was placed to take advantage of opportunities Mr Gordon Lane, previously managing director of Abbotts Packaging, has been appointed group development director. His responsibility will cover acquisition strategy and new products. Lord Macfarlane said the improved results in part reflected 'prudent financial housekeeping and strict control over costs'. Almost all the companies in the group improved their performance. Benefits of the cost-cutting programme undertaken in 1991 helped the group boost pre-tax profits for the 1992 year by 48 per cent to a record Pounds 10.1m. A significant number of jobs were cut and a squeeze put on stocks and debtors. The shares added 2p yesterday to 216p.</p>

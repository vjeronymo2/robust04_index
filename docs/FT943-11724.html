			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Interest rate fears depress US stocks Wall Street US stocks suffered a setback as strong economic data pushed bond prices down and raised the likelihood of an early increase in interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 15.21 lower at 3,720.47, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.79 at 452.57. Volume on the NYSE was a moderate 251m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite dipped 0.48 to 434.02, and the Nasdaq composite closed 3.53 lower at 712.13. The Commerce Department triggered an early decline in share prices with its announcement that orders of durable goods had jumped 1.3 per cent last month. The reading was much stronger than analysts had expected and reinforced the prevailing wisdom that the Federal Reserve was prepared to tighten monetary policy for the fifth time since February. Further evidence of a robust economy, in spite of the four previous rate increases, sent a shiver through the bond market, where the price of the inflation-sensitive 30-year government issue retreated by about 1/2 of a point. Stocks mostly followed the lead of the Treasury market, but the session was complicated by the release of a fresh batch of corporate results. With a tentative mood still prevailing, some good performances went unrewarded while the share prices of under-achievers were often marked down sharply. Among the Dow industrial components, Disney fell into the first category. Its stock added Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 42 1/8 , a modest gain in view of second-quarter earnings of 49 cents a share, about 3 cents above expectations. 3M added Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 51 3/8 as investors shrugged off the company's strong second-quarter performance. Ford, which handily beat Wall Street's projections, fared even worse, as its stock lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 1/4 amid fears that the car industry's recovery had passed its peak. Bethlehem Steel came under the heading of under-achiever. Its share price dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 20 3/4 after the company posted a profit of 14 cents a share, about half of what analysts had forecast. The uncertainty over interest rates took its toll on several other stocks sensitive to broad economic trends. Alcoa lost Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 77 7/8 and International Paper was down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 71. In a development unrelated to earnings news, Signet Banking climbed Dollars 2, or 7 per cent,to Dollars 39 1/4 after revealing plans to spin off its credit card operations. The brightest star of the session was Biogen, the biotechnology concern whose shares are traded on the Nasdaq. The stock was swept 52 per cent higher to Dollars 44 3/4 , a gain of Dollars 15 1/4 on the day, with some 14m shares traded. The surge followed the company's announcement that clinical tests of a drug to treat multiple sclerosis had produced promising results. Meanwhile, Chiron, a rival biotech concern, had a bad day, with its share price slumping Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 52 5/8 . Wertheim Schroder downgraded the issue, citing the potential for new competition for Chiron's multiple sclerosis treatment. Canada Toronto stocks fell for the third consecutive day, in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index lost 15.89 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 4,134.01, with declines outpacing advances 428 to 272. Volume of 57.30m shares was above Tuesday's 56.13m. Trading value was CDollars 655.0m compared with CDollars 651.0m. Lac Minerals rose CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 14 3/8 after reporting second-quarter net profit against a year-earlier loss. Lac also disclosed in filings with US securities regulators that it has held third-party talks regarding various transactions to maximize shareholder value. Imasco said its second-quarter net rose to CDollars 128m from CDollars 95m a year earlier, despite about CDollars 24m in pre-tax charges this year. Imasco's shares gained CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 34 3/4 . Mexico Equities rose 1.66 per cent in active trading driven up by investor buying following a decline in key interest rates and several solid first-half company results. The bolsa had its fifth consecutive advance on the back of a 66-basis-point fall in the rates for 28-day Cetes, or Treasury bills, to 17.00 per cent in yesterday's auction. The key IPC index closed up 39.82 points at 2,433.22. At the end of 1993, the IPC stood at 2,602.63. Volume totaled a heavy 2.05bn new pesos, on 137.5m shares traded.</p>

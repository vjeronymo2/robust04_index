			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A POET'S WORDS FROM THE HEART OF HER HERITAGE  </P> <P> Eagle Poem  </P> <P> To pray you open your whole self  </P> <P> To sky, to earth, to sun, to moon  </P> <P> To one whole voice that is you.  </P> <P> And know there is more  </P> <P> That you can't see, can't hear  </P> <P> Can't know except in moments  </P> <P> Steadily growing, and in languages  </P> <P> That aren't always sound but other  </P> <P> Circles of motion.  </P> <P> Like eagle that Sunday morning  </P> <P> Over Salt River. Circled in blue sky  </P> <P> In wind, swept our hearts clean  </P> <P> With sacred wings.  </P> <P>  -- Joy Harjo  </P> <P> Born in Tulsa, the first child of a Creek father and a Cherokee-French mother,  Joy Harjo spent her earliest years in a troubled and impoverished household.  She doesn't want to talk very much about that time, when she was "so insecure  and so shy . . . a child who was afraid to speak."  </P> <P> Harjo's writing is often dark. Her poetry draws on American Indian history and  contemporary problems as well as on Indian mythology and her own life and  imagination.  </P> <P> Harjo's heritage is extremely important to her, and she's sensitive about  discussing problems that can arise from her ethnic background. She also knows  that, being light-skinned, "I can pass (for white) easily, and sometimes I  think, you know, this is too hard. It would be easier to not be Indian at all.  It's hard enough to be one or the other, and it's harder to be both" white and  Indian.  </P> <P> Being Indian is "very tiring and painful and frustrating and sad and angering,  given the history," she says. Yet "I'm not trying to bitch and whine and groan,  because the other side of that is a lot of incredible beauty and insight."  </P> <P> The positive side of being Indian, Harjo says, is the knowledge of a rich  cultural heritage, a sense of community and connection to the land. "This is  our land, it's the homeland," she says. "The homeland affects you directly, it  affects your body, it affects the collective mind, and the collective heart and  the collective spirit. And so we (Indians) feel it, because there's no  separation."  </P> <P> Yet, she adds, "I don't like this romanticization of Indian people in which  Indian people are looked at as spiritual saviors, as people who have always  taken care of the land. We're human beings. But I think different cultures have  developed different aspects of humanness."  </P> <P> Harjo lives in a pink building on the outskirts of Tucson, in a unit also  inhabited by a wistful yellow cat named Custer, two gerbils, a black rabbit,  three fish and her 20-year-old son, Phil. Her 15-year-old daughter, Rainy Dawn,  goes to boarding school in New Mexico.  </P> <P> The author of three books of poetry, Harjo, 37, moved here last fall from  Colorado, where she'd taught for three years at the University of Colorado in  Boulder. She's now a tenured associate professor of English at the University  of Arizona.  </P> <P> "I've always loved the desert," she says. "I've spent most of my life in the  Southwest. It's certainly influenced my work. I used to dream about it when I  was young," growing up in Oklahoma.  </P> <P> "I don't see the desert as barren at all, I see it as full and ripe. It doesn't  need to be flattered with rain. It certainly needs rain, but it does with what  it has, and creates amazing beauty," she says.  </P> <P> The same could be said for Harjo, who has taken the material of a difficult  life and created poetry of great power. (She will read some of that work on  Feb. 18 in the Laguna Poets Winter Poetry Festival, at 2:30 p.m. at the Forum  Theater in Laguna Beach.)  </P> <P> Harjo lost her shyness on stage in school plays, and early in life she  demonstrated talent in drawing. At 16, she began attending a New Mexico  boarding school, the competitive-admission Institute of American Indian Arts in  Santa Fe. "I was lucky to end up going to school there. In a way it saved me. I  think if it hadn't intervened, I probably wouldn't have lived very long," she  says. "I mean, it's hard being an adolescent anyway, but I had a lot of wars  going on" at home.  </P> <P> She graduated at 17 after participating in one of the first all-Indian drama  and dance troupes in the U.S. Briefly married, she had her son Phil soon after  graduation. "Then I spent three years working in a hospital, cleaning rooms,  working in a health spa, pumping gas in a mini-skirt in Santa Fe, all those  kind of jobs. And I decided I wanted something more," she says.  </P> <P> With a grant from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and student loans, she attended  the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, starting out as a pre-med student  and quickly switching to art "because I couldn't keep away from that." At 22,  she began writing poetry, and in her last year of school she changed her major  to creative writing.  </P> <P> During this time she also married the well-known American Indian poet Simon  Ortiz, with whom she had her daughter, Rainy Dawn. The marriage lasted only  about two years, but Harjo and Ortiz are still close friends.  </P> <P> She raised her two children while supporting herself, attending school (she  later earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in poetry at the Iowa Writers  Workshop) and learning to be a writer.  </P> <P> In the early 1970s, she took part in "a lot of protests and marches for Indian  rights," including demonstrations on behalf of the Indians  </P> <P> who occupied Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973. This political awakening would infuse  her writing.  </P> <P>  I have a memory.  </P> <P> It swims deep in blood,  </P> <P> a delta in the skin. It swims out of Oklahoma,  </P> <P> deep the Mississippi River. It carries my  </P> <P> feet to these places: the French Quarter,  </P> <P> stale rooms, the sun behind thick and moist  </P> <P> clouds, and I hear boats hauling themselves up  </P> <P> and down the river.  </P> <P> My spirit comes here to drink.  </P> <P> My spirit comes here to drink.  </P> <P> Blood is the undercurrent. . . .  </P> <P>  -- (from "New Orleans," by Joy  </P> <P> Harjo, in "She Had Some Horses,"  </P> <P> Thunder's Mouth Press, 1983)  </P> <P> Harjo is more than a little leery of the written word, because "there's a lot  of leeway for lying, because when you have something written down you can't  look at the person, you're not looking at the person's eyes, you're not in the  person's presence," she says.  </P> <P> Indians come from an oral rather than a written tradition, Harjo points out.  "The knowledge was kept by remembering. And that's one of my theories about  alcoholism among Indian people, that we're basically coming out of an oral  culture, where you're taught to remember everything. And it can be hard to  forget" yet painful to remember stories of that culture.  </P> <P> Being a writer who thinks writing things down is dangerous is a little  quixotic, Harjo admits, but she says: "There's an irony in being a human being.  There's an irony in writing. I feel that all the time. Maybe that's why I've  been trying to play a lot more music. I get so frustrated with words, and their  limitations." For the last four years, Harjo has been learning to play the  saxophone, which she would eventually like to incorporate into her poetry  readings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scripts Are Produced  </P> <P> Since 1980, Harjo has also written six screenplays, dramatic stories centered  on American Indian characters. Half those scripts have been produced by small  film companies and state agencies. In addition, Harjo has written the text to  accompany the photographs of an astronomer, Stephen Strom, for a book called  "Secrets From the Center Of the World," to be published by the University of  Arizona Press this fall, and she is gathering work together for an anthology of  North American and South American women's writing and starting to write short  stories.  </P> <P> In her most recent work, Harjo is apt to mix surreal images, as in this prose  poem from her new manuscript, "In Mad Love And War," to be published by  Wesleyan University Press in 1990:  </P> <P>  The wind blows lilacs out of the east. And it isn't lilac season. And I am  walking the street in front of St. Francis Cathedral in Santa Fe, from Denver.  Oh, and it's a few years earlier and more. That's how you tell real time. It is  here, it is there. The lilacs have taken over everything: the sky, the narrow  streets, my shoulders, my lips. I talk lilac. And there is nothing else until a  woman the size of a fox breaks through the bushes, breaks the purple web. She  is tall and black and gorgeous. . . .  </P> <P>  -- From "Santa Fe" by Joy Harjo  </P> <P> She likes to be "surprised" by images while writing, Harjo says.  </P> <P> "The world is not necessarily a logical progression, and the way your mind  works is not linear. The dream world is not linear. The real world is not  linear."  </P> <P> Her poetry is not strictly autobiographical, she adds. "Of course there's  always autobiographical elements, but I elaborate, I make things up, I expand  the truth." She also incorporates details from her dreams, which she feels are  not just night-time imaginings.  </P> <P> "I have a dream life in which there are certainly more possibilities" than in  waking life, Harjo says. "Creation in it is much swifter. It's much more  elastic. And I can see better in this world. You can call it dream world, but I  don't mean it's a world that's just dreaming, like you go to sleep and there it  is. It's also a world that's simultaneous to this world."  </P> <P> She believes in poetry's transformative power, Harjo says. "I want my work to  be regenerative. I want it in some way to be a praising, and I want it to give  back. One of the principles of the universe is that if something is not  regenerative, if it does not give back life, then it dies. So if you look at  what's going on with human beings, I really wonder what will happen.  </P> <P> "Human beings are a very young species and probably won't last that long,  either. I think we're near the end of it. Because in order to be a viable  species you have to be giving something back to the ecosystem. And we're not  doing that." With her own work, Harjo wonders, "Am I going to leave something,  not necessarily important, but something? Or am I going to add to the  confusion? I don't want to add to the confusion."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reluctant to Talk  </P> <P> Discussing such things -- like talking about elements of her past -- isn't  easy, Harjo says, because Indians believe "you just don't tell people  everything. It's like, too, with the Indian people, with their history, there  are things that probably you don't want said, because you don't want to call  them (the events) back. You don't want them to appear again. And then of course  there's also things you aren't supposed to reveal, there's certain tribal  secrets, they're not written down, they're meant to be kept within the people."  </P> <P> Yet when she writes, Harjo says, she draws on her own "secret" places: "There's  a sort of ecstatic sadness. It's not always sadness, but there's a point of  letting go at which I know I can do what I want, and it feels good, and I'm  playing, I'm touching language, and I'm touching places I haven't touched  before. It doesn't work if I know where I'm going and how I'm going to get  there.  </P> <P> "I think a poem has to have a huge amount of risk, and it has to have some  danger, because there's danger in the universe."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SONG FOR THE DEER AND MYSELF TO RETURN ON  </P> <P> BY JOY HARJO  </P> <P> This morning when I looked out the roof window  </P> <P> before dawn and a few stars were still caught  </P> <P> in the fragile weft of ebony night  </P> <P> I was overwhelmed. I sang the song Louis taught me:  </P> <P> a song to call the deer in Creek, as in hunting  </P> <P> and I am certainly hunting something as velvet as deer  </P> <P> in this city far from the hammock of my mother's belly.  </P> <P> It works, of course, and deer came into this room  </P> <P> and wondered at finding themselves  </P> <P> in a house near downtown Denver.  </P> <P> Now the deer and I are trying to figure out a song  </P> <P> to get them back, to get all of us back  </P> <P> because if it works I'm going with them.  </P> <P> And it's too early to call Louis  </P> <P> And nearly too late to go home.  </P> <P>  (for Louis Oliver)  </P> <P> </P></p>

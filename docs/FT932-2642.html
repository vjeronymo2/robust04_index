			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (14): Solidarity has its moments / A look at the labour movement THE Solidarity trade union, founded in 1980 to oppose the communist system and its inefficient command economy, finds itself searching for a new role as the growth of the private sector decentralises power to independent company managements, while mounting unemployment erodes its power base in the big factories. But the now-reduced Solidarity union still has its moments. In 1992 the union's parliamentary group was instrumental in putting together the coalition government headed by Ms Hanna Suchocka. Eleven months later it was Solidarity which decided the coalition's fate when it followed up a campaign for public servants' wage rises with a no-confidence motion which scraped through parliament by one vote. Having toppled the government it then threatened to press for a general strike. But before Solidarity could savour its political triumph the constitution shifted the political initiative from the union and into the hands of President Lech Walesa. He vetoed a bill by which parliament had voted an extra 21,000bn zloties for pensioners, dissolved parliament and called early elections for a new government. Ironically, the government brought down by the union's no-confidence vote had earlier made the greatest effort to draw Solidarity and the other unions into the new market system. For it was Ms Suchocka and her ministers who negotiated the enterprise pact which sought to involve the trade unions in the privatisation process. As part of the pact the government also pledged to hold regular consultations on macro-economic policy between the unions, employers and the government. These promises will have to await the outcome of the elections. No less ironically, it was the OPZZ unions, fostered under the communist regime, which appeared in the past weeks to recognise that the Suchocka government was offering the unions a good deal. Under the leadership of Ms Ewa Spychalska, a political scientist, the OPZZ union federation movement, whose membership has shrunk to below 4m, had shown a lack of enthusiasm for Solidarity's political campaign against the government. Ms Spychalska herself admits that this year's budget constraints are such that she could not see what Mr Marian Krzaklewski, the head of Solidarity, had been hoping to achieve by pushing his wage claims so strongly. But day by day Solidarity and the OPZZ face similar problems. But the underlying problem is that neither union has much of a presence in the private sector, which now accounts for over half of Poland's employment  - except where a plant has been privatised and the unions privatised with it. In the state manufacturing sector, conflicts are rarely about pay but more often about protecting jobs. Strikes are called usually where orders are scarce anyway, and it is not unheard-of for workers at plants formally declared to be 'on strike' to continue to work for fear of losing orders. The conflict line, especially in the state sector, does not really run between workers and management. On the contrary, public sector workers and management often combine to put pressure on government for support to keep their usually loss-making enterprises afloat. All this is confusing for blue collar workers without whose support the Solidarity movement would never have removed the communists from power in 1989 and who now see few rewards for their efforts. The feeling of impotence and disillusion is mounting.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Kurds seek long-term UK aid MR Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdish Democratic party, arrived in London yesterday saying he would ask Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, to provide long-term development aid to enable Iraqi Kurds to become self-sufficient. He said he would also ask Britain to make a commitment to help protect the Kurds against further Iraqi aggression and to provide observers for elections to be held in northern Iraq in April. Mr Barzani, who is to hold talks with Mr Major this afternoon, said the combined effects of the United Nations embargo against Iraq and Baghdad's internal blockade of the Kurds threatened to cause a 'social explosion' in Iraqi Kurdistan. Although he said fighting in northern Iraq had calmed considerably in recent weeks, Mr Barzani said the embargoes had caused severe food and fuel shortages. The Kurdish leader is also hoping Britain, France and the US will extend its commitment to keep protective forces in Turkey, at present comprising 48 fighter aircraft based at Incirlik airbase, beyond the present mandate which runs until June. 'As long as there is no political settlement on the ground, it is vital that there are forces there to give long-term protection to the Kurds,' he said. Mr Barzani said Kurdish groups were still seeking a negotiated agreement with Baghdad over Kurdish autonomy, although talks between Kurdish leaders and the regime of Mr Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president, have been frozen for some months.</p>

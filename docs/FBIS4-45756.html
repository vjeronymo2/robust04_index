			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held here  Friday under the sponsorship of the State Environmental  Commission on the occasion of the world day of environment.    At the meeting Yi Sang-nak, vice-chairman of the State  Environmental Commission, gave a lecture under the title "One  Globe, One Family."    Noting that environmental protection has become an important  common task facing the mankind in saving it from environmental  pollution and degradation and making a sustained development, he  said the developed industrial nations have thrown away a  fabulous amount of polluting materials, seriously polluting the  environment of the globe and causing irrevocably grave damage to  the lives and health of the people.    "In our country, the best socialist system of Korean style  centred on the people has been built and an environmental policy  for the people has been pursued under the wise guidance of the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il, with the result that enormous achievements have been  registered in environmental protection in the country", he said,  and continued:    "The great leader's idea of environmental protection has  been  successfully carried forward by the dear leader. In the days  when he began leading our revolution, the dear leader expounded  an original idea that environmental protection is not merely a  technical and working matter but an important political one for  improving the people's health and providing them with conditions  for an independent and creative life, and clearly indicated the  way of carrying it into practice.    "The adoption of `the law of the Democratic People's  Republic  of Korea on Environmental Protection' has led to the  codification of the idea of the great leader and the dear leader  for environmental protection and the achievements in this  domain."    Referring to the tasks for environmental protection, he  declared: "We will as ever remain faithful to the international  obligation for environmental protection by honestly discharging  the national duty for it."    The chief of the United Nations Development Program [UNDP]  mission also spoke at the meeting.    A friendship gathering between officials of the state  environmental commission and members of the UNDP mission took  place.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: French bank forecloses on collateralised MGM shares CREDIT Lyonnais took steps to sever the last connection between MGM, the Hollywood film studio, and Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier, on Thursday when the French bank announced it would foreclose on the 98.5 per cent of MGM's stock it holds as collateral for loans made to MGM and its parent Pathe Communications. The financially crippled studio is currently in default on Dollars 600m of loans from Credit Lyonnais, which in 1990 provided the bulk of the financing for Mr Parretti's Dollars 1.3bn acquisition of MGM from Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the hotel owner. To foreclose on the collateralised shares, Credit Lyonnais first has to put them up for sale. The stock will be auctioned in Delaware on May 7, and Credit Lyonnais said that at least Dollars 400m of the indebtedness owed it by MGM-Pathe will be bid for in the purchase of the stock. It is unlikely that any bidders will come forward. Credit Lyonnais won control over the management of the studio three months ago when a Delaware court settled a dispute over the ownership of MGM by ruling in favour of the French bank. The decision was a defeat for Mr Parretti, who had been fighting for control of MGM through a series of lawsuits against Credit Lyonnais. Mr Parretti is currently appealing against a four-year prison sentence and fraud conviction in Italy. By severing all links between MGM and Mr Parretti, Credit Lyonnais hopes to strengthen the position of the studio's current management, which is working on a long-term business plan for MGM's survival. Mr Alan Ladd and Mr Dennis Stanfill, the co-chairmen of MGM, said on Thursday night that the auction would not affect the ongoing business and operations of the studio. They said: 'The company is finalising a comprehensive business plan in co-operation with the bank and expects to make continuing progress in this process as well as in its negotiations for a new credit line to reinforce MGM's prospects for the future.' The dire state of MGM's finances, however, was illustrated earlier this week when the company's auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick, qualified its report of MGM's 1991 full-year loss of Dollars 347.7m by questioning whether the company would be able to continue as 'a going concern'.</p>

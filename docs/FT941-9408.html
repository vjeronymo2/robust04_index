			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Observer: Forming up Place your bets, please, on who gets to run the UK National Lottery. William Hill, the bookmaker, has opened a book on the sweepstake to beat all sweepstakes. The 7-2 favourite is The Lottery Foundation, headed by Richard Branson and Lord Young. Second favourite is The Great British Lottery Company at 4-1. Games for Good Causes, in which William Hill's rival Ladbroke has a stake, is trailing at 6-1. Last of the eight bidders is Rainbow, at 20-1. The smart money seems to be on Branson's bid. Indeed, Observer hears that Will Whitehorn, the entrepreneur's mouthpiece, has bet Pounds 1000 of his own money on Branson winning. Sensibly, he never risked a penny betting on the chances of his master winning an ITV franchise.</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Sherwood Computer drops 69% to Pounds 541,000 SHERWOOD COMPUTER Services, which earlier this month saw its shares fall by almost a third following a profits warning, is maintaining its interim dividend at 1.75p. Bearing out the warning, pre-tax profits tumbled 69 per cent to Pounds 541,000 for the six months to June 30, compared with Pounds 1.75m previously.

The purchases helped lift turnover to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 10.7m). Sherwood, which has developed specialist software for the housing and insurance markets, put most of the blame for the profits fall on 'the well publicised difficulties in the Lloyd's insurance market.' Mr George Matthews, chief executive, said the company had sold no licensed software in either sector in the first half. Reorganisations and contractions had deferred orders at Lloyd's, while the switch from poll tax to council tax had delayed orders from local authorities. The group closed two licence sales in the housing sector last month, and was expecting to sell two more in the second half. The insurance sector was showing good prospects for 1994, Mr Matthews said. After minorities of Pounds 203,000, fully diluted earnings per share fell to 3.4p (16.7p).</p>

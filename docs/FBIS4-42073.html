			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Markus Lesch: "Upswing in the East for the </F> Chancellor"]    [Text] Freiberg -- "Good Luck, Good Luck, the Miner is  Coming" -- the "Saxonia" miners' orchestra is playing as Federal  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, dressed in a blue trench coat, mounts  the platform at the Upper Market. Freiberg is the last leg of  this round of the Chancellor's election campaign through eastern  Germany. Prior to that the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]  chairman had attended the party conference of the Brandenburg  CDU in Strausberg near Berlin. In the afternoon, Kohl had  spoken in Kamenz.    More than 10,000 people are crowding the Upper Market at the  old silver mining town of Freiberg -- a home match for Kohl.  "We heard that he is coming on the seven o'clock news and came  here right away," a couple from Doebeln says. They have a small  electrical supplies company; the chancellor can be sure of  winning their votes: "We cannot complain, things have been going  upward."    The chancellor hits the right tone when he welcomes the  political opposition first: "There they are, the  representatives of the socialist migration," he calls over to a  small bunch of protesters carrying the inevitable banners  reading "The head is soft." People with posters saying  "Messiah, let us have your message," do not stand a chance  either. Their whistles are drowned in the crowd's laughter,  people are shouting "Helmut," and in front somebody waves a  black-red-and-gold flag.    "Saxony will be your home country, Germany your fatherland,  and Europe your future," Kohl calls out at the end of his  speech, and minute-long applause fills the air. When the  orchestra plays the national anthem, some are embarrassed that  they still do not know the text after four years.    The scenery at Freiberg is also favorable for Kohl: A great  deal has changed in the town. The platform has been set up in  front of the refurbished historic town hall; almost all the  house facades shine with fresh paint; the university housing  Germany's oldest mining college is attended by students from the  West. Pretty pubs are emerging, and beer from Freiberg is  popular also in the land's capital, Dresden. The people in  Freiberg are proud of what they have achieved over the past few  years and of the things they can show the chancellor.    In the new laender, there is a clear shift toward the CDU.  "There is a ray of hope in every village," Saxony's CDU deputy  chairman Fritz Haehle says. According to an Infratest opinion  poll, contentedness with the land governments has gone up in all  the new laender governed by the CDU, including Berlin, since  February. Eberhard Diepgen in Berlin (+ 16 percent) and  Bernhard Vogel in Thuringia (+ 13 percent) have been able to  gain the most in popularity. Over the same period, confidence  in Manfred Stolpe's SPD-led [Social Democratic Party]  Brandenburg government has declined by 9 percent, which for the  first time makes Kurt Biedenkopf's CDU government (+ 3 percent)  the most popular of all the new laender governments.    The CDU is also ahead in Germany as a whole now. At the  weekend, four research institutes announced that the Union is  ahead of the Social Democrats. Forsa: 42 to 39 percent,  Wickert: 39.9 to 37 percent. The figures indicated by Basis  Research are 39 to 38 percent. And Emnid expects the CDU/CSU  [Christian Social Union] to win the European elections at 40  percent, with the SPD winning only 38 percent of the votes.  With regard to future chancellors, Forsa sees Kohl leading at  34 percent over his SPD opponent, Rudolf Scharping, who is  currently supported by 32 percent of the population.</p>

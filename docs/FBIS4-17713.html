			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 486] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, April 27, ELTA -- Polish President Lech  Walesa by the end of his visit to Lithuania met with  representatives of the Polish community in Lithuania.    According to the statistical data, at present 261.5 thousand  Poles live in Lithuania.    "Despite a great number of obstacles you have not lost your  nationality", Walesa said. "You still belong to a large Polish  family. You never reached outside the border, the border  stretched over you. You are not here guests or newcomers or  emigrants".    Walesa emphasized that Poles in Lithuania are citizens of  Lithuania. "Lithuania is your country. The prosperity of  Lithuania is your prosperity. You must be good citizens. You  must care about your homeland and participate in the changes.  You must show that you can usefully and creatively work for  Lithuania in building the common home for both Lithuanians and  Poles".    Poles who live in Lithuania should be loyal for the state  and  respect its institutions. The state in its turn should  guarantee the ability to foster national identity, culture,  education and language.</p>

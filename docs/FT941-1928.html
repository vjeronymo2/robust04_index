			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Metalrax to expand as profits pass Pounds 8m mark Metalrax Group, the precision components, houseware and storage equipment group, yesterday said it was planning to expand its UK and North American operations following a 7 per cent increase in profits. The Midlands-based group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.02m in the year to December 31, compared with a restated Pounds 7.47m last time. The company said it was well placed to make acquisitions on both sides of the Atlantic and was already discussing two bids. Such acquisitions are likely to be funded from year-end net cash balance of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 5.3m) or by offering equity to potential subsidiaries. Expansion of the group last year helped turnover rise 10 per cent to Pounds 71.3m. Mr Eric Moore, managing director, said the performance of the precision components division showed the sharpest improvement and now accounted for 50 per cent of sales and profits. The business was augmented at the year-end by the Pounds 1m acquisition of Western Body Hardware, the specialist locks business. Mr Moore also hinted at further expansion of the houseware division, representing 30 per cent of turnover, following its takeover of Fabricote, the supplier of non-stick materials. The new subsidiaries increased the workforce to more than 1,500. Earnings per share were 6.36p (6.27p) and the final is raised to 3p (2.73p), taking the total to 4p (3.64p). A 1-for-10 scrip issue is proposed.</p>

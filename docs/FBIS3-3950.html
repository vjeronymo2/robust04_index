The highways link the region with Qinghai and Sichuan  Provinces and Nepal, respectively.    The construction of the Heihe-Gamdo Highway has been  completed, and work is going well on some sections of the  China-Nepal Highway, upgrading projects on the Qinghai-Tibet and  Sichuan-Tibet Highways, and the Lhaze Bridge.    Highways in Tibet are subject to frozen earth, mud-rock  flows, snowslides, snow storms, desertification and landslides.    Statistics show that such natural disasters have blocked  highways in Tibet for an average of over 100 days each year in  the past over 40 years.    The Qinghai-Tibet Highway has undergone three large-scale  improvements.    As Tibet is the only region with no railway outlets, the  Chinese Government attaches great importance to highway  construction.    In the past 40 years the central government has invested  over  4 billion yuan (almost 500 million U.S. dollars at the current  exchange rate) in highway construction.    The upgrading and improvement of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway  started in 1992 and will cost 850 million yuan (about 100  million U.S. dollars).</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HAHN FAULTS BRADLEY;  </P> <P> CITY ATTORNEY FILES A CIVIL SUIT BUT NO CRIMINAL CHARGES;  </P> <P> HE SAYS MAYOR HAS NOT BEEN VINDICATED  </P> <P> Insisting that "no vindication of the mayor's conduct is intended," City Atty.  James K. Hahn today sued Mayor Tom Bradley for allegedly failing to disclose  properly several stock transactions but declared there was insufficient  evidence to bring criminal charges against the embattled five-term Democrat.  </P> <P> Hahn announced the six-count civil lawsuit, which seeks fines for alleged  violation of state laws that require public figures to disclose their financial  holdings, as he released a 1,165-page report on a wide-ranging and  unprecedented six-month investigation of Bradley.  </P> <P> In addition to the lawsuit, Hahn said some related leads pursued by his  investigators have been passed along to the district attorney and other law  enforcement agencies for further investigation. He noted that Bradley's stock  holdings are under investigation by federal authorities.  </P> <P> Hahn's report appears to bring to a close his office's role in investigating  Bradley's personal finances and business relationships with individuals or  institutions that did business with the city. It began in late March with news  reports of Bradley's employment by Far East National Bank and Valley Federal  Savings and Loan Assn., then was expanded to include the Task Force on  Africa/Los Angeles Relations, whose executive director, a friend and business  partner of Bradley, has failed to account for about $180,000 in city funds.  </P> <P> The report addressed numerous allegations that arose in the press and elsewhere  during the investigation, and in every case concludes there is not enough  evidence to charge the mayor with a crime.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Report Adds Caveat  </P> <P> "However," Hahn's report noted, "no vindication of the mayor's conduct is  intended, implied or should in any way be inferred."  </P> <P> Hahn devoted roughly half of his voluminous report to Bradley's relationship  with Far East bank, which paid him $18,000 as an adviser throughout 1988.  Bradley returned the money in March of this year when he learned news  organizations were preparing stories about his bank employment.  </P> <P> Regarding Bradley's dealings with Far East National Bank, the city attorney  said: "The mayor clearly stepped into that gray area of the law between factual  innocence and a chargeable offense, but our system of justice rightfully gives  him and the rest of us the benefit of the doubt in such circumstances."  </P> <P> The mayor was prepared to respond to the report at 5 p.m. in his office, his  aides said. He had balked at commenting on allegations against him throughout  the Hahn probe.  </P> <P> Hahn's report had been seen as crucial to Bradley's political stature, as well  as to Hahn's, and as a result City Hall had been gripped with a fever of  anticipation over the past week. His decision not to bring criminal charges at  this time, however, had been reported previously, and the main question was  whether the city attorney would find any fault with the mayor's behavior beyond  faulty record-keeping.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Given Advance Copies  </P> <P> City Council members and reporters were given copies prior to an 11 a.m. press  conference, at which Hahn commented on his findings.  </P> <P> "Just because we found no violation of the law doesn't mean that what the mayor  did was right," a low-key Hahn said. "Public officials must avoid even the  appearance of a conflict in the performance of their duties."  </P> <P> One of the most surprising aspects of the report dealt with how Bradley came to  be hired by Far East, and what bank Chairman Henry Hwang expected from the  mayor in return.  </P> <P> "We hoped he can open some doors for us with . . . a major corporation: people  that he might know that we are not able to get . . . because we're a very, very  small bank," Hwang told investigators in a May 17 interview.  </P> <P> Hwang previously had said Bradley's duties were to court foreign investors for  the bank and did not involve any potential conflicts of interest with local  firms or city business.  </P> <P> But the report found that Hwang apparently made a "direct solicitation" for  city business in January, 1988, when he wrote Bradley a letter spelling out  what was needed. At least two other letters were found that indicated Bradley  may have known at the time he was employed that the city did business with Far  East. In returning the funds in March, 1989, Bradley said he had not realized  such a relationship existed and would not have accepted the employment had he  known.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Circumstantial Evidence'  </P> <P> Further, the report concluded "there is circumstantial evidence" that Bradley  attempted to and "did use his official position to influence a governmental  decision" to the benefit of Far East.  </P> <P> Testimony before a City Council committee last summer revealed that the mayor  had called City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg on March 22 to inquire about an  expiring $1-million city deposit with Far East. After the phone call,  Rittenberg ordered that $2 million be deposited with the bank. Work sheets to  make it look as if there had been competitive bidding were compiled and someone  used white correction fluid to obliterate a reference to the mayor. Bradley and  Rittenberg denied the mayor influenced the deposit decision.  </P> <P> "This circumstantial evidence appears damaging and may call into question the  mayor's credibility and judgment in some areas," the report said. "There is  obviously no doubt that 'but for' the mayor's telephone call to Rittenberg, the  treasurer's office would not have deposited" the funds in Far East.  </P> <P> "However, merely proving that the mayor's phone call caused the treasurer to  deposit those funds does not prove that the mayor intended to influence the  decision of the treasurer," Hahn's report said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cites Other Dealings  </P> <P> Hahn and his five-member investigative team also probed Bradley's annual  financial disclosure statements, the subject of the lawsuit, and referred  information about his dealings with the troubled investment firm Drexel,  Burnham Lambert to federal authorities. A preliminary federal investigation is  still in progress.  </P> <P> Additionally, Hahn said he has sent copies of his report to the District  Attorney's Office, the state Fair Political Practices Commission and the state  Attorney General.  </P></p>

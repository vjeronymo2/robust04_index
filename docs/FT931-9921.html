			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Colin Powell says he may retire early: Top US general denies rift over Clinton defence policies GENERAL Colin Powell confirmed yesterday he was thinking of retiring early as chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, but flatly denied this was because of disagreements with the Clinton administration. He appeared on morning television shows after a report in the New York Times had quoted 'friends and associates' as saying he was unhappy with President Bill Clinton's determination to admit homosexuals to the US military and with the extent of the defence budget cuts under consideration. Gen Powell's second two-year term as chairman of the joint chiefs is to expire at the end of September. He said yesterday that he had told Mr Dick Cheney, the previous secretary of defence, last summer that he would not seek a third term, even if President George Bush were re-elected last November. The general added that he had spoken then of leaving the post a month or two early so as to resettle his family. He vigorously denied suggestions that he was at odds with the new administration's policies: 'I'm not in any conflict with the administration over their plans and I am not planning to retire early as a result of any conflict.' Gen Powell said the military had received 'good guidance' from Mr Clinton and Mr Les Aspin, the new secretary of defence, with both of whom he had 'a fine relationship'. He said he had every intention of testifying before Congress in support of the new and reduced defence budget. The general was also at pains to stress that the military at large was not distressed by the new policies. 'There's nobody over here in a blue funk, thinking the whole word has dropped on us,' he said. 'We shouldn't let the impression be created around the country that somehow we are fighting the president.' He reiterated his 'concerns' about admitting gays to the military, but said the president's guidance on the issue was clear and he was not about to be 'insubordinate' by frustrating it. Gen Powell, 55 and black, is rated a phenomenally successful chairman of the joint chiefs, and not only because of the victory in the Gulf war. His doctrine of 'maximum force' has been criticised by some who feel that it delayed US intervention in humanitarian crises such as that in Somalia, but his reluctance to commit forces overseas without a clearly defined mission commands much respect in Washington, where he is rated as a consummate politician.</p>

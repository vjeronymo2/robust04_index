			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Stijepo Martinovic: "Bosnia Is Paying for </F> Peace in Its Neighborhood?!"]    [Text] The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina could last for years,  just as the one in Lebanon, but the United Nations has done much  by containing it within Bosnia-Herzegovina and preventing it  from spreading outside "former Yugoslavia." The UN secretary  general recently reiterated that statement, thus contributing --  along with many others who hold that view -- to cementing the  stupid but utterly lethal thesis: that the war in the former  central Yugoslav republic was preordained owing to the  republic's multiethnic and multicultural situation. That it is,  therefore, an internal war, and that no one stoked up the fire  under the "Bosnian pot," and that nobody can do anything apart  from containing the tragedy within its "natural and ethnic  borders."    First of all, that "revelation" is nothing more than a poor  excuse, for it is more than obvious that it is most often used  by exactly those so-called international mediators whose entire  range of activities in the "Yugoslav crisis" is calculated to  a crawling rehabilitation of memorandum goals and  thereby also of means used by the greater Serbian program  headquarters in their conquest. For, regardless of the risk  that the war might last as long as the one in Lebanon and be  equally destructive for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Butrus-Ghali,  Akashi, Juppe, Hurd..., not to mention Kozyrev, say it is OK as  long as it is contained within the borders of "former  Yugoslavia." Even the most naive observer, though, realizes at  least three things:    First, that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- regardless of  the developed phenomenology that came later on -- did  not begin as a tribal conflict of everybody against everyone,  but as an aggression (both in terms of ideas and implementation)  of joined greater Serbian forces, from outside and  inside, against Bosnia-Herzegovina as a territorial and  political whole and against two indigenous nations which  unambiguously opted for its survival at an independent address  at a referendum.    Second, the Bosnia-Herzegovina war did not spread  to other areas of "former Yugoslavia" -- and to areas of early  Yugoslav territory in particular -- only because that is  theoretically not possible. The greater Serbian onslaught on  Bosnia-Herzegovina is conceptually significantly different from  the staged Yugo-army aggression against Slovenia, it  is different from the Yugoslav-Serb assault on  Croatia, and from the Serb-allied aggression that  Milosevic's regime designed for Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. On the other hand, with regard  to Kosovo, Sandzak, Vojvodina, Montenegro... as victims of  greater Serbian aggression, those areas were occupied without  war, "integrated" and Serbianized by means of a mixture of  political and police terror and economic and social apartheid.  The UN secretary general's fear -- and not only his -- that the  war will spread beyond the borders of "former Yugoslavia" is  based on utterly stretched speculations about the Balkanization  and, subsequently, full internalization of the escalation of  Serb state terror over the Kosovo Albanians and (or) the attempt  to divide Macedonia among (all of) its neighbors.    However, neither the Kosovo Albanians give any indications  as  to the limits of their humiliation, nor is Macedonia -- with  U.S. (para-)UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] soldiers  deployed along the border with Serbia -- the prey one is allowed  to reach for.    All in all, Butrus-Ghali's going into raptures over  containing the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina (Croatia was evidently  forgotten as the side to which the UN owes everything but the  protection of the terrorist part of its Serbian minority!) is  nebulous, to say the least. His real purpose is to convince the  victims of greater Serbian aggression that they have the  privilege of using their misfortune (even if it is of a Lebanese  kind) to contribute to peace in the neighborhood of former  Yugoslav territory.    True to such interpretations of the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, i.e. of the "Yugoslav crisis" in general,  Butrus Butrus-Ghali justifies the impotence of the UN to  alleviate the suffering of the people and destruction caused by  Serb acts of savagery by saying that, instead of 35,000 "blue  helmets," he was only given 10,000. This is, again, not just a  poor excuse but a very hypocritical one indeed, for as long as  the secretary general himself is toying with the definition of  the war, identification of the aggressor, and with imperative  resolutions of his own house, being very careful not to smear  his hands with truth, and as long as his plenipotentiary holds  bandit leaders on Pale and in Knin to be "peacemakers" (and they  have, naturally, became his "friends"!), it is more than obvious  that the number of peacekeeping soldiers is not important, but  the induced impotence of political decisions about using those  soldiers on the ground is.    Of course, it would be wrong -- considering the number of  people who should be given credit -- to lay all the blame for  "Yugoslav mistakes" of international factors on the UN secretary  general. However, his is the grandiose contribution to the  tragedy on the territory of former Yugoslavia in that his  actions were clear and biased and especially in the fact that he  gave himself the privilege, as the first secretary of the world  organization, to make independent decisions on the level of  the president of the government of the world, which  gives a special meaning to his lethal, though sincere, delusions.</p>

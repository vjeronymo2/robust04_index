			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Hundreds killed in Turkish quake BETWEEN 300 and 1,000 people were believed killed yesterday in an earthquake in eastern Turkey, Reuter reports from Ankara. The earthquake, which struck the provincial capital of Erzincan, 350 miles east of Ankara, early yesterday evening, was felt in 14 provinces. 'According to first reports, we estimate a death toll of between 300 to 1,000', State Minister Omer Barutcu told the semi-official Anatolian news agency. He said the city's hospital was one of many buildings that had collapsed, with more than 60 students reported trapped in the rubble of the medical school. Interior Minister Ismet Sezgin said relief supplies were being sent into the city of about 145,000 people, which was without electricity. The earthquake measured 6.8 on the Richter scale and was the worst in the area since 1939, when 30,000 people were killed, said seismologists from the US Geological Survey.</p>

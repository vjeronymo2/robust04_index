			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO BID TO DUCK LIABILITY, NEIL BUSH'S LAWYER SAYS  </P> <P> Spokesmen for Neil Bush said Thursday that the President's son was not trying  to reduce personal liability resulting from his role in the failure of a Denver  thrift when he listed his wife as owner of a $550,000 home purchased last year.  </P> <P> "I was not even consulted on it regarding any liability and didn't know about  it until the last couple of weeks," said James E. Nesland, Bush's lawyer,  referring to reports about the Denver house published by newspapers in  Colorado.  </P> <P> Both Bush and his wife, Sharon, were listed on the deed of the previous home  they sold in 1988 to move to a house that a Bush associate described as "more  secure."  </P> <P> A financial planner for the President's son, who asked not to be named, said  that listing the house as his wife's asset was for the purpose of "estate  equalization." He said it was not intended to shelter Bush from liability  resulting from any government, shareholder or depositor suits that may be filed  against him for his role as a former director of Silverado Banking, Savings  &amp; Loan Assn. in Denver.  </P> <P> Under unified estate tax credit provisions, a taxpayer can transfer to a spouse  without tax liability up to $600,000 in a lifetime.  </P> <P> L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said a  suit is under consideration against the former directors of Silverado alleging  that they failed their fiduciary responsibility to protect the financial health  of the institution.  </P> <P> Insurance for Silverado's directors and officers to cover such suits was  allowed to expire in April, 1986, and the S&amp;L set up its own $15-million  indemnification fund. However, after Silverado's failure, the FDIC sued in  federal court in Denver to take over the funds being held in escrow. The case  is yet to be argued.  </P></p>

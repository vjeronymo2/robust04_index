Geographic extent of recall. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   EPA is proposing that the enhanced in-use compliance program apply to all vehicles sold in California for both enforceability and environmental reasons. EPA therefore proposes that any required recalls also apply to all vehicles of the affected engine family which have been sold throughout the state. This will also include vehicles from all model years that are part of the same engine family. Engine families consist of vehicles with the same basic emissions design and performance and problems with a single model year's vehicles should also exist on other model years' vehicles. EPA requests comments on the extension of recalls to all vehicles statewide versus only those vehicles registered in the three FIP areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i. Technical feasibility. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed in Section A.(2) above, EPA does not expect manufacturers to have to reduce the low-mileage emissions of properly operating vehicles in order to comply with the proposed recall provisions. The degree that vehicle design changes are necessary to better ensure improved in-use emission performance under this program will depend on the technologies and cost tradeoffs manufacturers will make in response to CARB's existing LEV and OBD programs and the enhanced I/M program. If a manufacturer has sufficient confidence that its vehicles will comply with the enhanced in-use standards, there will obviously be no technological or cost implications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if a manufacturer lacks such confidence, then vehicle designs could be improved. In general, the durability of every aspect of a vehicles' current and future emission control system can always be improved. The primary issues are cost and the level of reliability. EPA expects each manufacturer to review the durability of each of its emission control system components and assess whether it is adequate given the additional financial disincentives of the emissions in-use compliance program which would occur should it fail. The decision would then be made to further improve design durability or accept the current durability as adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a manufacturer decided that it needed to increase the probability that its vehicles would comply with the enhanced in-use standards under typical conditions of maintenance and use, EPA believes that numerous methods exist with which this can be done. For example, vehicular emission control can be divided into two basic components, efficient combustion and catalytic conversion. Efficient combustion relies primarily on fuel management and sufficient ignition spark, including its timing. Efficient catalytic conversion depends most heavily on fuel management and sufficient active catalytic material. Fuel management in turn depends heavily on the onboard computer and the feedback control mechanism (i.e., the oxygen sensor) and the fuel injector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that CARB's existing fuel detergent program will help address manufacturers' concerns related to fuel injector, intake valve and combustion chamber deposits and the possible associated degradation of emission control performance. EPA also believes that fuel injection technology has reached a sufficient stage of development such that maintenance free operation is possible (i.e., EPA is not aware of any required maintenance for fuel injectors on LDVs, LDTs, or MDVs). Catastrophic failure of an individual injector can always occur, but this should be immediately identified by the OBD system. Likewise, recent electronic ignition systems are also maintenance free, with the exception of the spark plugs and possibly the ignition wires. If improvements were desired in these areas, gold and platinum tipped spark plugs could be considered. These plugs are already in limited use and offer the advantage of improved durability. Manufacturers have already utilized, to a varying degree, high voltage ignition to lessen the importance of wire separation, as the higher ignition voltage will cross a sizable gap in the wire as well as across the spark plug tip. Onboard computers have clearly generated a track record of proper operation over the life of the vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission control as well as efficient combustion also depends on the proper operation of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valves. The primary in-use problem with EGR valves is plugging or sticking due to combustion products, particularly unburned fuel which can solidify with prolonged heating. A manufacturer could decide to redesign its valves by smoothing its channels, eliminating sharp bends, better lubricating valve axles, etc., as well as changing the valve location to control temperature and deposit formation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

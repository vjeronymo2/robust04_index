			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN VOLLEYBALL TEAM KEPT ON ITS TOES IN HAWAII  </P> <P> Hawaiian paradise has turned out to be more than a few days at the beach for  the Cal State Northridge women's volleyball team. The Matadors survived two  unexpectedly tough matches against lower-division foes in the first half of  their four-match trip to Oahu.  </P> <P> Chaminade fell in four games, 15-13, 13-15, 15-10, 15-8, late Monday and it  took five games late Tuesday for CSUN to do away with Brigham Young (Hawaii) of  the NAIA.  </P> <P> The 14-16, 16-14, 13-15, 15-11, 15-5 win extended Northridge's winning streak  to nine matches and improved CSUN's record to 18-5.  </P> <P> Now, the difficult part begins. Northridge will take on 15-2 Hawaii, ranked  third in the NCAA Division I coaches' poll, today at 10 p.m. (PDT) and Friday  at 10 p.m. (PDT).  </P> <P> It marks the first time the Matadors will play back-to-back games against the  same team.  </P> <P> "The first night we'll prepare the same way we do with every other team," CSUN  Coach Walt Ker said. "The second night it'll be a little different. Everyone  has a little more of the book on each other. Still, the bottom line is we gotta  execute. Hawaii is such a great team. Physically, they have no weaknesses."  </P> <P> A victory or two over a highly ranked team such as Hawaii would give CSUN what  the NCAA considers to be a "significant win."  </P> <P> In its quest to earn an at-large berth in the 32-team NCAA tournament, CSUN  needs several significant wins and a minimum of significant losses, that is,  losses against teams that the Matadors should beat.  </P> <P> Two of CSUN's losses are against teams that currently are ranked in the top 20.  Another loss, to USC, came when the Trojans were ranked.  </P> <P> "Even if we are 25-7 at the end of the season we may not get a bid," Ker said.  "A win or two over Hawaii would look good in the NCAA's eyes. But the San Diego  State and (Cal Poly) San Luis Obispo matches (Oct. 26 and Nov. 16,  respectively) are just as significant. We can't lose to them because we are not  supposed to. Although the winning streak is critical we weren't supposed to  lose to any of those teams."  </P> <P> Against BYU (Hawaii), Matador senior Kathleen Dixon played the best blocking  match of her career, according to Ker. Along with nine solo blocks and three  assists, she had 28 kills. Twin Marianne also played exceptionally well, adding  25 kills and eight blocks. In an unusual move, Ker played Marianne in the back  row for both matches and she responded well.  </P> <P> Right-side hitter Shelly Swalec reinjured her hamstring in the match and will  be replaced by Shana Wilson against Hawaii.  </P> <P> Although Ker is a taskmaster, the Matadors have combined business and pleasure.  Along with snorkeling and shopping, they toured Waimea Bay on the North Shore  of Oahu on Wednesday.  </P> <P> "We're trying to enjoy ourselves in this rough setting over here," Ker said.  "It's hard."  </P> <P> So is riding around in three white Cadillacs, the mode of transportation  provided for the Matadors when the rental company couldn't deliver the trio of  minivans Ker had reserved.  </P></p>

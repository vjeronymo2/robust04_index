In unusual circumstances, however, NCUA may consider other factors, such as other federal law or public policy, in deciding if a charter should be approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II_Common Bond <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Congress, in the Federal Credit Union Act, has recognized three types of federal credit union common bonds_occupational, associational, and community. A federal credit union may also consist of a combination of occupational, associational, and, in certain limited circumstances, community groups. For example, NCUA may charter a federal credit union consisting of employees of a local school district and members of a church group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA recognize that individual groups have their own common bond. All of the groups belonging to one particular credit union included in Section 5 of the credit union's charter make up the credit union's field of membership. If the charter is granted, the federal credit union will only be able to grant loans and provide services to persons within the groups defined in the field of membership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a federal credit union later wishes to add persons to its field of membership, it must comply with the procedures set forth in Chapter 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II.A_Occupational Common Bonds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> II.A.1_General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A federal credit union may include in a single occupational common bond, regardless of location, any and all persons who share that common bond. NCUA permits a person's membership in an occupational common bond to be established in a number of ways: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Employment (or a long-term contractual relationship equivalent to employment) in a single corporation or other legal entity makes that person part of an occupational common bond of employees of the entity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Employment in a corporation or other legal entity with an ownership interest in or by another legal entity makes that person part of an occupational common bond of employees of the two entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Employment in a corporation or other legal entity which is related to another legal entity (such as a company under contract and possessing a strong dependency relationship with another company) makes that person part of an occupational common bond of employees of the two entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proposed federal credit union must supply documentation from as many authorized representatives as are needed to establish that all persons to be included in a single occupational common bond are in fact linked in one of the ways described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An occupational common bond must include a geographic definitions, e.g., ``employees, officials, and persons who work regularly under contract in Miami, Florida for ABC Corporation or any of these majority-owned subsidiaries. *&blank;*&blank;*'' Other acceptable geographic definitions are: ``employees of *&blank;*&blank;* who are paid from *&blank;*&blank;*'' or ``employees of *&blank;*&blank;* who are supervised from *&blank;*&blank;*'' To the maximum extent possible, setting geographic definitions by changeable corporate or division boundary_e.g., ``employees of Federal Reserve District 6''_is to be avoided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> So that NCUA may monitor any potential field of membership overlaps, each group to be served (e.g., employees of subsidiaries, franchisees, and contractors) may be separately listed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The employer may also be included in this common bond_e.g., ``ABC Corporation and its subsidiaries.'' The employer group will be defined in the last clause describing the field of membership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> II.A.2_Sample Occupational Fields of Membership <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some examples of occupational group definitions are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Employees of the Scott Manufacturing Company who work in Chester, Pennsylvania. *&blank;*&blank;*'' (common bond_same employer) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Employees and elected and appointed officials of municipal government in Parma, Ohio. *&blank;*&blank;*'' (common bond_same employer) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Employees of Johnson Soap Company and its majority-owned subsidiary, Johnson Toothpaste Company, who work in Augusta and Portland, Maine. *&blank;*&blank;*'' (common bond_parent and majority-owned subsidiary company) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Personnel of fleet units of the U.S. Navy home ported at Mayport, Florida. *&blank;*&blank;*'' (common bond_same employer) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Department of Defense civilian and U.S. Army personnel who work or are stationed at, or are attached or assigned to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, or those who are retired from, or their dependents or dependent survivors who are eligible by law or regulation to receive and are receiving benefits or services from, that military installation. *&blank;*&blank;*'' (common bond_same employer) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Employees of those contractors who work regularly at U.S. Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. *&blank;*&blank;*'' (common bond_employees of contractors) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Employees, doctors, medical staff, technicians, medical and nursing students who work at Boston Medical Center at the locations stated: *&blank;*&blank;*'' (common bond_same employer) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

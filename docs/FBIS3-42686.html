			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Todres: "Gaydar and Fedorov As an </F> Appetizer for Subsidies; the Regions Have Prepared To Get What  They Have Coming to Them]    [Text]  <H5>  The Territories </H5>   It was not difficult to foresee the restrainedly satisfied  reaction of the regional authorities to the changes in the  Russian Cabinet of Ministers.    The general attitude, it appears, was expressed by Leonid  Polezhayev, the newly elected leader of the Siberian Agreement  association and the head of administration of Omsk Oblast:  "Gaydar left because the leadership of the country, 'and  especially Yeltsin,' finally realized the need to rectify  reform--first and foremost on questions of social protection and  the revival of Russia's industrial production.'"    It was the provincial chiefs who demanded changes in general  policy from the government, proposing that the cabinet  leadership itself look into "personnel support" of adjustments.  As far as SEGODNYA knows, at the famous luncheon with Viktor  Chernomyrdin, where the local bosses were being urged,  nonetheless, to elect Vladimir Shumeyko speaker of the  Federation Council, they refrained from being more precise about  personally whose heads should fall as a result. Only Buryat  Prime Minister Vladimir Saganov repeated his eternal refrain  that "we will never achieve anything with this Fedorov."    Now, even compliments can be heard following the reformers  who left. Irkutsk Governor Yuriy Nozhikov and Viktor Ignatenko,  the head of representative authority, think that "the government  aircraft still should have two wings--both directorial and  macroeconomic." But Vyacheslav Novikov, a Krasnoyarsk colleague  of Mr. Ignatenko, even declared that "not to give money is a  remarkable quality for a minister of finance, and Boris Fedorov  had it."    Now, the "fathers of remote places" are contentedly awaiting  the material results of "adjustments in the direction of  selective support of the regions and enterprises." In the words  of Primorye Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, 35 billion rubles [R]  in fuel subsidies have already been transferred to the  territory. Out of this, Valentin Dubinin, his deputy,  distributed R5 billion to those rayons and cities where heating  and water were starting to be cut off because of a shortage of  fuel. Vyacheslav Novikov expressed the hope that a certain  sum--"in the form of a credit or subsidy"--would be received  quickly by power engineering specialists of Krasnoyarsk Kray,  where because of nonpayments the miners of the Borodino open pit  mines were threatening to stop dispatching coal.    The oil workers of Western Siberia warned of the possibility  of a strike--strike committees have already been established  there in 12 oil and gas production associations. Yuriy  Shafranik, the minister of the fuel and power industry, called  for a sharp reduction yesterday in taxes for them, "inasmuch as  the power engineering specialists who are delivering fuel  despite the nonpayments are now actually engaged in  interest-free extension of credits for the entire economy of  Russia."    The parliament of the Republic of Karelia Thursday resolved  to try to get a substantial reduction in taxes from Moscow on  profits for enterprises of Karelia. Sergey Yaskulov, its first  vice prime minister, justifies this with the fact that "the  volume of industrial production in Karelia amounts to 81 percent  of the 1992 level, the differentiation in agricultural and  industrial incomes has become too wide, and there is a  noticeable worsening in the demographic situation." His  colleague, Anatoliy Maksimov, sits in Moscow without budging  from the place, lobbying for the demands of the region--but to  the indignation of the leadership of the republic, "he has been  unable to dislodge any kind of money up until now, even what is  due northern Karelia."    A coordinating council of Siberian Agreement on questions of  conversion is supposed to convene Tuesday in Omsk. In the  opinion of observers, it obviously intends to use the  reorganization of the government to demand additional money from  Moscow for the local VPK [military industrial complex].    It seems that the possibility of success among all of the  enumerated regional lobbyists is rather high. Especially when it  is considered that at a press conference Thursday, Viktor  Chernomyrdin promised "immediately to settle up with the most  pressing debts--first and foremost for wages, the VPK, the  'northerners,' and the agro-industrial complex."    As for the agrarians, they will personally state their  claims  to the prime minister and to Aleksandr Zaveryukha, his deputy,  and no later than Tuesday, when the leadership of 18  agricultural oblasts of central and southern Russia convene in  Orel. As Aleksandr Mayorov, Orel deputy governor, declared to  SEGODNYA, "They have still not paid us R10 billion for grain,  and the situation is about the same in the rest of the oblasts."  However, Mr. Zaveryukha, without waiting for the meeting in  Orel, has already promised to settle up all agrarian debts in  the sum of R1.3 trillion by the end of January.    Against all of this background, it is rather difficult to  understand the statement of the prime minister that "there is no  kind of branch pressure." The pressure, which was clear even  before Gaydar's and Fedorov's resignations from the government,  is growing along the entire front with increased strength. And  strong doubts exist that the cabinet will be able to cope with  it, while remaining within the framework of "selective"  additional feeding with meaningless money.</p>

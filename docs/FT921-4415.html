			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Fall in price of steel hits SSAB SSAB, the Swedish state-controlled steel concern which heads the list of planned share sales by the government, yesterday reported a 77 per cent drop in profits, after financial items, to SKr218m (Dollars 35.9m) for 1991. Mr Leif Gustafsson, the SSAB president, blamed the sharp profit decline on a 15 per cent price fall for steel, reflecting a price war in Europe due to excess production and a 20 per cent fall in demand in Sweden as the recession deepened. SSAB predicts steel consumption in Europe has bottomed out, but it sees no signs of increased demand in 1992. Profits could improve if steel prices recover due to increased demand in the US. SSAB is to maintain an unchanged dividend of SKr6 as it prepares to become one of the first state concerns to be completely privatised by the conservative government. SSAB also said all its shares will become non-restricted, allowing foreigners full shareholding access to SSAB. Group sales fell 12 per cent to SKr13.8bn, while the operating profit dropped 75 per cent to SKr249m. SSAB Strip Products division, which was SSAB's most profitable group in 1990 with profits of SKr280, suffered a loss of SKr9m in 1991.</p>

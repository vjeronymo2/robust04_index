He graduated from the military  medicine department of the Kuybyshev Medical Institute in 1972,  and in 1981 from the department of supervisor personnel of the  Military Medical Academy. In 1987 he became the Chief of Medical  Service of the Turkestan Military District. In 1991 he was  appointed the First Deputy Chief, and in October 1993 the Chief  of the Main Military Medical Directorate of the Ministry of  Defense, the Chief of Medical Service of the Armed Forces of the  Russian Federation. He is a Lieutenant-General of Medical  Service.    He is married, with a son who is a student at the  Military Medical Academy, and a daughter in college.    [Altunin] Ivan Mikhaylovich, you were the number two man in  the medical service of the Armed Forces for more than two years,  and now you are number one. You undoubtedly have a good idea of  what our health care is like today, and in particular are well  acquainted with the status of medical support in the Army and  Navy. The newspaper assertions which have become commonplace  recently, that our health is worsening -- are they justified?    [Chizh] As far as the country goes, the reduction in the  living standards of the populace, and in particular the  worsening in the quality of food, and the lack of social  protection of large groups of people, especially retirees and  disabled persons, result in the many negative consequences which  the papers write about.    I must say that in the Army and Navy, the medical indices in  all basic parameters are comparatively good. Thanks to  discipline, good organization of personnel, and the high  qualifications and devotion to duty of military medics in the  units and on the ships, epidemiological measures are active and  persistent, and there is strict monitoring of working conditions  in the Army.    [Altunin] Tell me, is the manpower adequate for this?  Haven't  you been affected by the reduction in the Armed Forces?    [Chizh] The general situation is not a simple one, of  course,  and it also affects the status of military medicine. But the Law  "On the Status of Service Members" and subsequent orders of the  minister of defense, which raised it to a qualitatively new  level in the Armed Forces, have entailed not a reduction in  personnel, but on the contrary, reinforcement of our  institutions.    After all, what were things like before this? We had  "active"  service members, as well as generals and senior reserve and  retired officers who had served 25 years in the Army, receiving  medical services. But now the contract troops and their families  are added to that, and also reserve and retired officers,  including junior ones, discharged with 20 years or more of  service, and their families. If you count the women and children  in the garrisons, and the blue and white-collar workers whom we  also serve, this amounts to around 5 million people. Imagine how  many medical personnel are needed today!    [Altunin] As you see it, what are the reasons for this?    [Chizh] There are several. Some are common to all officers,  particularly the poor living conditions, and for military  doctors, especially the scarce specialists, there is the  temptation of finding work in commercial structures. In recent  years the number of those wanting to continue their training in  military medical departments has also dropped significantly.    [Altunin] So what are you doing?    [Chizh] I must say that the package of military laws adopted  recently, which have somewhat raised the prestige of military  service, have played their part. But we are doing some things. A  system of post-graduate physician training has been created,  including primary specialization, along with systematic  improvement of medical personnel. Besides this, a significant  number of physicians have the chance to study in the department  of supervisor personnel and in clinical residencies.    Further, we have begun to successfully recruit women to the  departments. Incidentally, at present they make up about 5  percent of medical service officers, and according to  predictions by the year 2000 they will be 10 to 15 percent of  the total number. Since last year we have also begun recruiting  reserve medical service officers on a contract basis.    [Altunin] So things have worked out with respect to cadres.  But where will they serve the doubled contingent of patients,  these 5 million? After all, you can't spread apart the walls of  the hospitals and polyclinics, and they aren't building new ones.    [Chizh] No, but why must we? They are putting up new  buildings at the hospitals, even if it is slow, and bed space is  growing overall. Besides that, we are working actively to expand  and reconstruct old and so-called adapted premises. In addition,  a territorial system of medical service is being created. Small  institutions of different services and combat arms close to one  another are being combined into base hospitals and polyclinics.    The hospitals include specialized departments and offices,  including vascular surgery, oncology, endoscopy, "artificial  kidney," ultrasound and others. We are converting polyclinics  into consulting and diagnostic centers with the corresponding  reinforcement with qualified specialists and equipment.    The 45 Central Polyclinics of the Defense Ministry can serve  as an example. [A polyclinic] includes 18 treatment and  diagnostic departments, 12 offices, and an infection/immunology  laboratory. Last year around 30 thousand patients received  consultations there. Many of them were provided the necessary  assistance on the spot, during admittance, using various modern  methods of examination. Day inpatient facilities are a new and  undoubtedly progressive type of operation of military  polyclinics. What are they? After initial reception at the  office of the physician/therapist or surgeon, the officer is  sent to the inpatient facility of the polyclinic, where he  undergoes a complete examination from all the specialists  involved with his ailment without changing his "life-style." A  300-bed hospital could not have accommodated the patients who  have gone through "day inpatient" facilities in the last three  years. This means convenience for the service members and the  families, and in itself brings a savings of resources.    [Altunin] But we often get letters to the editors from  military retirees and even cadre officers that there is a long  waiting list for hospitalization.    [Chizh] Yes, this is true, especially in Moscow there are  still not enough places. Of course it is not a matter of urgent  assistance. There are no problems with that. This has to do with  planned treatments. But I already mentioned above that this  problem is being resolved. Of course, as before we give priority  to war veterans and disabled veterans and their equivalent  categories.    [Altunin] Ivan Mikhaylovich, letters of another type also  come to the editors, from service members and members of their  families suffering from grave illnesses. They persistently  request that they be sent abroad for treatment. What do you say  to this?    [Chizh] We get such letters at the GVMU [Main Military  Medical Directorate] too. As a human being I can understand  these people. Something terrible happens and you start rushing  about. Only, I must say that recently the capabilities of our  military treating facilities have grown significantly. For  example, at the Main Hospital imeni N.N. Burdenko, they have  done more than a hundred kidney transplants, are performing  unique cardiac operations and laparoscopic surgery (without  cutting into the abdominal cavity), and at the Central Hospital  imeni A.A. Vishnevskiy, they are successfully doing aortal  coronary bypasses for ischemic disease, and implanting  pacemakers for cardiac arrhythmias. At the Military Medical  Academy they are transplanting bone marrow to patients with  oncological blood diseases. In treatment practice, the latest  attainments of anesthesiology, resuscitation, microsurgery and  others are being used more and more.    As for trips abroad for treatment, that is a very individual  matter. But the corresponding expense item was not provided for  in the estimate of expenditures in the Defense Ministry. I know  there are very limited capabilities in the Ministry of Health of  the Russian Federation.    [Altunin] Afghanistan, where you saw both blood and death,  and directly organized medical support, and also the Chernobyl  accident, the earthquake in Armenia, and "hot spots" in  different regions of the country, has all of this "shaken up"  our military medicine? Has it forced some changes?    [Chizh] Our medicine has enormous experience from the Great  Patriotic War, and we continue to study and utilize it.  Nonetheless, the recent events which you mentioned have forced  us to revise much, and to put the accent on military field  surgery. The basic conclusion was to create an emergency medical  service. Besides the center, it calls for special-purpose  medical detachments in the Armed Services and districts and also  for a number of non-organic formations in military hospitals.  There is precedence: In the Hospital imeni Burdenko they have  already created "flying laboratories." When the situation  requires it, a group of doctors and nurses will head for "hot  spots" in a small special aircraft to provide rapid and  effective assistance to the injured. This year five medical  "special-purpose elements" will be organized. All of this within  the general doctrine of assuring a high level of combat  readiness for actions in extreme situations.    [Altunin] About emergency situations, Ivan Mikhaylovich. Did  you notice that there were two military medics among the ten  people named by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA in its "Exploit-93"?    [Chizh] How could I not? Thank you. Extracting a mine fuze  from the body of a Georgian lad, which in the course of the  surgery might cost the life of the surgeon himself, Colonel  Shurenkov, that is of course an exploit. But I must say that  nowadays such selflessness in military medics is more the rule  than the exception. For example, the medical chief of the 201st  Division, Lietenant-Colonel Valeriy Sergeyevich Arutyunov,  during an attack on the 12th Element of the Moscow Border  Detachment himself personally rushed in on an APC and while  under fire from the Mujaheddin provided assistance to the  wounded, and carried them from the battlefield. And a  just-recent incident: The chief surgeon of the Armed Forces,  Major-General of Medical Service Pavel Georgiyevich Bryusov was  at the operating table for nine hours, removing the trachea and  simultaneously the esophagus of an oncological patient, and then  restoring them with prostheses.    [Altunin] A few words about medical supplies.    [Chizh] You know what the general supply background is in  the  country. The basic problems come from a shortage of financing.  Nonetheless, with the support of the Defense Ministry and with  the assistance of the Ministry of Health and our own  initiatives, I can state firmly that we have managed to maintain  the treatment-and-prevention institutions at a level which  allows them to fully provide all types of medical assistance. We  have signed more than 600 contracts in the amount of 20.8  billion rubles for delivery of 7 thousand items of medical  technical equipment and gear from 700 enterprises and  joint-stock companies.    We are also given hard currency to buy imported equipment,  but very little. But I want to say that we have now organized  the production of many nationally-produced medications and  instruments which are equal to the foreign analogues, or even  surpass them. This includes, for example, ultrasound units,  lithotripsy devices, gammascopic units and much else.    [Altunin] We know that for the time being article 16 of the  Law "On the Status of Service Members" is "not working."    [Chizh] Some provisions, having to do with medical support  of  all service members and their families are already working, as I  mentioned earlier. As for the payment of monetary compensation  in the amount of the average cost of travel, that we don't have.  A draft statute "On Procedures for Compensation of Expenses  Associated With Provision of Medical Assistance, Sanatorium and  Spa Treatment, and Organized Rest of Service Members, Civilians  Discharged From Military Service, and Members of Their Families,  as Well as Payment of Monetary Compensation for Treatment" has  been sent to the government. Unfortunately, the adoption of this  statute is being delayed due to the lack of financial resources.    I should add that since many military health resorts "went"  to the CIS countries, and particularly to Ukraine, we are  expanding the spa system in Russia. New buildings are springing  up in the Moscow region and in the Stavropol and Krasnodar  krays, and last year's plan was met. In addition we have  acquired ("ransomed") from other ministries a number of  sanatoria which were becoming run-down. This "deal" was made by  the Airborne Troops, the Transbaykal Military District, and the  Space Troops. Talks are under way with Ukraine regarding joint  use of the Black Sea military health resorts.    [Altunin] Ivan Mikhaylovich, the last word: How do you  yourself, a doctor, set an example in improving health?    [Chizh] For now I get along without medicine. I love  volleyball and skiing. I have to say that recently because I  have neglected these "procedures" because I have been so busy,  and have limited myself to intensive morning exercise. I think  that when I get into the new routine, I will make up for it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  (SDP), poised to rejoin the ruling coalition, is proposing the  introduction of a numbering system for Japanese taxpayers by  2001 as part of national tax reforms, SDP sources said Thursday  [23 June].    The SDP, which split from the coalition in April in protest  at maneuverings by its partners to create a new Diet bloc  excluding the party, is moving to rejoin the fold.    The sources said the numbering system would facilitate fair  combined taxation and plug tax loopholes.    The SDP proposal, which also calls for increased  contributions from the national treasury for basic pensions,  gives more emphasis to fairer taxation and public welfare  measures than similar proposals by the government's tax  commission and a coalition panel.    The proposal will be discussed at policy consultations on  Friday morning between representatives of the SDP and member  parties of the ruling coalition, the sources said.    Sharp differences on tax reforms remain, however, between  the  SDP and the ruling parties over the extent of a raise in the  consumption tax from the present 3 percent and other issues,  they said.</p>

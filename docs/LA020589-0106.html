			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board gave the operator of the Three Mile  Island plant in Pennsylvania approval to boil off 2.3 million gallons of  radioactive water -- part of the legacy of the nation's worst nuclear accident.  About 260,000 gallons of the water has been sitting in the reactor building  basement since the 1979 accident. The rest of the water has accumulated during  cleanup operations. General Public Utilities Nuclear, the plant operator,  proposed to get rid of all the water by boiling it into steam released from a  100-foot-high stack, and packaging impurities for shipment to a waste dump.  Pennsylvania citizens' groups have challenged the decision, expressing concern  about the release of radiation into the atmosphere.  </P></p>

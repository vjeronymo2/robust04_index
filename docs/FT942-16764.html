			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Price to pay for manipulation Sir, ICI's comments about prices in the Electricity Pool ('Power costs anger large users', April 6) deserve little sympathy. We have what it calls 'manipulated prices' because the largest users of electricity, presumably including ICI, somehow convinced the regulator that they pay too much for their power. His response was to persuade the two biggest generating companies to use their market position in a way which would achieve an average annual price of 2.4 pence per unit. ICI will have to accept that even regulated prices will rise and fall before such an average is achieved. There is also an unfortunate side effect to the decision. The manipulated price has been fixed at a level below that needed to secure the development of new power stations. This is hardly the way to hasten the arrival of the regulator's 'fully competitive market'. David Porter, chief executive, Association of Independent Electricity Producers, 1st Floor, 41 Whitehall, London SW1A 2BX</p>

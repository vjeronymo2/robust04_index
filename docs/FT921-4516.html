			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Observer: Strange taste The idea that Warren Buffett, the canny American investor, has suddenly found a taste for the shares of Guinness, Britain's sixth biggest company, is a bit hard to swallow. True, Buffett likes to take big stakes in solid brand names and has done very well by investing in that other well-known drinks company, Coca-Cola. But Buffett tends to invest in famous names when they are down on their luck. Witness his current love-affair with Salomon. Guinness, by contrast, has been outperforming the market for years and is selling on 18 times earnings. It is hard to see how it can perform much better. If Buffett really has a big stake in Guinness - one per cent would be worth over Pounds 100m - perhaps he should be thinking of lightening his load, rather than adding to it?</p>

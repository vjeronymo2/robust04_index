			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Chubays, deputy prime minister of </F> the Government of Russia, by unidentified ARGUMENTY I FAKTY  correspondent; place and date not given: "Zhirinovskiy's Plot?"]    [Text] A few days ago EFIR-DAIDZHEST reported that  Anatoliy Chubays, deputy prime minister of the Government of  Russia, speaking on a British television program, said that  there exists a plot aimed at bringing V. Zhirinovskiy into power  in our country no later than this coming fall. We asked A.  Chubays to explain what he meant.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] What sources do you have for such  contentions?    [Chubays] The sources of information are quite simple: A  special trait of figures like Zhirinovskiy is that they cannot  keep their mouth shut, which lets them down, especially when  they publish in "their" publications. They get a little "carried  away" and say things they had not intended to say.    I have in my possession the newspaper ZAVTRA, which  published  a dialogue between A. Prokhanov and Mr. Zhirinovskiy. In it,  Zhirinovskiy states: "...and in Russia, in order to wake up the  Russian nation, it can be awaken by bloodshed." I think this  statement does not need any comment.    Next A. Prokhanov asks V. Zhirinovskiy: "You mean that  reintegration will occur through the tragedy of these people?"  (meaning unification of the former USSR republics). V.  Zhirinovskiy replies: "Through death! The death of millions of  Tajiks, Georgians, Uzbeks." I want to draw your attention also  to the title of this material: "I Will Move Into the Kremlin!"  He also names the time frame--this coming fall.    I did not invent all this--I simply reproduced what Vladimir  Volfovich himself said.    It is interesting to see how he reacted to my comments in  the  BBC program. This is what REUTER writes. V. Zhirinovskiy is  asked: "What is your reaction to what A. Chubays said?" He  replies: "Chubays told the truth. He is absolutely right." Next  he says that there have been two putsches: "These two putsches  were without our participation, and that is why they failed.  With our participation, victory will be ensured. The third time  will be with our participation."    What follows from this? It is obvious that these people  understand very well that the only way for them to come to power  is through bloodshed. It is clear that they will attempt to  provoke this bloodshed. Of course, all our economic  difficulties, all problems are fertile soil for them, on which  they have grown in the first place. The worse the economic  situation, the better it is for them, the more chances that they  will be able to rock the boat and "move into the Kremlin" in the  fall. Why in the fall? So far there are no presidential  elections scheduled for the fall. They are scheduled for 1996.  If a political figure, a leader of a party, says "I will move  into the Kremlin in the fall," it means that he is speaking of  an unconstitutional method of seizing power. All other words:  "by peaceful means," "people themselves will carry me in," "I  will be given a ticket to move into the Kremlin"--these are just  window dressing to cover the plot.    That is why I see this situation as so serious. And I treat  it not as empty bantering but as a slip Zhirinovskiy has made  regarding plans that are actually being hatched by his  supporters. And I am convinced that both government bodies and  public organizations should treat it seriously. The president  has already said that he will watch carefully over any actions  violating the law, on the part of both those who have been  amnestied and those who are in cohort with them.    Our actions with respect to setting up the Russia's Choice  Party are directly linked with this. We do not need a debating  club that discusses various general political problems--we need  a well-defined political structure with a staff, cadres,  communications, and finances, capable of providing resistance to  provocation. We can only fight this threat by united efforts: of  the state, which resorts to the enforcement apparatus in the  event the law is violated, and social forces, for which the road  of plots is unacceptable.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] It is strange to hear a reformer predict  V. Zhirinovskiy's victory.    [Chubays] I never said Zhirinovskiy would win, because I am  convinced that fascism cannot win in Russia--at least legally. I  do not believe that Russia will ever give its vote to a fascist  leader. For me it is also impossible because I am a son of a  military man who fought the war from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945.  As to the threat of fascism, I spoke of it as long ago as 13  December 1993.</p>

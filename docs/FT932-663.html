			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / The European Market: Hunting the Euro-consumer - Common market or not, EC citizens remain intractably individual FAR from offering marketing managers a conformist, 'Euro-consumer' paradise, the EC's citizens remain intractably individual. Research by Mintel provides extensive evidence - 16 volumes of it in all - of huge diversity in the European market of 340m consumers. It is impossible to give a complete breakdown of the picture Mintel has built up after questioning more than 7,000 consumers in Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. But the flavour of the mix of consumer attitudes should be taken into account by any business toying with the idea of pan-European marketing. Mintel's report suggests that certain trends prevail throughout the EC - generally higher spending on healthcare than a decade ago, yet lower spending on food and drink - even though individual markets have markedly different characteristics. For anyone involved in marketing across EC borders it is vital to understand this apparent contradiction. Take new products. Multinational companies increasingly seek to launch new products across the whole of Europe, not just one or two countries. Knowing what influences consumers to sample a new product is a vital piece of marketing information. And knowing that the French are twice as likely as the European average (22 per cent against 11 per cent) to sample a new product if they see it being endorsed by a celebrity - as Mintel's survey has discovered - could make a big difference in the manner and costs of marketing that new product in France. In the UK only 1 per cent of those asked said they would be influenced into new product sampling by seeing it endorsed by a celebrity. Similarly, the perceived power of advertising differs across the EC. In Italy (50 per cent) and France (55 per cent) more than half those questioned said all forms of advertising played a key role in prompting a purchase. Yet in Spain only 31 per cent said that advertising had an effect on their spending habits. When it comes to particular media, habits are again widely different. Just 9 per cent of Spaniards claim to be influenced by magazine and newspaper advertising, whereas in France the figure is 29 per cent. Across the six countries an average of 19 per cent said they were influenced by magazine and newspaper advertising, against just 6 for radio advertising. Marketing takes many forms, with some of the most influential the least visible. Sales promotions, direct mail, free-trial offers and money-off coupons meet a widely different consumer response across the EC. While just 4 per cent of Dutch respondents admitted to being influenced by eye-catching package designs, the figure shoots to 21 per cent of French shoppers. Only 22 per cent of Dutch admit to being swayed by money-off coupons, yet 67 per cent of French find it an important factor. And just as current purchasing practices are far from homogeneous, future ones are likely to be highly variable. Mintel asked respondents what they would spend more on if their incomes increased by 25 per cent. Of those opting to spend more on leisure activities, 22 per cent of the French would raise spending on meals outside the home; just 6 per cent of the Italians would make that choice.

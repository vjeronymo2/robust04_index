			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / IMF set to assist more ex-Soviet states The International Monetary Fund is considering support agreements in Uzbekistan, Armenia and Azerbaijan, the last three candidates for a scaled-down programme specifically designed for eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. If the three republics are granted Systemic Transformation Facilities, the IMF will be assisting almost all the independent nations that emerged after the Soviet collapse. It would leave just ex-Yugoslavia, Georgia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan without IMF assistance when the STF programme closes to new members next month. The IMF has eased its requirements in this programme, a special case being made for eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In general, the IMF has responded to criticism that its guidelines were too tough for this region. The two Caucascus republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, for example, have among the region's worst economies mostly because of their six- year undeclared war against one another. Uzbekistan, conversely, has suffered little instability but has been among the most reluctant to adopt genuine economic reform. 'These have been the laggards all along,' said a western economist, referring to the last three STF candidates. 'You don't know whether they are now committed to reform, or if they simply see the boat leaving and don't want to miss it.' Analysts believe Armenia will almost certainly reach agreement with the IMF. While economists are not entirely satisfied with Azberbaijan's performance, it would be politically difficult for the IMF to admit Armenia but not its enemy. Uzbekistan is trying to persuade the IMF that it will stop indirect subsidies to state enterprises and reduce state control over its main industry, cotton.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAFFIC WATCH;  </P> <P> RAIL PLAN  </P> <P> The apparent popularity of the Blue Line has put more in motion than thousands  of happy commuters. It also has injected new movement into stalled negotiations  over unused right-of-ways that could form a new regional commuter-rail system.  </P> <P> More than a year ago, the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe railroads offered to  sell the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC) five little-used  branch lines totaling more than 200 miles of track. When combined with the  county's right-of-ways, the lines would allow planners to assemble a mix of  light- and heavy-rail lines stretching from San Bernardino to Santa Monica and  from Santa Clarita to Long Beach.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, negotiations over the lines broke down in June, when the  companies and the county were unable to agree on the formula for setting a  price. Now both sides have announced a willingness to resume talks, though they  also agree the monetary gulf is wide. But however gaping it may be, the Blue  Line experience suggests that it's worth bridging.  </P> <P> Few of the disastrous regional planning decisions made -- or, for that matter,  not made -- over the past 30 years have been as obviously destructive as the  dismantling of the 1,164-mile network of Red Car Trolley lines in 1961. To  detail the consequences of that willful folly is to belabor what is obvious to  every commuter who will spend unrecoverable hours of their lives next week  stalled in traffic.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Avraham Shohat, who heads the  Israeli delegation to the economic talks in Paris, says that  although not all the problems have been solved, progress is  achievable. It has been learned from the Israeli delegation  that about 60 percent of the economic agreements have been  drafted.    Last night Israeli and PLO representatives discussed worker  traffic. The remaining unresolved issues are the imports from  Arab countries and the value added tax rates. Our correspondent  Gid'on Kouts reports that the PLO has agreed to establish a  monetary authority instead of a central bank, and as for  Palestinian currency, there will be a limited token issue.    This round of the Paris talks will continue until 11 April.</p>

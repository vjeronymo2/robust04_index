			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Entitled to benefit HAVING BOUGHT Treasury 8 per cent 2009 on the National Savings register, I was charged Pounds 309.10 for 138 days' accrued interest (gross). Can I offset this against the first payment of gross interest, and account to the Inland Revenue only for tax on the difference? Also, having bought some Inchcape 12 1/2 per cent ULS and Bristol &amp; West Pibs, I was charged a total of Pounds 354.40 as accrued interest. When I receive payment of the first interests, they will be paid net - which, of course, covers the accrued periods. Have I a claim for recovery of tax on the Pounds 354.40? Although you forgot to tell us the nominal amount of each holding, it is clear that the total nominal amount exceeds Pounds 5,000. That being so, you are entitled to the benefit of the accrued-income scheme (AIS), and can claim the appropriate relief in your next tax return. Meanwhile, ask your tax office for the free pamphlet on the AIS: IR68. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

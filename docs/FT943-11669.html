			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Japanese rise in output holds steady Japanese industrial production rose in the three months to June for the second consecutive quarter, the first time it has done this since the downturn hit nearly three years ago. Increased sales helped output in the second period to rise by 0.8 per cent against the opening three months of the year, when production increased by 1.5 per cent, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. However, it warned that output might weaken in the third quarter, due to price advantages given to imports by the yen's strength. Output in June rose 2 per cent from the previous month, having fallen in April and May. On an unadjusted basis it was stagnant in the year to June, breaking a record 32 consecutive months of decline. Manufacturing sales rose 4.1 per cent from May to June, contributing to a decline in stocks of unsold goods. Miti's index of inventories to annual sales fell by 4.1 per cent to 113.5 in June, not far above the 110 at which the ministry believes stocks will be sufficiently reduced in line with demand. Officials said stock reduction was in the final phase and posing less of a drag on production. Japanese business planned to reduce investment in plant and equipment by 3.2 per cent in the final quarter of the year, after a 2.8 per cent fall in the third quarter and a 4.4 per cent decline in the second period. This confirms that corporate investment has yet to bottom out, and that the fragile signs of recovery are being supported mainly by personal spending.</p>

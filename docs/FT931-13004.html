			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Uzbekistan's president tightens his grip on the oppositio: The former Soviet republic retains the closed atmosphere of the old USSR WITH the political trial of Mr Abdoumanob Pulatov that resumed in the Supreme Court today, Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov is tightening a crackdown that has effectively silenced political debate in the former Soviet republic. Mr Pulatov, a leader of the opposition movement Birlik (unity), stands accused of insulting Mr Karimov, a crime carrying a possible six-year prison sentence. The trial is expected to conclude today. In another important trial last week, the Supreme Court outlawed Birlik for three months. The crime was 'intent' to organise public demonstrations, which are banned in Uzbekistan. The ban against Birlik, coming after months of arrests, disappearances and beatings, leaves Uzbekistan's chief opposition party moribund. Last Tuesday a member of Birlik's ruling presidium, Mr Alim Karimov, who is not related to the president, was spirited away by unidentified men and has not been heard from since. Another critic, Islamic Renaissance party leader Abdullah Utah, disappeared last month. 'The living standard is so bad now that they are afraid of a social explosion. That's why they want to eliminate all organised opposition,' said Mr Shukhrat Ismatulayev, Birlik's co-chairman. It is true that life has become tougher for Uzbekistan's 20m people since the Soviet Union collapsed over a year ago. The price of some basic items has risen 100-fold, while monthly wages have gone up only six-fold, to about 3,000 roubles (about Pounds 4.40). But the tight grip maintained in Uzbekistan and throughout former Soviet Central Asia probably has more to do with conservatism than with fears of a social explosion. More so than any of the 15 former Soviet republics, the five Central Asian republics retain the closed, inflexible atmosphere of the former USSR. Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan maintain different shades of political and economic rigidity, with a new, hardline government having recently taken power in Tajikistan. But resource-rich Uzbekistan is the least changed from the Soviet period. President Karimov tries to keep matters under his sole control, through a combination of political repression and, despite public statements to the contrary, an almost obstructionist approach to foreign investors. Foreign businessmen grouse constantly about the problems of obtaining decisions. Mr Karimov insists on oversight of the tiniest details, which sometimes include even the design of luncheon invitations. They also say that investment policy, though seeming liberal as written into law, is still vague. But it is Mr Karimov's political crackdown that has recently attracted the greatest attention. In its yearly human rights report, issued last week, the US State Department said Uzbekistan was 'responsible for significant human rights abuses'. 'The regime's heavy-handed control of the political process. . . was a major impediment to further progress and left in doubt its commitment to democratisation,' the State Department said. The report also said, 'despite government denials, the frequency of assault on opposition political figures, with the assailants never being apprehended, suggested government involvement'. Mr Pulatov, Birlik's human rights committee leader, was abducted by the Uzbekistan KGB at a human rights convention in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan last month. The government accuses Mr Pulatov of defaming President Karimov during a Tashkent State University demonstration last January in which three students were killed. According to the government case, Mr Pulatov gave a student a placard containing Mr Karimov's photograph and told him to carry it in the demonstrations. Underneath the photograph was the caption: 'Here is a beast that devours its own children.' But in the first three days of testimony last week, the three government witnesses - all of them students - offered contradictory accounts. One student testified that he had no idea whose placard it was. A second said Mr Pulatov was part of a large group of students, all of whom handled the placard. Only the third, Mr Jalol Gadayev, testified that he saw Mr Pulatov himself produce the placard for the student to carry. Uzbekistan tempted by golden lure, Page 26</p>

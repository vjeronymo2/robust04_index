			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hafslund to buy imaging business Hafslund Nycomed, the Norwegian group best known for its radiology products, yesterday announced it had agreed to acquire the diagnostic imaging business of US-based Sterling Winthrop from Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals group, for Dollars 450m. The acquisition, the largest by a Norwegian group, represents a significant step for the company in its ambitions to become the world's leading producer of contrast media, which are used to improve X-ray images. Hafslund estimates the contrast media market will be worth NKr20bn (Dollars 2.89bn) next year. The deal would give Hafslund a 45 per cent share of the US market, where its main competitors are Bristol-Myers Squibb and Schering of Germany. 'Through this acquisition, Hafslund has achieved its strategic goal of establishing a presence in its own right in the US pharmaceutical market, which is the largest in the world, and will thus retain a larger share of the total added value on its products,' said Mr Svein Aaser, Hafslund president and chief executive. The sale also represents an important part of Sanofi's programme of disposals to help finance its Dollars 1.68bn acquisition of the prescription pharmaceuticals business of Sterling Winthrop, the healthcare subsidiary of Eastman Kodak. Announcing the acquisition of Sterling Winthrop last week, Mr Jean-Francois Dehecq, Sanofi chairman, indicated some Sterling Winthrop businesses were not central to Sanofi's strategy and would be sold. Sanofi said that the specific nature of the diagnostic imaging business, which involved the production and sale of contrast agents, meant it would not be part of its strategy. The French company said, however, that it would retain the sub-licence in Japan for Omnipaque, one of the diagnostic imaging agents. Following the deal, Sanofi said the effective price of its US acquisition had been reduced to Dollars 1.23bn, supporting its forecast that the purchase of Sterling Winthrop's prescription drugs businesses would raise earnings per share by up to 15 per cent next year. In 1993 Sterling's contrast media business generated sales of Dollars 480m. Hafslund expects to realise annual synergies from the acquisition of up to Dollars 80m.</p>

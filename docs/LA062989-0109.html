			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PASSES BILL TO FREE MOTHER JAILED TWO YEARS IN CUSTODY CASE  </P> <P> The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a bill aimed at freeing a woman  jailed nearly two years by a judge for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of  her daughter in a child-custody case.  </P> <P> The bill would require prosecutors in the District of Columbia to release or to  file criminal contempt charges -- guaranteeing a trial and the possibility of  bail -- against anyone who had been held more than 12 months for civil contempt  of court.  </P> <P> The measure, which passed by a 376-34 margin, is designed to apply  retroactively to the case of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a local plastic surgeon.  </P> <P> She was jailed for civil contempt in August, 1987, after refusing to produce  her daughter, Hilary, for court-ordered visits with Dr. Eric Foretich, her  ex-husband and the girl's father.  </P> <P> Morgan hid Hilary after alleging that Foretich had sexually abused the  6-year-old girl; Foretich has repeatedly denied those charges.  </P> <P> Before the legislation could take effect, the Senate would have to act as well.  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has introduced a similar bill, but it has not yet  been debated.  </P> <P> Congress has review power over all District of Columbia laws, but rarely uses  its right to intervene in the city's court system.  </P> <P> Morgan's case now stands before the city's appeals court, which is reviewing  D.C. Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon's May 11 decision to keep her behind  bars until she reveals where her daughter is.  </P> <P> The case has gained national attention as women's rights groups and  organizations concerned with child abuse have rallied to Morgan's defense.  Foretich has been backed by several fathers' groups.  </P> <P> "The controversy (involving Morgan) is not the issue we're addressing. . . .  We're addressing a flaw in the criminal justice system," the bill's sponsor,  Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), said during floor debate. "The flaw is that anyone  -- including Dr. Morgan -- can remain behind bars indefinitely on civil  contempt charges."  </P> <P> The bill survived despite protests that it would set a bad precedent in child  custody battles and concern that Congress should not intrude on city court  matters.  </P> <P> "This interferes with an ongoing court case, and that is bad public policy,"  Rep. Herbert H. Bateman said during debate on the bill. "If this is such a good  idea, we should have done it for all 50 states."  </P> <P> "Don't apply it just to Dr. Morgan's case -- apply it to others and see if it  fits," pleaded Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).  </P> <P> Stephen Sachs, Morgan's attorney, has repeatedly asked Dixon to file criminal  contempt charges against Morgan so that she can receive a jury trial.  </P></p>

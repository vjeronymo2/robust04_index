			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- The ruling coalition's chief  strategist Ichiro Ozawa criticized the leading opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Monday [4 April] for refusing  Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 state budget because of a  loan issue involving Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. At a  press conference, Ozawa, co-founder of the coalition's core  party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), said at a news  conference, "It is unreasonable for the LDP to hold Diet  deliberations hostage."    The LDP has refused to attend lower house Budget Committee  sessions to discuss the 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal  1994 for a month, demanding that Hosokawa submit further  documents relating to a 100 million yen loan from the Sagawa  Kyubin business group, the country's leading but scandal-tainted  trucking group, and that his former secretary testify in the  Diet.    The Diet last Friday enacted a 50-day provisional budget for  the current fiscal year with a record outlay of 11.05 trillion  yen to bridge the delay in Diet passage of the full fiscal 1994  budget.    The LDP has said the loan might be an illegal donation,  contrary to Hosokawa's assertion that he borrowed the money to  buy a condominium in Tokyo and to repair the gate and walls of  his house in his native Kumamoto Prefecture, western Japan.    The premier has resisted the LDP demands, saying he  presented  as much evidence as he could and there were no illegalities in  the loan from the Sagawa Kyubin group, whose now-defunct Tokyo  Sagawa Kyubin Co. was implicated in a mob-and-money scandal  involving politicians such as disgraced former LDP don Shin  Kanemaru.    On international affairs, Ozawa expressed dissatisfaction  with the United States' reinstatement of the so-called Super 301  trade legislation in early March, which allows the U.S.  Government to take retaliatory steps unless Japan meets its  demands for greater access to its markets. "This is a type of  political fighting and could lead to nationalism, aggravating  the feelings of the people of the two countries," Ozawa told  reporters.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Firmer sterling leads longer-dated gilts higher LONGER-dated UK govern-ment bonds rose about a point yesterday as sterling firmed, though the gilt market failed to get as much of a lead as some had hoped from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer. Mr Lamont failed to provide any real direction to the markets when he addressed the Tory party conference and attempted to set out the bones of the government's economic strategy outside the ERM. At first, gilt prices slipped back, reflecting a two pfennig slide by sterling. Then they recovered with the pound to show strength at the longer-dated end. By the close, long gilt futures were a full point firmer at 96.14 and the 10-year government bond had risen  29/32 to 104-17. Recovery of the long-dated government bonds was partly sparked by a growing confidence that Germany was likely to cut rates in the next few weeks. Dealers said there was overseas demand for the 10-year gilt, particularly from the US, although trading continued to be thin. GERMAN government bonds consolidated recent gains as bunds moved within a narrow band and closed virtually unchanged. There was still some overhang from Wednesday's auction on new 10-year bonds. One analyst said that too much inference had been drawn from recent comments by Bundesbank officials and a rate cut was not as certain as some investors had believed. The bund futures contract on Liffe was virtually unchanged at 91.12. SPANISH government bonds experienced a sharp rally yesterday as investors decided that any devaluation was likely to be smaller than previously thought. The market had been discounting a devaluation of about 6 per cent but some traders argued that this appeared unrealistic, making the benchmark 10-year bond cheap. There was some covering of short positions and the bond jumped some three points, with the yield spread against the D-Mark narrowing by as much as 65 basis points to 595. ITALY continued to see consolidation with government bonds bouncing back in early trade, helped by short covering. However, analysts said that the fundamental situation in Italy continued to be very worrying. Yesterday the Italian budget minister notified parliament that the government would seek a confidence vote to secure approval of a L23,800bn package of spending cuts. Late in the day, the Bank of Italy cut its Lombard rate by half a point to 16 per cent, reflecting the easing of pressure in the money markets and a partial reversal of the last rate hike on September 4 when the lira was in the ERM. IN FRANCE, there was initial disappointment that the central bank did not follow the recent lead provided by Belgium and Holland and cut interest rates. The Bank of France said it left its intervention rate unchanged at 9.6 per cent. However, interest picked up later and OATs gained  3/4 of a point, while the BTANs advanced nearly  1/2 point. Dealers said the inverted yield curve was far less pronounced, suggesting that the prospects of a rate cut were growing all the time. BELGIAN bond markets saw little movement by the close of trade, but the market managed to hold on to Wednesday's gains. Dutch government bonds finished a quiet session flat to slightly firmer with the guilder's recent strength continuing to lend support. IN TOKYO, Japanese government bonds and futures prices were down from their Wednesday close but off their lows in late afternoon trade. Faded hopes for an imminent relaxation of US credit induced selling from dealers, but moderate short covering lifted prices slightly before the close. SWEDISH yields for short-dated bonds closed sharply lower as a market consensus grew that the central bank would continue to cut its key lending rate from yesterday's 18 per cent. On Wednesday, the bank lowered its marginal lending rate from 20 per cent and said earlier it was aiming at levels below that of last summer when it stood at 11.5 per cent. It did not elaborate on a possible time frame for further cuts. US Treasury prices posted solid gains yesterday afternoon after an undistinguished morning and in spite of an unexpectedly large fall in initial jobless claims. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/32 at 97 5/8 , yielding 7.443 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  3/32 at 100 5/16 , yielding 3.817 per cent. The day's main economic news was of a 24,000 decline in weekly state unemployment claims, a much larger than expected fall. Although prices shed a few points on the news, reports of strong Middle East buying of seven-year notes helped the market regain most of its lost ground by midday. Prices were supported by demand from investors who believed the market had been oversold in the few days after the Federal Reserve failed to cut interest rates following a poor September employment report.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the Chernobyl nuclear power station, a leak from  a pool with used fuel cassettes was detected on 11 June.    As the Chief of Ukraine's National Committee for Emergencies  Sergey Nazarenko has told INTERFAX, water did not spread outside  the station grounds. In his words, polluted water has been  reliably collected for special treatment.    The situation at Chernobyl is said to have returned to  normal.</p>

During the half-hour meeting, the two discussed a wide range  of political and economic issues, including the ROC's entry into  the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) and its bid to join the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a dialogue  partner.    Chairmin Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for Economic  Planning  and Development, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Fang Chin-yen,  and Government Information Office Director-General Jason Hu were  also present at the meeting.    Lien will also visit other high-ranking officials during his  three-day stay in Malaysia.    Lien arrived in Kuala Lumpur Friday on a private visit, seen  by the local press as the most important step in ROC's bid to  promote ties with countries that maintain diplomatic relations  with Beijing.    Two-way trade between Taiwan and Malaysia totaled US$3.29  billion in the first 11 months of 1993 with Malaysia enjoying a  US$250 million trade surplus.    Lien will fly to Singapore for a three-day visit Sunday.</p>

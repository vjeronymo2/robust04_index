			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Sainsbury abandons plan for Somerset superstore J. Sainsbury, the food retailer, is abandoning its plans to build a superstore on the outskirts of Yeovil, Somerset. The scheme ran into strong local opposition, with protestors occupying vacant buildings in the town centre. The decision, announced yesterday, comes less than a fortnight after Sainsbury said it would continue with its programme of opening 20 superstores a year for the next four years. Sainsbury denied that the withdrawal had any bearing on its overall development programme, but said it was because Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, had given consent for a nearby Safeway store. Sainsbury said that since it first sought a Yeovil site in 1986 'the provision of food shopping in the town has increased dramatically'. It had negotiated a clause with South Somerset district council which allowed it to withdraw if consent was given for another supermarket within five miles. The council supported the Sainsbury store, which would have had a gross area of more than 50,000 sq ft and parking for 460 cars, but opposed Safeway's scheme, about a mile away. After a public inquiry Mr Gummer approved the Safeway plan in December. Recently the Department of Environment has taken a tougher stance on out-of-town developments. On Monday Mr Gummer urged local authorities to discourage it. Sainsbury was to pay about Pounds 6m for the site and the county council was to provide Pounds 2m towards a new access road and other infrastructure costing Pounds 5.1m. But the plans caused protests because of the impact on the Wyndham Hill green space and the town centre. Objectors from Earth First, an environmental pressure group, occupied an empty Tesco store in the town. After a High Court eviction order they moved into another derelict building.</p>

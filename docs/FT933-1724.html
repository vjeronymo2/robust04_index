			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Indian bank seeks to raise Dollars 820m from public issues STATE Bank of India, India's largest commercial bank, will launch later this year equity and bond issues worth a total of Rs24.72bn (Dollars 820m). It will be the first time in 40 years that an Indian commercial bank has made a public issue of securities. The capital injection will enable the bank to meet the Basle agreement on bank capital adequacy requirements. SBI's capital ratios are currently around 5 per cent. The Basle norm is 8 per cent. The move is being widely interpreted in India as a sign of the government's determination to press ahead with the sale of shares in the bank. Once the issues are launched, the government's stake in SBI will fall to about 74 per cent from 95 per cent at present. The equity element of the public offer is 12.4m shares at a premium of Rs800 to raise Rs11.16bn. The bond issue will centre on 10-year floating rate bonds, with interest at 2.5 per cent above the maximum term deposit rate, which is 10 per cent at present. Analysts predict that the SBI flotations will be a runaway success, partly because of their rarity value. The Rs800 premium is considered modest by analysts. It compares with the Rs4,400 at which the shares currently change hands on the Bombay Stock Exchange, and with a peak last year of Rs7,250. Indian bourses are passing through a difficult phase; share prices are far below peak levels of 18 months ago. SBI has Rs14.62bn capital and reserves. The capital injection will lift owned funds to nearly Rs40bn. The bank made a net profit of Rs2.12bn for the year ended March.</p>

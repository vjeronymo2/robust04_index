The confirmation of the report made by  economist Jose Carlos Alves dos Santos forestalled the political  deaths of some important congressional leaders such as Deputy  Ibsen Pinheiro (RS [Rio Grande do Sul]), Genebaldo Correia (BA  [Bahia]) of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Jose  Luis Maia (PI [Piaui]) of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party],  and Ricardo Fiuza (PE [Pernambuco]) of the PFL [Liberal Front  Party], and knocked down Congress President Senator Humberto  Lucena (PMDB-PB [Paraiba]) and the PMDB leader in the Senate,  Mauro Benavides (CE [Ceara]). The political space created by the  CPI's tarnishing of these leaders' image ended up opening room  for a group of young politicians who today head the political  negotiations.    Ideology, different origin, and different political  backgrounds are not obstacles to the new congressional foxes in  understanding each other. In the conservative field, the most  organized house is that of the PFL bloc in the Chamber of  Deputies headed by Deputy Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes (BA). Magalhaes  is serving his second term. He was elected to Congress with the  help of his father, Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, but he  shines because of his own merits. His most courageous move was  to accept Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS), another emerging star serving  his second term, as general coordinator of the constitutional  revision process.    "It was brilliant. Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes' decision  prevented  the articulation of a scheme by people opposing the revision,  and guaranteed the beginning of the process," said former  Minister Gustavo Krause (PFL-PE) in praising Magalhaes. Krause  is serving his first term in Congress.    Magalhaes' counterpart in the leftist field is Deputy Jose  Genoino (PT-SP [Workers Party-Sao Paulo]), the oldest public  servant (he is serving his third term) in the new generation of  foxes. In association with Paulo Delgado (PT-MG [Minas Gerais]),  Genoino paves the way for leftist proposals with a style  entirely different from that used by his party's dogmatic  executive board. Miro Teixeira (PDT-RJ [Democratic Labor  Party-Rio de Janeiro]) and Jose Serra (PSDB-SP [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party]) complete the group of the new cardinals  association -- or the "Sacred College," as former President Jose  Sarney defines it.    "It is only natural for new leaders to appear and face new  difficulties. The CPI affected Congress like the stripping of  political rights changed it at the beginning of the military  regime. The political space left empty by the latest changes  must be occupied and the process is not easy," said Civil  Household Chief Henrique Hargreaves, who has served in Congress  since 1961.    The process is more painful at the PMDB, which has the  largest congressional representation. Before the CPI, party bloc  leadership members were all supporters of former Governor  Orestes Quercia. Today, the three most visible PMDB deputies are  bloc leader Tarcisio Delgado (MG), CPI Vice President Odacir  Klein (RS), and Luis Carlos Santos, government leader in the  Chamber of Deputies. The three are opposed to Quercia and lead a  congressional bloc where the former governor still has great  influence.    "My single most important working tool is dialogue. I am not  the result of any agreement, and all I can do try to convince my  colleagues. That is my style," Tarcisio Delgado said. He is a  strange case among a group of legislators who were already  involved in politics (in Juiz de Fora) before 1964.    The young cardinals do not have a habit identifying them --  such as the "pears" [preceding word in French] liquor bottle  made famous by [late senior Deputy] Ulysses Guimaraes' group --  and prefer to talk about common objectives. Luiz Eduardo  Magalhaes, Genoino, Miro, and Klein were the main proponents of  an important decision made by CPI coordinator Roberto Magalhaes  (PFL-PE). They convinced the deputy -- who also feels  comfortable with the group -- to abstain from making a partial  report.    "Roberto Magalhaes had the greatness of taking a step back.  The partial report would have created such big pressure on the  CPI that the investigation would have had to be cut short,"  Genoino recalls.</p>

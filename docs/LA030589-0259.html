			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE IN COUNTY  </P> <P> It seems that we in Orange County still live in an age of bigotry, racism and  intolerance. I refer to the defacing of two newly placed freeway signs on the  Garden Grove and San Diego freeways. The signs announce "Little Saigon Next  Exit."  </P> <P> Over the past 2 weeks both of these signs have been defaced with spray-painted  remarks against the Vietnamese community. The first time it happened, around  Feb. 1, Caltrans quickly cleaned the signs. For this, they should be commended.  However, I noticed as I drove the freeway today that it has happened again.  </P> <P> The signs announce what has quickly become an important cultural and  geographical area to the Vietnamese community in Orange County. I am not  Vietnamese. I work with them and consider them my friends. It saddens me that  in a county that is quickly becoming a melting pot there are those who are  bigoted and racist enough to stoop to these levels -- spray-painting remarks  telling the Vietnamese to "Go Home."  </P> <P> The fact is there is an ever-increasing Vietnamese population in Orange County.  Because of the problems of their homeland, many could not return if they wanted  to. We can learn much from these people. I have and consider myself the better  for it.  </P> <P> If there are those in Orange County who do not wish to take part in this  melting pot of cultures and continue to deface signs and throw out racial  slurs, I invite you to check out the country of your heritage and take your own  advice: "Go Home."  </P> <P> MARK WEINMANN  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MICHIGAN U. TO GET BILL FOR VANDALISM  </P> <P> Mayor Jerry Jernigan said the University of Michigan can expect a bill for at  least $14,000 for police work and damage to public property during the  celebration of Michigan's 80-79 NCAA basketball tournament victory over Seton  Hall.  </P> <P> "We're going to send a real clear message that this kind of behavior just won't  be condoned in Ann Arbor any longer," Jernigan said Thursday.  </P> <P> The party, during which street signs were uprooted, awnings torn down and  windows broken, cost the city $7,500 in police overtime and damage to fire  equipment, City Administrator Del Borgsdorf said. Borgsdorf said damage to  street signs and traffic lights totaled $6,500, and damage to private property  totaled $78,000.  </P> <P> University President James Duderstadt said the celebration that followed  Michigan's championship victory was disgraceful and an embarrassment to the  university.  </P></p>

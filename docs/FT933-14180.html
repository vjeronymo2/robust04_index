			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Leslie Wise slips to Pounds 1.23m at six months Interim pre-tax profits of Leslie Wise, the textile company which supplies retail groups such as Burton and Etam, slipped from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 1.23m. Turnover for the six months to May 31 was virtually static at Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 22.8m). Margins were under pressure in the core garment business due to lower volumes and rising raw material costs. Directors pointed out that trading throughout the group had improved towards the end of the opening six months and that this trend had been maintained so far in the second half. Earnings emerged at 2.38p (2.96p) and the interim dividend is unchanged at 1.75p.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORTMAYER DISMISSED BY CHARGERS  </P> <P> The San Diego Chargers announced Monday that Steve Ortmayer, director of  football operations since January 1987, will not be offered a contract next  season.  </P> <P> "Steve and I met today," Charger Owner Alex Spanos said. "I want to thank him  for the effort he has made to make the Chargers a stronger team. Our meeting  was amicable, and we wish him well in future endeavors."  </P> <P> Ortmayer, 44, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> There has been speculation all season that Spanos was considering replacing  Ortmayer with Bobby Beathard, former general manager of the Washington  Redskins, who left Washington at the conclusion of the 1988 season. Beathard  owns a home in Leucadia, Calif.  </P> <P> Ortmayer, director of football operations for the Raiders from 1978 through  January of 1987, found both personal success and failure with the Chargers. In  1988, the Chargers' first pick was Anthony Miller, now one of the top receivers  in the AFC. Also drafted in '88 was tackle David Richards, who has started all  31 games since.  </P> <P> This season's draft included defensive end Burt Grossman, quarterback Billy Joe  Tolliver and running back Marion Butts, all significant contributors.  </P> <P> But if Ortmayer's draft picks were his strength, trades were his undoing. He  gambled in trading for Chip Banks in 1987. Banks is with Indianapolis. He sat  out all of last season and was arrested four times on drug charges.  </P> <P> Ortmayer was also responsible for trading All-Pro offensive lineman Jim Lachey  to the Raiders for Napoleon McCallum, cut before this season, and offensive  lineman John Clay, who likely will not play again because of a neck injury.  </P> <P> Charger Coach Dan Henning expressed regrets at Ortmayer's dismissal.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed that Steve won't be with us," Henning said.  </P> <P> "I saw him handle the draft as well as it can be handled, and I think we had an  outstanding draft. I've seen him put a great deal of time and effort into  getting things where they ought to be. And I see the progress. But wins and  losses are what the perception is always. That's what we have to do a better  job of."  </P></p>

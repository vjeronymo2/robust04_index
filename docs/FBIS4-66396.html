			<p>CSO     [Summary] A liver cancer vaccine that can induce the immune  system to produce antibodies to recognize liver cancer cells and  kill them, has been jointly developed and successfully tested in  white rats by the Eastern Institute of Liver and Gall Bladder  Surgery of the Shanghai Second Military University and the U.S.  Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). The scientists fused the  liver cancer cells and the activated B cells, both were obtained  from white rats, to produce new hybrid cells (vaccine). After  being injected back into the white rats, the hybrid cells  (vaccine) induce the rat's immune system (B-Cells) to produce  antibodies, which can automatically recognize the cancer cells  and kill them. Test results indicated that white rats receiving  injections of both newly-developed hybrid cells (vaccine) and  cancer cells at the same time have survived, those receiving  only cancer cells died within 60 days. The hybrid cells can  prevent cancerization of normal cells as well. It is the first  successful research worldwide to use immune cells (B cells) to  develop vaccine. The achievement has laid the foundation for  using vaccines to prevent and treat liver cancer.</p>

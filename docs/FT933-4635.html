			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Arts: The Seagull, a fluent display of fringe virtues - Theatre CHEKHOV must have had his tongue in his cheek when he described The Seagull as a comedy. No play that contains so much feeling and ends with a tragic off-stage suicide can quite fit that description. Yet one sees what he meant. The Seagull is full of ironies, has some comic characters like Sorin, the invalid brother of the actress Arkadina, and has some comic situations which should be played for all they are worth. Perhaps Arkadina in particular does not belong to the really tragic mould. But unless you have a peculiarly warped sense of humour, the younger characters - Konstantin, Nina and Masha  -surely do. The production at the Orange Tree in Richmond has many of the virtues we have come to expect from the pleasantest of London's fringe theatres. It uses the fluent translation by Michael Frayn which almost persuades one that the play was written in English in the first place. Frayn simply skips the habit of constantly repeating Russian names. Paul Shelley's direction has clearly been carefully thought out. The acting is impeccable down to the smallest part. No irony is missed. Watch the way Diane Fletcher's Arkadina recaptures her lover, Trigorin, when he says he wants to leave her for a younger woman. Trigorin is played by David Yelland: if you look at his face, it is immediately clear that she has only partly won him back and that he despises himself for going that far. And if you want to see a proud, tortured but unprotesting woman on stage, note Naomi Capron as Masha. There is no fuss, just a controlled suppression of emotions when she cannot have the man that she wants. This is an even harder part to play than Arkadina who, as an actress, has the perfect excuse for letting herself go whenever she wants. Ms Capron makes Masha the most interesting character in the play, for all the others are either superficial or parodies. Her performance is superb. Cathryn Bradshaw's Nina looks melodramatic beside her. For the rest, the production is not quite satisfactory. There are times when it is impossible to see all the characters. They seem to stand in diagonal lines. As it happened, I had a splendid view of Trigorin being repossessed by Arkadina; others may not have done. Chekhov's description of the piece as a comedy may have been unduly overlooked: occasionally it could be played faster and the pregnant pauses cut short. One of the reasons why we have come to expect such high standards at the Orange Tree is the artistic direction of Sam Walters. He has worked by developing a permanent company which understands the Richmond stage. Walters is now on sabbatical and The Seagull is performed by a more ad hoc group. The occasional lapse in the direction makes the case for a resident company, playing together all the time, look stronger than ever. Orange Tree, Richmond (081) 940 3633</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NOAH ENDS LONG TITLE DROUGHT BY DEFEATING STEEB IN 3 SETS  </P> <P> Yannick Noah of France defeated Carl-Uwe Steeb of West Germany, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4,  to win the men's championship in the $400,000 New South Wales Open Sunday at  Sydney.  </P> <P> It was Noah's first victory in nearly two years and came only three months  after he considered retirement.  </P> <P> The match took two hours.  </P> <P> "It could have gone either way," said Noah, who was seeded eighth. He rallied  from 3-4 to win the last three games and cap a tournament in which he beat Ivan  Lendl, the world's top-ranked player, in the quarterfinals, and defending  champion Aaron Krickstein in the semifinals.  </P> <P> Noah, 29, praised his new coach, Dennis Ralston, a former U.S. Davis Cup  captain, for "getting the fire back" in his play.  </P> <P> The victory was Noah's first since upsetting Jimmy Connors at Milan, Italy, in  February, 1988. He earned $21,600. Steeb, seeded seventh, got $12,720.  </P> <P> "I feel great," Noah said. "It's been a long time since I won a tournament and  now I just want to enjoy it.  </P> <P> "Last year was the first that I didn't win anything. This proves all the work I  have been doing has been worth it."  </P> <P> Earlier, the Soviet Union's Natalia Zvereva, seeded 11th, rallied to beat  Austrian Barbara Paulus, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, in the one-hour 45-minute women's  final.  </P> <P> It was Zvereva's second tournament victory. Last week, she won the Queensland  Open at Brisbane.  </P> <P> Scott Davis upset top-seeded Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union, 4-6, 6-3,  6-3, to win the $175,000 New Zealand Open at Auckland.  </P></p>

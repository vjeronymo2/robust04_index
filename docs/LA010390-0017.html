			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 WOUNDED, 200 FLEE AS GUNFIGHT ERUPTS AT BAR  </P> <P> At least three patrons were wounded and another 200 fled in terror early  Tuesday morning when a gun battle erupted during a pay-to-attend party at a  crowded bar in Culver City.  </P> <P> "There was a tremendous amount of gunfire -- more than 50 rounds," said Sgt.  Dan Irvin of the Culver City Police Department.  </P> <P> "As the officers rolled up, the people came pouring out the door . . . with  shots still being fired.  </P> <P> "There were people running in all directions and cars driving in all  directions," he said. "It looked like a mass migration."  </P> <P> Irvin said no arrests had been made and no weapons had been recovered, and  detectives had not determined what led to the gunfight.  </P> <P> One woman suffered a chest wound and was in critical condition at Brotman  Medical Center in Culver City, Irvin said. A man was treated at Los Angeles  County-USC Medical Center for a minor hand wound and a woman was treated at  Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood for a minor elbow wound.  </P> <P> The identities of the victims were withheld pending notification of relatives.  </P> <P> Irvin said more than 200 guests had responded to posted flyers and paid an  entrance fee to attend the party at the Cover Girl Lounge at 9300 Jefferson  Boulevard.  </P> <P> "The only thing we know is that there was some sort of an altercation," the  police sergeant said. "We know that there was more than one handgun and more  than one gunman."  </P> <P> Irvin said a man working across the street heard the shots and called police at  2:40 a.m. A nearby patrol unit arrived moments later, police said, but the  patrons fled so quickly that officers were able to interview only about 25 of  them.  </P> <P> The gunmen apparently escaped with the fleeing patrons.  </P></p>

NODONG SINMUN in a commentary brands the traitor Kim  Chong-pil's malicious slander against the DPRK over the "nuclear  issue" as an open challenge to the DPRK's sincere efforts for  reconciliation, unity and dialogue and an unpardonable criminal  act of trampling upon the desire of the fellow countrymen for  reunification.    The analyst points out:    The South Korean puppets are the criminals who have created  nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula by shipping nuclear  weapons into South Korea and have stepped up their own nuclear  armament. So they are not in a position to talk about the  "nuclear issue" of the DPRK.    It is the height of impudence for the puppets to meddle in  the problem that should be solved through negotiations between  the DPRK and the United States and say this or that in this  regard.    That day the traitor Kim cried over "armed provocation" by  the North and raved that it should be checked. His outburst is  a shameless act that reminds people of a thief crying "Stop  Thief!"    By calling for "close cooperation with friendly countries,"  he meant, in essence, to slay fellow countrymen with the sword  of outside forces.    It cannot be forgiven and overlooked that he cried the South  "should not make haste with unification" and that it should  "make full preparations for reunification by prevailing over the  North". He revealed in this a heinous intention to keep the  division for an indefinite period, dawdling away time and  achieve "reunification by prevailing over communism" through a  war, not a peaceful reunification.    The traitor Kim Chong-pil's outcries for "predominance over  the North," revealing the scheme to delay reunification and his  reiteration of the doctrine "unification by prevailing over  communism" that is not possible any time are all unpardonable  anti-national criminal acts, says the commentary.    MINJU CHOSON in a signed commentary says if the "Democratic  Liberal Party" continues to bar national reunification with the  outcries for "unification by prevailing over the North" and  "unification by prevailing over communism" that are impossible,  they will face a stern judgment by the people.</p>

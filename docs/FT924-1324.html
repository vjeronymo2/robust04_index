			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Gestetner improves 21% to Pounds 27m GESTETNER Holdings, the international office equipment distributor which has recently been the subject of bid speculation, yesterday reported a 21 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits to Pounds 27.2m. Turnover for the 12 months to October 31 was flat at Pounds 900.3m (Pounds 898.3m). A maintained final dividend of 6.4p makes an unchanged 8.2p total. Basic earnings increased to 22.2p (16.4p); fully diluted the figure was 12.1p (11.6p). Mr Basil Sellers, chairman, would not comment on the bid rumours which have helped underpin a rise in Gestetner's share price in recent months. Yesterday the stock closed up 2p at 152p. Last year he persuaded Ricoh, the Japanese office equipment manufacturer, to pay 250p per share for a 24.2 per cent stake in the group. Commenting on the results Mr Sellers said that trading conditions in Gestetner's European markets had continued to be difficult. However, sales in its international and North American regions were 'pleasing.' Second-half earnings were more than double those in the first half 'reflecting a continual improvement in the trading performance of the group.' The group's core office automation products business reported a marginal increase in sales to Pounds 733.9m (Pounds 725m) and trading profits of Pounds 41.3m (Pounds 34.1m). Gross margins continued to slip reflecting reduced sales of older high margin products and the group's policy of reducing product prices to maintain market share. However, cost cutting in 1991 resulted in significantly lower operating expenses. Copiers now account for 62 per cent of office equipment sales although digital duplicator sales are also rising. The group's photographic products business suffered the effects of the recession with sales, adjusted for currency translation effects, falling 6 per cent to Pounds 166.4m and trading profit dropping to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 8.9m). The camera business, which is being sold, had sales of Pounds 81.4m and trading profits of Pounds 1.1m. Mr Sellers said the sale of this business, announced in September, should be completed next month. The photographic supplies business, which is being retained, had sales of Pounds 85m and posted trading profits of Pounds 3.6m. The effective devaluation of sterling in September had little impact on shareholders' funds, which rose to Pounds 262m (Pounds 250.2m) although gross assets and gross liabilities increased significantly. Net debt, including Pounds 37.9m of convertible unsecured loan stock, increased from Pounds 64.4m to Pounds 94.7m. The Pounds 30.3m increase mainly reflected a translation adjustment of Pounds 29.4m on net foreign debt. COMMENT Gestetner's results were somewhat better than expected although there are still a few black spots like Canada. Revenues from service contracts and supplies have provided some protection from the recession, as has the opening up of new markets in Latin America and Asia. With almost 95 per cent of its sales outside the UK the group is especially vulnerable to currency fluctuations. If rates stabilise around current levels the profit and loss account should be a big beneficiary this year, even without an economic upturn in Europe. Currency translation accounts for all of the 12 percentage point increase in gearing to 36 per cent at year end. Results for this year are difficult to predict, but Pounds 35m pre-tax and fully diluted earnings of 15p are at the top end of expectations. At those levels the stock is trading on low prospective p/e of 9.8, but if no real bidder emerges the stock may not go much higher.</p>

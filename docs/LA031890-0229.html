			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RULING REVIVES RANCH DEVELOPMENT ISSUE;  </P> <P> CITY ELECTION: A VICTORY AT THE POLLS BY PROJECT OPPONENTS MIGHT ENDANGER THE  PROPOSED 329-HOME HELLMAN PLAN IN SEAL BEACH.  </P> <P> A court ruling may make the proposed Hellman Ranch housing development the No.  1 issue in the March 27 election to fill two City Council seats.  </P> <P> On Friday a Superior Court commissioner, ruling that the city's housing plan  was outdated, sent the controversial proposal back to the City Council for  rehearing and a new vote.  </P> <P> The council approved the hotly contested plan last October. It remained  uncertain whether a second vote can be taken before two new council members  take office. Incumbents Victor Grgas and Joyce Risner, who voted for the  proposal, are not seeking reelection.  </P> <P> An election victory by development foes could threaten the proposed 329-home  development, which critics charge would harm the environment and quality of  life in the beach community.  </P> <P> Half of the eight candidates vying for the two council seats said they are  dissatisfied with the development plan, and another, a project supporter, said  Saturday that if elected he would take another look at it.  </P> <P> Current council members who backed the Mola Development Corp. proposal insisted  Saturday that they intend to approve the project again. They said they were  certain that the matter will come to the council before the end of their terms  May 15.  </P> <P> The long-running Hellman Ranch issue appeared settled before Friday, but Orange  County Superior Court Commissioner Ronald L. Bauer invalidated the development  plan, saying permits were issued using a section of the city's general plan  that had not been undated as required by law.  </P> <P> "When it comes back to the council, it's going to be a whole new show," said  candidate Joe Rullo, who believes that the Hellman plan will be amended before  being resubmitted.  </P> <P> Rullo, a supporter of the development, is one of five candidates running for  the District 1 seat held by Grgas. He has served two terms, the maximum allowed  by the city's charter.  </P> <P> Three candidates are vying for the District 3 seat held by Risner, another  two-term lame duck.  </P> <P> Both Grgas and Risner were part of the 4-1 majority that approved the project.  The two open council seats make possible a shift to a 3-2 majority against the  development.  </P> <P> "The plan now is to win enough council seats so that when the Mola proposal  comes back through town, we can take a fresh look at it," said Galen Ambrose, a  candidate in District 1 and the co-founder of the Wetlands Restoration Society,  the Seal Beach-based environmental group that won its suit in court Friday.  </P> <P> Growth has traditionally been a hot issue in Seal Beach, where some residents  make the maintenance of a village atmosphere a high priority. The city was the  site of a bitter 1988 campaign over a strict slow-growth measure that  ultimately lost at the polls.  </P> <P> Critics of the development plan insist that it does not properly address  environmental concerns and that it will increase traffic, pollution and even  crime in the town of 26,000 people.  </P> <P> Ambrose -- and to a lesser degree, other candidates in the race -- have  centered their campaigns around the issue of growth and the detrimental effects  that they see it having on Seal Beach.  </P> <P> "Seal Beach is in a crisis and needs strong leadership as massive developments  go through that will change our city," said Ambrose during a recent candidates'  forum. "Is the city of Seal Beach going to sell itself like a whore to the  first person who comes in with a checkbook?"  </P> <P> Supporters of the Mola development say the plan adopted by the council is far  better than the original proposal. The original plan for 773 dwelling units was  reduced to a plan for 329; and 41.4 acres -- roughly a third of the site -- are  set aside for wetlands restoration.  </P> <P> But at an election forum last week, the most common reason candidates gave for  supporting the Mola plan was that it was "a done deal."  </P> <P> "There will be some kind of a development there. People have property rights,"  said Grgas, who is backing Rullo in the campaign.  </P> <P> "If the (new council) votes 3-2 to close it off . . . the taxpayers are being  exposed to a great risk of liability."  </P> <P> But Dennis Pollman, a District 1 candidate who supported the Mola plan, said  Saturday that if elected, he would reopen discussion of development to gain  more public input.  </P> <P> "The only question left is how the public feels," Pollman said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by S. Ginzburg, chief of the Information Studies </F> Department at the Oblast Administration, under the "Apropos One  Appeal" rubric: "There Is No Need To Spread Panic"]    [Text] Recently, certain political forces have made  attempts to discredit the idea of the imperative adoption of the  law "On the Status of Kaliningrad Oblast." At the same time, it  turns out that this move will be responsible for our political  distancing from Russia, will promote Germanization of the  oblast, and so on. The emergence of such statements on the eve  of debates on this draft law in the Federal Assembly is  worrisome. Therefore, I consider it necessary to focus on the  following:    1. The draft law "On the Status of Kaliningrad Oblast" was  prepared by the Oblast Administration in cooperation with the  Oblast Soviet of People's Deputies and promulgated for public  consideration in the 6 August 1993 issue of KALININGRADSKAYA  PRAVDA. Later, the draft law was brought in line with the  Constitution of the Russian Federation adopted on 12 December  1993, the current law of the Russian Federation, No. 2117 decree  of the Russian president of 7 December 1993 "On Kaliningrad  Oblast," and proposals of ministries and departments concerning  its first reading.    2. If it is adopted, the law will establish the status of  our oblast as a territory of the Russian Federation separated by  other territories from its proper area. The term status in this  case implies the legal situation of Kaliningrad Oblast within  Russia, defined by specific conditions for economic activities.  Moreover, the status will conform with the oblast's  geopolitical, social, and economic position, and will provide  for additional guarantees in protecting the rights of Russian  citizens on its territory.    3. All talk about the oblast's distancing from Russia are  unfounded. Those who claim this, have either not read the draft  law or are deliberately misleading Kaliningrad inhabitants. For  example, the first article entitled "Kaliningrad Oblast Within  the Russian Federation" clearly states that our oblast is an  inseparable part of Russia, that its frontiers coincide with the  state border of the Russian Federation, and that its territory  has a particular place in ensuring Russia's security system.    Furthermore, the last version of the draft law notes that it  bans the activities of any political parties, organizations, and  individuals in Kaliningrad Oblast, which run counter to  international legal norms that establish Russia's authority over  this territory as final.    4. Speculation about the law facilitating the purchase of  land by foreigners, which would allegedly promote Germanization  of the oblast, are groundless. In fact, Article 36 of the  Constitution of the Russian Federation reads that land in Russia  (that is, also in Kaliningrad Oblast) can be owned only by  citizens of the Russian Federation and not by any foreign  residents. In other words, this is a citizen's rather than a  human right.    The draft law on the status of Kaliningrad Oblast reflects  all the key peculiarities of our unique region. The sooner this  law is adopted, the sooner the oblast will gain political and  economic guarantees. I think that in such a situation some  esteemed deputies should direct their efforts to the consistent  protection of the interests of our oblast rather than to  spreading panic.</p>

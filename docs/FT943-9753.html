			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Charge of Dollars 485m puts Sara Lee into the red Sara Lee, the international food and personal products company, suffered a net fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 309m, or 65 cents a share. This was after a previously-announced Dollars 495m restructuring charge to trim costs in its hosiery division. In last year's fourth quarter the company earned Dollars 109m, or 38 cents a share. Sales for the quarter rose 5.6 per cent, to Dollars 4.1bn, from Dollars 3.9bn in same period last year. In spite of the higher sales, the company said that even without the restructuring charges, its fourth-quarter results would have been flat compared with last year. For the year, excluding all extraordinary items, the group reported income of Dollars 729m, or Dollars 1.47 a share, on sales of Dollars 15.5bn. This compared with Dollars 704m, or Dollars 1.37, on sales of Dollars 14.6bn in fiscal 1993. Commenting on the results, Mr John Bryan, Sara Lee's chairman, said profit growth suffered from weak results in the company's personal products division, particularly in hosiery and knit operations in Europe. However, the company's other three lines of business, notably packaged meats and bakery items, and household and personal care products enjoyed profit growth. Mr Bryan said growth in those businesses, combined with the extensive cost-cutting announced for the troubled hosiery operations, should boost earnings in 1995. Although Sara Lee historically is viewed as a rapid-growth company, Wall Street took the flat results in its stride, with the shares closing Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 20 7/8 in New York yesterday.</p>

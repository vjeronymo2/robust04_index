			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MILLIONS LINE UP FOR A SHOT AT $40 MILLION  </P> <P> He may have been standing in a 15-minute line to buy $4 worth of lottery  tickets on a lark Friday, but Harry Anderson denied he was buying into  "Lottomania." He said he knows his chances of winning the $40-million jackpot  are one in 14 million.  </P> <P> "My parents and grandparents would be spinning in their graves if they knew the  government was taking the poor people's money like this," said Anderson, a  computer programmer from South Pasadena, while waiting his turn at the Olympic  gift shop in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo.  </P> <P> But Anderson and millions of other Lotto players up and down the state queued  in pharmacies, liquor stores, markets, restaurants and convenience stores in  pursuit of the third-largest payoff since the California Lottery began.  </P> <P> Harvey Rexsteiner, owner of an Anaheim convenience store, said the Lotto rush  started early Friday as morning commuters stopped in for coffee.  </P> <P> "From 6 to 8 in the morning we sold a lot more Lotto (tickets) and Quick Pick  because of the fact that the pot is large," Rexsteiner said. "We've had no  lines, but there's been a lot of activity all day."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Difference in Strategies  </P> <P> David Mejia, a convenience market clerk in Costa Mesa, said he has noticed a  difference in the buying strategies of his Lotto customers.  </P> <P> "We haven't had as many people as we expected, but those who have come in buy  $20 or $30 worth of tickets, much more than they normally buy," Mejia said.  </P> <P> Although both Mejia and Rexsteiner say they like playing Lotto, only Rexsteiner  had already purchased a "winning ticket."  </P> <P> "I've got this one wrapped up already," he said.  </P> <P> Lucille Jackson, who lives on disability payments, bought two lottery tickets  at the Palace International Cafeteria on San Francisco's Market Street, where  the line of hopeful customers stretched out into the street.  </P> <P> "With this $2 I could have bought another blouse at Goodwill," she said. "But .  . . they say once in your life you are supposed to experiences riches. I  haven't yet."  </P> <P> The stakes began to swell this week as Wednesday's $22-million jackpot went  unclaimed, marking the third game in a row without a winner. The prize money  was rolled over into today's game, which is expected to provide $40 million for  the person or persons, if any, able to pick all six winning numbers.  </P> <P> California Lottery spokeswoman Joanne McNabb said the prize, although far less  than October's world record of $61.98 million, would be the eighth-largest  lottery jackpot ever awarded in the United States. Four of the top 10 jackpots  nationwide have been won in California, she added.  </P> <P> Ticket sales Thursday reached $3.9 million, far more than the $1.5 average  revenue for that day of the week, McNabb said. Lotto playing hours were  extended for an extra hour Friday, to 11 p.m, but officials said they expected  the longest lines to materialize at 6 p.m. today, one hour and 45 minutes  before closing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $40 a Month  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at the Columbus Pharmacy in Los Angeles' Chinatown, Dave Osborn, a  plumber from Newport Beach, said he has been shelling out $5 a week for tickets  since the lottery's inception. He has won only once -- collecting $5.  </P> <P> Perhaps he could have spent the money on a vacation, he mused. Yet he said he  has no regrets. "I figure I could blow $5 on something a lot worse than a  chance to win $40 million," he said.  </P> <P> Times staff writers David Reyes in Orange County and Amy Stevens in San  Francisco contributed to this story.  </P></p>

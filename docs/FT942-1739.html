			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Spain faces recession aftershocks: First-quarter growth figures confirm central bank's optimism over recovery Spain's recession is now over but its consequences will be felt for a considerable time, the Bank of Spain said in its annual report published yesterday. Its optimism about the turnaround was confirmed by figures from the National Statistics Institute showing economic growth of 0.8 per cent in the first quarter against the same period last year. This was the first positive growth in year-on-year figures for Spanish GDP since the third quarter of 1992, and exceeded the central bank's earlier estimate of 0.5 per cent. The figure compared with a 0.2 per cent decline in the last quarter of 1993 and a 1 per cent reduction for last year as a whole. It reflected a 19.1 per cent growth in exports in the quarter. Imports also rose by 4.5 per cent, the first increase since 1992. Internal demand continued to fall but at a reduced rate of 2.1 per cent compared with 3.3 per cent in the previous period. The fall in gross fixed capital formation, meanwhile, slowed to 5.8 per cent from 8.9 per cent. The Bank of Spain report said recovery had begun to affect internal demand, which could soon show 'moderately positive' growth. However, Spain faced 'enormous difficulty' absorbing its high level of unemployment, now running at almost 25 per cent, and the effect that this would in turn have on the country's economic growth potential. Prospects for sustained growth and economic convergence with the richer countries of the European Union were conditional on 'more balanced macro-economic policies' and on greater success in reducing inflation and tackling the high public sector deficit, the bank said. The inflation differential between Spain and the three best-performing EU members remained at about three percentage points. Mr Luis Angel Rojo, Bank of Spain governor, said there was little room for further reductions in short-term interest rates, after a succession of cuts earlier this year. He said there would be 'great cautiousness' about interest rate levels in Europe generally, and there would only be room for further cuts in Spain if they reduced inflation and the public deficit. 'Any relaxation of monetary policy not justified by these factors would only help to increase the risk of an unbalanced recovery,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chengdu, April 2 (XINHUA) -- China's Sichuan  Province and its 17 cities and prefectures have formed sister  city relations with 32 states or cities in foreign countries  since 1981.    Local officials said that the relations have promoted the  province's opening to the outside world.    Last year, Sichuan Province received 85 delegations with  1,200 people from its sister cities and sent 45 visiting groups  to the cities abroad.    Sichuan and its sister cities jointly held 11 trade fairs or  cultural exhibitions and concluded 65 economic and trade  projects with cooperation funds of 70 million U.S. dollars.    Last September, North Rhine-Westphalia State of Germany sent  a business group with more than 40 entrepreneurs to visit  Sichuan Province and investigate its investment environment.    The group made inspections in the sectors of environmental  protection, energy, mining, machinery and metallurgical and  light industries.    Since Sichuan and North Rhine-Westphalia formed friendly  relations, more than 60 students have gone to study in the  state, majoring in agriculture, industry, environmental  protection, tourism and finance.    Of the groups from Sichuan's sister cities and states in  foreign countries, the group from Hiroshima, Japan, was the  largest.    In 1992, the Diet of Hiroshima started a "Green Program" to  support Sichuan's afforestation. By the end of 1993, donations  from the program amounted to more than 100 million yen (about  7.5 million yuan).    Chongqing City in the province resumed its sister-city  relations with Toronto in Canada, and now the two cities have  signed nine agreements involving urban construction,  communications and transportation, entertainment facilities,  light industry and education.    Chengdu City, capital of Sichuan Province, has sent 258  students to study at her sister city in Japan and now 120 have  returned to Chengdu to make remarkable contributions.</p>

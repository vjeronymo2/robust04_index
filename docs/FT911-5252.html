			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: Days of Hope - Hampstead Theatre Although I doubt whether Howard Goodall's new musical will make it to the top, it is worth going to see if only to ponder on that narrow line between success and near miss. It is not that the subject matter is wrong, though it is slightly peculiar and nowadays in danger of seeming out-dated. Days of Hope revolves round a young Englishman who goes to Spain to fight for the anti-Franco forces during the Spanish civil war, and takes his bride and part of her family back to his home town of Scarborough when Franco is victorious. Apart from a brief prologue, all the action takes place in Spain. The significance of Scarborough is that it used to be a regular base for the Labour Party conference. I rather liked the juxtaposition. It is not, on the face of it, a more unpromising subject for a musical than, say, post-Peron Argentina. The difficulties lie elsewhere. A good musical is unmistakeably a musical, not just a play with songs. Days of Hope falls between stools. Half of it is a rather straight play, wandering between the melodramatic and the corny, written by Renata Allen. The other half includes some very good numbers, but the dialogue seldom leads naturally into the singing. Part of the fault in the Hampstead production may stem from the direction by John Retallack of the Oxford Stage Company. The Hampstead Theatre has a small stage, but not so small as to dictate that practically every time a musical number begins the participants have to get into a horizontal line. Retallack could learn something about deployment of resources by looking at the versatility of some of the productions at the Gate Theatre in Notting Hill, which has an even smaller stage. Having his characters stand in line only emphasises the somewhat stilted nature of the piece. The small size of the place detracts in another way. The orchestra consists only of a piano and two guitars, shoved off at the side. It is interesting to reflect how a try-out production of Evita would have looked in such circumstances. For the most striking point about Days of Hope is that some of the music and lyrics, both written by Goodall, are pretty good. It is not inconceivable that, given better staging and a fuller instrumental back-up, they would rank alongside those of established successes. Take Viva la Muerte, for example, which is a powerful revolutionary song. So are some of the others, including the one which gives its title to the musical. They have catchy tunes and not bad lyrics. As we know from the rain on the plain, there are plenty of words to rhyme with Spain. Somewhere there is a better musical lurking to get out than the one in the Hampstead production. Even with its imperfections, I could think of worse ways to spend an evening in the theatre.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Laing gets NatWest Tower contract John Laing, the UK construction group, has won the main contract to refurbish London's NatWest Tower after it was severely damaged in a terrorist bomb attack in April 1993. The contract for work on Britain's second-tallest building is thought to be worth about Pounds 80m. The 42-storey property, which dominates the skyline of the City of London, previously housed the headquarters of National Westminster's high street banking oper-ations. Mr David Edmonds, NatWest's property and central services general manager, said yesterday that a decision on how the building is to be reoccupied will not be taken until closer to the completion of the refurbishment in December 1996. About two thirds of the windows in the tower were blown out in the explosion, which also severely damaged parts of the interior, bringing down ceilings and wall partitions. The bank intends to reclad the exterior of the building - which was opened in 1981 - in its original style. It will, however, redesign the interior. The design of the building dates back to the early 1960s and many of the fittings had become dated. Schmidlin UK has been awarded the cladding sub-contract. Crown House Engineering has been awarded mechanical and electrical and public health sub-contracts. Architects are GMW Partnership, assisted by Richard Seifert and Partners, the original architects of the tower. After the explosion the bank's staff were re-housed in other buildings - mostly at its neighbouring Drapers Gardens offices in the City.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Trade News: US criticism baffles backers of patent rights draft - Intellectual property negotiators say it is as good a deal as they will ever get / GATT CRITICISM levelled at the Uruguay Round draft accord on intellectual property by the US pharmaceutical and film industries has left negotiators in Geneva baffled. The general view is that the US has got as good a deal as it could have hoped for, far better than it imagined possible when the trade talks were launched in 1986. Then, many developing countries were opposed even to discussing intellectual property protection under Gatt auspices. Over the ensuing five years' talks, their attitude has changed. The result: a 34-page draft covering all forms of intellectual property that would strengthen and harmonise protection standards and allow effective national and international enforcement. Its main features include: Protection of patents for 20 years, regardless of place of invention or whether products are imported or produced locally. Main permitted exclusions would relate to animal and plant inventions and biotechnological processes for their production; thus Gatt would not require 'patents on life'. There would be strict limits on compulsory licensing of patented products by governments, now commonly used for pharmaceuticals in rich and poor countries. Copyright would be protected at least 50 years, to include computer programs and data compilations; authors of computer programs and films would, broadly speaking, have exclusive rental rights, as would performers and producers of sound recordings and broadcasts. Trademarks would be protected at least seven years, and geographical indications, important for European wine producers, would also gain protection. Semiconductor layout designs would be protected for 10 years. For the first time, trade secrets would be protected from unauthorised disclosure. All these rules would have to be implemented in national legislation by Gatt's 102 members, observing the basic fair trade precepts of national treatment (equal treatment for domestic and foreign right-holders) and non-discrimination between trading partners. A council on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (Trips) would supervise operation of the accord, sitting alongside Gatt and the envisaged General Agreement on Trade in Services under the proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO). This represents a big concession by developing countries. The Trips council would be separate from Gatt, but intellectual property disputes would be subject to the MTO's integrated disputes settlement machinery. In principle, countries could be subject to 'cross-sanctions', reprisals on goods trade for breaches of the intellectual property accord - which third world nations had opposed. On the other hand, the accord would require all signatories to abide by the MTO's disputes procedures, which would curb recourse by the US to 'Special 301' provisions to win concessions. Threats of unilateral action under 'Special 301' have scored successes, most recently in making China toughen intellectual property protection. The deal signed by China last week mirrors the international accord in most respects, but goes further in two areas where US industry now claims the Uruguay Round draft is deficient. First, China (which would not be a party to the Trips accord because not a Gatt member) has agreed to bring in the new rules this year. The poorest countries, such as Burundi and Bangladesh, have an extra 10 years or more to implement the accord; most developing countries, such as India and Thailand, have five, and industrialised nations one. For areas where no patent protection exists, such as pharmaceuticals, developing countries have 10 years to put legislation into effect. But for pharmaceuticals and agri-chemicals, the accord would require developing nations to allow the filing of patents from the time the accord comes into force (probably 1993) and to treat them 10 years hence as if the legislation had been in effect from the start. Since drugs may require at least 10 years' safety testing, those invented now would be protected at the point at which they came on the market. If they reached the market earlier, the patent-holder would be given interim exclusive marketing rights. Not satisfied with this, the US pharmaceuticals industry wants protection for drugs already invented but not yet on the market, the second deficiency it sees in the draft. China last week agreed to give 'pipeline' protection back to 1986, but Washington found no backing in Geneva for a similar multilateral deal. 'We've asked developing countries to accept a 10-year transition for liberalisation in textiles. It's simply not realistic to ask them to accept retro-active protection on patents,' one European negotiator said. Another sore point for the US involves a bilateral dispute with the EC on allocation to artists and performers of proceeds from a levy on blank audio and video tapes. It says this system, now in operation in France and Germany, in effect discriminates against the US film and record industry. Most other countries believe US industry is deluded if it thinks it can get a better overall deal through unilateral action than the draft multilateral accord. India has rebuffed US threats in the past. Washington has not so far sought to re-open the talks, but trading partners fear it could want to if the EC presses demands for changes to the Uruguay Round text on farm subsidy cuts. Then India will almost certainly resist on the textiles accord, and the unravelling of the Uruguay Round package could begin.</p>

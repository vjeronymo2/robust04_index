			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RUN-AND-SHOOT FINDS A PLACE IN THE NFL  </P> <P> Mouse Davis, the short but potent guardian of the run-and-shoot offense, turned  on his small-screen television Monday night to watch big-time critics rip his  lifelong beliefs.  </P> <P> On the screen, retired quarterback Ron Jaworski and former New York Giants  coach Allie Sherman trashed Davis' run-and-shoot offense, saying that it had no  place in the NFL. Davis, currently the quarterbacks and receivers coach with  the Detroit Lions, rolled his eyes. He's heard the same complaints too many  times since installing the run-and-shoot into the Portland State offense in  1974.  </P> <P> "They were saying that the quarterback gets hit too much," Davis said. "They  were making such a big deal about it. So I watch Houston play the Buffalo  Bills. Every time the Bills blitzed, Warren Moon completed a quick pass and  didn't get touched. Every time the Oilers blitzed, Jim Kelly went down. I  wondered what they'll dig up next."  </P> <P> Houston's 27-24 victory over the Bills Monday night marked another graduation  of the unconventional offense the NFL refuses to accept. Moon passed for 300  yards, his eighth 300-yard game of the season. Halfback Lorenzo White rushed  for 125 yards.  </P> <P> From high school to the Canadian Football League to upstart pro leagues to NFL  prime time, the run-and-shoot refuses to die. Davis feels like Dr. Frankenstein  telling the scientists that his monster is alive. It is alive, but the  scientists demand more proof.  </P> <P> "They won't want to look at the facts," Davis said. "They just want to bitch  about something."  </P> <P> Sunday at 1 p.m. in the Kingdome and on Dec. 30 when the Lions pay a visit, the  Seahawks will watch more of the run-and-shoot than they would care to see. To  them, the run-and-shoot is scary. They believed in the concept enough to  install it in their playbook. Now, their task is to try to stop it.  </P> <P> "Nobody's stopped the Oilers yet," Seahawks defensive coordinator Tom Catlin  said. "I guess our goal is to make them punt one time and not let them get into  the end zone. Against the Bills, they didn't even have to punt."  </P> <P> Oilers coach Jack Pardee doesn't sugarcoat the run-and-shoot. He doesn't call  it the spread or the stretch or the red gun. To Pardee, it's the run-and-shoot.  It's worked for him in the United States Football League, at the University of  Houston and now with the Oilers.  </P> <P> "I've been doing this for eight or nine years," Pardee said. "There's a lot of  criticism going around. It's a good system. As a coach, you find players with  enough ability to win with it. As a coach I wanted to move the football, but  I've never been in the situation where I thought we could line up and dominate  a team."  </P> <P> So when he coached the USFL's Houston Gamblers, he hired Davis to teach his  team the run-and-shoot. For Davis, it gave him the forum to show pro fans that  the four-receiver, wide-open format worked on levels higher than high school or  college or the CFL.  </P> <P> In the past 20 years, Davis has heard all the complaints and the myths. The  so-called geniuses first said the concept wasn't sound. Later, they doubted it  would work. Eventually, a few saw things in the offense that were appealing.  Now, the majority fear it.  </P> <P> With Moon directing the Oilers' run-and-shoot, the NFL record book will look as  though it has been riddled by a machine gun. By season's end, Moon should break  all of Dan Marino's season records for completions, attempts and yardage and  throw for more 300-yard games than anyone ever imagined.  </P> <P> His four receivers -- dubbed the Fab Four -- already rank among the top nine in  the AFC and should collect more than 300 passes as a quartet, another NFL  record. More importantly to Davis and Pardee, the concept is winning games and  supporters within the NFL establishment.  </P> <P> Each week, the run-and-shoot breaks records and myths.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of people who don't want it to work," said Oilers offensive  coordinator Kevin Gilbride, who's also grown tired of the criticisms. "They  keep saying the system doesn't work."  </P> <P> Folks, it works, and the Oilers are embarrassing defenses and dispelling those  myths.  </P> <P> Each Sunday, Moon steps to the line of scrimmage feeling like a young lad in a  candy store carrying a blank check.  </P> <P> "Teams have played so many looks against us, it actually takes a little while  before you see everything a team wants to do against you," Moon said. It takes  you a couple series going into each game to see exactly want kind of package a  team wants to play against you. You pretty much have to adjust on the run."  </P> <P> As Moon adjust his sights, the NFL adjusts its stereotypical criticisms.  </P> <P> Myth 1: The run-and-shoot won't work in NFL.  </P> <P> Pro Football Weekly rates the efficiency of NFL offenses. The Oilers are first.  The Lions are second.  </P> <P> Look at the Oilers' numbers as an example. They are averaging 379.5 yards and  23.2 points a game. They've converted 52.5 percent of their third downs. Each  offensive play averages a 6.1 yards. That's 1.3 yards per play better than the  Seahawks. The Oilers are also averaging four plays a game more than the  Seahawks.  </P> <P> Myth 2: Because run-and-shoot teams have no tight ends on their rosters, the  offenses stall once they cross opponents' 20-yard lines.  </P> <P> The Lions, despite having inferior quarterbacks and receivers, are converting  64 percent of their opportunities inside the 20 into touchdowns, one of the  best ratios in the NFL. That deflates the argument used against the Oilers, who  have converted only 47.5 percent of their scoring chances into touchdowns.  </P> <P> "We've had chances to score, but we've had dropped passes and fumbles,"  Gilbride said. "It's not a matter of the scheme being the problem. It's  execution. The No.1 problem has been the drops. We had two touchdowns dropped  in a game against the Rams."  </P> <P> The Oilers dropped 15 passes in an early-season game against the Pittsburgh  Steelers. At the time, the Oilers were still learning new routes and Moon was  adjusting to new reads.  </P> <P> "I don't see any defense stopping us," wide receiver Ernest Givins said. "At  first, we were wondering if we were in the right area, and wondering if we were  using the right techniques. Now we are starting to get great continuity and we  are not seeing that many drops."  </P> <P> Myth 3: There is no run in the run-and-shoot.  </P> <P> Lions halfback Barry Sanders led all NFC rushers with 1,470 yards in 1989, 10  yards behind Christian Okoye of the Kansas City Chiefs. He leads the NFC with  844 yards in 1990. When the Bills concentrated their defense on Houston's Fab  Four, White burned them on draw plays.  </P> <P> Myth 4: The Seahawks junked the run-and-shoot after one half of the Chicago  Bears game because they didn't think it would work.  </P> <P> Not true. The Seahawks found that they weren't skilled enough or proficient  enough to use it regularly. Now, they sprinkle in the run-and-shoot as a  change-up.  </P> <P> "I've always thought it's got a chance," Seahawks offensive coordinator John  Becker said. "There's some guys who think it's a passing fad and all that. It  didn't look like a passing fad to me the other night against the Bills. They  lit it up against a real good football team.  </P> <P> "You spread people out and then you've got the skilled people that they have,  I'll tell you what, you create some real problems. We've used it really, really  sparingly. Nobody ever promised how much we were going to us it. I don't think  it was given what you would consider an awesome look."  </P> <P> With the Oilers, who use it all the time, it looks awesome.  </P></p>

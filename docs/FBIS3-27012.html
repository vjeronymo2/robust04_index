			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents Liu Linzong (0491 2651 1350) and Huang </F> Weihua (7806 1218 5478)]    [Text] Beijing, Feb 16 (XINHUA) -- Upon returning here  from Xichang Satellite Launch Center recently, Long Lehao (7893  2867 6275), vice president of the Chinese Academy of Carrier  Rocket Technology and general architect of the Long-March 3A  carrier rocket, said: The rocket's successful launch marked a  giant step forward and a new stage in the development of China's  rocket technology. It is a rare event in China's rocket  development history to achieve complete success during a  rocket's first test launch.    Long Lehao said: The Long-March 3A rocket, which  incorporates China's latest carrier rocket technology, is  actually a brand new model. The newly developed high-energy  oxyhydrogen III (gao neng qing yang di san ji 7559 5174 8641  8638 0005 4787] involved the successful tackling of several  hundred technological problems and the development of dozens of  major new technologies, many of which approach contemporary  advanced international levels. The carrier rocket also employs  a control system for operating four-spindle gyroscope  oscillating platform [dong diao tuo luo si zhou rao xing ping  tai 0520 6148 7094 5828 0934 6519 2371 1840 1627 0669] for the  first time in China, a technology quite advanced even in the  world. The use of the cold helium heating pressurization  technology [leng hai jia wen zeng ya ji shu 0397 8640 0502 3306  1073 1090 2111 2611] for pressurizing the third-stage liquid  oxygen chamber makes China the second country after the United  States to independently and successfully develop and utilize  such a technology. The low-temperature hydrogen energy source  [di wen qing qi neng yuan] and other technologies used in the  servo-control mechanism of the third-level oscillating power  generator [san ji bai dong fa dong ji 0005 4787 2369 0520 4099  0520 2623] is also a new technology in our country.    Long Lehao said: The successful launch has extremely great  significance to China's space undertakings:    -- The successful launch has provided a carrier vehicle for  China's new-generation and bigger-capacity satellites -- the  Dongfanghong [East Is Red] 3. As a result, it will play an  important role in promoting the development of China's broadcast  and telecommunications industries. China's new-model  telecommunications satellites will serve the needs of its  economic construction even better if they can be launched  earlier.    -- It helps lay the foundation for the formation of a rocket  series capable of carrying the largest payload onto higher  orbits. The carrying capacity of the Long-March 3A is 2.5  tonnes, up from the Long-March 3's 1.4 tonnes. The Long-March  3B -- which is based on the Long-March 3A with extended  second-stage rocket, an enhanced cowling system, and four  cluster liquid booster rockets -- is capable of carrying 4.8  tonnes of payload. The Long-March 3C, which strips two booster  rockets from the Long-March 3B, is capable of carrying 3.5  tonnes of payload. The Long-March 3A, 3B, and 3C rockets  constitute China's rocket series capable of carrying the largest  payloads onto higher orbits. The series is capable of carrying  a wide range of payloads. It ranks first in China and second in  the world in terms of the capacity to carry payload onto higher  or lower orbits.    -- The success in the rocket's first test launch greatly  improves the Long March rocket's competitiveness in the  international market for satellites launch services. Because it  is capable of carrying a payload ranging from 1.4 tonnes to 4.8  tonnes and sending it to geosynchronous orbit and because it is  capable of launching one, two, or three satellites at the same  time, it can be used for launching a variety of satellites and  thereby has a greater appeal to consumers. The Long-March 3A  can also change orbits, redirect, initiate revolution [qi xuan  6386 2467], and conduct large attitude angular movement  according to consumers' demands.</p>

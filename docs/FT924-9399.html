			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar trades in tight ranges THE DOLLAR traded in tight ranges against the D-Mark yesterday, in spite of the political euphoria that followed Mr Bill Clinton's election as President of the US, writes James Blitz. In recent weeks, the prospect of Mr Clinton's election has been viewed by dealers as 'dollar positive'. The market believes that his promise to increase government spending will probably be accompanied by a rise in US short-term interest rates - a repetition, as some analysts see it, of the economic policies associated with the early Reagan years. However, a Clinton victory had already been priced into the market, and the dollar had little upward momentum to gain from the victory declaration itself. Many dealers are betting on a sharp upturn in the dollar continuing into the new year. But they are unsure about the exact timing because the incumbent does not take office until January. A sharp dollar rise might accompany earlier than anticipated announcements of Mr Clinton's administration, the framework of his economic policy and his attitude on the exchange rate. In the absence of developments the dollar only managed to rise to a high of DM1.5743 in Europe yesterday, before retreating to a low of DM1.5555. It finished in London at DM1.5675, up about  1/2 pfennig on the day. In New York it ended at DM1.5690. Nevertheless, the dollar is now some 12 per cent above the historic low reached on September 2, and the effect of this is being felt in the European markets. As more investors sell dollars for D-Marks, the German currency appears to be weakening on the cross rates. In recent days, for example, both the French franc and the Italian lira have shown signs of a new upward momentum. The franc rose 30 centimes to a close of FFr3.3830 against the D-Mark yesterday, in spite of Monday's cuts in official interest rates and a promise from the French prime minister yesterday that more interest rate cuts are about to come. The lira also closed higher, at L852.6 per D-Mark, helped by the fact that two-thirds of the government's emergency package has now been ratified by parliament. There is growing confidence that the lira could re-enter the exchange rate mechanism before the new year. Sterling has also benefited from the dollar's strength in recent days, rising 1 1/2 pfennigs yesterday to a DM2.4350 close in London. However, the short-term outlook for the UK currency depended on the results of last night's vote in the House of Commons on whether the government should move to endorse European economic and monetary union. Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, said the pound will find it difficult to re-enter the ERM in any event. The UK's economic weakness and the cuts in interest rates would continue to weaken sterling.</p>

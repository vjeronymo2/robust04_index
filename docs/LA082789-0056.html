			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICERS MOURN VETERAN POLICE DOG KILLED BY CAR THEFT SUSPECT  </P> <P> Los Angeles police officers Saturday mourned the death of Marko, a German  shepherd who helped collar 243 criminal suspects in his five years as a police  dog before being stabbed in the neck last week by a car theft suspect.  </P> <P> Marko was buried at a local pet cemetery Saturday morning, Officer Glen Schnoor  said. He died about 9 p.m. Friday.  </P> <P> "We're all pretty upset. It's like losing a member of the family," Schnoor  said.  </P> <P> Officers had stood vigil inside a veterinary clinic, hoping for a miracle  recovery for the 85-pound dog, which was on a life-support system late Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Close Relationship  </P> <P> "Marko is not a human being, but he is about as close as you can get," said  Police Lt. Mike Hillmann. "You're talking about a relationship that is very  close."  </P> <P> Marko's handler, Officer Sal Apodaca, had worked with the dog on hundreds of  cases since Marko joined the force in 1984, authorities said.  </P> <P> Marko was stabbed late Thursday after tracking a suspected car thief to a house  in South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Officers used tear gas to flush Myra Wright, 27, from beneath the house, police  said. Wright, whose address was not immediately known, was arrested for  investigation of felony auto theft and harming a police dog, Hillmann said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arlette Milhomen] </F>   [Text] Brazil has the highest number of fertilizer  poisoning cases in the rural area where, in 1992 alone, 3,700  were reported. The World Health Organization, however, reported  that this number is only 2 percent of the overall number of  cases, which totals 185,000. The organization added that 30  percent of these cases are fatal.    Herbicides forbidden in other countries still are in use in  Brazil, including paraquat, which is used in sugar cane  plantations. This substance causes lung fibrosis, in addition to  several other serious illnesses.    These cases will be reported during the Second National  Congress on Workers' Health, which will be held in Brasilia next  month. Causes of job injury also will be discussed in the  congress. From 1979 to 1988, more than 46,000 workers died in  Brazil while 26,000 others suffered injury. Experts from the  Ministries of Health, Labor, and Social Security and several  other organizations will attend the congress. They will present  proposals for the establishment of a policy safeguarding  workers' health and ensuring better supervision by the internal  commission in charge of preventing job accidents.</p>

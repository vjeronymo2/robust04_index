			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / MP warns on jobless figures The government's 'single-minded' focus on reducing the unemployment total is having negative consequences for public finances and economic well-being, says Labour MP Mr Frank Field. Mr Field today calls for an 'employment audit' of government policy to stop it from creating a welfare dependency. He makes his call in a conference paper to mark the 50th anniversary of the full employment white paper. He points to increased expenditure on family credit, in-work benefit, and the growth of invalidity benefit as the cost of reducing unemployment. 'Tax revenues should be rising and welfare spending falling as those previously unemployed begin work. That process is less marked during the current recovery,' says Mr Field.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Management: German workers go back to school to get ahead - Leslie Colitt reports that highly-trained employees are the key to the country's success / Training on Trial German manufacturers never cease to complain that their labour costs are the world's highest, especially when non-wage benefits are included. But press them a bit harder and they will admit that their highly-trained German workers are a key to the country's manufacturing success. The cost of employing skilled workers is causing German industry to shift lower-value production abroad. Klaus Krone, chairman of Krone in Berlin, a medium-size producer of telecommunications components, says German manufacturers are switching to higher technology products. This has been the experience of his own company, even though labour represents less than 5 per cent of total costs. Germany is famous for its training system. This provides for three-year apprenticeships during which most trainees from the age of 16 work on three days a week and attend vocational school for the other two. Management at Krone, which has 4,100 employees in 17 countries, says this training gives the company's German labour force a significant advantage in both theoretical and practical knowledge over its workers in Britain and Australia which favour on-the-job training. Thomas Mickeleit, a spokesman for Krone, says: 'A worker in the UK has a more narrow training than here and lacks the theoretical background which would make him more flexible.' Krone workers in Berlin said they found it difficult to imagine how foreign workers could cope without having been apprenticed or having attended a vocational school. Jurgen Rinner, a 38-year-old, did his three-and-a-half-year apprenticeship at Krone when the company was desperate for skilled workers in isolated west Berlin. At that time he earned only DM145 (Pounds 57) a month compared with the DM800 which a 16 year-old apprentice starts off with today. He attended vocational school once a week, doing practical work and studying technical drawing, maths and materials science. Today, young German apprentices go to vocational school twice a week - to the dismay of many small companies which rely heavily on them - and the range of subjects is far greater and more specialised. One language is required, usually English, and a social science. 'You can't know enough today,' says Rinner. In fact, a growing number of the 100 young people who are apprenticed at Krone each year have Abitur school-leaving certificates, qualifying them for university studies but instead choose to learn a trade through fear of unemployment. Rinner is one of a handful of maintenance and control workers in an automated hall producing quick connection components for copper and optical fibre networks. He doubts that on-the-job-training could give a worker the skills he gained during his apprenticeship and vocational school. 'The foundation would be missing' he says. A colleague, Karsten Vogel, is one of Krone's nearly 200 east German employees, hired since the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. They proved to be as well-qualified as their west German counterparts, according to the company. Vogel, a 28-year-old electronics worker did his apprenticeship at an east Berlin television plant equipped with modern Japanese equipment. At the same time, he studied to gain the coveted Abitur. 'You learned more than you need but you never know where you will end up,' he says. Vogel attended a number of training courses offered by Krone and was soon able to cope with its different control system for the automated equipment. At first, western workmates kept their distance but finally accepted him when he proved his competence. Vogel would like to become a technician but says the two years of evening classes he would need to attend are not possible while he continues to work in a three-shifts-a-day pattern. A vital link between the management and workers on the German shopfloor is the meister, the foreman. Jurgen Schumacher, aged 54, and a meister at Krone for seven of his 11 years with the company, says: 'The only problems we have are with older employees as their capacity to absorb new information is limited.'</p>

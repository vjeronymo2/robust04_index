			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Low countries see red and orange in needle matches Deep-seated rivalry between the Netherlands and Belgium will surface today in two highly-contested matches played between determined teams in far-flung, sunny settings. On the Greek island of Corfu, Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, will seek to prevent victory by his Belgian counterpart, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, in a closed-door contest to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. Meanwhile, the US will host Dutch-Belgian competition of a more open kind at the football World Cup. In the midday heat of Orlando, Florida, Belgium's 'Red Devils' squad will be meeting the 'Orangemen' - the national side of the Netherlands. Fixtures involving the two countries are always favourites with the fans, but this match has taken on added significance because of the unusually hard-fought battle between Mr Lubbers and Mr Dehaene for the right to assume the mantle of 'Mr Europe'. Diplomatic relations between the Dutch and the Belgians are usually correct but the two countries have a complicated love-hate relationship springing from a shared history. The Belgians may have seceded from the United Netherlands in 1830, but the language, literature and culture of the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium and 'big brother' Holland to the north are inextricably intertwined. This link has brought irritations and jealousy, and Belgian jokes in the Netherlands are as rife as Dutch jokes in Flanders. The Dutch like to see the Belgians as drink-loving layabouts mired in political squabbles. To the Belgians, the stereotypical Dutchman is stingy with money, lacking in culture and devoid of gastronomic finesse. Above all, he is loud and overbearing, especially when visiting Belgium. In fact, Belgian resentment is similar to the aversion of the Dutch to crowds of German tourists in their own country. Indeed, Dutch passion about the succession to Mr Delors is not directed so much at Belgium, a fellow small country in the European Union, as it is at Germany, Mr Dehaene's main supporter. This attitude was neatly captured by a political cartoon in the Amsterdam daily Het Parool showing German chancellor Helmut Kohl with a tiny Mr Dehaene in his shirt pocket. The caption read: 'The right man in the right spot', underscoring Dutch perception of Mr Dehaene as a potential puppet for German interests. It is therefore just as well the Germans and the Dutch - whose sporting encounters have tended to rekindle unresolved anger dating from the second world war - have yet to meet on one of the football fields of the US while the question of Mr Delors' succession remains unresolved.

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Sport: Forget the Masters, this is serious - Golf There is only one serious golf tournament next week - and it is not at Augusta. Several hours before Greg Norman and others tee off on Thursday for the 1994 US Masters, 640 golfers, mainly British, will assemble at Royal Cinque Ports (Deal) and Royal St George's (Sandwich) in Kent for the Halford Hewitt Cup, an annual contest between old boys of some of Britain's best-known public schools. The unique character of the event is hard to pin down. Suffice to say that it is a combination (among other things) of that peculiarly British affection for the alma mater, the glorious unpredictability of the (peculiarly British) weather, the unfamiliar pressures in this highly individualistic sport of playing for a team, and the chance to renew acquaintances from year to year. The 'Hewitt', which dates back to 1924, probably owes at least as much to the inspiration of a Cambridge golf and soccer blue called G L 'Susie' Mellin as it does to Halford W. Hewitt who presented the Cup. According to Peter Ryde, who chronicled the first 60 years of the competition in his book A Festival of Foursomes*: 'What is important in thinking of the tournament is that the name of one should not be remembered without that of the other.' In a foreword to Ryde's book the late Gerald Micklem (one of England's finest amateur golfers) wrote that the Hewitt was really a series of little tournaments within a big one. For many of the 64 participating schools getting through one round - or beating an old foe - is the limit of their ambition. Reaching the last 16 on Saturday morning when everyone moves to Deal - the true 'home' of the Hewitt  -is another incentive for those drawn to play their first two rounds at Sandwich. Part of the unpredictability lies in the draw, which always takes place at the East India Club in London in January and is unseeded. This means strong teams often clash early on - Eton and Harrow being a case in point this time - while others have a supposedly 'easier' ride. My own school, Uppingham, appears to be in that happy position this year, judging by a complex table compiled by our organiser and showing the number of quarter-final and semi-final appearances over the last 10 years of all the teams in each section of the draw. The official 'form guide', however, is the so called Andersen scale - named after a veteran Malvern campaigner - which ranks schools on the basis of both their overall record and their recent record. What stands out is the sheer consistency of those at the top: the best between 1984 and 1993 (Malvern, Shrewsbury, Tonbridge, Harrow, Watson's and Eton) all feature in the top 10 'all comers'. The standard of golf reflects the mixed composition of many teams - from players who have represented their countries to the club hackers sometimes required to make up numbers. Reputations, though, count for little when the wind blows and nerves start to jangle. There are few more stomach-cramping experiences than the dawning realisation that it is 'your' match which will be the decider, that the rest of the team and its camp followers are gathering around the 18th green to watch the action, and that you may have a three-foot putt or less to take it down the 19th. And what a 19th (by which I do not mean the clubhouse). Played for the first time the first at Deal seems a relatively straightforward par four - a drive and a flick for longer hitters. Played for the second time - perhaps in front of scores of other competitors relaxing on the clubhouse verandah - the burn across the front of the green suddenly becomes a daunting challenge even with wedge in hand. At least one school has lost after two of its five pairs won their matches by handsome margins in the 'country', whereas the other three all lost after extra holes. Ryde's book sums it up by quoting the verdict of one competitor to the effect that the Hewitt would be the greatest fun in the world were it not for the golf. Another has a sodden North of England, Scottish or West Country competitor remarking: 'If I'd known it was foursomes, I'd never have come'. Best of all perhaps is the 'telegram story' of 1949 which sounded a still relevant warning for successful schools who take their opponents too lightly. It involves the late Leonard Crawley, a golf writer on the Daily Telegraph and pillar of the formidably strong Harrow side, who failed to arrive in time for a first round match at Deal. His hapless captain later in the day received a telegram from the victorious underdogs which read simply: 'Tell Crawley bring his pen but leave clubs behind'. * Published by Public Schools Golfing Society, 1984, but now out of print.

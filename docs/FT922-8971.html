			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subdued as rate cut hopes fade Wall Street US EQUITIES traded in a narrow range as stronger payroll figures for April dampened hopes that the Federal Reserve would make an early cut in interest rates, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 6.04 higher at 3,369.41 on paltry turnover of less than 169m shares. Advancing broadly equalled declining issues, at 834 against 810. The Standard &amp; Poor 500 was 0.20 higher at 416.05 and the Nasdaq composite eased 1.41 to 585.75. On Thursday, the Dow closed 6.04 lower at 3,363.37. Evidence of a slow but steady economic recovery was provided by April's employment report which showed a rise in non-farm payrolls of 126,000, considerably above most predictions. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 7.2 per cent from 7.3 per cent and the March non-payroll increase was revised to 39,000 from 19,000. The employment report stifled speculation that the Federal Reserve would ease monetary policy. Yesterday the Fed signalled that its policy was on hold by arranging Dollars 1.5bn of customer repurchase agreements. The operation, which adds reserves to the banking system, occurred when Fed Funds were trading at 3 3/4 per cent, the Fed's perceived target for the rate. Pinelands soared Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 17 3/4 in active trading on reports that the New Jersey-based television station operator had accepted a takeover offer of Dollars 18 a share from Chris-Craft Industries. Shares in Chris-Craft fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 . Trading was heavy in a number of blue chip stocks including Boeing, down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 44 1/8 , IBM, off Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 93 1/4 and Chase Manhattan, up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 29 1/2 . Liz Claiborne rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 37 7/8 after the apparel company said it had offered to buy the operating assets of Russ Togs, which is operating under protection of Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. The transportation sector reversed some previous day's losses, the Dow Jones Transportation Average climbing 4.67 to 1,399.66. Airline issues were mixed, with AMR, parent of American Airlines, unchanged at Dollars 68 5/8 , Delta Air Lines adding Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 61 3/4 and UAL, parent of United Airlines off Dollars 1 to Dollars 124. Railroad stocks, which contributed to the average's decline on Thursday, turned higher. Burlington Northern added Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 45 7/8 , Norfolk Southern rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 65 and Consolidated Rail firmed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 91 1/2 . Transco Energy climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 13 after the natural gas and coal producer said it expected to take a first quarter charge of 66 cents a share to settle a lawsuit with Global Marine. In over-the-counter trading, Sun Microsystems improved Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 29 3/4 after a Morgan Stanley analyst upgraded his rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'hold'. American Funeral Services was quoted at Dollars 10. An initial public offering of 1.8m shares was priced at Dollars 10 a share. Canada TORONTO stocks closed modestly higher in moderate trading, ending an uneventful week on a positive note. The composite index rose 11.53 points to close at 3,374.43. Advances outnumbered declines 289 to 231 on volume of 24.195m shares, up from 21,714,000 shares. Trading value climbed to CDollars 267.2m.</p>

According to  the decree, the measure will control the entrance of fiduciary  money, "since right now, a great many people enter the nation  with large amounts of cash and other assets and no one knows  their origin or destination."    Several weeks ago, DEA agents in the United States said  Panama cooperated more in the fight against drug trafficking  during Manuel Antonio Noriega's military dictatorship than the  current democratic government.    According to a Presidency press bulletin, the government  order seeks to safeguard the principles ruling the International  Financial Center operating in Panama and to prevent the  fraudulent entrance of ill gotten cash and other valuables. In  this regard, the document indicates that "although our  legislation does not prohibit the entrance and exit of cash and  other liquid assets, it is advisable to safeguard the Panamanian  banking center's principles. This assures that passengers  entering the nation with cash and other assets, that the cash  and assets have legal origins and are not the product of illegal  drug trafficking."    The government said the Customs Directorate will be  responsible for enforcing the decree as well as punishing the  violators. Forms, therefore will be drawn up to read:  "Traveler's Sworn Statement," in which the person, national or  foreigner, will declare his assets.    Yesterday, members of the National Banking Association  pointed out that the initiative can be healthy, but only as a  precautionary measure as it is very difficult to prevent money  laundering. Meanwhile, others said the measures could cause the  number of attacks on tourists to increase as the amount of cash  being brought in will be known.</p>

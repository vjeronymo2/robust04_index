			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Cerus hit by loss provisions CERUS, the French holding company of Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian financier, yesterday announced fresh problems with a FFr377m (Dollars 74.46m) loss for the first half, due to heavy provisions at its banking arm. The shortfall, which compares with a FFr315m loss in the first six months of 1991, comes despite the strong gains recorded by the holding company's main investment, Valeo, the French car components maker. ***** Dumenil-Leble, Cerus' 76 per cent owned banking subsidiary, recorded a FFr492m loss, after FFr540m of provisions for losses on property investments and the closure of its Swiss unit. Cerus announced that it planned to inject fresh funds into Dumenil-Leble, which had FFr650m of shareholders' capital before these results. The amount of the recapitalisation has yet to be decid-ed. ***** Mrs Edith Cresson, the former French prime minister, is to chair a French-owned international consulting company for which she worked briefly before becoming prime minister in May 1991, Reuter reports from Paris. Her new employer, Services Industries Strategies International et Environnement (SISIE), belongs to the Schneider engineering and building group. ***** Burda, the German privately-owned newspaper publishing group, said its parent company's pre-tax profit in 1991 rose to DM76.1m (Dollars 51.33m) from DM71.6m, while group sales rose 10.3 per cent to DM1.37bn. The company said business with printing and electronic media was satisfactory in 1991; advertising was difficult due to increasing competition from television. Burda expects its results for 1992 to be similar to 1991. It said it would continue to use profits for investments. Capital spending in printing and computer equipment should rise to almost DM300m over the next four years.</p>

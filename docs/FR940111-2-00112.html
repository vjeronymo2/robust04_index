The report examines the Correlation of NCAP Performance with Fatality Risk in Actual Head-On Collisions. In NCAP, frontal crash tests of approximately 35 passenger vehicles are conducted each year and the test results are made available to the public, in response to the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972. The Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1992 directed ``NHTSA to provide a study to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations comparing the results of New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) data from previous model years to determine the validity of these tests in predicting actual on-the-road injuries and fatalities over the lifetime of the models.'' In December 1993, NHTSA submitted a report to Congress, titled Response to the NCAP FY 1992 Congressional Requirements, summarizing the agency's analyses of head-on collisions and other types of crashes. This Technical Report documents the agency's analysis of head-on collisions. The agency seeks public review and comment on the technical report. Comments received will be used to improve future analyses of the correlation of NCAP performance and fatality or injury risk. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received no later than April 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Report:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons may obtain a copy of the report free of charge by sending a self-addressed mailing label to Ms. Glorious Harris (NAD&hyph;51), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All comments should refer to the docket and notice number of this notice and be submitted to: Docket Section, Room 5109, Nassif Building 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.

In response to Congressional direction, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration studied the relationship between vehicle test scores in NCAP and the fatality risk in crashes of vehicles on the road. This study is based on head-on collisions, where the effect of crashworthiness can be separated from the effects of extraneous factors that influence fatality rates (drivers, roadways, mileage). Collisions between two 1979&hyph;91 passenger cars in which both drivers were wearing safety belts were selected from the Fatal Accident Reporting System. There were 396 collisions (792 cars) in which both cars were identical with or very similar to vehicles which had been tested in NCAP. In the analyses, adjustments were made for the relative weights of the cars, and for the age and sex of the drivers_factors which substantially affect fatality risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are statistically significant correlations between NCAP scores for head injury, chest acceleration and femur loading and the actual fatality risk of belted drivers. A composite NCAP score, based on the test results for all three body regions, has excellent correlation with fatality risk: In a head-on collision between a car with good composite score and a car of equal weight with poor score, the driver of the car with the better NCAP score has, on average, a 20 to 25 percent lower risk of fatal injury. Slightly smaller, but still significant fatality reductions are obtained even when the NCAP scores for just one body region (just HIC, or chest g's, or femur load) are used to partition the fleet into ``good'' and ``poor'' performance groups. The borderline between good and poor NCAP scores that optimizes the differences in actual fatality risk is close to the criteria specified in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208 for each of the three body regions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cars built from 1979 through 1982 had, on the average, the poorest NCAP scores. Test performance improved substantially in 1983 through 1986 models, and continued to improve in 1987 through 1991 cars. In parallel, fatality risk for belted drivers in actual head-on collisions decreased by 20 to 25 percent in model years 1979&hyph;91, with the largest decreases just after 1982. The 35 mph test speed for NCAP is 5 mph higher than the test speed for FMVSS 208. By now, most passenger cars meet the FMVSS 208 criteria at the NCAP test speed. The study shows that achievement of this enhanced level of test performance has been accompanied by a significant reduction in actual fatality risk. However, being a statistical study, it does not address what portion of the fatality reduction was directly ``caused'' by NCAP. Also, these results do not guarantee that any individual make-model with low NCAP scores will necessarily have lower fatality risk than another make-model with higher NCAP scores. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA welcomes public review of the technical report and invites the reviewers to submit comments about the data and the statistical methods used in the report. The agency is interested in learning of any additional data that could be used to expand or improve the analyses, such as information about the curb weights of cars and light trucks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose, in the envelope with their comments, a self_addressed stamped postcard.

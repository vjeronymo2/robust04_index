			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following subsection 5(g)(4)(B) is a provision which provides as follows: ``[u]nder IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;11&hyph;6(c), the administrative law judge shall issue the findings and a non-final order within 60 days after conclusion of the hearing.'' This provision, which allows the ALJ 60 days to render a non-final order, would leave no time for the commission to render its final decision and still conform to the 60-day time limit provided by 30 CFR 843.13(c). The proposed language is also inconsistent with proposed subsections 5(g)(3) and 5(h) which are no less effective than the 60-day provision at 30 CFR 843.13(c). Therefore, the Director finds that the language quoted above in this paragraph is less effective than the Federal regulations and cannot be approved. In addition, the Director is requiring that Indiana further amend 310 1AC 0.6&hyph;1&hyph;5 by deleting the language quoted above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection 5(h) is amended to set a 50-day deadline for the final order of the commission following the issuance of the director's recommended order or the ALJ findings and written recommendations. Amendments also set a 90-day deadline for the commission's final order following receipt of the order to show cause by the permittee where the permittee does not comply with the requirements of 310 IAC 0.6&hyph;1&hyph;5(e). A 60-day deadline is set for the commission's final order following the hearing or the ALJ's receipt of the permittee's answer filed under 310 IAC 0.6&hyph;1&hyph;5(e) if no hearing was requested nor necessary. The Director finds this provision to be consistent with 30 CFR 843.13(c) and fully satisfies the required program amendment at 30 CFR 914.16(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection 5(i), which was formerly found at subsection 5(g)(1), is amended by replacing ``administrative law judge'' with ``commission'' and adding a reference to 310 IAC 12 at the end of the first sentence. The Director finds these changes clarify responsibilities and procedures under the Indiana program and are consistent with 30 CFR 843.13. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Old subsection 5(j), which limited the number of hearings available to one before the director and one before the commission, is deleted. The Director finds that this deletion, which has no Federal counterpart, does not render 310 IAC 0.6&hyph;1&hyph;5 inconsistent with 30 CFR 843.13 and 43 CFR 4.1190 through 4.1196, because the procedures for a hearing remain clear in the section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the exceptions noted above, the Director finds that the proposed changes to 310 IAC 0.6&hyph;1&hyph;5 are consistent with and no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 843.13 and 43 CFR 4.1190 through 4.1196. In addition, the Director finds that the required program amendment codified at 30 CFR 914.16(d) is satisfied by these amendments and can be removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. 310 IAC 0.6&hyph;1&hyph;13&blank;Awards of Litigation Expenses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsection 13(c) is amended by changing ``IC 13&hyph;8&hyph;5&hyph;7'' to read ``IC 13&hyph;8&hyph;15&hyph;7.'' The Director finds that this correction of the citation does not render the provision less effective than 43 CFR 4.1294 concerning the award of costs and expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. 310 IAC 0.7&hyph;3&hyph;5&blank;Delegations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New subsection 5(a) is added and provides that 310 IAC 0.7&hyph;3&hyph;5 governs the delegation of authority by the Natural Resources Commission with respect to the Bureau of Mine Reclamation and with respect to the Division of Reclamation. Subsection 5(c) is deleted. This provision would grant the deputy director of the IDNR authority to take action to forfeit a bond. The Director finds that there are no Federal counterparts to the language proposed to be added and deleted, and that the addition and deletion does not render the Indiana program less effective than SMCRA or the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Agency Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various interested Federal agencies. No comments were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The public comment period and opportunity to request a public hearing was announced in the July 15, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 36114). The comment period closed on August 15, 1994. No one commented and no one requested an opportunity to testify at the scheduled public hearing so no hearing was held. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

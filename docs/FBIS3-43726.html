			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have learned from the Rwandan Embassy in Burundi  that young Tutsi extremists from opposition political parties  yesterday staged demonstrations outside the Burundi Republican  Presidency between 1500 and 1600 while Prime Minister Sylvie  Kinigi was meeting representatives of civic groups and  opposition parties to explain to them the appropriateness of  amending Article 85 of the Burundi Constitution in order to seek  ways and means of restoring peace and tranquillity in Burundi.    The amendment of Article 85 of the Burundi Constitution  should enable the National Assembly to elect a new president of  the Republic to replace late President Melchior Ndadaye, who was  assassinated last October.    According to the Rwandan Embassy in the Burundi capital, the  demonstrators were dispersed by security forces. While being  dispersed, the demonstrators attacked the premises of the  Rwandan Embassy in Bujumbura which they ransacked after breaking  windows and smashing doors. The Rwandan Embassy, however, has  given assurances that all Rwandan diplomats in Bujumbura are  safe and sound.    The Rwandan chancery and other diplomatic missions in  Bujumbura invited the Burundi Ministry of Foreign Affairs to  visit the scene to see the damage caused by the demonstrators to  the Rwandan diplomatic mission in Bujumbura.</p>

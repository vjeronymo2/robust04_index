This revised definition of inedible kernel will better reflect handler processing capabilities and will be more equitable to growers and handlers. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Almond Board of California (Board), which is responsible for local administration of the order. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective on August 3, 1994.

The marketing agreement and order are authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in accordance with Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This interim final rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of entry of the ruling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this interim final rule on small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 115 handlers of almonds that are subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately 7,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000 and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the almond producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule revises the definition of inedible kernel in &sect;981.408_Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations by excluding almond kernels, pieces, or particles of almond kernels with web and frass from being considered inedible almonds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The processing of almonds involves various steps taken by growers and handlers prior to shipment to market. In most situations, growers initially take their almonds to a huller/sheller operation where the hulls and shells are mechanically removed. The almonds are then delivered to a handler, who has the almonds inspected by the Federal-State Inspection Service. The inspector determines the percentage of inedible almond kernels in a sample, as defined in section 981.408. Based upon the inspection, growers are paid by the handlers for the marketable almonds in the lot. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

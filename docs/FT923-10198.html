			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Names may fight on in Canada CANADIAN NAMES at Lloyd's of London insurance market are considering appealing to their Supreme Court after an attempt to sue Lloyd's for alleged fraud was defeated earlier this week. The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a decision that the Names - the individuals whose assets support the insurance market - would have to bring their case in an English court. The court also overturned injunctions obtained against some Canadian banks to prevent them from paying out guarantees taken out by the Names as part of the assets pledged to the market. Mr Justice Carthy, Mr Justice Osborne and Mr Justice Abella ruled that the Names must comply with the clauses in their membership agreement with Lloyd's that any litigation would be conducted through English courts. Lloyd's could switch quickly to offering limited liability to its Names, a report from Davies Arnold Cooper, a firm of solicitors, argued yesterday. The report says the present position of unlimited liability is a historical accident and that a simple change in a by-law would allow admission of people without full liability. Syndicate 2000. Davies Arnold Cooper, 6-8 Bouverie Street, London EC4Y 8DD.</p>

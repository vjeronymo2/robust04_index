			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BUCHAREST MUSEUM SHOT UP  </P> <P> The mythical hero Hercules grimaces in agony, a bullet hole through his heart,  as he wrestles with a centaur in a 17th-Century masterpiece at the Bucharest  art museum.  </P> <P> Machine-gun fire has ripped through the canvas by Italian painter Luca Giordano  and bullet marks pock Alessandro Allori's tranquil 16th-Century "Mother with  Child."  </P> <P> The damage was caused when troops fired on the National Museum of Art during  last week's fighting to flush out secret police snipers loyal to ousted  Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu shooting from the roof.  </P> <P> Art critic Dorana Cosoveanu sensed trouble when hundreds of angry demonstrators  gathered in front of the presidential palace opposite the museum Dec. 21,  booing Ceausescu.  </P> <P> "I realized the people thought this was Ceausescu's house, they didn't know it  was a museum. So I climbed out of a window and put up a sign saying " 'museum  of art, please protect,' " she said. In the days of fighting that followed, the  stately museum became a prime target, and its stone exterior is now pitted with  shellfire. Some of the gunfire was so heavy it pounded through the walls and  straight through paintings, hitting the walls on the other side.  </P> <P> Museum Director Alexandru Cebuc said between 15% and 20% of the collection was  damaged in the bombardment.  </P></p>

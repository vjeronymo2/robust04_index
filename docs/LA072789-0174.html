			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> SAVE OUR BEACH PETITION  </P> <P> Save Our Beach Committee last week submitted a petition with more than 10,000  signatures for an initiative that would ban all new beachfront hotels and  restaurants larger than 2,000 square feet.  </P> <P> The county registrar-recorder has 30 days to verify the signatures. At least  8,420 are needed to qualify. If the initiative qualifies, the City Council must  adopt the initiative or place the issue on the ballot in a special election  within 88 to 103 days.  </P> <P> Sharon Gilpin, a spokeswoman for the committee, said 65 people collected the  10,000 signatures over 10 weeks.  </P> <P> The initiative would ban all new hotel construction, including a luxury hotel  proposed by restaurateur Michael McCarty on the site of the private Sand and  Sea Club on Pacific Coast Highway, and one being planned by Maguire Thomas  Partners on Ocean Avenue next to the recently opened Loews Santa Monica Beach  Hotel.  </P> <P> Another group is circulating a petition for a competing initiative that would  ban new beachfront hotels for three years, but exempt the McCarty and Maguire  Thomas projects. It began collecting signatures earlier this month. This  initiative would use a portion of beachfront hotel bed taxes to clean up Santa  Monica Bay and city parks.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the group, Santa Monicans for a Livable Environment, said  they expect to collect between 10,000 and 12,000 signatures by Aug. 1.  </P></p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UAP and Axa post sharp falls for year THE problems in the French insurance industry were highlighted yesterday when Union des Assurances de Paris and Axa, two of France's largest insurance companies, yesterday announced sharp falls in their net profits for 1992. Axa's shares fell FFr28 to FFr1,114 on a fall in net profits for 1992 and a FFr3.65bn (Dollars 652m) convertible bond issue to strengthen the capital position of Equitable Life, its US associate. Mr Claude Bebear, Axa chairman, said it needed to invest several hundred million dollars in Equitable to enable the US company, in which Axa bought a 49 per cent stake in 1991, to meet new US regulations on risk-based capital ratios. Equitable needs to raise its ratio from 85 per cent to 100 per cent by 1995 when the new rules come into effect. Mr Bebear stressed the new ratio was the only reason for Axa's investment in Equitable Life. However, Axa suffered a fall in profits last year with net attributable profits slipping to between FFr1.5bn and FFr1.6bn from FFr2.4bn in 1991. The group, like other French insurers, was hit by the intensely competitive state of both the life and non-life markets in France. UAP last night warned of a fall in net profits to between FFr1bn and FFr1.3bn last year from FFr3.76bn in 1991. News of UAP's profit fall, which was made after the Paris stock market had closed and suggests that the group's 1992 performance was worse than analysts' expectations, comes at a delicate time for the company. UAP is a prime candidate for privatisation. UAP yesterday said that the main cause of last year's reduction in profits was its exposure to Banque Worms, its French banking subsidiary. The bank lost FFr350m in the first half of last year, and is expected to have lost FFr1bn during the full year. UAP last month was forced to provide FFr1.4bn in emergency recapitalisation for Banque Worms. UAP increased group turnover by 19 per cent to FFr125bn last year. However, this growth was mainly due to the contribution from Sun Life, the UK insurer. The group said yesterday that the level of underlying growth in its existing business was 5 per cent.

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Galapagos forest fires threaten giant tortoises An eleven-day-old forest fire on the Galapagos Islands has destroyed 6,000 hectares of the area's unique eco-system and is now threatening hundreds of the giant Galapagos tortoises. Adverse climatic conditions on the island of Isabela are impeding efforts by poorly equipped fire fighters, while heavy machinery is having difficulty in the rough volcanic terrain. In addition, efforts at isolating the fire by cutting trails through the brush are failing due to highly combustible vegetation that is carried by the wind. Experts say a vast network of roots allowed the fire to spread beneath the trails. President Sixto Duran Ballen declared a state of emergency over Isabela island, the largest and most populated in the archipelago, which was declared world natural patrimony by Unesco. He called on the international community to support the fire fighting efforts with specialised equipment and technical advisers. Though experts from the US and Canada have already arrived, the urgently needed hydroplanes won't be sent by their respective governments until the team of forestry technicians presents its report in a few days. Meanwhile, rescue workers are preparing to evacuate hundreds of giant tortoises, each of which can weigh up to 350 pounds. If the tortoises are not evacuated on time, experts say, one of the various breeds inhabitating the islands could become extinct. Mr Alfredo Carrasco, secretary general of the Charles Darwin Foundation, discarded volcanic activity as the likely cause of the fire, and suggested that hunters may not have properly extinguished a campfire.</p>

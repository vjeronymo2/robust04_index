			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Tories to renew attacks on Labour SENIOR Tories yesterday shrugged off an opinion poll giving Labour a 5 percentage-point lead and prepared for the latest of the political offensives the party has planned for the approach to the general election. Although rejecting Labour claims that the election campaign has already begun, Conservatives plan a concerted offensive against Labour's defence and foreign policies. They will use tomorrow's Commons nuclear defence debate for this purpose. More attacks on Labour tax and education policies will follow. Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, yesterday set out the broad thrust of the Conservatives' election themes in a message to his Colchester South and Maldon constituency association. The choice was between 'sound and responsible stewardship of a low-tax economy, strong defence and firm leadership from the Conservatives', and 'higher taxes, economic ruin and a weak, vacillating Britain' from other parties. Conservative ministers believe their tactics so far this year have dented Labour confidence and are determined not to overreact to the opposition's intensive campaigning or to be panicked by one opinion poll. 'We don't want to look frantic and frenzied like Labour,' said one cabinet minister who believed recent opinion polls showed Labour and the Tories 'neck and neck'. Another minister conceded that the result of most general elections was decided well beforehand. 'This one is obviously more interesting.' Extra staff have been brought into Conservative Central Office to ensure the swiftest possible reaction to Labour offensives. The release of further details of the Tory election manifesto is being controlled for maximum effect. They are certain to include help for working mothers, more privatisation, deregulation, lower taxation, environmental protection and support for training and education. Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, attacked the pledge yesterday by Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, to use the tax system to redistribute income as 'the politics of envy'. He said Labour policies 'would send our economy into a permanent tail spin'. The NOP poll in the Independent on Sunday newspaper put Labour on 45 per cent, Tories on 40 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 12 per cent.</p>

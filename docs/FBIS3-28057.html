Dr. Mahathir promised unbridled development and progress for  the state if Sabahans reject Datuk Kitingan and his rebel Parti  Bersatu Sabah [PBS] in the February 18 and 19 state polls. But  he cautioned that the oil and timber-rich state would experience  continued economic stagnation if it rejected the NF again. "If  you make a wrong choice again, you will have no one to blame but  yourselves," he told a crowd of several thousands in this small  rural town, 160 km from the state capital, Kota Kinabalu.    Dr. Mahathir, who is campaigning against the PBS for the  first time in a state election since 1985, made no bones about  what he thought of Datuk Kitingan, a stocky bespectacled native  Kadazan lawyer who is seeking a fourth term in office against  the might of the NF. Datuk Kitingan and the PBS earned the NF's  wrath when they deserted the federal ruling coalition on the eve  of general election in 1990 to back an opposition alliance led  by former Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah.    State-federal ties, never comfortable since the PBS came to  power in 1985, had deteriorated since then with Dr. Mahathir  laying the blame squarely on Datuk Kitingan.    Yesterday, Dr. Mahathir said Datuk Kitingan's conviction on  corruption charges on January 17 proved his point that "Pairin  just wants to serve his own and his family's interests; not that  of the people of Sabah". He said that it was "a shameful thing"  for Sabah and Malaysia to have the state led by a chief minister  who had been convicted of graft.    Dr. Mahathir's address followed that of normally  mild-mannered Sabah NF chief Tan Sri Sakaran Dandai who vowed to  "crush the PBS for taking Sabah into economic decline".    The attacks on the Sabah chief minister were a calculated  risk by the NF to demolish the "Pairin magic" widely attributed  for the PBS continued success in three state polls. Datuk  Kitingan is revered by the mainly-Christian Kadazans who form  the majority, in about 40 per cent of the 48 elecoral  constituencies in the state and enjoys a wide following amongst  the other races.    By focusing on his conviction, the NF intends to shatter the  Pairin myth and draw support to itself. But some analysts said  such attacks ran the risk of drawing greater sympathy for Datuk  Kitingan who was perceived by many of his supporters as a  political victim when graft charges were levelled against him.    Datuk Kitingan was fined [Malaysian dollar] $1,800, a  sentence light enough to allow him to remain as chief minister  and lead the PBS.    Dr. Mahathir also touched on the unsound state-federal ties,  saying that Kuala Lumpur had no reason to be unkind to Sabahans.    Last week, Datuk Kitingan admitted that investments in Sabah  had declined but blamed it on Kuala Lumpur's failure to maintain  roads and provide adequate electric supply.    Dr. Mahathir's attacks on Datuk Kitingan and the PBS,  telecast live over state-owned Radio Television Malaysia, signal  that the coming campaign will see state-federal relations  further battered.    Datuk Kitingan himself has taken a tougher stance in the  last  week attacking the federal government for not providing enough  assistance to the state. Dr. Mahathir leaves for Kuala Lumpur  later today.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Blair flirts with tax cuts - Plan to 'reduce burden on middle-income families' alarms soft left Mr Tony Blair yesterday raised the possibility that Labour could promise tax cuts for middle-income voters at the next general election. His comments came as close colleagues indicated that Mr Blair planned a wide-ranging shake-up of Labour's front-bench team in the Commons after the shadow cabinet elections later this month. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, is expected to remain in place - but Mr Blair may well shuffle the holders of all the other principal shadow cabinet portfolios. He is also expected to promote a number of modernisers into important second-rank positions. Mr Blair is determined to resist pressure from prominent leftwing figures in the shadow cabinet to back-pedal on his pledges not to increase the tax burden for average earners to pay for Labour's spending programme. Mr Blair said on BBC Radio that Labour would reconnect the issue of tax levels with the overall performance of the economy. As long as the economy had serious structural weaknesses, the tax burden would rise. He added that a successful economy under Labour would pave the way for eventual reductions in tax. 'A strong economy will allow us to spend more wisely and reduce the burden of tax on middle-income families,' he said. But Mr Blair's stance has alarmed leading figures on the party's soft left. They fear that by emphasising now that Labour will not put up taxes, Mr Blair will commit the party to matching after a general election any pre-election cuts announced by the Conservative party. Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, is among those determined that Labour should keep its options open - and he has made clear that the issue will be at the centre of the party's internal debates in the next year. But Mr Blair has told close colleagues that it will be impossible to sustain the party's attack on Conservative tax increases unless Labour is clear that it will not add to the burden. One colleague said: 'It destroys the argument. It is no use attacking the Tories for a 7 pence increase in the basic rate if you then say you are going to bung it up by 8 pence.' Mr Blair is said to be 'perfectly aware' that the Conservatives are likely to test Labour's rhetoric by announcing big tax cuts before the general election. He intends to respond with a strategy based on the argument that any such reductions will prove as temporary as the ones before the last general election because of the government's failure to build the long-term strength of the economy. One colleague said: 'We want to re-integrate the tax and spending question with the overall state of the economy.' More broadly, once his new shadow cabinet is in place, Mr Blair will give priority to producing a number of statements on key policy areas to give clarity to the change in the party's direction in Blackpool. But he has ruled out producing a further set of detailed policy documents in favour of 'crisp' and concise statements reflecting Labour's position on the 'policies that matter'.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Arts: King Lear - Barbican Theatre I have never liked King Lear. The rage is out of all proportion to the reason. And while only a fool - a germane character in Lear - would deny that there are great things in it, the play does not hang together as a whole. However, I am aware that this is a minority opinion. Some people, whose views I respect, think that is one of the greatest plays that has been written. Almost any production is likely to offer new thoughts on it. The Royal Shakespeare Company's production at the Barbican, directed by Nicholas Hytner, is no exception. At first, it confirms one's own strongest prejudices. It begins as a domestic drama. As in the same company's production of Marlowe's Edward II, there is little to suggest the majesty of a king. The characters quarrel about the number of retainers who can stay under one roof. When King Lear goes out into the storm, one is reminded of the Englishman's infatuation with talking about the weather. He must have seen rain before, even as a king. On the other hand, the second part is deeply moving. One of the keys to the production is Linus Roache's Edgar, who has already emerged at the start as an actor with staying power. He guides Lear through from mediocrity to greatness. For Lear, played by John Wood, is a pretty nondescript monarch at the beginning. As he gives up his kingdom, he scarcely stands out from the rest of his court. Gloucester, too, is not much of a man until he has his eyes put out. Yet in the second part some of it comes together. Lear ages dramatically, and with age come dignity and feeling. Gloucester develops as well. The great stage at the Barbican takes on dimensions that were concealed when Lear was in power. What you see now is the power of emptiness, as Gloucester seeks to throw himself off the cliff and Lear wanders about. It is as though the cliffs of Dover were the edge of the world. Edgar, disguised as a madman, maintains sanity. It is a pity, in a way, that we have to come back to the plot. The production, again like that of Edward II, plays up the sex for all that it is not worth. There is not much to said for Goneril and Regan: for all their difference in hair-style, it is hard to tell them apart. They simply lust after Edmund, who belongs to the unsatisfactory sub-plot. Cordelia is a cypher. But, for a while, you have seen the full majesty of King Lear, the play. At the last, John Wood rises to it magnificently. In one other respect, the Edward II production comes to mind. It is astonishing that the RSC can dress some performances, like Much Ado, so well, yet others as if the costumes had come from a jumble sale. Someone could perform a service by taking them off to Oxfam, and starting again. Perhaps one of the City livery companies would help.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Soviet search ship photographed the hulk of a nuclear-powered submarine that  sank off Norway on April 7 with the loss of 42 crew members and found no  increase in radiation in the area, the Tass news agency said. The Soviet  research ship Akademik Mstislav Keldysh arrived May 16 in the waters where the  sub -- armed with nuclear-tipped torpedoes -- sank. It visually detected the  wreck with the help of deep-sea exploration vehicles it carries and  photographed it, Tass said.  </P></p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government relents on export cover THE Government yesterday bowed to business pressure by increasing the insurance cover it offers to exporters. Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said 'transitional' reinsurance support provided to export insurers by the government's Export Credits Guarantee Department would be extended by at least three years. The facility - introduced when the ECGD's short-term export credit insurance business was privatised in 1991 - was to be phased out at the end of next year, threatening more than Pounds 1bn in exports annually. 'We are not going to be in a position where British exporters are going to fail to get business because of a lack of cover,' declared Mr Needham, who said that he had responded to representations made to him. Details of how the reinsurance scheme will work have yet to be thrashed out, but exporters and their insurers have welcomed the move. 'This is good news,' said Mr Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export. 'We have to export our way out of the recession. This kind of support is very helpful.' 'The decision to extend the transitional reinsurance facility will greatly assist British exporters to make long-term and strategic business plans,' said Mr Colin Foxall, managing director of NCM Credit Insurance, the country's biggest export credit insurer. 'It takes a lot of the uncertainty away for British exporters,' added Mr Terry Bridgman, director of Trade Indemnity, the credit insurer, which along with other smaller players in the market will benefit from government reinsurance support for the first time. NCM controls about 80 per cent of the market for short-term export credit insurance. TI has about 15 per cent. When it privatised ECGD's short-term business in December 1991, the government had hoped there would be sufficient reinsurance capacity available in the private sector. However, a sharp contraction in the reinsurance market has since occurred and exports have risen. 'It has become clear that in the immediate future capacity in the private reinsurance market may well not expand sufficiently to meet the likely demand for short term export credit insurance,' said Mr Needham.</p>

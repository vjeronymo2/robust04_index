			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Fedor Angeliy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], 2 Apr -- A CSCE mission  believes that if the Republic of Moldova wants to move forward  in the cause of unity, then it is in its own interests that it  should build a reputation as a state committed to tolerance and  bilingualism. Today, the CSCE mission published its report on  the language problem in Moldova in the republic's press.    The document notes that the questions of whether to call its  official language Moldovan or Romanian, and whether to use the  Latin or the Cyrillic script lies within Moldova's jurisdiction.  Moldova is to a large extent a bilingual country. It would,  therefore, be both a pragmatic step and a magnanimous gesture if  Russian were made the other official language alongside  Romanian, the document says.    CSCE experts believe that it was pragmatism that prompted  the  Moldovan Parliament to give Russian the status of the language  of interethnic communication. They believe that making  provisions for the use of the official language and the language  of interethnic communication throughout Moldova is quite  sufficient to guarantee the rights of the Russian speakers.</p>

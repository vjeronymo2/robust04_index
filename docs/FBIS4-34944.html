			<p>BFN     [Text] (TELAM) -- Yesterday, President Carlos Menem said  the person who will make the decision of postponing the deadline  for choosing a pensions system "is the president of the  Republic." The president characterized the results of his  meetings in Canada and the United States as "very good." Upon  returning to the country, he said: "The decision for Argentina  to join NAFTA has practically been made," but "everything  depends on the invitation."    Menem said his meeting with Bill Clinton was "very  important," characterizing his meeting with former President  George Bush as "very friendly and informal."    Menem said that pressure from the United States for the  approval of a patents law will decrease in the near future.  Menem said the government "will insist" that ruling party  legislators approve the draft bill that it will submit to  Congress soon.    The Tango 01 plane that brought the president back to the  country landed at 0630 at the military section of the  metropolitan airport. Travelling with Menem were, among others,  his daughter Zulema, Military Household Chief Jorge Rearte, and  Media Secretary Raul Burzaco.    During a brief news conference, Menem said: "A decision for  Argentina to join NAFTA has practically been made," but  "everything depends on the requirements or the invitation."  <H5>  Haiti </H5>   Menem reaffirmed that Argentina will contribute to the  political and economic embargo against Haiti, and that the  country will send more troops to the area "if they are required  for maintaining the peace." Menem added: "Congress will have to  approve the decision" if Argentina is required to participate in  an attempt to reinstate democracy in the Caribbean state through  armed intervention or an invasion.  <H5>  Patents </H5>   Menem said that "pressure" to approve a pharmaceutical  patents law "will decrease in the near future." The president  added: "The situation created by the U.S. demands has been  practically overcome" following his meeting with Clinton. "In  the future, the dialogue will be more fluid, and we will insist  that legislators pass the draft bill with the amendments we will  submit at the appropriate time," Menem said.  <H5>  Postponement </H5>   Menem said: "The economy and labor ministers only gave their  opinions" on the issue of postponing the deadline for choosing a  pensions system, adding that it was an "outrage to move for a  political trial just because they made comments about a bill."    The president stressed that ministers made an "assessment"  of  people who might be temporarily incorporated into the Retirement  and Pension Fund Managing Companies if by the end of the month  they have not chosen a system, adding that ministers have not  decided anything because "the person who will decide on the  matter is the president of the Republic." "I do not think a  minister can be tried in Congress just because he gave his  opinion on a draft bill that has not been approved yet," Menem  said.</p>

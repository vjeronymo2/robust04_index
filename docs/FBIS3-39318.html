			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by "Federal Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt to </F> representatives of French business and administrative circles in  Paris on 3 February"]    [Text]  <H3>  I. I was very pleased to be invited to speak to you here in  Paris. </H3>   A close dialogue between the French and the Germans is  essential, especially now, when Europe faces serious economic  problems. In the second half of 1994 and in the first half of  1995, Germany and France will chair the European Council. That  underscores the necessity of close cooperation.    Last year, especially in connection with the GATT  negotiations, much of the media reported discord in the  Franco-German relationship; there was even speculation about a  possible rupture.    In all these reports, however, too little attention was paid  to the fact that the successful conclusion of the GATT  negotiations was only possible because in the end Franco-German  cooperation functioned once more. The breakthrough on critical  issues only came about because there was agreement between Paris  and Bonn.    There are, of course, differences on certain topics and, of  course, different interests. That was always the case, and that  will also be the case in the future. What is decisive is that  despite these differences, the Germans and the French are both  on the same track and are pushing in the same direction.    It is important that we reached a compromise on the GATT  negotiations. The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round is  a positive signal to the world economy, one that we need  urgently. I personally am pleased that German's support for  French interests in the Uruguay Round has also received  recognition here.  <H3>  II. France and Germany are gradually emerging from a  serious recession, but we will nevertheless be confronted with  high unemployment over a long period of time. That is because  the current level of unemployment is not only a consequence of  the recession, but is also to a significant degree of a  structural nature. Both our countries must address this  structural change. </H3>   To some extent, Germany and France differ in their strengths  and weaknesses; in Germany, for example, medium-sized companies  perform a more significant role in innovation and employment  than in France.    Both our countries are equally affected by the fact that  they  will have to deal with changes in the world economy. Other  countries, especially in Asia and Central and East Europe, have  become more competitive over the past few years. The  globalization of markets and increasing economic integration  have also made competition over industrial locations even  fiercer.    Both our countries still lack pioneering companies that are  at the forefront in the development of new technologies.  Production costs must be kept under control in both countries.  It also seems to me that there is a danger in both our  countries of excessive regulation within society and the economy.    Of course, other European countries have similar problems.  However, I consider it important that France and Germany develop  stimuli to surmount these problems. Thus, we must see to it  that our businessmen do not "vote with their feet" and look for  other locations.    This leads us to reflect on the principles of the social  market economy and improve conditions for more employment in  Germany. The Federal Government report on securing Germany's  future as an industrial location, which was drawn up by my  ministry, contains an appropriate strategy.    A number of steps have already been taken:     -  We have  reduced the taxation of revenues derived from commercial  activity to bring it into line with the much lower international  level;    -  Procedures for obtaining permits in the construction and  transportation sectors have been greatly simplified;    -  It has been  decided to proceed with a reform of the German railroad  network;    -  It is hoped that the same will also shortly apply to  the second part of the reform of the postal service, which will  involve transforming German Telekom, the postal service, and the  postal service bank into joint stock companies, and present  monopolies will only be retained for a limited period of time.    The action program for more growth and unemployment, which  was approved by the Federal Government last week, will serve as  a basis for the implementation of further measures over the next  few months. The following points are of particular importance:  the continued consolidation of the budget and the introduction  of more flexibility into the labor market.    For both our countries, it is particularly important that we  pursue the consolidation of public budgets vigorously. That is  the only way in which investors and consumers can recover  confidence in the future. That, in conjunction with a moderate  wage policy on the part of partners to collective agreements, is  a precondition for granting our central banks more room for  maneuver with respect to reducing interest rates.    The consolidation of public budgets must be attained through  strict discipline with regard to expenditure. This means that  we have to refrain from pursuing public programs involving  considerable expenditure. Only by exercising strict discipline  with regard to expenditure will we be able to create more leeway  for lowering taxation, especially for companies and people on  low incomes.    This means that we also have to introduce changes to our  social welfare system. In Germany, such expenditure amounts to  about 1 trillion German marks, that is, about one-third of the  national product.    This ultimately means that we need administrative reform in  our countries. In other words, we should not only talk of "lean  production" in industry, but also achieve a "lean  administration." We will only accomplish this by simplifying  administrative and permit procedures and reviewing the great  number of legal regulations.    We are also in the process of making the labor market more  flexible. An important step in this regard is the separation of  working hours from machine operating hours. We are making  appropriate adjustments to labor law; we should also consider  whether the regulations concerning labor law that have been  approved in Brussels are flexible enough and take account of  modern requirements.    The public monopoly on employment agencies will be  disbanded,  and it will not be possible for commercial companies to be  active in finding jobs.    We will also start an offensive aimed at creating more  part-time jobs. The demand for part-time work has been far from  satisfied, and there is great potential for employment in this  area.    The redistribution of the employment that is available and  reductions in working hours are frequently cited as a recipe for  overcoming unemployment. I do not see such measures providing a  long-term solution. Reductions in working hours, even if they  are combined with a corresponding reduction in wages, can only  provide an interim solution that gives companies a necessary  breathing space.    There can only be an incentive for more employment if better  use is made of employment potential and if we introduce more  flexibility into working conditions. This imposes demands on  the partners to collective agreements above all. The corset of  collective agreement provisions is too rigid and inflexible for  today's circumstances.    What is needed today is more flexibility, more personal  responsibility, and more participation in decisionmaking in the  workplace. This means, for example, a differentiated approach  to wage policy solutions that will vary according to region,  branch of industry, and individual companies; more consideration  should also be given to wage components based on company  earnings.    Policy on collective agreements should prove itself,  especially in difficult times. There have been promising ideas,  in, for example, the chemicals industry.  <H3>  III. At the end of 1993, Brussels came up with initiatives  for overcoming structural and growth-related weaknesses in  Europe. I welcome the Commission white book and action plan.  Many of the contents accord with those in our Federal  Government report; that is particularly true of the suggestions  for a new direction in wage policy and more flexibility. </H3>   The question of finance has to be dealt with before the  program for creating trans-European networks can be implemented.  It should be financed within the framework of existing  instruments, because finance in the form of a loan through the  EU budget is not compatible with the necessary reduction in  national budget deficits. We cannot do what we consider wrong at  the national level in Brussels, namely, increase the level of  public debt.  <H3>  IV. What can France and Germany do jointly in the current  situation: How can they support each other in overcoming  economic weaknesses? </H3>   I believe that there are three key areas in which we should  pursue action:     -  First, economic cooperation between our two  countries must be intensified;    -  Second, both our countries must  jointly promote European integration;    -  Third, both our countries  must work together to expand the multilateral system of trade.    The first point: Economic cooperation between our two  countries must be intensified. France and Germany are very  closely linked to one another economically; we are each other's  most important trading partners. Airbus is a model example of  Franco-German cooperation that functions well, cooperation that  has involved the participation of other European partners.    At this point, I would like to thank French companies for  their involvement in the new laender. French companies are  among the first. In Trust Agency figures, they occupy first  place, both in terms of investment promises -- over 5.4 billion  German marks -- and promises regarding the number of jobs that  will be safeguarded -- over 25,000. What matters now is that  these promises are carried out reliably.    Despite these close links, problems regularly arise in our  cooperation; in addition, difficult economic circumstances  result in an increased tendency toward the adoption of national  solutions. Close and good cooperation is all the more important  in times such as these.    Cooperation between companies is something that companies  themselves must decide about; it is not a matter for the  government to decide about. What we can tell companies is that  we welcome such cooperation.    Frequently, the problems encountered in cooperation are the  product of misunderstandings, because the economic systems in  our two countries are based on different traditions and  experiences. It is true that France places more emphasis on the  participation of the state, whereas we give the marketplace and  competition a greater say in determining production and demand.    We proceed from the assumption that the state and society  cannot predict the future, let alone determine the future: I  think that Hajek was right when he talked of the  presumptuousness of knowledge in this regard. That is why we  find the marketplace process of searching so important in  finding the right path and preventing us from concentrating  excessively on the supposed "only solution."    That is because we must often acknowledge that there is no  one correct path, but that our strength stems from the diversity  of ideas and from competition between different ideas. That is  why I attach so much importance to the subsidiarity principle,  which promotes diversity.    I can see that in this respect the French and German  positions are close to each other. The best example is the  privatization of nationalized companies in France.    The problems that we still encounter in understanding each  other can be disposed of if we talk to each other openly and if  we intensify contacts by, for example, actively exchanging  officials and through closer cooperation between companies.    Something that is very helpful is the work of the  Franco-German Working Party for Promoting Competitiveness, which  is led by ex-Minister Fauroux and Secretary of State Eekhoff of  my ministry.    There is also a special working party for the  telecommunications field now. It is to deal with bilateral  problems in the telecommunications field; they include the  include the financing of research and development and employment  policy issues above all. In addition, the working party is also  to examine opportunities for closer cooperation against the  background of the plans for cooperation between France Telecom  and Germany's Telekom.  <H3>  V. The second key area for action: Both our countries must  work jointly to promote European integration; they must fulfill  their traditional role of being the engine of European union: </H3>   a. France and Germany must work together to prepare the path  leading to economic and monetary union.    Economic and monetary union is an essential political goal:  It will yield trade and competitive advantages and will have a  stabilizing effect on the global monetary system.    The tensions in the European Monetary System were a  reflection of economic policy disparities in member countries.  Incorrect exchange rates were adhered to for too long and that  upset currency markets.    For that reason, at the end of June, France and Germany  jointly put forward an initiative for expanding margins of  movement within the European Monetary System; the initiative  proved to be correct. Not only has speculation subsided, but  almost all the currencies participating in the monetary  mechanism have returned to their old margins.    In addition, with the convergence programs that they  proposed  jointly, France and Germany have sent the right signals to  indicate that more of an effort has to be made to promote  economic policy convergence among member-states. For the  Federal Government, the strict convergence criteria and the  independence of the European central bank constitute the  cornerstone of economic and currency union; that is something  that we should not doubt.    We are pleased that France has accorded the Banque de France  independence so resolutely and quickly. The international  financial markets have rewarded that: The current yield on  long-term bonds in France is even below that of comparable rates  in Germany, but short-term interest rates are still somewhat  higher.    The decision to base the European central bank in  Frankfurt/Main is a great sign of confidence in our monetary  policy, the goal of which is stability. I wish to express  thanks for French support.    b) France and Germany must work together to make the  community introduce a comprehensive initiative for deregulation  and reductions in bureaucracy. That also accords with the  intentions of the white book.    There is much in European guidelines and directives that is  too detailed, and there are some things that are superfluous.  There are many things that should be left to member-states, if  only in keeping with the subsidiarity principle; that also  applies to the administrative implementation of community  legislation.    In addition, we require a review of much community  legislation to establish those areas in which there are  excessive restrictions on private initiative and in which the  costs borne by citizens and companies are too high. I am  thinking of, for example, the detailed regulations on product  safety, the guidelines on liability in the provision of  services, the energy consumption guidelines, as well the  obligations to provide statistical data, which are formulated in  a perfectionist manner. Moreover, not all that is desirable can  be justified in economic terms.    The principle of mutual recognition is an appropriate  instrument for guaranteeing the free movement of goods and  services in a way that takes account of the subsidiarity  principle. This has been evolved by the European Court over  many years of rulings and has already been reflected in numerous  pieces of legislation.    c) France and Germany must promote institutional reform  within the European Union. The expansion of the union makes  this issue all the more pressing.    The governmental conference that is planned for 1996 must be  used to find suitable solutions. The conference should  contribute to reducing the lack of democracy within the  community. The further along the path of integration we find  ourselves, the more important it becomes that the European  Parliament should exercise effective democratic control over the  community.    d) France and Germany should also work to ensure that the  reformist states of Central and East Europe board the "European  boat." The reformist states are destined to be successful; the  opportunities for achieving a transformation can only be  realized if we cooperate successfully.    Our slogan must be "trade instead of assistance." We should  not view the reformist states solely as rival industrial  locations, but as new, expanding markets right next door to us.  Sales and investment in those countries can also strengthen our  own competitiveness.    The Federal Government supports the gradual admission of  Central and East Europe into the European Union. We should not  abandon these countries.    The first step has already been taken. By opening up the  community for goods from the reformist countries, an opportunity  has been created for these countries to integrate with the world  economy. I support the conclusion of partnership and  cooperation treaties with the CIS states and the conclusion of a  free trade treaty with the Baltic states.    In addition, we should not depart from the slogan "trade  instead of assistance" in those areas in which the reformist  states could greatly increase exports at the present time,  although there is overcapacity in the European Union in those  very areas. Sensitive areas in particular will show how serious  we are about integration, even if it is not possible to open up  the market in every field immediately.    We cannot continually solve the problems that we are  experiencing as a result of structural change at the expense of  countries that we ourselves are calling on to institute  fundamental structural changes, irrespective of the fact that a  policy of closing off markets would be very short-sighted.  <H3>  VI. The third key area of action: France and Germany must  continue to work together to promote the further development of  a liberal, multilateral system of world trade. </H3>   Even if our countries' interests differ in certain areas, as  countries that export, we both need open markets all over the  world. For this reason, regional cooperation should not be  allowed to undermine multilateral trade.    A multilateral system of trade is also the essential overall  framework for regional associations. We will see to it that the  associations recently formed in the Pacific Basin and North  America will also observe the principles of open, multilateral  trade.    We, for our part, must also ensure that the European Union  remains an open free market economy in which there is free  competition in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty. That is  why the Federal Government opposed "upgrading" the European  Union's trade policy instruments by reversing majority  requirements.    Germany and France differed in their positions on this. We  also managed to achieve a compromise in this area: A simple  majority on the European Council will be sufficient for the  introduction of antidumping and compensatory tariffs.    The commission has not, however, been granted new powers.  This should not happen as long as the community's democratic  base has not been strengthened.    France and Germany must also look at the new issues that  have  arisen in the global economy jointly. In view of cross-border  investment and the worldwide activities of global players, the  multilateral system of world trade must also be complemented by  the introduction of international guidelines on competition.    The issue of "trade and the environment" must also be  addressed. The protection of the environment is to a large  extent a global problem that can only be solved through a global  approach.    Ladies and Gentlemen, you can see that the agenda for  Franco-German cooperation is extensive. I am convinced that  there is much that we can accomplish together.    We can jointly initiate the right steps leading to new  growth  in Europe and the world. We should make that our task.</p>

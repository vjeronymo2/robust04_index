			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Stronger pound may have the shine taken off it / Assessing why sterling has been climbing THE pound is no longer the sickly weakling of nine months ago. But talk of it entering a new phase of upswing against other important currencies is probably overdone. Helped by the Bundesbank's cut in interest rates and a Treasury statement signalling no immediate easing in UK monetary policy, the pound yesterday consolidated its recent good run against the D-Mark. Last night sterling closed in London up 1 3/4 pfennigs on the day at DM2.5625, its highest level since last September's devaluation. Because of a less robust performance against other currencies, notably the dollar and yen, the pound has looked slightly less perky when measured by the Bank of England's trade-weighted index. It closed last night on this index at 80.9, slightly below its best level this year about two months ago, but comfortably up on its historic low of 75.7 in February. An important aspect which will almost certainly restrain the pound's rise is that any further strengthening would go down badly with manufacturers. They are flavour of the month at the Treasury in the light of comments by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that he wants to make the department more sympathetic to industry. Echoing the concerns of big manufacturers that any new increase in the pound's value would reduce the competitiveness of UK goods and choke off encouraging signs of export growth, Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, said he 'views with concern' the general drift upward by sterling. As a result of such sentiments and acting in concert with the Treasury, the Bank of England has in recent weeks discreetly sold sterling both to reduce its value and boost its heavily depleted foreign currency reserves. But sterling's upward movement has been unmistakable. The reasons include: Better growth prospects this year for Britain than for most European countries. Strong buying by Japanese institutional investors, many of which, especially given the high recent value of the yen, view the pound as cheap. The weakness of the D-Mark, resulting from concern about the fragile state of the German economy and speculation about cuts in German interest rates - duly served up yesterday. Heavy purchases in the past month by overseas institutions of gilt-edged securities which, notwithstanding the relative lack of success of this week's big gilts auction, have helped to push up the pound. Mr Clarke's ruling out of cuts in base rates in the near term unless the economy shows a sudden slide. Many City economists believe sterling is unlikely to rise above DM2.6 by the end of the summer. Also the pound may find it hard to sustain its rise yesterday against the dollar, which was sparked mainly by a US report indicating doubts about the strength of US industrial growth. Sterling was quoted last night in London at Dollars 1.5085, up 1 1/2 cents. Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at Citibank in London, said there were still 'some pitfalls' ahead for the UK economy which might constrain sterling. He was sceptical about the note of euphoria which has crept into discussion about the pound, pointing out that growth in consumer spending might be extremely fragile. Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London, said Mr Clarke might ease monetary policy if sterling's growth made life more difficult for manufacturers. 'The perception that Mr Clarke is more growth orientated than his predecessor has boosted market feeling that interest rates might be cut if sterling surged.' Mr George Magnus, economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the weakness of the D-Mark might soon pass. Any strengthening in the German currency would take some of the shine off sterling.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> PAPANDREOU, LIANI TO WED THURSDAY  </P> <P> Defeated Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, 70, plans to marry his  mistress, 34-year-old airline hostess Dimitra Liani, Thursday but a series of  political scandals will block any honeymoon plans.  </P> <P> The socialist politician, whose three-year affair caused constant headlines, is  a target of criminal investigation into multimillion-dollar scandals that  helped cause his crushing electoral defeat in June.  </P> <P> The low-key marriage has been hailed by Greek newspapers as a major social  event, comparable to the 1968 wedding of Jacqueline Kennedy to shipping magnate  Aristotle Onassis. Newspapers say Papandreou, who could face prosecution in  scandals that include embezzlement from a major bank, will wed Liani in a small  church near their luxury villa in the Athens suburb of Ekali. None of  Papandreou's four children from his marriage to American Margaret Chant are  expected to attend.  </P></p>

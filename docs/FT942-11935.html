			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (3): Success story needed - A fresh attempt at privatisation is planned Reformers are hoping that this summer's planned public offer of up to 10 state companies will re-launch Romania's privatisation programme which last year ground to a halt after becoming the focus of political battles between reformers and conservatives. 'We hope to involve as many people as possible in the public offer and to create a critical mass behind privatisation after a year of inactivity,' says Mr Adrian Nitu, vice-president of the Private Ownership Fund (POF) in the western Banat-Crisana region, one of six funds which own and manage the 6,300 companies earmarked for privatisation under a 1991 law. 'We've deliberately chosen very attractive firms - our first choice is a furniture company - as we badly need to give the public a privatisation success story.' If the offer goes ahead, Romanians will, for the first time, be able to exchange privatisation vouchers - distributed free to all adults in 1992 - for shares in state companies. The vouchers, or Certificates of Ownership, represent the population's 30 per cent share in the 6,300 companies and are held by five regionally-based POFs. The state's remaining 70 per cent is held by the State Ownership Fund (SOF) in Bucharest. The aim is to follow up the public offer with the launching of a stock exchange later this year. A securities commission has already been set up, under the aegis of the finance ministry, while in March, parliament finally began to discuss the securities law, drawn up with Canadian help in 1992. The public offer and stock exchange projects are among the first joint projects in which all bodies involved in privatisation - namely the six funds, the government's economic reform council and its co-ordinating body the National Agency for Privatisation - have co-operated. Relations between the different groups were tense last year, partly due to the appointment of Mr Emil Dima, a conservative senator in the ruling Social Democracy party, as president of the SOF. Under Mr Dima, the SOF last year pursued management and or employee buy-outs as the main method of privatisation, invested privatisation proceeds in decapitalised, loss-making state companies, sat on plans to close down or restructure large, highly unprofitable enterprises blacklisted by the government, appointed party loyalists to company boards and management, and refused to decentralise power to the POFs as provided for under the privatisation law. The result was that just 250 mainly small companies were privatised, well short of the initial target of 800-1,000; the rate of foreign investment in Romania dropped and, in 15 months, the SOF went through three general managers who were either sacked by Mr Dima or were unable to get along with him. However, since the appointment of Mr Constantin Dumitru in February, the situation has improved. Mr Dumitru, 54, a communist-era deputy minister of machine-building, appears determined to make the privatisation scheme work and to have more political clout than his predecessors. He is co-operating closely with the POFs on the public offer and has worked out a draft mandate giving the five funds the right to negotiate sales of 100 per cent of companies on behalf of the SOF. He has also signed an agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development under which the bank will analyse 25-30 medium-sized companies, short-list 10-12 and appoint a western merchant bank to find foreign buyers for them. Mr Nitu of the Banat-Crisana POF, however, fears privatisation will remain highly politicised. He says the POFs' recently-appointed new boards, are 'small parliaments', representing a cross-section of the political spectrum. He points out that Mr Dima remains head of the SOF, even though asked on several occasions by the government and reportedly also by President Ion Iliescu to make a choice between being a senator and SOF president. He is also concerned by plans to extend the MEBO methodology to medium-sized and large companies. The fear is this will enable the former communist nomenklatura at the head of state companies to retain control of much of the economy. Mr Dumitru says unco-operative managers are one of the biggest obstacles to privatisation. There are also many corruption cases involving company officials. Typical frauds include managers or their friends and family setting up private trading companies to handle a state company's inputs and output. Huge profits can be made by overcharging the state company for its raw materials and underpaying for its goods. Analysts fear such companies account for a not insignificant part of Romania's emerging private sector which, in just four years, has risen from nearly zero to contribute 25-30 per cent of GDP, 55 per cent of retail sales and 30 per cent of foreign trade. The private sector already employs more than a quarter of the 10.5m workforce - mainly in agriculture - and comprises more than half a million companies or registered entrepreneurs and family associations. Many private companies, however, have now accumulated enough capital from trade to move into production or services. Mr Mike Hicks, deputy head of the EBRD's Bucharest office, says that in the past two years the bank has looked at private sector projects in, for example, ceramics, glass, wood, furniture, bakeries, mineral water bottling, yoghurt-making, tourism, construction, computer software, plastics and textiles. Outside the capital, the private sector is most active in Transylvania, Romania's ethnically-mixed western province, and in Constanta, the Black Sea port and tourist region. Mr Hicks says: 'Romanians are natural entrepreneurs. . . Good people are moving from the state sector into private business. The private sector has its own dynamic - there is definitely an impetus building up.' However, many private sector projects are too small for direct EBRD participation. The bank has therefore opened credit lines at local banks for lending to small and medium-sized companies and for projects in agriculture. It has also taken equity stakes in three new local banks which concentrate on private sector lending. These include the Ion Tiriac Bank, set up by the Romanian-born tennis star, and a joint venture with Wasserstein Perella, the US boutique bank. But private entrepreneurs say high taxes, prohibitive interest rates and limited access to credits are starving them of capital for medium or long-term investments. Corporate and income tax rates are 45 per cent and up to 60 per cent respectively, while in the autumn, lending rates soared to 180 per cent at the central bank's weekly credit auction. The move was an emergency measure to bring down 300 per cent annual inflation but it forced many small, private businesses to shelve investment plans. The hope is that in 1994 a more stable macro-economy and greater efforts to privatise or restructure loss-making state companies will free more resources for private business.</p>

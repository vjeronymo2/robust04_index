			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: LAST PLACES: A JOURNEY TO THE NORTH BY LAWRENCE MILLMAN  (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $18.95; 242 PP.)  </P> <P> Lawrence Millman recounts his adventures as he traveled the old Viking route  across the North Atlantic from Norway to Newfoundland. Setting out from Bergen,  he passed through the Shetland Islands, the Faroes, set in at Iceland,  Greenland and Labrador, finally arriving in Newfoundland.  </P> <P> Probably much like the Vikings, Millman strayed from his path whenever he  sniffed a good story. A whale hunt in the Faroes is too much for him to resist.  There are the inevitable dangers of primitive travel; On one expedition,  Millman loses his way in an Icelandic lava field. He includes also the  descriptions of curious native customs so indispensable to travel writing: In  an Eskimo village, Millman mortally offends his host by refusing to sleep with  the hostess. Along the way, Millman collects myths and folktales from the  people he visits, which, interspersed with his descriptions of land that has  remained unchanged for eons, lend his narrative a quality of suspension in  time.  </P> <P> In addition to tales of traditional life, Millman regales the reader with his  experiences of modern Nordic life. Recuperating in a Reykjavik Salvation Army  hostel from a particularly strenuous adventure, Millman finds himself the  center of a literary controversy during a weekend of heavy drinking. One  Icelander professes his boozy love for the English language on account of three  writers -- Shakespeare, Poe and Ray Bradbury -- and immediately begins slurring  a quote from Henry V: "Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of  Iceland." This escalates into full-scale warfare when another drinking  companion defends the honor of the poet Tomas Gudmundsson against all comers.  In this highly entertaining account, Millman makes the frozen North seem to  burst with life and color.  </P></p>

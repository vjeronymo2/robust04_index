			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Mikhail Voronenkov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb -- The Russian Federation's Foreign  Ministry is satisfied with the preliminary results of the  Russian- Ukrainian talks on implementing the results of the  January meeting between the Presidents of Russia, the United  States, and Ukraine. This was said at a briefing today by  Grigoriy Karasin, the director of the Department of Information  and Press of the Russian Foreign Ministry.    At the talks, that took place in Kiev on 8th and 9th  February, a package of documents was agreed between the Russian  Federation and Ukraine on measures to implement the trilateral  Russian-U.S.- Ukrainian accords. The drafts of these documents  will be presented for examination by the Russian Federation  leaders and Ukraine.    "There are good grounds to suppose," Grigoriy Karasin  stressed, "that after the documents are examined and confirmed  by the leadership of Russia and Ukraine, they can become an  undoubted benefit for both states and for the whole of the  international community."    Russia's state delegation at the talks on 8th and 9th  February in Kiev was headed by Yuriy Dubinin, roving ambassador  of the Russian Foreign Ministry. The Ukrainian delegation was  headed by Valeriy Shmarov, deputy prime minister of Ukraine.</p>

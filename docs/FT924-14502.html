			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firm on chancellor's speech THE UK stock market gave a relatively favourable response to the keenly awaited exposition of the government's economic strategy from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. While his speech to the Conservative party conference damped down expectations of an immediate base rate cut which had spurred shares ahead early in the session, the stock market had decided by the close that lower rates are still in prospect before the year-end. The FT-SE Index bounced convincingly above the 2,530 hurdle, touching 2,547.3 ahead of first reports of the chancellor's speech. Suggestions of an immediate cut in UK base rates were sparked off by the announcement that the Treasury planned a statement, but the driving force behind equities was the sharp recovery in the pound against the DM, which was encouraged by the Bundesbank's apparent softening of emphasis on some money supply targets. Hopes of a cut in German interest rates strengthened in London. As first reports of the chancellor's speech reached the City of London, sterling came off quite sharply and equities also reacted to the absence of any immediate developments on interest rates. The gain on the Footsie was trimmed from 30.2 to 17.1 but selling was moderate and traders recovered their confidence as they watched Mr Lamont's speech on their television screens. By the close, the market had climbed to a final reading on the Footsie of 2,538.8, for a gain of 21.7 on the day. The Footsie has now recovered all but 11 points of Monday's dramatic 103 point loss, and equity chart strategists believe it could be set for an advance to the 2,790 area, especially if interest rates are reduced in the UK and in Germany. Seaq volume of 517.6m shares yesterday compared with Wednesday's 545m, worth Pounds 1.1bn in retail business, a welcome return to the business levels seen after Britain's exit from the ERM in mid-September. Also heartening for the stock market was the continued flow of corporate activity, some actual and some merely rumoured. Hints of international bid interest took brewery stocks ahead and a substantial share placing in the insurance sector again demonstrated the appetite of the institutions for good quality stocks. Firmness in the US currency against sterling continued to boost the dollar earning stocks. US interest was again reported among the pharmaceuticals, where Glaxo and Wellcome extended recent gains. UK institutions have been sellers of the big drug stocks over the past month but sector analysts in the UK now believe that prices will recover strongly on the back of demand from across the Atlantic. Gains in the interest-related stocks were fairly modest, however, and investors appeared to be slightly disappointed by the absence from Mr Lamont's speech of a target range for sterling. The progress of the pound on currency markets is still the key factor in the timing of further reductions in UK interest rates.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Aerolineas sell-off collapses ARGENTINA has partially re-nationalised its flag carrier, Aerolneas Argentinas, 21 months after it sold the company to a group of local and Spanish investors led by Iberia, Spain's national airline. The collapse of Argentina's first big privatisation is a blow to the government's ambitious programme, under which it plans to sell nearly all its state companies by December. The government was forced to raise its holding in Aerolneas to 33 per cent from 5 per cent because local minority investors were unable to inject fresh funds into the loss-making company. However, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said Iberia would continue managing the airline. He said the state hoped to sell its Aerolneas shares as soon as is advisable. Iberia's 30 per cent holding, the 19 per cent held by Spanish banks, and the 10 per cent owned by the employees remains unaltered. The government raised its stake at the expense of the minority Argentine investors, whose holdings have fallen to 8 per cent. It will not pay for the shares. Instead, the government cancelled Dollars 21.7m in debts still owed to it by the buyers. It is expected to subscribe over Dollars 145m worth of new shares during the year. The re-nationalisation of Aerolneas is the latest chapter in a saga of disputes between the government and the airline's new owners, and between the consortium that began even before the ink had dried on the sale contract. The disputes arose from the inability of the under-capitalised Argentine investors to finance the loss-making company. The government and the operators also argued over the terms and price to be paid for the company. According to its initial financial accounts, Aerolneas lost Dollars 25.8m in its first seven months under Iberia's management. The government has agreed to Iberia's request to review a mandatory Dollars 684m, five-year investment programme.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rates stay firm THE JUMP in the value of sterling overnight fuelled early speculation of a cut in base rates, although that enthusiasm was later dampened. This was the chief factor in an otherwise quiet day of money market dealing. The June short sterling contract opened higher at 89.84, having closed the previous evening at 89.78. However, it ended the day unchanged on the previous night's figure, indicating an implied interest rate of 10.22 per cent. The three-month Interbank rate, a key indicator of future base rate movements stood at 10 1/2 - 7/16 per cent. Overnight rates trod a similar course, peaking at 11 1/2 per cent before finishing the day at 10 7/8 per cent. The main reason for that rise was the larger than expected liquidity shortage forecast by the Bank of England in the discount money market. The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 1.3bn shortfall, some Pounds 500m bigger than many in the market had been expecting. One dealer said: 'We were slightly taken aback by the size of the shortage. A lot of bills were sold last week to pay for gilt sales and people are short of the sort of paper that they want to sell.' The shortage was later revised to Pounds 1.15bn. In early operations the Bank of England found takers for a mere Pounds 100m of a 15-day repurchase agreement at an interest rate of 10 7/16 per cent. Later, the bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 56m sterling, of which Pounds 26m were outright band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, and Pounds 30m for resale to the market on May 11 at an interest rate of 10 7/16 per cent. In afternoon trading the bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 725m and provided further assistance of Pounds 25m. German call money rose after the Bundesbank drained liquidity with this week's repurchase tender, but experts did not see the rise as a sign of tighter policy ahead of Thursday's central bank council meeting. Money market dealers quoted call money at 9.70 per cent after Tuesday's 9.65/70 per cent. Dealers and economists saw the Bundesbank making no policy changes, but expected it to keep call money very close to the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate while waiting for signs of a slowdown in money supply growth and Bonn government spending.</p>

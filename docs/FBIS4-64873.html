			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aurora Intxausti report: "Arzalluz Warns of People's </F> Party's Scheme To Overthrow Gonzalez and Rough Up His Successor"]    [Text] San Sebastian -- Yesterday Basque Nationalist Party  [PNV] chairman Xabier Arzalluz stated that he was not prepared  to cooperate with the People's Party in the strategy to  overthrow Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. "The People's Party  is aiming to overthrow Gonzalez. It does not want elections  now, it wants Gonzalez to resign and another Socialist to  replace him, so that they can rough him up nicely for a year,  then hold general elections and obtain an absolute majority."  Arzalluz believes that this strategy by the People's Party is  no good for either the Basque or the Catalan nationalists. "It  is no good for the country, nor for us nationalists," he said.    Arzalluz, who met Gonzalez last Wednesday at the Moncloa  palace, stated that the purpose of the meeting had been to  analyze the political situation, and that no agreements or  common plans had been reached. The PNV's leader denied, in this  connection, that Gonzalez had suggested forming a coalition  government including the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers'  Party], the PNV, and CiU [Convergence and Union].    The "lehendakari" Jos Antonio Ardanza explained this aspect  further, stating that no changes had occurred in the last eight  months to warrant the PNV's joining the government.  <H5>  The Confidence Issue </H5>   Contrary to what a number of opposition parties are  requesting, Xabier Arzalluz believes that Felipe Gonzalez need  not submit to a vote of confidence. "I believe Gonzalez does  enjoy people's confidence, because in fact the people have  ratified their trust in him. Technically speaking, it makes no  sense for him to propose a confidence vote; rather, it is the  opposition who must table a no- confidence motion," he stated.  The PNV chairman said he was convinced that the government was  doing everything in its power to arrest the Guardia Civil former  director Luis Roldan, and he believed that the corruption issue  was being used as an easy argument for demagogic purposes.    Despite these supportive statements, the "lehendakari"  confirmed that his party's relations with the PSOE, the central  government, and the socialists had not improved over the last  few months. "Eight months ago -- for the reasons we explained at  the time -- we were not able to reach an understanding, but the  truth is that things have not improved."    "Eight months ago," he added, "we stated that seven years  had  gone by without any new responsibilities being transferred.  Today we can say that very soon eight years will have gone by  and still nothing has changed."    Ardanza then said curtly: "The Socialist government's  situation has not improved either, and these are the objective  data." "Yesterday (Wednesday -- EL PAIS editor's note), seeing  how events were snowballing, I pointed to the urgent need for  the captain of this ship named the Spanish Government to face up  to the situation that has been created," he concluded.</p>

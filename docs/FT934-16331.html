			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Bhutto disputes Sharif's claims: Pakistani rivals both hopeful as election results trickle in THE two main contenders in yesterday's general election in Pakistan, Mr Mohammed Nawaz Sharif and Ms Benazir Bhutto, both claimed victory last night as counting was under way. However, unofficial projections - mostly based on partially completed counts  -gave Mr Sharif, the industrialist from Punjab province, a lead over his bitter rival, the feudal princess from Sind. According to an estimate covering 134 of the 217 seats in the National Assembly, Mr Sharif's Moslem League party was set to win 70 and Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party 47. The other 17 seats in the 134-strong sample were going to Islamic parties and independents. By early today official results had been declared in 65 seats, with the PPP taking 26 and the Moslem League 24, while 15 were won by smaller parties. But Mr Sharif claimed victory on the basis of the unofficial tallies. 'We have won the election,' he told jubilant supporters at his home in Lahore. A Bhutto campaign manager, Shafqat Mahmood, retorted that it was the PPP which was set to form a government but also said that a coalition government appeared likely. Aides to Ms Bhutto, awaiting the outcome at Larkana, in Sind, said privately she seemed depressed by the way results were turning out. The turnout was low, reflecting disenchantment with the bickering between prime ministers, the president and the army which has disrupted politics since the death of the military dictator, Gen Zia ul-Haq, in 1988. Both Ms Bhutto, prime minister in 1988-90, and Mr Sharif, who was forced to resign this summer, were hounded out of office by the military leadership. Pakistanis have been called on to vote three times in the last five years. Only a few violent incidents marred the polls, mostly in the southern city of Karachi where the MQM, a local militant party, boycotted the elections. Elaborate precautions, including supervision by 150,000 troops and monitoring by foreign observers, seemed to have kept cheating to a minimum. Mr Moeen Qureshi, the interim prime minister, declared the election was 'as democratic and as transparent' as polls in any country. Ms Bhutto's party, however, claimed electoral fraud. 'It was clear that some of the presiding officers (at polling stations) were openly subverting the sanctity of the poll to the detriment of the Pakistan People's party,' the PPP said in a letter addressed to the election commission. Mr Qureshi has launched economic reforms and an anti-corruption drive which both Mr Sharif and Ms Bhutto have pledged to support. In one of the final acts of his administration, the State Bank of Pakistan, the central bank, was yesterday made independent.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Telekom to start private cellular arm DEUTSCHE Telekom, the German telecommunications state monopoly, will create a private subsidiary to operate its cellular telephone networks and fight mounting competition in the domestic market, Mr Helmut Ricke, the chief executive announced. The subsidiary, Deutsche Telekom Mobilfunk, will have a basic capital of between DM300m and DM1bn and will start operating in January 1 1994. Sales for the first year are expected to be DM3.5bn (Dollars 2.1bn) and to grow to DM8bn by 2000. The move could pave the way for the group to privatise other divisions, except its traditional telephone services which, according to the national constitution, must be under state administra-tion. The company has been urging the government to push ahead with full privatisation. Talks on the issue reopened last week in Bonn between the ruling coalition parties and the opposition Social Democrats, whose approval is needed to change the constitution. The subsidiary will operate the existing C and D1 cellular telephone networks, which compete with the D2 network operated by Mannesman, the German engineering group. Other competitors include a consortium headed by Thyssen and Veba, the German industrial groups, Bellsouth of the US and Vodafone of Britain which was recently awarded a licence to develop and operate a new network, with 3m subscribers expected by the end of the decade. Deutsche Telekom also announced it will join forces with Preussag, the German steel and engineering group, and Alcatel Sel, to form a company which will recycle electronic goods. The company also announced the creation of a venture with a consortium of Ukrainian companies to develop telecoms in the former Soviet republic.</p>

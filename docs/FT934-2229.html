			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / N&amp;P to sweep away obsolete accounts National &amp; Provincial, the eighth-largest building society, is to transfer Pounds 380m held by 600,000 savers in 40 obsolete accounts into new accounts, most of which will pay higher interest than the old ones. The society estimated that about Pounds 20bn was languishing in obsolete bank and building society accounts in the UK, depriving investors of up to Pounds 800m a year that they would earn in other accounts. The N&amp;P savers - accounting for 25 per cent of customers but only 5 per cent of savers' deposits - will be invited by letter to move to new accounts. If they do not reply the society will move the accounts for them. Savers will not have the option of staying with the old accounts - all will be closed. It says that no saver will be worse off as a result of the automatic transfer and that many will earn up to 4.5 percentage points gross above their current rate. Savers will be able to retain special features of an old account, such as standing orders, even if they are not a feature of the new one. Mr Stephen Geraghty, N&amp;P director of customer engagement, said savings on administration costs would be small compared with the Pounds 5m it would pay in extra interest. N&amp;P has seven investment accounts for new customers. The society has spent Pounds 15m a year since 1991 on a campaign to keep depositors informed about savings rates. About 1m customers have moved to new accounts as a result. N&amp;P says it will be rid of obsolete accounts by the end of March. If so, it will be the first building society to sweep its savings cupboard clean of old accounts. At least half of N&amp;P's obsolete accounts are the legacy of mergers and many date back to the days of the Provincial and Burnley building societies which merged in 1982 to form N&amp;P. Mr Andy Marchant, savings manager, said: 'Very occasionally someone may not want to move because they are fond of an account belonging to an old society that they are still loyal to.' Obsolete accounts include the Whitehaven Old Series which pre-dates the second world war. There are only 13 savers, earning 0.5 per cent a year gross. 'It is quite possible that the customers may be deceased,' said Mr Marchant. The Burnley Old Series dates back to 1984, while the Keighley account has only 12 savers.</p>

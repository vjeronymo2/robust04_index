			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bunnings valued well above its suitor's offer Bunnings, the Western Australian forest products, manufacturing and merchandising group facing a bid of more than ADollars 535m (USDollars 390.5m) from Wesfarmers, said yesterday Price Waterhouse, an independent adviser, had valued its shares at ADollars 12.52-ADollars 13.61. This is much higher than the ADollars 10.40-a-share cash alternative being offered by the bidder, which holds a 48.1 per cent interest in its target. Bunnings said its advisers had put the value of Wesfarmers' paper alternative at between ADollars 9.96 and ADollars 10.46 a share, and again urged shareholders to reject the terms. 'The conclusions of the independent expert support the committee's opinion that the current offer price is inadequate,' Bunnings said.</p>

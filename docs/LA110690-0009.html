			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A $17,500 reward for information leading to the recovery of three pieces of  pre-Columbian art that were stolen from Mingei International Museum of World  Folk Art is being offered by the insurance company that underwrites the  exhibition.  </P> <P> The New York-based Cigna Insurance Co. put up the reward in the hope that it  would yield information in an investigation that has gone cold, said William F.  Smith, a representative for the company who works solely with fine arts.  </P> <P> Investigators from the San Diego Police Department and the FBI still have no  leads in the Oct. 23 theft, he said.  </P> <P> The reward is about 10% of the estimated $175,000 value of the stolen  artifacts, Smith said. It applies only if all three pieces are returned, he  said.  </P> <P> The three pieces -- a terra cotta vase dated AD 750-800, and two sculptures --  were part of an exhibition at the Mingei entitled, "Pre-Columbian Flora and  Fauna: Continuity of Plant and Animal Themes in Mesoamerican Art." The show  opened Sept. 30 and will run through mid-February.  </P></p>

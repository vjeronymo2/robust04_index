			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Leading Article: See-through pay SELF-PROMOTION is usually a suspect activity; but nobody is likely to oppose the recommendation from Pro Ned that top pay in all listed companies should be set by a named non-executive remuneration panel, although this body exists to promote the role of non-executive company directors. The practice is already widespread, but often falls short of the standards proposed in this report - a clear remit for the panel, and the publication of details and explanations of top pay well beyond the meagre requirements of British company law. Transparency and demonstrable independence would help to defuse some of the public resentment which has recently flared up about top pay. Full disclosure of top pay and fringe benefits should be legally required, as disclosure of service contracts already is. But disclosure will do little good if what is disclosed is seen as greedy or unjust. For example, where pay is related to performance, it should, as it does not always, move down after bad years as well as up after good. This would protect non-executives from 'having to defend the indefensible', as Pro Ned rather self-regardingly demands. And it would avoid the real economic penalties of pay awards which tend to raise shop-floor wage pressure when the economy can least afford it, quite apart from getting privatisation, not to mention capitalism itself, a bad name.</p>

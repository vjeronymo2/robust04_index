			<p>CSO     [Text] The Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, Ministry  of International Trade and Industry [MITI], has decided on a  policy of holding down the policy goal increase rate for the  amount of energy consumed by 2010 to an annual average of 0.9  percent. The amount of energy consumed has continued to increase  at an annual rate of about 3 percent for the past 10 years, but  they are dealing with an agreement by the various advanced  nations to hold down the supply of fossil fuels centering on  petroleum to prevent global warming. MITI is promoting  energy-saving measures such as popularization of new energies  and introduction of summer time [daylight savings time].    The final domestic energy consumption amount recorded in  1992  was 360 million kiloliters. They are promoting work on a review  of the "Outlook for Long-Term Energy Supply and Demand" in the  Supply and Demand Subcommittee of the General Energy Research  Committee (MITI consulting organ), and will incorporate this  policy in the report compiled at the end of June.    MITI is forecasting the amount of consumption divided into  the case where existing policy is continued and the case where  new energy-saving policy is implemented. Consumption in 2010  will be 425 million kiloliters to 446 million kiloliters  converted to crude oil. The rate of increase under the existing  policy is an annual average of 1.2 percent. It is expected to be  0.9 percent when energy-saving policies are added. Since an  increase in supply of fossil fuels such as petroleum or coal is  difficult from the viewpoint of preventing global warming, it  was decided to make the target increase rate for consumption an  annual rate of 0.9 percent.    In order to promote energy-saving measures, MITI has a  policy  of promoting electric cars and development subsidies for  high-efficiency boilers.</p>

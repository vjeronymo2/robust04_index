			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Calls for Crimea to lose its autonomy Crimea's ongoing political struggle is prompting increasingly loud calls in Kiev for the Ukrainian peninsula's status as an autonomous republic to be revoked. This follows the Crimean parliament's decision on Thursday to strip President Yuri Meshkov of most powers, as it did a month before. Mr Meshkov at that time suspended parliament but later relented without the row being resolved. If the crisis continues, Kiev must take direct control of Crimea, said Mr Vladimir Mukhin, the Ukrainian parliament's defence committee chairman. While Moscow considers the present dispute an internal Ukrainian matter, any move to weaken the republic's autonomous status might bring Russian involvement. Transferred to Ukraine in 1954, the peninsula is the sorest point in relations between Russia and Ukraine since the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. Under pressure from Russian nationalists, a clause on Ukrainian territorial integrity leaving Crimea outside Russia is the main issue holding up agreement on a Ukrainian-Russian co-operation treaty under discussion. Crimean deputies today are expected to consider amending the constitution to validate last week's step, which Mr Meshkov called a 'coup d'etat'.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Second push for green reporting - An absence of benchmarking has undermined reporting, but Peter Knight says the City could provide an impetus Environmental reporting is a waste of time and money. This could be the view of the vast majority of companies that steadfastly ignore demands to publish regular voluntary reports on their emissions, waste, and efforts to reduce their impact on the environment. After a spate of reports in the early 1990s from blue-chip companies in western Europe and North America, environmental reporting appears to be at a crossroads. Those companies that have reported - about 150 worldwide - are wondering whether it is worth continuing. The non-reporters appear to be hoping that reporting is a dying fashion. 'Reporting by some companies spurs on competition among others. But a diversity of styles and lack of conformity has undermined this competition because there is no benchmarking. And, of course, those companies which choose not to report are deeply comfortable with this,' says John Elkington, a director of SustainAbility, a UK consultancy advising the United Nations Environment Programme on reporting. Unep is trying to encourage small- and medium-sized companies throughout the world to report. Such companies produce most of the world's pollution, but because of their size and low visibility they are less affected by public pressure. Unep's underfunded campaign is only beginning, but the chances of success look slim unless there is renewed pressure to report. The future of voluntary reporting is uncertain, for three reasons. First, those companies that have so far reported have received, at best, a muted response from the audience that was calling for voluntary reporting, mainly campaign groups. Second, recession and the rapid slide of the environment down the political agenda have reduced the pressure to report. Only businesses in those sectors whose record is constantly under public scrutiny, such as water, chemicals and energy, feel the need to report. Third, information contained in the vast majority of reports lacks credibility and is of little use to most audiences, such as investors. 'Environment reporting is still the product of the public relations industry,' says Clive Bates, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK. 'Investors, employees and the public need the unexpurgated environmental facts just as much as they need to see the mandatory financial accounts,' he adds. Greenpeace is not alone in its criticism of the value of the information found in environmental reports. Bill Dale, environment analyst at S. G. Warburg, says the City finds it difficult to identify potential environmental risk because of the poor quality of information made available by companies. 'Although more data are now being revealed in annual reports there is a high degree of discretion in what is reported,' he said. It seems unlikely that companies will ever be forthcoming with all the facts until they are forced. Although there have been hints that the European Union could legislate on the issue, this now seems unlikely. The EU's voluntary scheme, called Eco Management and Audit Scheme, is up and running but has yet to fulfil one of its primary goals - to encourage companies to conform to its standards and so gain a competitive advantage. And Emas is only aimed at very large industrial operations. The general trend in the EU's attitude towards the environment is away from prescriptive legislation and towards a greater use of voluntary and fiscal measures to encourage improved environmental performance. This does not mean, however, that environmental reporting is off the agenda. Elkington sits on the EU's consultative forum on the environment, a group of business people and representatives from consumer groups, local government, trades unions and non-governmental groups. 'In our discussions, reporting is seen as absolutely fundamental,' he said. And companies that continue to report say they find benefits other than public recognition for their efforts. The process forces them to set up the systems to gather information about their products and processes. This enables them to manage their businesses better. 'Our report gives us the opportunity to provide concise information on our environmental performance to outsiders and employees. We find it a useful communications tool,' says Richard Robson, environment communications manager at ICI. Thorn EMI has just produced a highly detailed report on its performance and the Kingfisher retailing group, which includes Comet, B&amp;Q, Superdrug and Woolworths, is expected to publish its first environmental report this year. 'Reporting is a primary strategic communications tool,' says Elkington. 'A prime example here is the success of Dow Europe. Because it does not have an annual report for the European business its their environmental report is a window through which people can view Dow.' But in spite of such advantages, it appears that many companies will not take environmental reporting seriously unless they are put under more pressure. Early indications are that in the absence of any official initiative, the financial community could provide the impetus. Asbestosis claims and concerns about possible effects of climate change on catastrophic property casualty exposures have increased the world insurance industry's interest in the environment. Banks are paying more attention to their exposure to environmental risk and investors are starting to show concern about risks posed by companies with poor environmental records. But if the financial community is to convert its concerns into action it needs better information. Dale says: 'Most of the information, including specific quantitative detail, is arbitrary and self-determined. In very few cases is it possible to draw direct conclusions as to the implications for revenues and profit margins. While investors wait for better standards of reporting they will be more impressed by those companies which publish separate reports on their environmental performance. Particular credit will be given to information that is independently audited or verified.'</p>

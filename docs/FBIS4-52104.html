			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korea is shifting  its military policy from defense against a possible attack by  North Korea to diverse efforts to enhance cooperation with such  neighbors as China, Japan and Russia and participation in United  Nations Peacekeeping Operations, the Chinese People's Liberation  Army (PLA) daily reported Wednesday.    The shift was prompted by changing international politics  and  the volatile military situation surrounding the Korean  peninsula, said the PLA organ. It predicted that Seoul would  achieve military self-reliance by focusing on developing  state-of-the-art weapons, specializing and systematizing its  defense industry and training elite troops.    Such efforts will be pursued in line with Seoul's policy of  "all-direction" military and diplomatic cooperation, said the  PLA daily.    It added that despite this policy shift, military  cooperation  between Seoul and Washington will remain the core of South  Korea's defense relations with other countries.    The policy shift, drawn up by the South Korean Defense  Ministry, has already been reported to President Kim Yong-sam  and will likely be approved by President Kim in the near future,  said the PLA organ.</p>

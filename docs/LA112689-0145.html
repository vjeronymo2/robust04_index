			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPEC MINISTERS STILL SPLIT OVER OIL OUTPUT QUOTAS  </P> <P> Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Saturday made  what delegates said was agonizingly slow progress toward reconciling rival  ambitions to sell more oil within a new system of output quotas.  </P> <P> The 13 oil ministers held a brief formal opening session and then adjourned  with differences unresolved. The ministers resumed bilateral talks at their  hotel.  </P> <P> Two days of informal pre-conference haggling failed to produce an OPEC response  to the threat of lower world oil prices posed by the excess production of two  Persian Gulf states, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.  </P> <P> "We have nothing concrete on the table, only ideas," said Indonesian Oil  Minister Ginanjar Kartasasmita.  </P> <P> Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, a veteran consensus-builder who was elected to an  eighth term as OPEC president, pleaded in a speech: "We must . . . relax some  of our entrenched positions."  </P> <P> Kuwait and the UAE are at present outside OPEC's quota system, saying their  assigned quotas are unfairly low. Delegates said one problem in the talks  Saturday was the UAE's inability to commit itself so far to any suggested  quota.  </P></p>

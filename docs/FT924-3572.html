			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Gaidar at centre of Congress power struggle MR Boris Yeltsin's parliamentary opponents, smarting at their failure at the weekend to deprive the Russian president of his power to form governments, are likely to return to the offensive today by refusing to endorse Mr Yegor Gaidar as prime minister. Members of the Congress of People's Deputies hope to put a stop to economic policies they have described as 'contrary to the interests of Russian citizens' by voting to remove Mr Gaidar, the acting premier whose name has become synonymous with market reform in Russia. The government last night issued a statement warning Congress that it would resign en masse unless Mr Gaidar was approved as premier, the only post which would allow him to 'effectively conduct reforms'. Congress's failure - by four votes - to endorse a move giving parliament the right to appoint the cabinet spared the country a constitutional crisis. The president did hint that he would have dissolved the full parliament had it taken any other decision. Even if Mr Gaidar's endorsement is defeated, President Yeltsin can still keep him on as acting prime minister for another three months, while he comes up with another candidate. Such a vote against Mr Gaidar, coupled with a resolution by Congress calling his performance 'unsatisfactory', would be awkward for the government in the short term, but it would not be a fatal blow. President Yeltsin's negotiations with the centrist Civic Union group may yet result in a compromise which would alter the composition of the cabinet while finding some way for Mr Gaidar to retain control over economic reforms  -which have already moved a long way to accommodate many opposition demands. Mr Alexander Shokhin, a deputy prime minister, said the result of today's vote would depend on 'the mood of the deputies' following the failure of their attempt to curtail President Yeltsin's powers on Saturday. In secret ballots held on Saturday, the Congress also failed to secure other constitutional amendments giving it the right to veto the creation and disbanding of various ministries. But Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliament's chairman who has orchestrated opposition to Mr Gaidar, warned President Yeltsin that his victory at the weekend was only temporary. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, said the government's main challenge now was to achieve tangible successes in time for the next Congress scheduled for April.

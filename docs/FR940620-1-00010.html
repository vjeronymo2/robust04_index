This event will be held on the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel, Tonawanda, NY from 10 a.m. (EDST) until 6 p.m. (EDST) on August 27, 1994 and from 11 a.m. (EDST) until 6 p.m. and August 28, 1994. This event will have an estimated 70 inboard hydroplanes and runabouts, racing a closed course race on the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. A special local regulation which would restrict vessel traffic in the area is necessary to ensure the safety of life, limb and property on portions of the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel during this event. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before August 4, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should be mailed to Commander (oan), Ninth Coast Guard District, 1240 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44199&hyph;2060.

Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this notice (CGD 09&hyph;94&hyph;10) and the specific section of the proposal to which their comments apply, and give reasons for each comment.

This event will have an estimated 70 inboard hydroplanes and runabouts racing in a closed race course, oval in shape, approximately 0.5 nautical miles long, 0.25 nautical miles wide, running northeast/southwest in the Tonawanda Channel which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. In order to provide for the safety of life, limb and property, the Coast Guard is considering a proposal to regulate vessel traffic within this section of the Niagara River, Tonawada Channel. Commercial vessels desiring to transit the regulated area shall provide prior notification to the Coast Guard Patrol Commander. Any vessels desiring to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Coast Guard Patrol Commander (Officer in Charge, U.S. Coast Guard Station Buffalo, NY). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1233 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 100. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism Implications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposed regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HLASEK AND 3 OTHER SEEDS ELIMINATED FROM TOURNEY  </P> <P> Fourth-seed Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland and three other seeded players were  eliminated today at the $607,500 Monte Carlo Open tennis tournament.  </P> <P> Argentine Martin Jaite, who lost in last year's finals of this tournament to  Ivan Lendl, beat Hlasek 6-4, 6-1.  </P> <P> The two top seeds advanced in rainy conditions. Mats Wilander of Sweden beat  wild-card Diego Nargiso of Italy, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 and Boris Becker of West  Germany topped Lawson Duncan 6-4, 6-1.  </P> <P> Sixth-seeded Henri Leconte of France withdrew during his match against Patrick  Kuhnen of West Germany. Kuhnen was leading 6-3, 3-2 when Leconte decided to  abandon the match because of a back injury.  </P> <P> In other second-round matches, Marcelo Filippini of Uruguay beat 15th-seeded  Mark Woodforde of Australia 7-5, 6-1 and Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden eliminated  the 11th seed, Slobodan Zivojinoviv of Yugoslavia, 6-4, 6-2.  </P> <P> Hlasek said he knew he would be in for a difficult match.  </P> <P> "I was prepared for a tough match because I haven't played a match on clay in  eight months and he's already played a few tournaments, including yesterday,"  Hlasek said. "I played very badly and made it easy for him to beat me."  </P> <P> Nargiso, who lives here, served for the first set at 6-5. But Wilander held him  off, won the tiebreaker 7-4 and romped in the second set 6-1.  </P> <P> "It's hard to practice for a few weeks and then play your first match,"  Wilander said. He won three of the four Grand Slam tournaments last year.  </P> <P> "I'm just happy I won," Wilander added. "To play on clay is such a mental game,  and you have to be fresh."  </P> <P> Becker, a two-time Wimbledon champion, had an easy time against Duncan. In the  last two years of this tournament, Becker lost in his first match.  </P> <P> "It's almost like winning the entire tournament," Becker said. "It was very  special for me."  </P> <P> Ninth-seeded Jonas Svensson of Sweden survived a scare against Thierry Tulasne  of France. Svensson overcame a 5-2 deficit in the third set to win 6-7 (5-7),  6-3, 7-5.  </P></p>

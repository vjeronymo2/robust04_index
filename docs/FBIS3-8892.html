[Begin Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus recording] Since there is  no visa requirement for Russian citizens, the government does  not have any legal means that would enable it to prevent Mr.  Zhirinovskiy from entering the territory of the Czech Republic  [words indistinct]. The government does not intend to find a way  round our laws and therefore it will act in this way.    Naturally, the government is ready to intervene if any of  our  laws are violated or if public order is disturbed, etc. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Sport: Overwhelmed in Japan - Golf Numbers. Sheer weight of numbers. That is what sets Japanese golf tournaments apart from their equivalents elsewhere. US events have their volume of volunteers, British events have their army of marshals, Continental events have their posse of posers but Japanese events have all these in abundance and then some. Rakers, sweepers, divot replacers, scoring operatives, crowd chivviers, player protectors - in Japan there are hordes of each and the resultant swarming effect is unique. And there is, of course, the yen. That comes in very large numbers, even in these straitened times. For example, Barry Lane, a personable Englishman who played in the Visa Masters and the Dunlop Phoenix tournaments recently, tied for third place one week and second the next, winning more than Y16.5m (Pounds 104,000) and found himself 66th on the Japanese money list. If Lane had won the Dunlop, as Ernie Els, of South Africa, did, he would have zoomed to 29th place by virtue of a cheque of Y36m, or Pounds 225,000, which would have been good enough for a place in the top 20 of the final the Volvo European order of merit or Dollars 337,000, which would have brought 45th on the end-of-season US money list. On the course, everything was immaculate and recognisable but different. Every hole has two greens, one of bent grass and one of tifton, for use at different times of the growing season. Every time a divot is taken, a woman in a uniform that includes a straw hat swathed in an enormous white scarf scurries from the sidelines to fill it in. Another of her like will rake the bunkers after the players or, at some courses, sweep the sand with an old-fashioned broomstick, crouching below the rim of the bunker for fear of disturbing the golfers. The local caddies are all women. They sport caps with a duck bill a platypus would kill for and scuttle along pulling a trolley, always keeping up, always on hand to soothe their charges. Just as the caddies are unique, so are the crowds. They are appreciative of the foreign players, especially the big hitters, but only become really animated when it looks as though a Japanese might win. Jumbo Ozaki is their hero and he milks each occasion for all it is worth, with theatrical gestures and reactions that are quite the opposite of inscrutable. Jumbo is eminently quotable and is always likely to attribute some misfortune, such as a double bogey, to an evil spirit lurking at the hole where the offence occurred. He is also big business and seems to clothe half the spectators at a big event. Jackets are quite a feature at Japanese tournaments and Ozaki's slogan, written like most of them in English, ranks with the best. 'Jumbo aims at professional activity with never-ending spirit,' it reads.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Philippe Pentecost, a businessman of European  origin, and Nidoish Naisseline, the Kanak separatist leader,  yesterday established a new Caledonian political party that  advocates the establishment of an "autonomous Caledonian state,  a member of the Francophone community and the EC." The party is  called "1999," which is the year following the referendum on  self-determination provided for in the 1988 Matignon accords.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gao Shangquan (7559 1424 0356), deputy chairman </F> of the Economic Structural Reform Commission: "Market  Orientation, Way of Gradual Advance--Strategies for Reform of  China's Economic System"]    [Text] The reform of China's economic system has already  gone on for 15 years. For 15 years, from the rural areas to the  cities, from the coast to the interior, from the non-state-owned  economy to the state-owned economy, from micro to macro, and  from the economic domain to the scientific and technological,  educational, and political domains, the reform has become the  main performer in China's social and economic life, and its  successes have become the focus of world attention. When we look  back on and sum up the basic experiences of the 15 years of  reform, we see that China's reform took the path of gradual  expansion of the proportion of market regulation and of gradual  enhancement of the role of market mechanisms, in broad outline:  market orientation and the way of gradual advance.  <H5>  Market Orientation: Reform's Basic Achievement </H5>   There are many reasons that China's reform was able to  obtain  universally acknowledged successes; and the reform itself  employed the strategy of "market orientation, and the way of  gradual advance."    In the l5-year reform there were roughly four stages. In the  first stage, from the end of 1978 to October 1984, the reform  first of all made a breakthrough in the rural areas and obtained  successes; in the cities, starting from expansion of the  enterprise's right to take the initiative, experiments at  selected points in comprhensive and special-item reforms were  carried out. In the second stage, from October 1984 to September  1988, the focus of reform shifted from the rural areas to the  cities, and reform was launched in a comprehensive way in all  domains. In the third stage, from September 1988 to the end of  1991, in the economic domain the environment was brought under  control, the order was rectified, and the reform was deepened.  The fourth stage, which started at the beginning of 1992, with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talk on his inspection of the  south as its starting point, and the 14th CPC Congress set the  goal of the reform of China's econmic system as the  establishment of the socialist market economy system. The pace  of reform and opening up to the outside world markedly  quickened, and the reform entered a new historical stage.    Following the constant deepening and expansion of the reform  and opening up to the outside world, profound changes occurred  in the pattern and operating mechanisms of China's economic  system:    --With public ownership as the main part, many economic  forms  coexisted, including ownership by the whole people, collective,  privately operated, individual, and foreign joint venture, and a  pattern of joint development was gradually formed. The single  ownership structure of the original economic system--a structure  that was separated from the level of productive forces--was  broken, and township enterprises, "the three kinds of  enterprises that were either wholly or partially owned," and the  private and individual economies developed swiftly. In 1992, in  industrial output value, enterprises owned by the whole people  accounted for 48.4 percent, the collective enterprises accounted  for 38.2 percent, and the individual, private, and "three kinds"  enterprises accounted for 13.4 percent; in retail value of  social commodities, the enterprises owned by the whole people  accounted for 41.3 percent, the collective enterprises accounted  for 27.9 percent, and joint venture, individual, and private  enterprises accounted for 30.8 percent. The rapid development of  the non-state-owned economy and the non-public economy infused  new energy into China's economy.    --Based on the principles of separation of government and  enterprise and of separation of proprietary rights and  management rights, the management mechanisms of state-owned  enterprises are being changed and are progressively moving  toward the market. Starting with smoothing out the relationship  between state and enterprise, and with the implementation of the  enterprise's right to take the initiative in production and  management, enterprise reform of various forms has been carried  out. Ninety-three percent of the industrial and commercial  enterprises under whole-people ownership have implemented  various forms of the contract management responsibility system,  and, in order to promote the rational combination of important  production factors, they have formed a number of new-type  enterprise groups. For some small and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises, the practice of "rent, transform, or sell" was  instituted. In recent years, in order to explore effective forms  for implementing public ownership, new-type enterprise systems  have been set up, and a large number of enterprises have carried  out the reform of instituting varied forms of the stock system.  By the end of 1992 there were more than 3,700 stock enterprises  in China; at present, 92 of them have been publicly put on the  Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges.    --With the market primarily determining prices, the  commodity  market system, which gives full play to the role of market  mechanisms, has been initially formed. Now, controls on the  greater part of commodity prices have already been loosened, and  the proportion of prices fixed by the state is less than 15  plercent of the total amount of agricultural products purchased.  In the ex-factory total sales of industrial consumer goods and  means of production, the proportions of state-fixed prices are  only 10 and 30 percent, respectively. At the same time, the  stock exchange, foreign exchange market, labor market,  technology market, land market, and other markets for important  factors are now being swiftly developed.    --The macroeconomic regulation and control system has begun  to change from primarily direct administrative control to making  indirect regulation and control primary with the comprehensive  application of economic and legal measures. The state plan broke  away from direct controls, such as fixed quotas, apportioned  investment, mandated projects, and apportioned materials; in  addition, command planning has been greatly reduced. In  industrial production, before 1979 command planning accounted  for more than 95 percent of the entire industrial output value,  and now it accounts for only 7 percent. The means of production  under the state's unified distribution and the one-category  commodities under planned purchasing have also been  correspondingly reduced. At the same time, the effect of  financial policy and monetary policy is becoming larger and  larger.    With distribution according to work as the main part, a  social distribution pattern of various forms of distribution  existing side by side is appearing, and a new social security  system is being formed. The policy of encouraging some people to  become wealthy by honest work before others do so and of  appropriately widening the income gap has greatly arouused the  enthusiasm of workers.    --Opening up to the outside world has become an enormous  motive power for promoting domestic reform and developing it;  and a new pattern of multilevel, omnidirectional, multiform  opening up to the outside world, in which there is the  progression "special economic zone--coastal and border open  cities--interior," has been formed. By the end of 1993, in China  there were 84,000 registered "three kinds of enterprises," $58.7  billion in contracted investment, and $11.2 billion in actual  investment. In its foreign trade system, China will, in  accordance with international practice and GATT regulations,  control imports and exports in order to meet the requirements  for expanding economic and technological cooperation abroad and  for taking part in international market competition. Opening up  to the outside world is not only manifested in attracting  foreign capital; what is more important is that it makes  reference to foreign advanced technology and successful  practices, in order to accelerate the welding of China's market  to the international market.    The profound changes in economic mechanisms and operating  mechanisms have brought enormous changes to China's social and  economic life. Over the 15 years of reform, China's GNP has  grown at an annual average rate of 9 percent, its overall  national strength has increased markedly, and the people's  standard of living has risen markedly. In addition, people's  ideas and concepts have been liberated from a long period of  confinement, and in practice, with the spirit of emancipating  the mind and of seeking truth from facts, there is constant  exploration and a gradual push toward deeper involvement in  reform.  <H5>  Gradual Advance: A Successful Experience </H5>   Under the premise of already making clear the direction and  goal of reform, the movement and method of reform is to  gradually move forward, and not to apply "shock treatment" to  reach the goal in one bound. In the practice of China's reform,  the form that "gradual advance" is manifested in is that the  reform of the system is a process of preceding from point to  area, i.e., there is a breakthrough at a key point, which then  evolves and permeates everything. The specific practice is to  first make experiments at selected points and then popularize  the results, i.e., when any reform measure appears, first there  is an experiment at a certain place or a certain enterprise, and  after a result is obtained it is popularized throughout the  country. To this end, the state before and after the fact  decided on some experimental zones for reform and opening up to  the outside world and on some experimental cities, experimental  counties, and experimental enterprises for comprehensive reform  or single-item reform, which undertake the task of testing each  reform. For example, reform first begins in the rural areas and  then gradually makes the transition to cities; first begins with  the setting up of special economic zones, after which it  radiates to the coastal region, and then deeply penetrates the  interior region; first begins with developing the township,  individual, privately operated, and "three kinds of enterprise"  economies, and, after strengthening the roles of market  mechanisms in these domains, causes these roles to infiltrate  the state-owned economy; and first begins in the microeconomic  domain, where the right to take the initiative in production  management is expanded, and then promotes reform in the  planning, financial, and banking macro-domain. This way of  pushing forward reform by gradual advance and infiltration is a  creation of the Chinese people, and is also the result of  constant exploration in practice.    A typical example of the method of "gradual advance" is  price  reform. In the past price reform was always a difficult problem  for some countries, and it was also the first difficult problem  that we ran into in our reform. The Chinese government and  economic academic circles both saw the importance of price  reform, and understood that price marketization was the premise  for the full display of the role of market mechanisms and of  fair competition between enterprises, and for guiding the  optimum deployment of natural resources. However, at the same  time they also saw that price reform had to be integrated with  the cultivation of the market, and that price reform was a fast  variable while market cultivation was a slow variable, and that  to demand that a slow variable be adapted to a fast variable was  to be divorced from reality. Price reform requires a necessary  financial base in order to meet the need for smoothing out  various price relations and to ensure that in the process of  reform the interests of the broad masses were not harmed. Price  reform is also linked to the charateristics of different  industries or products; the elastic coefficient of some  industrial prices is high, and price controls are relaxed it  will be possible to achieve rapidly a market equilibrium.  Production in some industries or of some products, first,  requires a large investment; second, has a long production or  contruction period; and third, has higher technological  requirements, and, after price controls are relaxed for a long  period of time, there cannot be a market equilibrium and thus  there is a trend toward inflation. Precisely because we  recognized these characteristics, in our price reform we did not  adopt the tactic of relaxing controls at one fell swoop, but  rather adopted the policy of positive safety, and, based on the  characteristics of different industries and different products,  at different periods of time put forward some reform measures.  Even if there are still heavy tasks in China's price reform, it  may be affirmed that China's price reform has made the  transition to a critical period.    Why did China's reform adopt the way of gradual advance? The  reasons are many-sided. Generally speaking, this reform is  China's third revolution, i.e., it will make a fundamental  change in the economic system's operating mechanisms. This is an  unprecedented creative undertaking, and there is no ready-made  model we can copy, so we can only proceed in an orderly way step  by step and try to find our way in practice. And the deeper  reasons have a many-sided basis.    First, the way of gradual advance has its basis in  understanding. Reform is an important matter that affects all  domains of social life and that touches on every member of  society, both basically bringing interests to the people and  adjusting to different degrees the relationships of the  economy's specific interests and authority. This means that  reform must obtain the understanding and support of all quarters  of society. For a reform measure, particularly a measure that  adjusts the structure of interests, there must be a process of  gaining society's understanding. Therfore, before  comprehensively promoting a measure, there must first be an  experiment, and when it gradually becomes understood by people  it can become a conscious action of theirs. Otherwise, in the  course of reform there will be numerous difficulties, and  contradictions will be intensified, causing all previous efforts  to be wasted.    Second, the way of gradual advance has a logical basis in  the  system. All links in the economic system are closely connected,  both requiring coordination and forming complete sets, and the  accurate selection of breakthrough points, and then the  uncoupling of one link at a time, and in the end untying "fast  knots." Looking at China's experience, we see that reform often  does not start from the most critical, most difficult place, but  rather the breakthrough is made at the place where there is a  large probability for success and where it is easy to solve  technical problems. For example, in enterprise reform, the  reform of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises is  extremely important, but it is very difficult. The reform begins  with expanding the right of enterprises to act on their own  initiative, and at the same time it vigorously develops the  non-state-owned economy, forming outside the state-owned economy  a competitive "colony," which puts pressure on the state-owned  economy, proomoting the reform of the state-owned economy. It is  very difficult to imagine that a process of reform without this  kind of gradual advance would find a path to pass through into  the state-owned economy.    Third, the way of gradual advance is determined by China's  complex national condition. China's basic national condition is  a large population, a vast area, and an unbalanced economic  development; the level of economic development in all places is  uneven, and there are also differences in them in the conditions  and basis for reform. This determines that reform in each place  cannot "quick march," and that it should be recognized that in  some places reform will go somewhat faster while in other places  it will go somewhat slower. This kind of unbalanced reform, in  reality, is a process of conforming to nature and developing by  gradual advance.    Fourth, the way of gradual advance is also a political  requirement. China's reform needs a stable political and social  environment; a radical way of reform would be bound to go beyond  the capability of society to bear it, causing shocks in society  that in the end would harm the reform. China is a large country  with a population of more than 1.2 billion, and obtaining  stability is an overriding task that must be done. Therefore,  the selection of the way of reform must proceed from the  question of whether it is advantageous to promoting social  stability.  <H5>  New Starting Point of Reform: Establishment of the New </H5> System of a Socialist Market Economy    China has already decided that the goal of reform is the  establishment of the system of socialist market economy. Without  the slightest doubt, this is a continuation and development of  the past 15-year "market orientation" reform, but it also has  pushed China's reform to a higher stage. To establish the system  of socialist market economy there must be formed the inherent  unity of public ownership and market economy; under the state's  active, effective macro-regulation and control, the market  mechanisms play a fundamental role in the disposition of natural  resources, and are able to bring about an economic system that  combines a high standard of efficiency with a high standard of  fairness.    To establish the system of socialist market economy, first  of  all we must boldly assimilate and use for reference the  successful experiences in the practice of foreign market  economies, abiding by the laws of modern economics. This is  mainly a case of all commodities and important production  factors going on the market, and, in the disposition of natural  resources, the market mechanisms play a fundamental role. By  making clear the relationship of property rights and making  pluralistic the main part of interests, the enterprise will  truly become a corporate entity that operates on its own and  that is responsible for its own profits and losses, and the main  part of market competition. Mainly through economic measures,  the government will indirectly regulate and control economic  activity; and the unified, open domestic market, with the  organic "joints" of the international market, and in accordance  with the current international criteria and practice, will carry  out economic activity. The socialist market economy must be an  integration of public ownership and the market economy; public  ownership must adopt basic forms that meet the demands of the  market economy and that are achieved through the market economy  system. China's basic national condition also determines that,  in the market economy, the component parts of the economy are  diversified and include state, collective, private, and foreign  venture ownership. With public ownership primary, the  diversified forms of ownership will coexist for a long time,  jointly develop, and compete on an equal basis. Following the  development of the market economy, there will be an  interpenetration of different owners' properties, more and more  mixed ownerships forms will appear, and the specific forms of  public ownership will be diversified.    Establishing the system of socialist market economy is a  piece of complex systems engineering. The main frame of this  system has the following aspects:    --Establishment of a modern enterprise system with distinct  property rights, initiative in operation, responsibility for  profits and losses, and competition on an equal basis.  Enterprises of all types are not divided by form of ownership.  They are all formed legally and recorded in registers, and they  have the authority to have real ownership and use of property  and to legally dispose of property. For the reform of  state-owned enterprises, we must start with smoothing out the  relationships of property rights and carrying out the industrial  transformation of enterprises in competitive industries, so that  they mainly become different types of stockholding companies,  for example limited-liability companies or joint-stock limited  companies. At the same time, based on market economy laws and  the characteristics of different industrial sectors, under the  premise of ensuring the increase in value of state-owned  property, we must vigorously take the initiative to readjust the  industrial distribution structure of state-owned property.    --Establishment of a modern market system in which the  market  regulations are sound, the organization is complete, and the  main part's behavior is normal. Controls on the prices of the  great majority of commodities and important production factors  are to be relaxed, forming a mechanism for deciding prices with  the market as primary. This entails formation of an integrated  system of markets for commodities and markets for important  production factors; elimination of industrial monopolies,  regional blockades, and sector divisions; and formation of a  unified, open market structure in which there are diversified  economic components, diversified economic forms, and  multichannels for circulation, and in which domestic and foreign  trade are balance, domestic and international markets are  linked. The focus of the current stage in market construction  are opening up the market for important production factors,  smoothing out the prices for important production factors, and  ending the "double-track system" in important production factors.    --Establishment of macroeconomic control and indirect  regulation and control system in which the goal of balance in  total volume and optimum structure of the economy is promoted,  and in which economic policies and economic levers are the main  measures; and the corresponding establihsment of a crack, highly  efficient economic regulation and control organizational  structure, in which the structure is rational and the duties are  clear, and which meets the demands of the market economy. Now,  the changes in government functions and the establishment of a  macro regulation and control system have been seriously delayed,  a situation that has become a serious restraining factor in the  construction of the system of socialist market economy; and we  must be determined to make breakthroughs in these respects. In  the reform's advanced system of financial payment in which  payment is made partly in kind and partly in cash, on the basis  of a clear demarcation between central and local rights, the  standard divided-tax system is to be practiced. There is to be  an acceleration of the reform of the banking system by  perfecting the central banks' macro-regulation and control  mechanisms, and by making an effort to promote the business-like  transformation of the commercial banks. There is to be an  acceleration of the setting up, with the enterprise taking the  initiative in investment as the main part, of an investment  system that practices management by category.    --Establishment of a social security system in which social  insurance for unemployment, for old age, and for medical  treatment is the main part. The new-type social security system  must integrate social security mechanisms and stimulus  mechanisms. Currently, the focus must be on getting a tight grip  on establishing a national unified organizational structure for  social security management, on formulating a unified policy, and  on enhancing management and supervision. There will be  separation of government affairs, entailing the setting up of a  nonadministrative organization for managing social insurance,  and for legally engaging in raising, using, maintaining and  increasing the value of the social security fund in order to  reduce erosion and waste in the fund.    Establishing the system of socialist market economy is a  formidable task. In general, China's reform still can only  gradually advance in order, and step by step make the transition  to this system and it cannot engage in "shock treatment."  However, this does not exclude the fact that reform at certain  times and under certain conditions, or reform in certain regions  can progress more quickly or to a greater degree. It should be  seen that "breakthroughs from point to area" were not very  different and that at present reform has entered the historical  stage of "storming fortifications." We must be determined to  break through the contradictions on some deeper levels; if we  are not decisive the losses could be larger. Therefore, the  point at which "to storm the fortifications" must be accurately  selected, an advantageous and opportune time must be selected,  action must be adroitly guided according to circumstances, some  major reform measures must be pushed forward, and the transition  to the system of socialist market economy must be accelerated.</p>

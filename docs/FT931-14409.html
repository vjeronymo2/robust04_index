			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Discreet platform suits an energetic advocate - The activities of the man behind the British Management Data Foundation TO BE influential and discreet are among the main aims of the professional lobbyist. On both counts, Mr Anthony Cowgill scores highly. Mr Cowgill is director of the little-known British Management Data Foundation, which represents 21 big UK companies. The foundation's chief goal is to win better backing in Whitehall for the cause of manufacturing, which many industrialists reckon the government did not take seriously enough in the 1980s. In the past three months the group - and other organisations putting similar views - has seen its efforts at least partly rewarded. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, unveiled a modest package of measures to help industry in the November Autumn Statement and Mr John Major has stressed that the March Budget should follow similar principles. The prime minister has talked about making the Civil Service more sympathetic to industry. Meanwhile, the Treasury is trying to foster better links with manufacturers, partly to improve its knowledge of economic trends after its lack of success in monitoring the longer than expected recession. Mr Cowgill says: 'We are beginning to see a more receptive approach by the government. And on the part of industry there has also been a change, with less whingeing and more selectivity about the things it wants from the politicians.' The genial Mr Cowgill is a fit-looking 77, with a military manner stemming from his 30-year career in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. He left the army as a brigadier in 1969 to become chief industrial engineer with Rolls-Royce, and set up the foundation in 1980, after taking over an existing body that organised engineering studies. He gradually made the foundation more concerned with broad policymaking, though it continues to act as a forum for debate about specific industrial issues, from robotics to accounting standards and energy pricing. The foundation's main role is to set up meetings involving its member companies and the government. There were about 40 such gatherings last year, most of them receiving little or no publicity. Normally these talks involve are senior managers rather than company chairmen or main-board directors. The industry representatives do not have to repeat company views, but say what they really think about specific issues. Mr James Plant, production executive at Wellcome, a member of the foundation, says: 'It is more of a sounding board than a platform.' In keeping with this goal of encouraging dialogue rather than pushing fixed ideas, Mr Cowgill does not like to call himself a lobbyist. He prefers the term 'illuminator of facts'. Mr Cowgill describes his organisation - which provided him with a Pounds 35,000 salary last year - as a 'Mickey Mouse outfit'. He runs the foundation from a converted garage in his Gloucestershire home overlooking the Cotswolds. Within the small world of people who know about it, the foundation is highly rated. Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive of Lucas, a member of the foundation, says it is a 'well-meaning organisation out to improve understanding'. Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at ICI, another member, says: 'It has provided people in industry access to people at high levels in government they would not otherwise meet.' Membership of the group costs Pounds 5,000 a year and is by invitation of Mr Cowgill. It features a range of companies representing many sectors. In this way, says Mr Cowgill, the group can be more representative of industry than a trade association, while less unwieldy than a group such as the Confederation of British Industry which represents hundreds of companies. The foundation's full list of corporate members is: Allied-Lyons, Allied Steel, Associated Octel, British Coal, British Gas, British Nuclear Fuels, Ferranti, Greenalls, ICI, ICL, Lucas, Marks and Spencer, National Power, National Grid, Nuclear Electric, PowerGen, Rolls-Royce, Shell UK, Simon Engineering, TI Group and Wellcome. Cranfield Institute of Technology is a member. Perhaps the most important regular gathering is at 10 Downing Street with Mr Gus O'Donnell, the prime minister's press secretary. He meets about 10 people from the group roughly once a quarter for an informal discussion. These gatherings started about two years ago, and follow on from similar meetings which Mr Cowgill arranged with Sir Bernard Ingham, who was spokesman for Lady Thatcher when she was prime minister. Other recent discussions have involved the Department of Trade and Industry, the Employment Department and the Bank of England. Mr O'Donnell says he passes on ideas from the meetings to Mr Major. He adds: 'The gatherings are a useful way to find out about how people in industry see the economy, and for them to pass on grouses.' According to Mr Malcolm Edwards, former marketing director of British Coal and now an independent energy adviser, the most recent Downing Street discussions had a big effect on influencing Mr Major to come out with statements asking banks to reduce the cost of business loans by passing on to customers a bigger proportion of recent base rate cuts. Many of Mr Cowgill's associates say his personality vital to the foundation's function. Mr John Collins, a former TI executive who is director of design and manufacturing at Cranfield, says Mr Cowgill has 'extraordinary' energy and initiative. Mr Stuart Pratt, head of automation at Rolls-Royce, says: 'He never forgets a name or a face.' As for his own views about industry, Mr Cowgill thinks Britain has become too involved with the rest of Europe and that politicians should spend more time making sure UK businesses can compete on a global scale. He says the government should refuse to sign the Maastricht treaty and was delighted when Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism, which he says was keeping the exchange rate and also interest rates at an artificially high level. 'The members of the foundation know my views (on Europe), and I may annoy those who think differently,' says Mr Cowgill. 'Sometimes I walk a tightrope, especially when I am in a discussion with the government, but normally I try to keep in the background and let others do the talking.'</p>

			<p>BFN       [Text] [Minister Yi continues] What is important at present  is to put various opinions and views together harmoniously. It  is true that there were some complications in the past. However,  each office came to have a good understanding of each other, and  I believe that they will now handle the work in harmony.    [Reporter Yi] The family of Yo Man-chol, who defected from  North Korea, held a news conference yesterday. At the news  conference, we noted that North Korea is suffering from a  serious food shortage. What plans do you have to bring in our  country the North Korean workers who escaped from logging sites  in Russia and our North Korean compatriots who defected to China?    [Minister Yi] Needless to say, our Foreign Ministry and  other offices are making great efforts on this. The relevant  government offices held many discussions to work out proper  measures to deal with the issue. I understand that there is  progress. Our government assumed it as an essential principle to  resolve this issue from the humanitarian point of view, because  there are many complex and delicate diplomatic, legal, and  political factors. Taking all these factors into consideration,  the government is handling the issue in an appropriate manner.  We seek the people's cooperation and understanding so that the  government can settle this quietly. What I mean by humanitarian  point of view is the welfare of the constituents of the nation  who shared the same blood with us. Thus, the government, paying  keen attention, will deal with the issue properly.    [Reporter Yi] Many people think that the continuous escape  of  the North Korean compatriots may lead to the collapse of the  North Korean system. In other words, a similar situation to what  happened in East Germany will occur. However, the North Korean  side is known to be opposed to reunification through absorption.  What is your opinion on this?    [Minister Yi] As it is known, our basic policy is to  establish a national commonwealth [minjok kongdongche] on this  land in a peaceful, independent, and democratic way.    Therefore, we neither want to see an abrupt outbreak of a  situation nor do we wish misfortunes resulting from such  situation. The whole world is changing today. But only the  Korean peninsula remains divided. This is indeed a disgrace of  the nation. North Korea should respond to dialogue at an early  date. We need not be nervous about the North Korean claims on  opposition to reunification through absorption and so forth.    It is true that many North Korean compatriots are suffering  from many difficulties. However, we have no intention to use  this for political purposes or for North-South relations.    [Reporter Yi] People are hoping that the relevant government  officials in charge of diplomatic and security affairs should  make efforts to seek national consensus and to make the people  fully understand the situation. What is your view on this?    [Minister Yi] I will speak to the people as much as I can  whenever the opportunities arise, just as now. There are many  channels for dialogue. I do intend to fully reflect the people's  opinion and views in the policies to be implemented. I think  that without dialogue with the people, no policy can be  implemented effectively. In particular, this is ever more true  about the reunification policy. Thus, I will make all possible  efforts to seek the people's wisdom and reflect their will in  the policies.    [Reporter Yi] Thank you for being with us today despite your  busy schedule.    [Minister Yi] Thank you.  (endall) 031246 yy/ramirez/KYY29045.03/dr610405.12/hc 04/0609z  May  BT  #0096  NNNN</p>

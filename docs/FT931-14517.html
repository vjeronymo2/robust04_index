			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Government bonds Even allowing for sterling's ignominious exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, a strong performance from French and German bonds this year might still help support the gilts market. The fundamentals are encouraging enough. Lower German interest rates are eagerly awaited in Paris. Even the hawkish Bundesbank is close to admitting inflation is no longer the main threat as the growth outlook has worsened. The worry is that European bond markets have barely faced up to the scale of future government borrowing. The German government's plan to issue short-term paper for the first time might take some of the strain from longer-dated bunds. Having seen 10-year yields fall by 1 percentage point since autumn, though, further gains will be hard won. France offers better prospects. If the franc escapes devaluation, the yield differential over Germany might be expected to narrow. But France faces a borrowing requirement of similar proportions to the UK this year. Even allowing for its enviable inflation record, that will still affect long-term interest rates. European yields may thus not fall far enough to make gilts look cheap. Since 10-year gilts currently yield barely 1.5 percentage points more than bunds and 0.5 percentage points more than French bonds, they might quickly look expensive if inflation is seen to be creeping back alongside recovery. With so many European governments competing for funds, investors can afford to be choosy.</p>

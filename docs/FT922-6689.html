			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: French call for rigour in company reports FRENCH companies should be more rigorous in their reporting of financial information according to the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the watchdog for the French stock market. In its 1991 annual report, which was published yesterday, the COB criticised French companies for inaccuracies and irregularities in their presentation of financial information. It also alleged that some companies did not disclose enough information in their annual reports. The COB's call for more rigorous reporting - an issue which is often commented on within the French financial community - comes at a time when the French government is engaged in a series of reforms intended to complete the modernisation of France's financial markets. Earlier this spring the government announced its intention to abolish the right to make 'partial' bids for only 66 per cent of a company's equity. Meanwhile, the stock market authorities are finalising plans to make block trading - transactions involving large numbers of shares - easier in Paris. These changes coincide with the wider reforms of the socialist government's partial privatisation programme and its plans for pension reform. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, France's long-serving finance minister who recently became prime minister, is seen as a prime mover behind these changes. Mr Jean Saint-Geours, president of the COB, used its 1991 annual report to stress the need for scrupulous standards among French companies. He said the current difficulties could 'increase the temptation for companies to confuse fiction with fact and to mislead the public'. He cited four companies - Sedri, Concept, SMT Goupil and Asystel - which had released misleading or inaccurate information. Two years ago the COB was empowered to initiate legal proceedings against such companies.</p>

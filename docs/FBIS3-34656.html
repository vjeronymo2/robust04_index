			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sufyan al-Zaydan, member of the Fatah </F> Supreme Committee in the Gaza Strip, by Me'ir Einstein; place  not given -- live]    [Excerpt] [Einstein] What is your reaction to the  agreement reached in Cairo? Are you pleased?    [Al-Zaydan] We are not pleased. It is not an agreement we  are proud of; you should be proud of it. It is better for you  than for us, that is clear to everyone.    [Einstein] Why?    [Al-Zaydan] Because you got everything you want, and we the  Palestinians, received everything you offered us. I regret to  say that due to the situation we were forced to accept it since  we could not get anything better. If the Israelis had taken a  bold decision to evacuate the settlements in the Gaza Strip, the  whole predicament the police minister has referred to about the  need for coordination between the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  and the Palestinian police force would not have been necessary.  You would have simply put up a fence near the Gaza Strip.  There would not have been differences of opinion about the  crossings and the police.    [Einstein] Does that mean that what is upsetting you is that  the settlements are staying in the Gaza Strip?    [Al-Zaydan] Believe me, that not only disturbs us, but also  you, and deep down you know that it will complicate matters. We  Palestinians view this agreement as a start, a new opening, a  step forward, in the direction of a comprehensive, just peace.  But this agreement on its own is not comprehensive peace and it  cannot be relied upon to bring full peace. That is not possible.    [Einstein] You know, as I do, that it is an interim  arrangement based on Israeli-Palestinian cooperation in many  fields, and in fact its success will be tested through that  cooperation. Do you believe cooperation will be fully achieved?    [Al-Zaydan] I see it as a test for the Palestinians and  Israel. Can we make progress, take several more steps, or  remain deadlocked, that is the test. I hope that both of us  will succeed and we will go forward. [passage omitted]</p>

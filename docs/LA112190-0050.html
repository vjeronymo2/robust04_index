			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> $1.6-MILLION FUND GOES UNTAPPED BY DOCTORS;  </P> <P> HEALTH: FEW COUNTY PHYSICIANS USE THE STATE PROGRAM, WHICH WAS CREATED TO  ENCOURAGE HEALTH-CARE PROVIDERS TO TREAT MORE PREGNANT WOMEN AND POOR CHILDREN.  </P> <P> Much of the $1.6 million in tobacco taxes set aside to reimburse Ventura County  doctors who treat indigent patients has gone unclaimed and may have to be  returned to the state, county officials said this week.  </P> <P> Few local doctors have enlisted in a special state program designed to  encourage physicians to treat more pregnant women and poor children, the  officials said. The program also pays them for treating indigents in hospital  emergency rooms.  </P> <P> "I don't think the physicians locally are interested in it," said Phillipp K.  Wessels, director of the county's Health Care Agency. "The procedures to get  the money are very cumbersome. And I don't see any significant trends that  indicate we'll spend all this money."  </P> <P> If unspent, the money must be returned to the state for redistribution, but  none will be lost until next year, Wessels said.  </P> <P> Of the $1.6 million Ventura County has received since the program began in  February, doctors had claimed only $152,000 as of Friday, the county reported.  </P> <P> A similar situation apparently exists in counties throughout California, said  state officials and a spokesman for the California Medical Assn.  </P> <P> "I'm hearing the same thing. Claims are not coming in," said Michael Kassis,  chief of the Medically Indigent Section of the state Department of Health  Services.  </P> <P> Kassis said distribution of the so-called Physician Services funds -- collected  as part of a 25-cent-a-pack tobacco tax passed in 1988 -- has been slow because  doctors do not know much about it.  </P> <P> Of the $578 million expected to be collected from new tobacco taxes for the  1990-91 fiscal year, about $58 million will be forwarded to Physician Services  accounts overseen by the counties, he said.  </P> <P> George Cate, associate director of the California Medical Assn., predicted that  as word spreads about the program, more doctors will file claims and open their  doors to increasing numbers of poor patients because the state guarantees that  they will be paid for treatment.  </P> <P> Under the Physician Services program, doctors seeing patients who cannot pay  their bills and who are not covered by Medi-Cal will be reimbursed for 50% of  their billing -- about the same amount allowed under Medi-Cal, officials said.  </P> <P> Ventura County officials said ignorance of the program is also apparently the  biggest obstacle locally.  </P> <P> "It's a great program," said Andrea Pendleton, operations director for the  Ventura County Foundation for Medical Care, a private firm that processes  claims for the county. "But we think we've had some misconception in the  physicians' offices. They don't understand that they can recoup this money.  It's just a continuing education."  </P> <P> Seminars about the program have been held at six of the seven private hospitals  in the county and another is scheduled next week at Los Robles Regional Medical  Center in Thousand Oaks, said Kathy Chester, program administrator at the  Health Care Agency.  </P> <P> "Immediately after each seminar, we've had an influx of claims," she said.  Since payment of local claims began in May, the amounts distributed countywide  have increased from $11,000 to about $33,000 in November, officials said.  </P> <P> The claims, though increasing, are still only a fraction of those needed to  meet the goals of the program, Chester said.  </P> <P> The county, in conjunction with the 600-doctor county Medical Society, is  working with the hospitals to try to enlist more emergency room physicians,  obstetricians and pediatricians into the program, Chester said.  </P> <P> Yet, Chester said, doctors and their staffs have seemed daunted by the  paperwork. Background information required by doctors includes details such as  whether patients are newly legalized immigrants, she said.  </P> <P> At a Thousand Oaks pediatric clinic, which receives numerous patients who  cannot pay their bills, office manager Vicki Goldschlager said she has not  filed claims for reimbursement because she thought that the program only  covered emergency treatment.  </P> <P> But doctors who treat expectant mothers and children can also be reimbursed for  non-emergency care, Chester said.  </P> <P> County officials say they hope that area physicians are informed before next  November, when money from the 1989-90 fiscal year must be returned to the state  if not spent.  </P> <P> In fact, state law requires that funds from fiscal 1989-90, which ended June  30, be returned to the state by the end of this year if not committed to pay  claims. But declarations by Ventura County that it expects to spend the money  will keep it in county coffers for another 12 months.  </P> <P> Proposition 99, the tobacco-tax initiative approved by voters in November,  1988, increased the tax on cigarettes from 10 cents to 35 cents a pack.  </P> <P> Laws to determine how the money would be split up and administered were not  passed until October, 1989, and tax money did not begin to reach the counties  until February.  </P> <P> About 10% of the tobacco taxes go to the physicians' account and 35% to  hospitals. Another 20% is earmarked for health education, 5% for research and  5% for public resources such as parks. A final 25% can be distributed as the  counties want among all the classifications.  </P></p>

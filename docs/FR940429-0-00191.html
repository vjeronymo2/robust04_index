			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters also suggested that the reference to a letter of credit be modified to explain that it would be an irrevocable letter of credit rather than some other type that the institution could revoke without notice to the Department. These commenters also suggested that institutions could withhold information about the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds disbursed through the institution that would otherwise increase the amount of the letter of credit that would be set based upon the information available to the Department for the institution's prior award years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters suggested that the requirement that an institution show that it has met all of its financial obligations during the preceding two award years be expanded to acknowledge that normal business practices would permit institutions to refinance debts to change payment terms or obtain lower interest rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters also stated that the proposed regulation was unfair because it would require provisional certification for any institution that had not demonstrated financial responsibility during the preceding five years, regardless of whether the institution currently demonstrated financial responsibility under its most recent audit. These commenters believed that such a procedure would be unfair because it could penalize an institution that met current financial responsibility standards based upon its prior financial condition. Other commenters suggested that the Secretary should exercise discretion in determining when financial guarantees would be required rather than making them mandatory whenever an institution triggered these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The Secretary disagrees that the standards for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for institutions that are not financially responsible should be deemed to constitute a sufficient demonstration of financial responsibility that would warrant granting full certification to such institutions. Institutions that are not able to meet the general standards of financial responsibility in &sect;668.15(b) or the exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility in &sect;668.15(d) are in a financial situation that is demonstrably different from their counterparts that do satisfy the requirements under these sections. Institutions that only meet the standards for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for institutions that are not financially responsible warrant the additional monitoring and protection to Title IV, HEA program funds that provisional certification provides. Even though such funding restrictions and surety postings may be difficult for some institutions that are already experiencing financial restraints, such protections and the heightened ability to act quickly to protect Title IV, HEA program funds are essential for improving the Department's oversight and gatekeeping responsibilities. Provisional certification will permit some institutions to improve their financial operations over time without compromising their administration of the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary would like to clarify that any letter of credit that an institution is required to submit to the Secretary must be in a form and amount acceptable to the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary agrees with the commenters on the provision requiring an institution to have met all its financial obligations during the preceding two award years. The Secretary has decided to clarify this provision in the manner in which a similar provision has been clarified in &sect;668.15 (see the discussion in &sect;668.15 on this issue).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary would also like to clarify when third party financial guarantees or assumptions of liabilities by owners are required. Institutions that demonstrate financial responsibility under the requirements of &sect;668.15(b) and &sect;668.15(d) and are in compliance with all other requirements of this subpart generally are entitled to full certification. An institution that, despite meeting the requirements of &sect;668.15(b) and (d), falls within one of the categories in &sect;668.15(c)(2) is not considered financially responsible and therefore cannot be fully certified. These categories include a limitation, suspension, or termination by the Secretary or a guaranty agency of the institution's participation at any time within the previous five years or a settlement to resolve such an action. Also included are audit or program review findings during the two most recent audits or program reviews amounting to more than five percent of the institution's Title IV, HEA program funds for a given award year, a citation for failure to submit acceptable audit reports in a timely fashion during any of the previous five years, and a failure to address satisfactorily any compliance problems still identified in program reviews or audits after the institution has exhausted its appeals of those findings. The Secretary considers any of these characteristics sufficiently detrimental to the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs to provide that an institution meeting them is not financially responsible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, to emphasize the seriousness with which the Secretary views these institutional failings, to protect Federal funds, and to deter institutions from acting in a manner that could cause them to fall within one of these categories, the Secretary will refuse even to provisionally certify such an institution, unless the appropriate additional financial guarantees and assumptions of liability are furnished. In the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary had also proposed to apply this treatment regarding provisional certification to any institution failing the financial responsibility standards of &sect;668.15 during the previous five years. The Secretary believes that a modification of this last provision is in order. The Secretary therefore wishes to clarify that any institution that fails to demonstrate financial responsibility under its current audit, and that has failed to do so at least once under the standards in effect during the preceding five years (other than for a reason described in &sect;668.15(c)(2)) is also required to post financial guarantees and furnish assumptions of liability in accordance with &sect;668.13(d)(2). This additional safeguard is warranted where an institution does not meet the current standard for demonstrating financial responsibility and has failed to do so at least once during the preceding five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that it is appropriate to put in place a procedure where such financial guarantees and assumptions of liability will be required from institutions that come within the provisions in &sect;668.13(d)(2). Rather than exercising discretion in whether to require such guarantees at all, the Department will examine the specific circumstances presented by each such institution and set the required amount and terms of the financial guarantees and assumptions of liability in accordance with the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The requirements for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for institutions that are not financially responsible have been amended to make clear that the criteria of this section are not required for an institution that meets the exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility under &sect;668.15(d). The regulations have been amended to clarify that any required submission of a letter of credit must be in an amount and in a form acceptable to the Secretary. Section 668.13(d)(2) has been clarified to explain that financial guarantees are only required if the institution comes within the requirements of &sect;668.15(c)(2), or where the institution fails to demonstrate financial responsibility under its current audit and has failed to do so at least one other time under the standards in effect during the preceding five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

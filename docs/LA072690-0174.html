			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGISLATION WOULD HELP WORKERS IN DEFENSE LAYOFFS  </P> <P> Congress is considering legislation to help defense-industry workers who are  laid off because of cost-cutting in Congress and the defense industry:  </P> <P> * House Bill 3999, introduced by Rep. Mary Rose Oakar (D-Ohio), would provide  about $200 million for programs including more unemployment benefits for  defense workers, educational grants for retraining, and reimbursement money for  job-search and relocation expenses. The program also sets aside funds for  entrepreneurs who want to market their defense-industry know-how in the private  sector. The bill would create an administrative staff, but not a new  bureaucracy, Oakar said at a public hearing in Paramount on Monday. She said  the policy-making committee would include the heads of already-existing  departments, such as the Labor Department, Defense Department and Small  Business Administration.  </P> <P> * House Bill 5327, authored by Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae) and introduced last  Friday, would return 10% of defense cuts to the communities affected by the  loss of these federal funds. The secretary of labor would determine which areas  would be eligible. Cities could use the money for job training or other needed  programs. Her bill also penalizes contractors that relocate, requiring them to  leave behind 20% of their contracts' value when they move their facilities and  leave employees behind.  </P> <P> Boxer has also introduced legislation she said will help communities recover  from the closing of military bases, which is another aspect of defense  cutbacks. One bill provides financial incentives to federal employees who  accept early retirement. Another gives military employees first crack at  federal jobs when their base is taken over by another agency. A third bill  mandates 60 days' notice when the government eliminates jobs at a military  base.  </P> <P> These bills remain in various congressional committees. Oakar's bill, more than  three years in the making, could be voted on this fall. Boxer's legislation  faces a more uncertain fate. Tens of thousands of aerospace workers will have  already lost their jobs by the time any of this proposed legislation would take  effect.  </P></p>

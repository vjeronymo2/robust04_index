			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Symonds Following its brief success in winning new orders earlier in the year, a significant downturn in the second half left Symonds Engineering with a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 611,000 for the year to end-March. The outcome at this Hertfordshire-based engineer compared with a profit of Pounds 156,000 last time and came from turnover down by Pounds 890,000 to Pounds 4.38m. The pre-tax figure was further depressed by reorganisation costs of Pounds 115,000. During the past few months a strategic review of the business had been completed. As a result of this a number of redundancies had been made and operational changes instigated, the directors said. Losses per share were 4.593p (1.102p earnings). There is no final dividend proposed, leaving the total for the year at 0.15p against 1p.</p>

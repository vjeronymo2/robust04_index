			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rhone-Poulenc inspires Paris bourse Bourses seemed less sensitive than before to US data, perhaps waiting for today's jobs figures; in the afternoon, they were more responsive to the upswing in US share prices, writes Our Markets Staff. Stock-picking seemed to come back into fashion and there were some strong rises in individual stocks. PARIS regained all of Wednesday's losses with a rise of 2 per cent in what brokers described as a technical rebound. The CAC-40 index ended 37.53 up at 1,911.13. Turnover was FFr3.7bn. Rhone-Poulenc provided inspiration as it surprised analysts with stronger than expected nine-month results, and the shares rose FFr9.50 or 7.5 per cent to FFr133.90. Analysts upgraded their full-year estimates after a 47 per cent jump in net profits. The chemical company's results were helped by lower tax charges. There was also good news for Euro Disney, the beleaguered theme park operator, which was twice suspended limit up after reporting a smaller than expected loss for the year to September, before ending the day up FFr1.25 or 18 per cent at FFr8.15. Elsewhere, Elf Aquitaine, FFr2.50 higher at FFr370.30, said that it had sold a 10.3 per cent stake in Enterprise Oil, of the UK, as expected, and taken a 1.5 per cent stake in Renault, whose partial privatisation began yesterday. The oil group still retains a 12.9 per cent holding in Enterprise. FRANKFURT moved from a Dax index rise of 9.13 to 2,051.48 on the session, helped by a firmer dollar and stable bonds, to one of 21.46 at 2,061.37 at the end of Ibis trading, lifted further by short covering and a 4.8 per cent rise in west German industrial orders in September. Turnover fell from DM6.1bn to DM4.9bn. Early strength in financials, automotive stocks, engineers and in Veba, the energy and chemicals group, was extended later. In financials, Allianz rose DM33 to DM2,300 on the Ibis day, and Deutsche Bank by DM13 to DM742. In automotives, which like a stronger dollar, Volkswagen climbed DM7.10 to DM445 following a big rise in its October US car sales, and MAN by DM4.60 to DM401.50 after saying it expected a significant improvement in current year earnings. Veba, up DM9.20 at DM503.20, said that it will decide in mid-1995 whether it will list its shares in New York. By then it would have calculated annual results for two years in a row according to US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), described yesterday by the Veba chairman, Mr Ulrich Hartmann, as 'actually not so bad'. AMSTERDAM was boosted by another clutch of strong results in a week which has given investors in Dutch companies an opportunity to feel confident regarding medium- term prospects for the market. The AEX index moved ahead 4.61 to 410.36. Philips saw strong US demand after the company reported an impressive set of figures. These showed that it had nearly trebled its profits in the third quarter, helped by high demand in markets such as the Far East and Brazil. The shares rose Fl 1.80 to Fl 56.50, while those in the Polygram subsidiary reaped the benefit by putting on Fl 2.40 at Fl 75.50. MILAN eventually regained its upward momentum following Wednesday's losses, still focusing on banks. The Comit index registered a 1.67 fall to 623.87, but the real-time Mibtel finished 79 higher at 10,035. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, decided that the time was ripe for investors to revisit Italy, in spite of continuing political uncertainty and the bourse's underperformance in recent months. Mr Richard Davidson, who increased its weighting in the European portfolio, pointed to the outlook for inflation and a further improvement in the current account as compelling reasons to buy, on expectations of a market rebound next year. BCI gained L109 at L3,570 as analysts conluded that its much heralded bid for control of Ambroveneto was likely to succeed, but some questioned the benefits of the deal for BCI. Ambroveneto was L23 higher at L5,338. Credito Italiano slipped L5 to L1,584 as it vowed to continue with its L19,000 a share suit for 48 per cent of a reluctant Credito Romagnolo. The latter picked up another L238 to L16,533. ZURICH marched 1.4 per cent ahead as the stronger dollar brought an improvement in sentiment, and the SMI index rose 34.8 to 2,534.8. Insurers were mostly firmer after Winterthur issued a favourable 1994 profits forecast. Winterthur registered picked up SFr21 to SFr641 as investors switched from the recently strong Swiss Re, SFr 6 lower at SFr755. Zurich Insurance registered advanced SFr37 to SFr1,200. The firm US currency supported chemicals issues. Roche certificates picked up SFr160 to SFr5,810 and Ciba was SFr11 ahead at SFr732. Among second liners, Schindler bearers rose another SFr45 to SFr1,525, and a SFr40 advance to SFr2,560 by Baloise, the insurer, was attributed to speculative foreign buying. MADRID sprang to life in the afternoon, but the quality of the recovery came into question. In terms of gains, senior blue chips and ADRs took second place to the construction sector and a collection of unrelated issues: these included the stainless steel group Acerinox, up Pta450 at Pta14,050; the retailer Pryca, up Pta80 at Pta2,125; Tabacalera, Pta70 better at Pta3,320; and Viscofan, up Pta40 at Pta2,160. STOCKHOLM fell on rising debt yields, following a controversial government austerity package. The Affarsvarlden General index shed 23.80 or 1.6 per cent to 1,447.30.

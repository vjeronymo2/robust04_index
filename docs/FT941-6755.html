			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Return to the black after the dark years - Philips On Thursday, the long-suffering shareholders in Philips, the Dutch electronics group, will find out whether they can expect to receive a dividend this year - for the first time since the company fell into difficulties in 1990 and embarked on its 'Centurion' restructuring programme under its then new president, Mr Jan Timmer. Analysts are divided on whether Philips will resume a pay-out with the 1993 results. An immediate resumption of the last dividend of Fl 2.00 per share, paid out of 1989 profits, will not be possible, but there may be room for around Fl 0.50. There is certainly no doubt that Philips will be reporting a return to profit. The company generated an exceptional gain of Fl 1.1bn (Dollars 570m) on the sale of its 35 per cent stake in Matsushita Electronics Corp, a joint venture with Matsushita of Japan. This will be more than enough to reverse the previous year's net loss of Fl 900m. Even without the help of extraordinary items, Philips is expected to post a net profit of Fl 500m-Fl 850m. Much will depend on whether Christmas shoppers stocked up on consumer electronics products to help the fortunes of the company's single biggest business. Consumer electronics is expected to have remained loss-making in 1993, but Philips has said it hopes to reach break-even this year. Another big question is how many consumers have been tempted to buy the company's two latest mass market products, the digital compact cassette (DCC), which is designed to replace the analogue cassette and to compete with Sony's Mini Disc system, and compact disc-interactive, a multi-media version of the popular CD player. Philips will be aided by the robust results expected from PolyGram, its 75 per cent-owned music and film company, reporting in London today.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW PAKISTAN CABINET SHOWS LINKS TO ZIA  </P> <P> Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's new Cabinet brings back nearly a dozen veteran  politicians with links to the late military dictator Gen. Zia ul-Haq.  </P> <P> The 18-member Cabinet was sworn in Friday night by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.  </P> <P> The ministry portfolios were announced Saturday.  </P> <P> Defense was the only portfolio that was not assigned. But analysts say Sharif  probably will keep it, following the tradition of his predecessors.  </P> <P> The new Cabinet is dominated by veterans of the Muslim League, the largest of  18 parties in the right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance that swept into power  in the Oct. 24 parliamentary elections.  </P> <P> Sharif, a 41-year-old industrialist who launched his political career during  Zia's rule, was sworn in as prime minister Wednesday to head the country's  fifth civilian government in 43 years.  </P> <P> His Cabinet is one of the smallest, especially compared to the record 58-member  Cabinet of his predecessor, ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.  </P> <P> Two of the most important portfolios will remain with veteran politicians who  have links to the Zia era. They were also members of the caretaker government  handpicked by the president after he dismissed Bhutto's 20-month-old government  on Aug. 6 on charges of corruption and mismanagement.  </P> <P> Sahabzada Yaqub Khan will remain foreign minister, Sartaj Aziz will stay as  finance minister and Chaudry Shujaat Hussain was appointed minister for  Industries and the Interior.  </P></p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Man in the News: Italy's ultimate referee - Oscar Luigi Scalfaro The deepening problems of the Berlusconi government have turned the political atmosphere in Rome venomous and conspiratorial. Wild rumours circulate at high velocity. Emissaries have begun to test new alliances. Knives are being sharpened to settle old scores. In the corridors of parliament and newspaper newsrooms, the talk has ceased to be whether Mr Silvio Berlusconi can survive as prime minister after being placed under investigation for corruption this week. It is rather of when and how he will go, and which government will come after. Moving to centre stage is President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the 76-year-old head of state and one of Italy's most experienced politicians. From the Quirinale Palace, once the residence of popes, he has been issuing terse statements indicating obliquely how events should unfold. The president has made no secret of his distaste for the media magnate turned politician, and does not share Mr Berlusconi's view that he can emerge fighting from the current crisis. Although Mr Scalfaro's constitutional authority is limited, his role will be crucial as events unfold. He has the power to dissolve parliament and to ask someone to form a new government. President Scalfaro is also recognised as the ultimate referee of Italy's volatile political system. Thus he enjoys considerable powers of moral suasion through making his own views known. To this must be added his enormous experience, having entered politics in 1946 in Italy's first postwar parliament. During the six months of the Berlusconi administration, President Scalfaro has frequently felt obliged to call the premier and his coalition to order. From the outset, he warned Mr Berlusconi of the potential problems arising from a conflict between his role as premier and his ownership of Fininvest, Italy's second largest private group. He intervened, for example, to remind the coalition that the RAI state broadcasting network could not become a tool of government. He took the side of the Bank of Italy when government tried to impose an outside candidate as new director-general. And as head of the higher magistrates' council, the governing body of the judiciary, he helped deflect government complaints that the magistrates were victimising Mr Berlusconi. On each occasion, his views have carried more weight than is strictly due to the president, undermining the government's position. Indeed Mr Berlusconi and his supporters see the president as a fifth column working to bring down the rightwing coalition government. Relations between the president and the government this week came close to getting out of control. President Scalfaro was furious over the tone and content of Tuesday's televised address by Mr Berlusconi, given when he learnt that he was under investigation for alleged corruption while running his business empire. Mr Berlusconi attacked the Milan magistrates for conducting a vendetta against him, and threatened early elections. Presidential aides promptly leaked to the media their views on Mr Berlusconi  -'a naturally unpleasant man who believes he is simpatico to everyone'. The Berlusconi camp countered, labelling Mr Scalfaro as 'the worst of the old Christian Democrats concentrated in one pill'. Matters were made worse when Mr Giuseppe Tatarella, the deputy prime minister, warned President Scalfaro that he was in no position to moralise when he had his own dirty linen. Mr Tatarella alluded to Mr Scalfaro's links while interior minister between 1983 and 1987 with the discredited intelligence services. His name was frequently mentioned during a recent trial of senior members of the services found guilty of embezzling more than Dollars 50m, who alleged he was aware of their practices while interior minister. This is Mr Scalfaro's most sensitive spot - and could yet weaken his position. However, the president was reportedly so angry at these insinuations, he postponed for 24 hours a formal meeting with Mr Berlusconi to discuss the future of the government. After the meeting, held yesterday, the presidential office refused to comment and it was left to the prime minister to say doggedly: 'There is no war with the Quirinale and it was a normal discussion as on every other occasion.' However, Mr Berlusconi failed to obtain the message of support from the president he needs to help him survive. He and President Scalfaro are at odds on almost every aspect of how to proceed. The only common ground seems to be a realisation that a financial crisis cannot be added to the political uncertainty. Both are agreed that priority must be given to passing the 1995 budget through parliament. This means the prime minister need not resign immediately just because he is under investigation by Milan magistrates for as-yet unproven allegations of corruption. But Mr Scalfaro has already begun to sound out the prospects for a successor government. He is against a quick dissolution of parliament, since the last elections were only in March. He wants to build a broad-based government that would look to the Popular party (PPI) - the former Christian Democrats  -in the centre and would embrace the former communist party of the Democratic Left (PDS). This new coalition would probably not include the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, the current mainstay of Mr Berlusconi's government along with his Forza Italia movement. Its task would be limited to rewriting the defective electoral laws of August 1993 and introducing constitutional reforms. Mr Berlusconi, in contrast, sees his only real chance of survival in staying close to the MSI/National Alliance and going to the country as quickly as possible. He would hope to cast himself in the role of a victim of the old political system. In this scenario, Mr Scalfaro, elected in 1992 by a subsequently discredited parliament, would be presented as one of the chief villains. The stage is now set for a show-down between the president and the prime minister. With political guile pitted against an inexperienced premier cornered like a wounded animal, the odds must be on Mr Scalfaro getting his way.</p>

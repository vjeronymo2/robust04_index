			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SETTLEMENT IN COUNCILMAN'S SUIT APPROVED;  </P> <P> IRWINDALE: THE CITY WILL PAY LEGAL COSTS IN THE PACT, BUT IT IS AGREED THAT  PATRICIO MIRANDA DID NOT KNOWINGLY VIOLATE LAWS IN A PROPERTY LEASE.  </P> <P> After 18 months of fractious dispute and nearly $400,000 in legal bills, the  City Council has approved an out-of-court settlement of a conflict-of-interest  lawsuit that has dogged longtime Councilman Patricio Miranda.  </P> <P> The settlement states that Miranda did not knowingly violate  conflict-of-interest laws when he leased property to Irwindale Associates, a  development company. The company, operating under the name Hopkins Development,  had several projects pending before Miranda and the rest of the city's  Community Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> In response to the suit, which was filed by resident and longtime Miranda  critic Brenda Marin, Miranda denied knowing the two companies were the same.  "If there's anything I know, it's that I didn't know," he said after the  settlement was approved Nov. 21 by a vote of 3 to 2.  </P> <P> Under the settlement, the city will pay for Marin's legal costs, which totaled  $76,964. Marin also agreed to drop the suit against Miranda, who in turn  dropped a cross-complaint he filed against former city redevelopment consultant  Fred Lyte, charging that Lyte had conspired to conceal the Hopkins connection  from him.  </P> <P> However, in acknowledgment that the lease was in technical violation of state  conflict-of-interest laws, Miranda will donate $2,500 to the city's scholarship  fund.  </P> <P> Lyte also will contribute $2,500 to the fund. "I had two choices: One was to go  along with the settlement, or I could spend another $100,000 fighting this  lawsuit," he said, denying any wrongdoing. "It was not an admission of anything  -- it's just a practical matter."  </P> <P> Marin told the council that she had opted to settle because she was "trying to  act in the best interests of the city." A trial could drag on for years, she  said, but with the agreement, "I'm getting what I wanted. He's admitting that  he did something wrong."  </P> <P> The settlement, with its large price tag, comes at a time when the council is  trying to cut the city's legal costs, which have surpassed the million-dollar  mark within the past few years.  </P> <P> City Atty. Charles Martin, who said the case cost about $400,000 in legal fees,  was unable to provide details of specific payments to private attorneys who  represented Miranda at city expense.  </P></p>

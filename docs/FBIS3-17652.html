			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Uzbekistan does in no way interfere into the  internal affairs of neighboring Afghanistan. "The Afghan  allegations on this score cause sincere indignation in  Tashkent," Uzbek ambassador to Russia Yusuf Abdullayev said at  a news conference in Moscow Monday.    He recalled that Hikmat Abdurrahman, special envoy of the  Afghan president, had recently paid a visit to Moscow where he  visited, in particular, the Uzbek embassy. "The Afghan official  expressed concern over some `interference' into Afghan affairs  by Tashkent and the secret talks that had allegedly taken place  between Uzbek leaders and Uzbek General Rashid Dostam.  Uzbekistan did receive Dostam last August but not as `a rebel  Afghan general' but as a special envoy of the Afghan president.  The meetings were held officially and openly. There were no  below the board dealings. All insinuations by the Afghan  authorities are outrageous."    The Uzbek ambassador denied Abdurrahman's allegations that  Tajik opposition fighters underwent training in Uzbekistan.  Only a Martian cannot see that this is untrue. These  inventions of the Afghan authorities cause surprise," Abdullayev  said.    Abdullayev said that his country "faithfully observed the  principle of respect for sovereignty of other countries and  non-interference into their own affairs. Uzbekistan is an  island of stability, calm and civic peace in the volatile  Central Asian region. Resolving the Afghan situation is one of  our primary concerns," Abdullayev declared.    He said that "the Soviet leaders ignored the lessons of the  three Anglo-Afghan wars. As a result, the Soviet action there  had an ignominious end. We have too many common roots with  Afghanistan to forget such things. Nobody has succeeded in  dismembering and subjugating Afghanistan. It would be strange  if we tried this," the ambassador said.    He said that Uzbekistan had traditional good relations with  Afghanistan's northern provinces inhabited chiefly by ethnic  Uzbeks. "This is normal cooperation with neighbors which does  not imply attempts at capturing the area," Abdullayev said.    In his words, "Uzbekistan's interference into Afghan affairs  amounted to supplying $13.8 Mn [million] worth of electricity  to Afghanistan while 300 Afghan students graduated Uzbek  universities free."    Asked by INTERFAX about the outlook for a settlement in  Tajikistan, Abdullayev emphasized, "The sooner Dushanbe and  opposition sit together, the better. We in Tashkent think that  all parties in the conflict should be legitimately participants  in the talks. Simultaneously Tajikistan should develop closer  ties with its neighbors, otherwise no outside aid would be  helpful."    He expressed the hope that Afghanistan would tangibly  contribute to resolution of the Tajik crisis. "At least we would  like to believe what Kabul officials say about this," he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "China's Transportation `Bottlenecks' Tighten </F> Daily"]    [Text] In recent years the disparity between the  transportation and shipping industry which had been the vanguard  of the national economy and the speed of economic development  has been widening. As compared with 1990, in 1992 only 187  kilometers of railway lines were added while the maritime  transport capability of the Ministry of Transportation decreased  by over 4,100 vessels. Coming into 1993, because of the limited  increases in the capabilities of transport equipment over the  past two years and the sustained high speed of economic  expansion, the problems with constrictive "bottlenecks" have  become ever more prominent.  <H3>  Extremely Limited Growth in Transportation; Obvious Changes  in the Mix of Products Being Shipped </H3>   From the beginning of the year to date, impelled by the  continued strong economic expansion, transport demand has  continued to swell, while the reciprocal transport output has  stalled and not increased, or increased only microscopically.  In the period from January to August, railway haulage amounted  to 1.036 billion tons, an increase of only 1.7 percent over last  year; maritime transport haulage increased only 2.6 percent,  while the specialized transport units under the highway  transport departments showed a decrease in output. This was in  sharp contrast with the increases in the national economy.    There were obvious changes in the mix of products being  shipped. The shipment of investment type products increased  greatly, while the quantity of the types of products normally  shipped fell sharply. According to statistics for January to  July, there was an average increase of over 10 percent in  shipments of metal ores, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals,  non-metallic ores, mine construction materials, cement,  chemicals, and industrial machinery, while there was a  corresponding large decrease in shipments of phosphates,  foodstuffs, cotton, fertilizers and farm chemicals, livestock,  and farm sideline products. The decrease in volume was over 15  percent for all of the above products except for foodstuffs  which decreased only 2.3 percent. The shipment of coal, which  represents over 40 percent of total railway transport volume  also fell 1.4 percent. Such decreases have seldom been seen in  recent years. Regional volume of maritime transport of  investment type products also showed very prominent increases:  according to statistics, for the first half of the year alone,  regional maritime transport of steel products, gravel, cement  and similar goods increased al almost 30 percent over the totals  for the same period last year.  <H3>  Passenger Volume Up Greatly, Ratio of Long-Distance  Travelers Increases </H3>   Since the spring of this year, and following the peak of the  Spring Festival period, the off-season did not turn off and the  peak season kept peaking, so that by the end of August, the  volume of railway passenger travel had reached 703 million  trips, an increase of 21.9 percent over the same period last  year, with medium and long distance trip volume representing  over 80 percent of the total. The average distance traveled rose  from 315 kilometers in 1992 to 334 kilometers this year. By the  normal practice of previous years, this would be the equivalent  of running an additional 1000 passenger cars in the first half  of the year.  <H3>  Gap Between Supply and Demand Widens, Transport Crisis  Worsens </H3>   Over the past several years there have been only limited  increases in equipment capabilities and the exploitation of  latent capabilities through renovation has just about exhausted  its potentials, and the capacity for guaranteed shipment has  fallen off greatly. According to concerned departments, the  first half of this year represented one of the most severely  critical periods in the history of the railway industry. The  railway freight car demand-fulfilled rate has averaged only a  bit over 60 percent; the gap between trunk route haulage and  upper limits has been about 40 percent, both of these being some  10 percentage points below the normal year's averages. It has  become difficult to guarantee shipment of materials for some  major projects and national command type plans, such as coal  shipments for the entire nation's chemical industry. The May  command contract plan called for shipment of 162,000 tons while  the actual shipment plan allowed for only 87,000 tons but less  than 80,000 tons was actually shipped. For the iron and steel  industry nationwide, the external cause of shortfalls in  deliveries of steel contracted by the state was attributed to  transportation problems in 62.3 percent of the cases of short  deliveries. Especially in the south-east coastal areas this  year, masses of passengers and freight required transport  southward, causing the crisis situations along the already  over-capacity Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai rail lines  to become even more spectacular. Only a little over one quarter  of the demand for freight shipment south to Guangdong can be  fulfilled. Many of the factories and the mines along the trunk  routes have already limited production or stopped production  because they are unable to obtain guaranteed shipment. The  crisis in passenger transport is also critical: along the trunk  lines, the passenger car passenger overload rate is commonly  above 50 percent. Some localities have been forced to use  freight cars to clear out laborers awaiting transport.    At present, while concentrating on the construction of basic  railroad facilities, we should also work diligently to expand  transport capabilities within a short period of time,  concentrate on getting the railroads to organize their  dispatching and establish a railway style of working, work  diligently to increase the full-load, non-stop transport of  railway freight cars and medium and long distance passenger  transport, further cut back on short haul freight and short trip  passenger transport, with the aim of having the railways  continue to concentrate on the development of high volume, long  distance, non-stop transportation.</p>

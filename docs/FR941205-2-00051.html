(CSXT), trackage rights in Indiana and Jefferson Counties, PA, over the portions of the Indiana and Ridge Subdivisions that it is acquiring and leasing for a coextensive period of time. The trackage rights on the Indiana Subdivision are overhead. The trackage rights on the Ridge Subdivision are both overhead and local, but the local trackage rights are restricted to limestone, limestone substitutes, ammonia, transformers and coal terminating at the Keystone Generating Station at Shelocta, PA. The limestone and coal transportation will be further restricted to commodities originating at quarries or mines served by CSXT or short line railroads connecting solely with CSXT, or originating or transloading on The Three Rivers Railway, Buffalo &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad, Inc. (B&amp;PR), Allegheny Railroad, Beech Mountain Railroad, West Virginia Northern Railroad, Elk River Railroad, or Strouds Creek &amp; Muddlety Railroad. No traffic originating on lines owned or leased by Conrail may be transported by CSXT in local service under these trackage rights. The overhead trackage rights are restricted to movements to the portion of the Ridge Subdivision between Shelocta and Clarksburg and will terminate if CSXT abandons that portion of track.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The trackage rights qualify under the class exemption procedures of 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7), and ordinarily would have become effective 50 days after filing. However, they are related to two other transactions that applicants simult-aneously seek approval for as one integral transaction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Accordingly, at applicants' request all three proceedings were considered together and the effective date of this notice of exemption was necessarily delayed. This notice of exemption will become effective on December 5, 1994, as will the related decision in Finance Docket No. 32544 and the related notice of exemption in Finance Docket No. 32544 (Sub-No. 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In Finance Docket No. 32544, Conrail proposes to lease from CSXT, for a 30-year term with an option to renew for an additional 30 years, a portion of the Indiana Subdivision from the connection with B&amp;PR, at DC Tower (milepost 0.0 at Cloe) to the connection with the Ridge Subdivision at Ridge Branch Junction (milepost 26.74). Conrail also proposes to purchase from CSXT a portion of the Ridge Subdivision, from its connection with the Indiana Subdivision at milepost 0.0 to the rail switch into the Keystone electric generating plant at milepost 5.83 near Shelocta.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Finance Docket No. 32544 (Sub-No. 1) Conrail will acquire overhead trackage rights from CSXT on the portion of its Indiana Subdivision from its connection with the Ridge Subdivision at Ridge Branch Junction (milepost 26.6) near Creekside to a connection to be established at a point to be mutually agreed upon between milepost 41.5 and milepost 44.7 near Josephine. The trackage rights will be for a 30-year term with an option to renew for an additional 30 years and are limited to the movement of limestone, limestone substitutes, ammonia, rail materials, transformers, and coal terminating at Shelocta.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7). If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ab initio.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: John J. Paylor, 2001 Market Street_16A, Philadelphia, PA 19101&hyph;1416.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the trackage rights will be protected under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Norfolk and Western Ry.

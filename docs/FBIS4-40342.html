			<p>BFN     [Text] Azeri President Geydar Aliyev favors the signing of  a comprehensive political agreement, which would solve all  problems associated with the Armenian-Azeri conflict in a just  manner.    In line with the document, international forces or observers  will be deployed in the region and the problem of security for  Karabakh Armenians will be solved, said the president during the  meeting in Baku on Wednesday with the chairman of the Minsk CSCE  group, Jan Eliasson.    The president repeated the position of Azerbaijan according  to which it is necessary to observe the cease-fire and achieve  the liberation of the captured territory of Azerbaijan.    Aliyev accused Armenia of dual policies towards the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, for example,  of Yerevan's refusal to sign the CSCE plan for the conflict  settlement, said the Azeri leader.    Eliasson said that the CSCE should act as a mediator in the  settlement of the Armenian-Azeri conflict.</p>

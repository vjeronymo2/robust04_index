Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin sent a letter to  Luzhkov on May 27 to demand cancellation of the illegal  instruction within three days. The mayor told a news conference  on June 3 he does not plan to change his instructions and "will  gladly go to the procurator's office" to prove the correctness  and lawfulness of "special privatization" in the Russian capital.

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Dish shortage curbs satellite installations A SHORTAGE of satellite dishes is slowing the growth of satellite television in the important autumn season, Raymond Snoddy writes. A survey of independent retailers by Continental Research, the independent market research company, found that 78 per cent of outlets were experiencing stock shortages, although supplies were now starting to improve. Continental believes the shortage was a factor in a decline in installations last month. The FT Satellite Monitor shows that in September an estimated 61,000 new dishes were installed, compared with 73,000 in August. There were 65,000 installations in September last year.</p>

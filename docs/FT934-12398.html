			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Lenders warn on mortgage relief MORTGAGE interest tax relief should be increased for first-time buyers and remain unchanged for other home owners if the housing market's fragile recovery is not to be jeopardised, the Council of Mortgage Lenders told the government yesterday. In its pre-Budget advice to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the council, which represents building societies and centralised lenders such as banks, warned that the housing market was on a knife-edge. Mr Adrian Coles, the council's director-general, said: 'There is really very little sign of the market recovering, despite a year of low interest rates since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism.' The council also called for an interest rate cut and a successor to the Business Expansion Scheme to bring repossessed houses back into use. Mortgage interest available through income support to people who have lost their jobs should not see further restrictions, it said. Under its proposals, new buyers would be eligible for tax relief on loans up to Pounds 60,000 in the first year, with that figure falling during the first five years of the loan to the present limit of Pounds 30,000. Any expansion of mortgage tax relief would be a severe change of direction for the government, given the government's moves in recent Budgets to restrict its scope.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claus Gennrich on interview with Federal </F> Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn on 7 January: "Kohl: NATO Must  Take the Security Needs of Eastern Neighbors Seriously"]    [Text] In one week, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]  will formally decide that the president of the Federal  Constitutional Court, Herzog, will be its candidate for the  presidential election in May. In an interview with FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE on Friday [7 January], Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl  said: "The leading bodies of the CDU -- the party executive  committee and the presidium -- at their first session after the  Christmas recess, scheduled for next Friday and Saturday will  also discuss the issue of the nomination of the candidate for  the office of federal president and make a decision; in  addition, we will stick to what I announced before, namely that  we will also discuss the matter with our coalition partner, the  Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]." Yet, such talks have  obviously not yet been scheduled for the next few days. For  Kohl, the talks of the Western alliance scheduled for Monday and  Tuesday in Brussels have priority.    Kohl said: "When we discuss European security within NATO in  the next few days, we will try to combine two important  objectives." Kohl said that as a first objective, the justified  security needs of Germany's Eastern neighbors have to be "taken  very seriously." The chancellor stated: "If we, as the NATO  document says, offer `Partnership for Peace' to our neighbors,  such as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, then, to me,  that means that this is not a mere diplomatic formula, but that  we are providing clear prospects for future NATO entry." In  connection with security policy, Kohl then switched from NATO to  the European Union [EU]: "This includes that I am absolutely in  favor of EU membership for these countries once they fulfill the  economic conditions." According to Kohl, the second objective,  which Germany will pursue at the NATO meeting, is: "I am in  favor of NATO extending and shaping security relations with  Russia to a close level to dispel from the very beginning fears  that can be heard in Moscow -- namely that the West was pursuing  a policy of isolation toward Russia." Without actually  mentioning the name of the nationalist politician Zhirinovskiy,  Kohl said: "The shrill extremist noises one can hear in Moscow  these days must not be ignored; however, they must not dissuade  us from continuing our course. On the contrary, they are an  additional reason to maintain the close relations with  particular care."    The dramatic development after the collapse of the Soviet  Union does not only offer the chance for building a law-governed  democratic system on the basis of the market economy but also  dangers. One can now see that nationalism and imperial claims  may increase.    Kohl concluded: "I clearly support President Yeltsin's  policy of reform and I expect that in the process of  establishing a democratic system, a relapse into old thinking  can be warded off." For 1994, it is important for Germany to be  ready to acknowledge the dramatic changes in the world. Kohl  said that Bismarck's statement was still valid -- that is, that  a nation's fate is determined by foreign policy. Kohl  criticized widespread provincial thinking in Germany when the  situation in Germany requires "us to recognize again the  outstanding importance of foreign policy."    Kohl said that he saw it as one of his greatest achievements  that it was possible to reduce, at least in part, distrust,  which was noticeable in connection with German unification in  1989 and 1990 in the East and the West. "I am proud that  relations with the United States, France, and Russia are very  good." At the moment, political unification of Europe is more  important than ever. Too many people are looking at Europe only  under economic aspects. It is true that Germany's economic  development depended on its integration in economic and monetary  union, but "even more important for us is to understand that 48  years of peace for Germany are not a matter of course; the  question of European unification is ultimately the question of  war and peace in the 21st century." The experience in the  former Yugoslavia shows that the evil spirits of chauvinism,  religious hatred, and nationalism are "not dead": "No one  should think that they could not be resurrected in other parts  of Europe." European unification, however, offers the strongest  bulwark. The Germans and the Europeans must not indulge in  self-contemplation. The development of North-South relations are  dramatic. Kohl said: "For me, it is of particular importance to  look at the economic and political development in Asia with more  attention than in the past." He said that he was trying to  intensify relations with China, Japan, India, and Indonesia.    Economically, 1993 was a particularly difficult year for  Germany. "Recession has mercilessly laid bare our structural  weaknesses." Deficiencies of the past decades have been clearly  exposed. Securing Germany's future requires a process of  rethinking in all areas: "As an export nation, we have become  too expensive due to our high wage level." Yet, the  difficulties cannot only be blamed on the high wage level.  Germany has lost ground as far as translating research results  into new products and tapping new export markets are concerned.  <H5>  Prospects for 1994 </H5>   The parties, the business community, and the trade unions  are  all to blame for the deficiencies. However, there are now "many  favorable prospects" indicating that in 1994, "we will be able  to stop the negative trend." In his assessment of the  situation, Kohl referred to the recovery of the economy in the  United States and other countries. The stock exchange was also  optimistic. "We have good chances of clearly forcing the  inflation rate under 4 percent again." Yet, despite the fact  that there was more light at the end of the tunnel, the  necessary development at the labor market will follow only with  much delay. Therefore, the struggle against unemployment and  the creation of new jobs are the most important objective. Kohl  said: "Unemployment is not a matter of statistical figures for  me. First of all, I see the fate of the affected people and  families." He was hoping that in the upcoming wage talks, both  sides of industry were taking the stabilization of the labor  market into consideration: "Safe jobs must have priority over  wage increases."    Kohl added: "The state must set reasonable signals in the  public service sphere as well." He considers it important for  all parties involved to respond to the challenges of the labor  market with the necessary sincerity and with new ideas. As one  example, Kohl endorsed part-time jobs. By European standards,  Germany was offering the lowest number of part-time jobs, only  15 percent. If it were possible to raise the number of  part-time jobs to the level of the Netherlands (34 percent), as  many as 2 million people could find employment in Germany.  Surveys in the old laender have shown that some 2 million fully  employed people would be willing to work fewer hours.  <H5>  Head Wind and Fear </H5>   Kohl claimed that last year, the Federal Government made  considerable achievements for securing the future with its  contribution to the conclusion of the GATT talks: "As a result  of the GATT agreement, Germany will make up to 50 billion German  marks [DM] in prosperity profits." Considerable improvement in  the sphere of housing construction has been achieved: "In  western Germany, 400,000 new apartments were built in 1993, more  than the record number of 1977; in eastern Germany, the number  of construction licenses doubled over 1992." Despite such  success, the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the coalition  have to struggle with a head wind. Nevertheless, what the  people really think is more favorable than the picture that is  generally presented. In all Western countries and Germany, one  can see that many people are unable to cope with the dramatic  changes. The rapid succession of images and events has  contributed to a feeling of insecurity: "Existential fears have  increased."    In the election year, people might be "greatly enticed to  use  this fear for political profits." The loss of faith as a result  of the major secularization step has created fear. The request  to the moral force of the churches for a consensus of values has  become more important. "Qualities that were ridiculed during  many years by left-wing forces as secondary virtues are now more  important than ever: compassion, solidarity, a sense of reality,  courage, hard work, and loyalty." One will be unable to  overcome economic difficulties without reflecting on these  values and foundations. We must stop thinking only about our  well-acquired rights: "Insisting on the status quo will not  take us any further."    The question is not to reduce but to rebuild our social  system. Hard work must be worth the effort again. The stability  of the currency must have priority. That means: "We must  maintain a very tight public budget." Responsibility lies first  of all with the politicians: "I personally acknowledge that."  However, the politicians cannot achieve everything by  themselves: "In no way can I accept a trend where people retire  into their privileged positions in society and shirk their  responsibilities." Cooperation between all members of society  is necessary and the sense for the commonwealth must be  developed. Despite all the problems, there is no reason to be  pessimistic. Compared to the difficulties of other countries, I  cannot understand the lamentation and obsession with complaining  in this country: "I also want to make this issue a topic in my  election campaign."    The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] was avoiding a  discussion on facts and indulges in populism. In decisive  questions of German unity, the SPD used to bank on the principle  of opportunism. Kohl said: Of course, we have not only made  many important decisions but also mistakes; still, considering  the criticism voiced by the SPD, I am astonished over the  impertinence of those who had long since given up and betrayed  the idea of German unity, and who even wanted, for example, to  accept Honecker's demand for recognizing a separate GDR  citizenship, and who wanted to dissolve the central office at  Salzgitter that registered law infringements by the GDR judicial  authorities."    With a view to the challenges of the 1994 election year for  the CDU/CSU and himself, Chancellor Kohl said: "I want the  coalition between the CDU/CSU and the FDP to continue." Kohl  was determined: "We must fight for every single vote and  approach the voters. We must mobilize our voters and offer a  clear alternative to the SPD, which means that to secure the  future of our country, we must change our way of thinking and  support the necessary, albeit at times unpopular, measures with  great resolve and represent our better arguments." Then, I  think we will stand "a good chance" in the election.</p>

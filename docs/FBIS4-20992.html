			<p>CSO     [Text] At least 45 kilograms of marijuana being transported  from Aceh to Jakarta by bus on the trans-Sumatra highway  (JALINSUM) were netted in Jambi; some of the perpetrators are in  custody and the evidence has been confiscated.    Police Colonel Drs Soeyono, head of the Jambi Regional  Police, told reporters in Jambi on Saturday that JALINSUM is the  main interregional route in Sumatra and that Jambi is in the  middle of Sumatra.    He said that it is possible that the route is a  transportation artery for "forbidden" goods destined for Java,  especially for Jakarta, the main sales target.    He also did not deny that Jambi has become a transit point  for the distribution of marijuana originating in Aceh and North  Sumatra, which is proved by the fact that some residents of  Jambi were involved as owners, dealers and users.    At the same time, Police Captain Drs Budi Soesilo, head of  the investigative unit of the Jambi Regional Police, stated that  the three suspects, MN. S. (31 years old), Pur (23 years old)  and Mul (24 years old), all residents of Jambi, are in custody  and charged with distributing marijuana.    The three suspects, residents of the Subdistrict of  Rawasari,  District of Kota Baru, Municipality of Jambi, were caught and as  a result 1.2 kilograms of marijuana were confiscated. MN.S is  believed to be the owner of the forbidden substance, which he  obtained in Medan, North Sumatra.    In an operation called "zebra elephant," another marijuana  case was uncovered in the Bungo Tebo Police Precinct, in the  region crossed by the JALINSUM, in December of 1993, and at  least 36 kilograms of marijuana were confiscated.    The three perpetrators arrested in that case are from North  Sumatra and Aceh. "They were planning to take the marijuana to  Jakarta," said Budi.    The three suspects are involved in two cases of marijuana  belonging to a young woman named Men. T (36 years old), a  resident of North Sumatra, and her male companion, Dnl (23 years  old), from Aceh.    It is estimated that the two suspects, who confessed to  taking the bus from Medan to Jakarta, were carrying 18.4  kilograms of marijuana stored in the baggage compartment of the  bus.    Meanwhile, the other perpetrator, Amr. S (49 years old), a  resident of Aceh, was also carrying marijuana destined for  Jakarta. "This case might have been handed over to the  prosecutor already," he said.    Marijuana is usually transported on passenger busses where  it  is stored in the baggage compartment. However, some people also  use vehicles which carry goods, such as trucks, and store the  marijuana on the tarpaulin at the top of the bus. "It is  possible that some people use other types of vehicles, including  private vehicles," he added.</p>

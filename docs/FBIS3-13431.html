In a radio and television interview this morning, Mr. Adeli,  the governor of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Central Bank,  announced: Following negotiations with the representatives of  some Japanese companies, an agreement was signed in the early  hours of this morning, Tehran time, between an Iranian  delegation from the Central Bank and representatives of the  Japanese companies. He added: This document will provide Iran  with more than $2 billion in credit to pay Japanese exporters.  Mr. Adeli said: The credit is for a period of around two years  and repayment period is three and a half years, which makes a  total of five and a half years.    The Central Bank governor also said: Two weeks ago a similar  $2.6 billion agreement was signed with Germany, which will help  our country pay off more than 50 percent of its postponed  credits.    He said the cost of those credits is just over 4 percent per  year. He stated that Central Bank delegations are currently  holding talks with other countries to pave the way for  negotiations. The people will be informed as soon as other  agreements are signed. Mr. Adeli added: The signing of the  documents allows Iran to postpone the expiry dates of its  condensed and short-term credits [e'tebarat] which were not  repaid in 1992, 1993, and 1994 due to the fall in oil prices.    He said: We expect to pay off all our postponed payments to  exporters of those two countries within the next couple of  months. Therefore goods which were not dispatched because of  nonpayment will gradually be sent.    The Central Bank governor went on to say: A group of  importers and production companies used to purchase their  foreign currency needs in the free market to pay off their  debts. With the payment of debts to foreign exporters there  will no longer be any need to do that. He said the signing of  the agreements will reduce cash purchases and cut foreign  currency demands in the free market. He added: It is expected  that some cases of limitation imposed by a number of countries  on government insurance will resume. He stressed: Obviously  countries that provide insurance cover to facilitate their trade  transactions with Tehran will be given a greater share of the  Iranian market in the future and will be given priority over  other countries.</p>

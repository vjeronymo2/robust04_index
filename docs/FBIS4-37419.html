			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear viewers: I have just been informed that His  Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the esteemed leader of the Islamic  revolution, has sent the following message:    In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.  [Koranic  verse in Arabic omitted] We belong to God and to God we shall  return. With sorrow and regret we were informed that the  criminal hand of the enemies of Islam has been tainted with a  great crime and, by desecrating the holy and pure shrine of Imam  Reza, they have massacred a number of innocent people at the  holy shrine of the eighth Imam, peace be upon him, on Imam  Husayn's 'Ashura.    With this action the hypocritical, hostile, and cruel  enemies  have shown that they adhere to no humanitarian standards, and  that their enmity against the brave and pious nation has no  bounds or limits.    The blind-hearted and treacherous hypocrites [Mojahedin-e  Khalq] have shown that they attach no value to the holy shrine  of the member of the household of piety and purity; that such a  great and holy time and place is no obstacle to their  bloodthirsty and bestial nature and their savage grudge against  the Iranian nation. The curse of God and His subjects be on  those criminal hands and those black hearts.    With such deeds the enemies of the Iranian nation have  demonstrated their weakness and impotence and proved that they  are doomed to isolation and destruction.    I express condolences to the Hidden Imam and to those  families whose dear ones have been sacrificed because of the  malevolence and crime of the enemies and to the great, brave,  and steadfast nation of Islamic Iran. I pray that those  martyred in this heart-rending tragedy will receive the loftiest  rank.    I call on the authorities and the law-enforcement bodies to  seriously pursue the perpetrators of this crime and, in the  shortest possible time, bring to justice those blood-sucking  bats. [Koranic verse in Arabic] And those who do wrong shall  surely know by what overturning they will be overturned.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAT 'RESCUER' MAY GET JAIL IN FREEING OF 45 FELINES  </P> <P> Todd Vailette, according to Lancaster authorities, is a brand-new kind of cat  burglar.  </P> <P> They're accusing him of burgling cats.  </P> <P> Vailette illegally let the cat out of the bag -- actually, about 45 cats -- on  the night of Nov. 6, when he turned loose the feline inmates from more than 16  cages at the Antelope Valley Animal Care Shelter, alleged Deputy Dist. Atty.  Sheilah Roberts.  </P> <P> He was familiar with the shelter, having spent several weeks working there in  October as court-mandated community service in lieu of a fine for a traffic  infraction, she said.  </P> <P> Vailette was found on the premises with a kitten on his shoulder after the  cages were opened, she said.  </P> <P> Vailette neither admitted nor denied the break-in in an interview Thursday. But  he said that while working at the shelter, he was disturbed by the conditions  in which the cats lived, especially the feral cats -- those classified as wild.  They were kept 10 to 12 in a cage, and when they were fed, "only the big cats  got to eat," he said.  </P> <P> He said he is not a member of any animal rights group, but has saved cats from  harm in the past. A year and a half ago, he rescued a cat from pit bulldogs  that were killing other cats, he said.  </P> <P> Roberts said Vailette -- who faces six misdemeanor charges including grand  theft, trespassing and interfering with an officer -- could face up to a year  in jail if convicted. She noted that those convicted of petty theft in Antelope  Valley courts routinely receive a minimum of two days in jail.  </P> <P> "Up here, we don't just give them a fine and say bye-bye," she said.  </P> <P> Roberts is scheduled to be arraigned Dec. 19.  </P> <P> Shelter manager Dan Sturkie said that although Vailette may have wanted to help  the cats, "he didn't do them any favor." His act will cause more cats to suffer  in the end by leading to the births of more feral kittens, Sturkie said.  </P> <P> He said Vailette also inconvenienced shelter personnel, now burdened with  trying to hunt down the escaped cats.  </P> <P> So far, they've found only six.  </P></p>

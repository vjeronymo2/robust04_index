			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Farmers are told they may face same fate as miners THE FARMING industry stands 'on the edge of a precipice' and could face the same fate as the miners if public pressure forces cuts in subsidies, landowners and farmers were warned yesterday. Subsidies to farmers amounted to more than Pounds 2bn a year and were set to rise to Pounds 2.6bn by 1995, said Mr Peter Pemberton, partner in Bidwells, the chartered surveyors and farm business consultants. He said that level was unsustainable when the industry accounted for less than 2 per cent of the working population, Addressing a Country Landowners' Association conference in Elveden, Suffolk, on the future of farming, Mr Pemberton said there would be 'a barrage of criticism' when farmers received large compensation cheques this autumn for cuts in price supports and for taking land out of production under Common Agricultural Policy reforms. 'We are heavily subsidised, politically unimportant and, rightly or wrongly, unpopular,' he said. 'It is important to understand what can happen when the country's good will and the government's support is lost. We can go the same way as the miners.' Even if subsidies did not disappear, they might become conditional on farmers protecting the countryside and allowing public access, he said. Mr John Kerr, who owns a 1,700-acre farm in Suffolk, said farmers had to cut all unnecessary costs to guarantee efficient production.</p>

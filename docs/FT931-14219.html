			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Five-fold rise in net earnings for NationsBank NATIONSBANK, the large south-eastern US regional banking group formed in 1991 by the merger of C &amp; S Sovran and NCNB, yesterday reported Dollars 1.15bn of net earnings for the whole of 1992, more than five times the previous year's level. The bank's earnings had been held back in 1991 by heavy merger-related restructuring charges and provisions for bad and doubtful debts. In the fourth quarter of 1992, NationsBank said net income was Dollars 234m, or 92 cents a share, even after a one-time Dollars 50m pre-tax provision caused by closures and merger-related consolidations. In the same quarter of 1991, it suffered a loss of Dollars 244m, orDollars 1.08 a share. NationsBank is the fourth-biggest bank in the US, with total assets of Dollars 118bn and more than 1,700 offices in nine states and the District of Columbia. Mr Hugh McColl, chairman and chief executive, yesterday described its first full year of operations as 'extraordinarily successful' and said the bank was ahead of schedule, since 300 of some 400 planned merger consolidation projects had already been completed. He noted that the bank's level of non-performing assets had declined by 29 per cent in 1992, to Dollars 1.99bn. Bad debt provisions declined to Dollars 1.45bn from Dollars 1.6bn in 1991, while net write-offs fell to Dollars 866m in 1992, from Dollars 1.3bn the previous year. Mr McColl said NationsBank was proceeding with expansion plans, including a deal with Dean Witter, the brokerage house partly-owned by Sears Roebuck, to form a joint venture retail securities company. Total shareholders' equity rose by 20 per cent in 1992, to Dollars 7.8bn. The bank's ratio of capital to assets under the Tier 1 regulatory measure used in the US stood at a healthy 7.54 per cent at year-end. Net interest income improved by 6 per cent last year, to Dollars 4.19bn, thanks to wider spreads being enjoyed by the entire US banking industry. Non-interest income increased by 10 per cent in 1992, to Dollars 3.97bn. On Wall Street, NationsBank's share price closed unchanged on the day at Dollars 52 1/8.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Vista Chemical shares rally on bid snag SHARES in Vista Chemical, the Houston-based company at the centre of an agreed offer from the German utility, RWE, rallied Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 52 1/2 yesterday after the bidder conceded it had problems with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over one aspect of the bid, but indicated that a possible solution was under consideration. The FTC's concerns centre on the alumina interests of the two companies - thought to be a relatively small part of both groups' business. RWE said yesterday it was in talks with an unnamed third party and the FTC's staff 'concerning the establishment of a new entity to engage in the alumina business'. There were suggestions in the market that the solution involved the creation of a 'new entity' which would provide competition in the area of high-purity alumina. The bidder stressed that 'there could be no assurance as to whether or when an agreement acceptable to all parties and to the FTC can be reached'. The German bid was announced in December, with RWE offering to pay Dollars 590m, or Dollars 55 a share, for Vista. The price did not include the debt which the buyer would assume; at the end of September, that stood at almost Dollars 600m. RWE yesterday extended its tender offer for a week, from May 13 to May 21.</p>

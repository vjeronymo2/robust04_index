TEC Executive Secretary Mac Maharaj told the TEC  on Tuesday [29 March] that security force action had already  been stepped up in the territory as violence continued to  escalate. He said the TEC's law and order sub-council was  devising regulations to give security forces greater powers.  These regulations would mean declaring unrest areas or a state  of emergency in the province, Mr Maharaj said. The actions were  intended to secure a free and fair election in the territory.    The TEC resolution commits the TEC to co-operating with the  security forces and the South African Government in intensified  security operations to secure free and fair elections in  Natal/kwaZulu. The TEC mandated its joint executive secretaries  and its sub-council on law and order to "interact with  governmental structures in the drafting of regulations providing  special powers for the security forces needed to secure the  safety of voters, the election process and reasonable  electioneering through party- political activity". The  resolution recommends in principle that "as soon as may be  necessary these regulations be put into operation in  kwaZulu/Natal, under the legislation that may be appropriate at  that time, that is the declaration of a state of emergency or of  unrest areas". The TEC said the special powers would be kept  under constant review by the government, the TEC and the  Independent Electoral Commission.</p>

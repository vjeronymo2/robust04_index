			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Canvey Island gas plant may be sold British Gas yesterday announced that it was considering the sale of the liquefied natural gas terminal on Canvey Island in Essex, the world's first commercial LNG import terminal, Robert Corzine writes. The 87-acre facility, which employs about 50 people, was built in 1964 to handle natural gas imports from Algeria. It initially supplied large industrial and commercial users before the country converted to natural gas. At its peak in the 1970s the site employed 200 people. But the recovery of large amounts of gas from fields in the North Sea eliminated the need for regular shipments of LNG, which ended in 1982. British Gas says there should be no contamination problem associated with the site. A company official said, however, that soil under those parts of the facility where the original in-ground storage tanks were located is 'well and truly frozen'. The cold from the tanks, in which liquified gas was held at minus 160 degrees centigrade, so permeated the ground that it could take 100 years for it to fully thaw. Mr Harry Moulson, managing director of TransCo, British Gas's transportation and storage business, said yesterday: 'There are currently no requirements from our customers for LNG importation and vaporisation services.' It is also unlikely that TransCo customers, including the trading division of British Gas, will need to use the site to store LNG for use at peak periods of demand, the role which it has fulfilled in recent years.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WRIGHT MAKES IMPASSIONED PLEA TO HOLD ONTO HIS JOB;  </P> <P> FIGHTS TEARS IN DEFENSE OF HIS WIFE  </P> <P> House Speaker Jim Wright, choking back tears, said today he never "knowingly or  intentionally" violated House rules and asked for "the very earliest possible  opportunity" to answer Ethics Committee charges against him.  </P> <P> In a defiant defense of a lifetime in public life, a feisty Wright vowed to  defend his wife, Betty, who figures in the allegations against him.  </P> <P> She is a "good decent, caring, thoroughly honorable person," Wright said, "and  I'll damn well fight to protect her honor and integrity from any challenge from  any source whatever the cost."  </P> <P> There have been charges that his wife did little work for a salary she was paid  by a Fort Worth business partner of Wright.  </P> <P> Wright's performance signaled his determination to fight aggressively against  the Ethics Committee charges -- allegations that could ultimately lead to his  removal as Speaker.  </P> <P> Wright spoke even before a formal announcement of the vote by Democrats and  Republicans on the Ethics Committee to pursue allegations that he improperly  accepted gifts from a business partner and tried to evade outside income limits  through the sale of his books.  </P> <P> He was flanked by a virtual who's who of House Democratic leaders as he  appeared before reporters. The scene unfolded in the ornate Rayburn Room a few  steps outside the House chamber -- a hall named for another Texas Democrat who  rose to become Speaker of the House.  </P> <P> "I will fight to the last ounce of conviction and energy that I possess,"  Wright vowed.  </P> <P> "I am confident that in the 34 years I have served in the Congress I have not  violated any of those basic rules or any commonly accepted standard of ethical  conduct," Wright said.  </P> <P> "I am prepared to demonstrate that in each of these instances no rule has been  violated," Wright said of the Ethics Committee charges.  </P> <P> "This House has been my life for more than half of my life," Wright said. "I  love this institution."  </P> <P> Wright made a detailed defense against the allegations he faces after noting  that the Ethics Committee had not yet established any proof that he had  violated the rules or even that there was "clear and convincing evidence" of a  violation.  </P> <P> The public scene came after a private defense.  </P> <P> Sources said Wright, speaking on a highly personal level, told senior House  Democratic colleagues at a closed-door meeting that he will fight to defend his  honor following Wednesday's votes in the Ethics Committee, which has been  investigating his finances for 10 months.  </P> <P> "There are some things worth fighting for, and one of them is personal honor  and reputation earned over 66 years of living and giving," Wright told  reporters after the leadership meeting. "And that's far more precious to me  than any public office."  </P> <P> The last of the ethics decisions were reached Wednesday on strong bipartisan  votes, according to sources familiar with the panel's probe. The votes mean the  panel has found "reason to believe" Wright violated a series of House rules,  and they point toward a new phase of the case that could involve a disciplinary  hearing and possible punishment.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Shelin under the rubric "Parties": </F> "Petersburg Now Has a `Choice'"]    [Text] Twenty-nine St. Petersburg residents will go  to Moscow to the founding congress of the Russia's Choice party.  They are instructed to vote for Yegor Gaydar in the party  chairman elections. In late June the work on setting up rayon  party organizations will begin in the city. This was decided on  Saturday by the St. Petersburg founding conference of Gaydar's  party supporters.    The exclusive nature of the event was indicated both by the  place where the conference was held (the banking center at 58  Nevskiy Avenue) and the small number of participants (108  persons), as well as limited access for the press. "The people  who gathered here are the achievers who already have the  experience of respect, wealth, and talent," said Yuliy Rybakov,  coordinator of the Russia's Choice St. Petersburg organizational  committee. Gathered in a small conference hall were six Duma  deputies, high-ranking city administration officials, bankers,  industrialists, democratic organizations activists,  intellectuals, and even some representatives of the artistic  Bohemia. Among the absent was Anatoliy Chubays: He was supposed  to attend but at the last moment his plans fell through. Also  absent was Aleksandr Belyayev: There are conflicting rumors  about the prospects of his joining Gaydar's party.    Vitaliy Sychev, the organizational committee coordinator and  the leader of the city's Association of Privatized Enterprises,  conducted the conference in a no-nonsense manner and at fast  pace. By the way, the debate as to who will head the party's St.  Petersburg branch is still on. Regional leadership organs have  not been elected. They will be formed by the next city  conference, which is scheduled to be held after the founding  congress. "To what extent members of the organizational  committee will become part of this leadership is probably  impossible to tell right now, since to a large extent it will  depend on how the congress goes," Mr. Sychev explained the  situation at SMENA's request.    One must say that at this point the organizational committee  leadership has a rather firm grip on the reins. The proof of  that were elections of deputies to the congress. Two-thirds of  those present supported the idea not to expand the  already-coordinated list of candidates. This list, which  consisted of 17 names, was then approved by an even more  convincing majority. Besides them, six St. Petersburg  politicians, who at the time signed the appeal to set up  Russia's Choice, will go to the congress, along with as many  respected members of the city intelligentsia invited as guests  with the rights of a decisive vote.    The debate on the subject of the program and rules was of  limited nature by default: The participants were told that the  draft program and rules handed out to them had not been approved  by the party leadership and a different version of these  documents will be ready in time for the congress. Some hints of  disagreements within the party could be picked up from the  argument between two organizational committee members (and Duma  deputies)--Grigoriy Tomchin and Mikhail Molostvov.    Mr. Tomchin is convinced that Russia's Choice must become a  rigidly organized liberal-conservative party, with a support  base in the large- and medium-size capital. In his opinion,  small business cannot play a perceptible political role. Mr.  Molostvov declared to thunderous applause that he is against  combining liberalism and conservatism: "What we got was not a  two-headed eagle but a many- headed hydra." He thinks that Mr.  Tomchin is debating Gaydar in the latter's absence, since Gaydar  is for looking for support first and foremost among creative and  technical intelligentsia."    Mr. Molostvov was supported not only by democratic  organizations activists. The idea of strengthening the liberal  beginnings in Russia's Choice was also supported by Aleksey  Kudrin, first deputy prime minister of the St. Petersburg  government. ZVEZDA magazine's editor in chief, Yakov Gordin,  said in a conversation with the SMENA correspondent: "I think  that in the final count a compromise road will be found, with a  serious bent towards M.M. Molostvov's position. As to large- and  medium-size capital, in a real-life situation it can be  protected only by a party that orientates itself towards broad  strata."    Actually, Grigoriy Tomchin resolutely denies that he is  debating Gaydar. In his firm opinion, Gaydar's reforms had been  largely aimed precisely at creating big capital. To the SMENA  correspondent question on whether he believes in a small  businessman--an owner of a kiosk, store, and so on--Mr. Tomchin  remarked: "I believe in him as a democrat but do not believe in  him as a party functionary. Because if he comes to us as a party  functionary, who is going to run his kiosk?"    This debate will certainly continue at the congress in the  capital. There also will be debates on how strict the party  rules should be, on how the regions will be represented in  Russia's Choice governing bodies (St. Petersburg members insist  on keeping the number of Muscovites in them to a minimum), and,  of course, the actual membership of these bodies. The congress  is expected to be held on 12-13 June.</p>

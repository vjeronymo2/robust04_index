The protests came barely a week after the lifting of  previous  emergency measures in force since early December. Police  removed the barricades almost as soon as they were put up.  Elsewhere in the city traffic was normal, though fewer taxis  than usual were seen. The previous day, the first of a general  strike called by public and private sector trade unions,  demonstrators stoned taxis to make the drivers take part in the  strike. The unions are calling for pay rises to cope with last  month's 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc.    Opposition party officials said their radio station was  wrecked in a dawn raid by security forces, but there was no  immediate confirmation from the government. [passage omitted]</p>

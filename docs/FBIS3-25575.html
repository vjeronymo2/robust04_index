			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg Feb 21 SAPA -- The multiparty  negotiating council convened at the World Trade Centre in  Kempton Park after a three-month interval on Monday without the  Freedom Alliance parties to pass amendments to the interim  constitution. The amendments to both the interim constitution  and to the Electoral Act provide for greater taxation powers for  provinces and guarantees that powers granted now will not be  taken away once a constituent assembly sits after the April  elections.    They also provide for the establishment of a "volkstaat  [Afrikaner homeland] council" to propagate a volkstaat within  the constituent assembly. The Electoral Act amendments provide  for a double ballot and the extension of registration for the  April elections until March 7. The amendments are due to be  passed by Parliament next week.    Several delegates questioned whether the council was going  far enough in meeting the alliance's demands for exclusive  powers. Others criticised the amendment on a volkstaat.    Ciskei's Mickey Webb said the amendments could be "too  little, too late".    Answering his criticism, African National Congress Secretary  General Cyril Ramaphosa said he doubted it was too late. He  said Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had said  that even if his demands were met he would not participate in  the election because it was too late to start campaigning.    He said the alliance's negotiating tactics made him doubt  whether they had ever been serious about taking part in an  election in the first place.    Mr Ramaphosa said that while Section 126 of the constitution  was not being amended to create exclusive powers for provinces,  other provisions meant their powers were exclusive even if the  term was not used. He claimed the alliance had constantly  changed the goalposts in trilateral negotiations on the issue of  exclusive powers.    He said that even as late as midnight on Monday, the ANC had  been asked by the alliance to amend Section 126 in a new and  different way. He said the alliance was being offered a  provision that powers granted would not be taken away. "These  powers all amount to exclusive powers because the provincial  governments will take the initiative in passing legislation on  these issues," he said. An amendment to Section 126 would have  been superfluous.    "We do have exclusive powers for provinces. The word  exclusive is not used, but when it is looked at closely they are  exclusive."    Minister of Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer said no  reformulation of Section 126 was acceptable to all three parties  involved in the trilateral negotiations. He said he had asked  the alliance for specific proposals on Section 126 but had  received none. Mr Meyer said that while negotiations with the  alliance could continue, Monday was the last chance for  amendments to the constitution.    Answering criticism on the provision of a mechanism for the  attainment of a volkstaat, Mr Meyer said a volkstaat could not  be in conflict with provisions of the constitution guaranteeing  fundamental human rights.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, March 31 (AFP) -- Israel has taken the first  step toward protecting Palestinians by signing an accord with  the PLO Thursday [31 March] to deploy 160 foreign observers in  the West Bank town of Hebron, a PLO spokesman said.    The accord signed in Cairo was "a first step in applying  (UN)  Security Council Resolution 904," the spokesman said.    The resolution, adopted on March 18, condemned the massacre  of 30 Palestinians by a Jewish settler at a Hebron mosque on  February 25 and called for international protection for the  Palestinians in the occupied territories.    The PLO spokesman, quoted by the official WAFA news agency,  welcomed the participation of "friendly countries in the  international force" which is to deploy in the West Bank town.    But he urged additional measures "to guarantee effective  international protection for the Palestinian people, its land  and its holy sites."    He called on Israel to fulfill all the conditions necessary  to ensure the observers could complete their neutral mission and  said the PLO was "ready to help them in the task."    Other problems still to be resolved included settlers  carrying arms and "the presence of extremist settlers and their  terrorist activities," he said.    The PLO would continue its efforts to protect all  Palestinians and "wipe out centres of terrorism," as well as  pushing ahead with deployment of a Palestinian security force in  the Gaza Strip and Jericho as set out in the Declaration of  Principles signed in Washington in September.    Talks on launching Palestinian self-rule resumed Thursday  after the security deal was signed in Cairo.</p>

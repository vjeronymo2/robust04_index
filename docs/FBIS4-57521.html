			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 1600 GMT on 18 May carries the program Straight Talk  featuring Osvaldo Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE and Eloy  Concepcion of TRABAJADORES. The program focuses on the current  degree of autonomy of the Basic Cooperative Production Units, or  UBPC's.    Rodriguez notes that autonomy is a much debated issue at the  UBPC's, adding: "The enterprise often acts as if the UBPC were  its subordinate, and the UBPC often acts as if it were indeed a  subordinate of the enterprise."    Concepcion says: "First, let us say that the word autonomy  scares a lot of people in the enterprises, as well as comrades  in the UBPC's." Concepcion adds that current Ministry of  Agriculture structures have yet to match changes in policy  regarding farming during the special period.    Regarding the role of the state, Concepcion adds: "Right  now,  the state cannot let individuals produce whatever they want,  whenever they choose, and distribute whatever they wish to  whomever they wish."    The speakers discuss the example of a UBPC that was ordered  by the enterprise to plant yams, although it was not  yam-planting season. This resulted in a lackluster crop, and the  Cuban people ended up the losers. Concepcion says the enterprise  should set a production plan for the UBPC in keeping with the  government's interests, adding: "The enterprise should leave a  large enough margin so that the UBPC can decide in what season  and under what conditions crops are to be planted. The  bureaucracy refuses to give up the power it possesses and that  often, consciously or unconsciously, blocks the progress of the  Revolution." Concepcion says there is conflict between the  Ministry of Agriculture's enterprise system and the UBPC's on  how to tackle food production problems. He stresses: "We have  tried many formulas: cooperatives, large state enterprises. At  the beginning of the Revolution, we had cooperatives, people's  farms, etc., and the UBPC's are our last chance. Everyone must  contribute to their success, since we are dealing with a most  important issue: feeding the population."    Rodriguez notes that frequently the bad is stressed, but, he  asks, what about the good? Concepcion replies: "Not all the  fault lies on the side of the enterprise system; there are  comrades managing UBPC's who are also at fault."    Concepcion says that highly positive results have been  obtained by the UBPC's since their creation five and a half  months ago and that he honestly believes that, within a year,  the UBPC's will become self-sufficient in food.    The speakers then discuss the fact that the work force is  better distributed in the UBPC's. Nevertheless, more workers are  needed throughout Cuba for agricultural activities. Concepcion  says: "We are a country unable to produce yams and cassava. We  have thousands of caballerias overgrown with weeds and we blame  the problem on a lack of fuel and fertilizer. What we lack, to  solve the food supply problem of the municipalities and the  population, is self-respect. What we lack is self-respect and  agricultural know-how. That is my opinion."    Rodriguez reiterates that Cuban agriculture needs additional  workers and notes that Cuba's alleged worker surplus could be  assigned to agriculture. In this connection, Concepcion adds:  "There is an accord, soon to be a year old, from the Politburo  that states that the Ministry of Agriculture is to give small  plots of fallow land to retirees. Why has the Ministry of  Agriculture not given these people this land? Why the delay?  This was a Politburo accord. It would have meant more food for  the population."    Rodriguez concludes: "Once more bureaucracy is acting  against  something as important as the UBPC's. Like you, however, I  believe this process is continuing to make progress, and that  the UBPC's will be a success."</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / US Senate backs Uruguay Round world trade deal The US Senate last night overwhelmingly approved the Uruguay Round agreement, paving the way for the most ambitious trade liberalisation deal in history and the setting up of the World Trade Organisation. The Senate vote - delayed by months - is expected to trigger speedy ratification by other countries, in time to set up the WTO by January 1. Many have held back, awaiting the crucial vote of the US Congress. The lower house of the Japanese Diet is expected to act today, and the European Union is on course to complete ratification by December 20. The US House of Representatives approved the Uruguay Round legislation by a wide margin on Tuesday. But only a week ago, Senate approval seemed doubtful. The Senate had to find 60 votes out of 100 to waive budget rules to bring the implementing legislation to the Senate floor. But supporters mustered 68 votes to 32 against, before then going on to vote 76-24 for the pact. Opposition to the WTO - portrayed as a supranational body which would impinge upon US sovereignty - has been whipped up by populists in both political parties and by Mr Ross Perot, the billionaire presidential candidate. Foes stoked indignation over the fact that the US gets only one vote like the rest of the 124 members. Opponents argued that the previous seven rounds of tariff cuts in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade had contributed to the chronic US trade deficit. They insisted that in textiles and apparel alone, the US would lose 1m jobs. Although recent polls showed only 51 per cent of US voters against the deal, radio and television talk shows have been flooded with anti-Gatt phone calls. Agreement between the Clinton administration and Senator Robert Dole, the Republican Senate leader, last week brought many wavering Republicans on board. Tireless lobbying by administration officials and business groups with much to gain in the round also brought others around. As debate dragged on in the Senate on Wednesday and yesterday, the 'lame duck' session, devoted only to the trade pact, took on something of a carnival air. Accompanied by a costumed 'lame duck,' opponents yesterday morning picketed the White House, meeting undecided senators who had been invited for talks with the president. Lobbyists, administration officials and senators mingled in the 'war room' set up to control the action on Capitol Hill. The rumour spread that previously opposed senators were switching to Yes votes in the hope that a large affirmative vote would give everyone political 'cover'. But administration officials continued to insist that they not let up on the pressure. Several senators who opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta)  -Democrats Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Donald Riegle of Michigan - declared themselves supporters of the Uruguay Round. Even before the vote, the US Council for International Business faxed press releases congratulating President Clinton and hailing the result as 'the most important vote on a trade policy that Congress has been asked to take' since 1934.</p>

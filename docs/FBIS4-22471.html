			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Galina Odinokova: "Who Will Fight the Mafia. MVD </F> Workers Are Confident That Only Professionals Can"]    [Text] The Analytical Center for Socioeconomic Policy under  the Administration of the President of Russia, headed by Petr  Filippov, has prepared and submitted to Boris Yeltsin a document  titled: "Organized Crime and the Prospect of Nationalists Taking  Over Power in Russia." A number of the media have published it.  In the opinion of the Center, the growth of organized crime,  which has infiltrated organs of the MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] and local executive authority, jeopardizes Russia's  economic and political development. Professionals from law  enforcement organs are not indifferent to this information  either, but they have their own attitude toward the conclusions  of the analysts. Today we offer the reader an opportunity to  become familiar with two of these opinions.    Vladimir Rushaylo--chief of the regional Administration for  Fighting Organized Crime (RUOP) of the Moscow GUVD [City  Internal Affairs Administration], militia colonel:    "As a practical worker responsible for the situation in  Moscow, first of all I have doubts about many of the figures and  generalizations presented in the document. For example, the  thesis that `70-80 percent of privatized enterprises and  commercial banks are forced to pay extortion money.' It would be  stupid to deny it--such things exist, but to say that the  absolute majority of enterprises are under the heel of criminal  groupings is irresponsible at best. We know that this kind of  information used to be disseminated by the criminal groupings  themselves so that potential victims would reconcile themselves  to paying them off without making a fuss.    "Incidentally, the criminals are also interested in  disseminating the information that `all the militia is corrupt,  there is no one to place our hopes in.' This is a kind of  shocking-paralyzing statement for the victim: To resist, to  defend your independence--is pointless, the power of the mafia  is boundless, it is better to pay the money. From the same  category comes the assertion that gangster formations everywhere  have informers in organs of the militia, and state automotive  inspection. I think that here too they have been laying it on  too thick. There are informers, of course, but only a few. We  regularly `round them up.' During the past year the Moscow RUOP  has discovered 29 militia workers who have committed various  kinds of official crimes. We do not deny this, just as we do not  intend to tolerate traitors, and we will fight fiercely against  them.    "The analysts advised the president to put together new  formations consisting of people who have never before served  either in the militia or in the Ministry of Security. And they  suggest using in operations for suppressing organized crime  workers temporarily assigned from other cities. As a practical  worker I can say that for Moscow, for example, this method is  not very acceptable. Operationally, the capital is such a  complicated city that even native Muscovites usually adapt fully  to the normal professional standard only after three to five  years of working under the conditions of the capital. What about  when it comes to work in the militia?    "The document's authors are under the impression that almost  all the activity of subdivisions for fighting organized crime  can be reduced basically to conducting raids and rounding up  criminals, which affects only the small fry. But how is it then  that in Moscow alone recently we have managed to bring criminal  charges against seven thieves operating within the law? The  professionals understand that the leaders of criminal groupings  are unmasked only as a result of in-depth operational  developments and penetration into the criminal environment.    "But if it did come down to raids, police lines,  inspections,  and ambushes, these too are absolutely necessary in daily  militia work. Here is a summary of the results of one of the  recent Moscow operations: 225 crimes uncovered, more than 30  units of firearms and 53 bladed weapons confiscated, 49 stolen  motor vehicles found. In one day!    "There are suggestions that simply need work. Take just the  idea of granting law enforcement organs the right to preventive  detention for up to three months without charging individuals  who are suspected of organized crime. In Tatarstan, for example,  they introduced such a rule, the territory was purged of  gangsters, and...they immediately moved to Moscow. Such  decisions must be made at the state and not the regional level.    "Subdivisions created relatively recently for fighting  organized crime are quite capable of fighting it today, but this  requires well-considered legal instruments as well. And the  dissemination in the press of documents like the note from the  Analytical Center does more to advertise organized crime than  help fight against it. It is necessary to begin with a serious  reformation of the investigatory apparatus, with the  introduction of an alternative form of investigation in keeping  with the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation  entitled `Gangsterism,' whereby the courts, when examining such  cases with clear indications of gangsterism but without the  necessary proof, will return the materials for further  investigation. And when the people arrested have been caught  red-handed--the question of the convictions should be decided in  the shortest possible periods of time, without reducing  liability or punitive measures."    Azaliya Dolgova--president of the International  Criminological Association, doctor of jurisprudence, professor:    "From the standpoint of the problem raised in the materials  of the Analytical Center, there is nothing basically new. Except  for one thing: In the subdivisions that will be fighting  organized crime there should not be...workers of the MVD or the  former Ministry of Security. Where did this kind of disrespect  for organizations on the leading edge of crime-fighting come  from? If there are complaints--they should be concretized. Each  case should be investigated legally--and only after this  procedure should those who have been penalized be prohibited  from working in the new subdivisions.    "Look at the position in which law enforcement organs have  been placed today. The criminals are becoming more brazen with  each passing day, they are arming themselves, and they are  strengthening their ties with corrupt bureaucrats of the higher  echelons of power. And no legal base has been created for  fighting against them. So in the absence of legal instruments  the workers have had to use force that is sometimes unjustified.  We are coming closer to a real danger of punishment of criminals  on the spot. Those who are objecting to the adoption of the  appropriate laws today are also provoking this.    "Another question for the analysts: Where do they intend to  gather up these professionals? Invite them from the West? Or  call in scholars from academic institutions who provide  theoretical knowledge for practical workers? We are now engaged  in a persistent war against crime and the enemy is taking the  offensive. And instead of introducing fresh professional forces,  even after achieving success they want to begin to settle scores  with everyone left in the trenches--the authors of the document  are proposing: `All for the state!' What is the enemy doing  during this time? Naturally, he is continuing to attack. And  what are the `people in the trenches' doing? Of course, they are  starting to philosophize: Is it worth the struggle?    "The idea itself of creating special services, of course, is  productive. It is worth considering from all angles. But it  cannot be embodied without resolving the key problems of the  organization of the fight against crime as a whole. Without  reforming criminal procedure and operational investigatory  activity.    "We must not arbitrarily change units in a system--this will  necessarily warp other of its elements. As a result of serious  work, the analysts have come to extremely sore spots in society.  But instead of turning to professionals they simply deny them  the right to work. And our esteemed workers from the Analytical  Center have forgotten about many essential elements without  which a persistent struggle is simply impossible, or else they  have considered them to be of less importance. For example, the  fact that our legislators have not yet adopted a law on  corruption in combination with a law on organized crime--new  deputies of the State Duma are even lobbying for this unified  mechanism for fighting the mafia."    From the dossier of the Main Administration for Combating  Organized Crime of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the  Russian Federation--the results of 1993:    "Promising signs of stabilization of the dynamic of the  growth of crime have appeared. In spite of predictions of  certain specialists, in 1993 this indicator rose by only 1.4  percent, while in 1992 the dynamic growth amounted to 26  percent. A significant decline in the dynamic was brought about  by the initiative of internal affairs organs. The number of  organized crime groupings disclosed increased by 30.8 percent  (5,681 groups, including 87 of a gangster inclination). They  have confiscated 11,737 units of firearms from the criminals,  which is 2.6 times more than during the preceding year. They  have confiscated nine times more bladed weapons. RUOP  subdivisions have confiscated 4.4 tonnes of narcotics. Twice as  many corrupt bureaucrats have been taken to court. While in 1992  throughout Russia only nine cases were reported under the  article of the Criminal Code `Gangsterism,' last year there were  44 of these cases. Convictions were handed down against 20  thieves operating within the law, and there are now 62 of these  thieves in prison."    We share the bewilderment of representatives of law  enforcement organs regarding the evaluation of professionals.  Indeed, it is unfitting to run roughshod over specialists who  have accumulated experience in fighting organized crime. But you  cannot get away from the facts: In terms of the number of  murders per capita we are almost ahead of everyone else on the  planet. When will we be delivered from fear? The government  today is discussing a nationwide crime fighting program that is  unprecedented in history. But if we do not feel its results  tomorrow, we will have a right to draw a tragic conclusion: The  mafia is immortal, and there is no one who can fight it. It is  getting late...Listen: Tomorrow!</p>

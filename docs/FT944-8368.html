			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / UN force on alert over Bosnia: Moslem-led government demands air strikes against Serb tanks The 40,000-strong United Nations force in former Yugoslavia was placed on high alert last night as intensifying warfare in northern Bosnia left the peacekeepers vulnerable to assault from both Serbs and Moslems. The Moslem-led Bosnian government angrily demanded that the UN follow up its new resolution and authorise air strikes against Serb forces advancing on the Moslem enclave of Bihac. Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime minister, said that despite an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Saturday, Serb tanks were moving towards Bihac yesterday. 'The concrete action would be to take out these tanks - serious air strikes.' On Saturday night the Security Council passed an emergency resolution authorising Nato aircraft to extend their role as policemen of the skies to the Serb-controlled areas of Croatia, after Serb aircraft based in Croatia made two air raids on the Bihac area in two days. An aircraft in the second attack crashed into an apartment block in the town of Cazin, near Bihac, killing the pilot and injuring at least nine people. Mr Willy Claes, Nato secretary-general, indicated on CNN television that the alliance was waiting only for a request from the UN but stressed that 'we are ready to intervene not only politically but militarily . . . we are ready to give a very clear and strong signal to Serbs that this is enough and it must stop.' In the US, senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in Congress, expressed frustration with the UN's role: 'The UN should get off Nato's back and let Nato take care of Serbian aggression.' He would visit Nato's headquarters next week 'and tell them I don't see any reason for their existence if they have to take orders from the UN'. The Security Council resolution was welcomed by a senior British naval officer who is overseeing air policing activities in the Adriatic. Captain Richard Hastilow, commander of the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible, said the new policy was intended to stop hostile aircraft leaving the ground in the Serb-controlled areas of Croatia. The worsening situation around Bihac has presented the UN with one of the toughest challenges since it became involved in peacekeeping in former Yugoslavia in 1992. Any draconian action against the Serbs would leave peacekeepers vulnerable to retaliation in many parts of Bosnia, while the UN's failure to protect Bihac was incurring the anger of local Moslems. Reports from Bihac said local people were attacking the vehicles belonging to the 1,000-strong contingent of lightly-armed UN soldiers from Bangladesh, whose stocks of food and medicine have run very low. A UN official said there was 'major concern' for their welfare. Fighters loyal to the maverick Moslem leader Mr Fikret Abdic, who opposes the Bosnian government, were engaged yesterday with Serb support in heavy house-to-house fighting in the town of Velika Kladusa, north of Bihac. Ignoring threats of Nato air strikes if Serbs attack Bihac town, a UN-designated safe area, General Manojlo Milovanovic, chief-of-staff of Bosnian Serb forces, last night said his troops 'are at the very outskirts of Bihac and are advancing from three sides'. He claimed that his Serb forces had retaken all the land they initially lost in a recent Bosnian-government offensive. Navy welcomes wider Bosnia role, Page 3</p>

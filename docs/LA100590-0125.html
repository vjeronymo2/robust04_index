			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST EXECUTIVE IN NO INSTANT DANGER, CHIEF SAYS;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: FRED CARR SAYS A RESTRUCTURING BEING PLANNED AT THE BIG LOS ANGELES  HOLDING COMPANY IS NOT AN EMERGENCY.  </P> <P> First Executive Corp. confirmed Thursday that it is hastening work on a major  restructuring plan that will involve not only a renegotiation of bank debt but  also further measures designed to put the life insurance holding company on a  sound footing.  </P> <P> Fred Carr, chairman and chief executive of the big Los Angeles-based firm,  confirmed that it has been holding intensive meetings with commercial and  investment bankers during the past two weeks.  </P> <P> However, in the company's first public comment since it was disclosed this week  that First Executive had notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that  it expects to call a special meeting of shareholders, Carr denied in an  interview that First Executive is in any imminent danger.  </P> <P> Carr also strongly denied that negotiations on the restructuring are taking  place in a crisis atmosphere. "It is true that we are accelerating the  process," Carr said. But he added: "We have gone about it very tediously" and  deliberately. He said it isn't urgent that the talks be concluded quickly.  </P> <P> Separately, sources confirmed Thursday that the investment banking firm Kidder,  Peabody &amp; Co. has been involved in the talks on restructuring and may soon  be hired officially by First Executive to handle part of it. The sources also  said that Kidder's parent company, General Electric, has been consulted and is  considering an investment that would be part of the First Executive  restructuring plan. GE so far hasn't confirmed publicly that it is  contemplating any role in the restructuring.  </P> <P> Carr refused to say anything specific about when he expects a plan to be  announced. "We have been working with the (commercial) bank group and believe  that they have been very constructive," he said. "We hope that over the course  of the next few months, we'll be able to present a program to our various  constituencies."  </P> <P> He refused to give any details about the purpose of the special shareholders  meeting. As reported, sources have said the meeting will be necessary to  approve elements of the plan. One source Thursday said First Executive had  filed preliminary proxy material with the SEC for a meeting as a way to spur  the banks and other parties to reach an agreement quickly.  </P> <P> First Executive, the parent of Executive Life and Executive Life of New York,  has been hit hard by the declining value of its enormous junk bond portfolio.  The parent firm also has disclosed that it may have to suspend dividend  payments on its preferred stock and might be in danger of defaulting on $275  million of bank debt. Regulators are refusing to let the parent company  withdraw profits from the insurance units.  </P> <P> Carr said Thursday, however, that the next payment on the debt, $46 million,  isn't due until March. He said the company has enough cash on hand to cover it.  "Because we have adequate funds to meet the 1991 payment, we have no immediate  concerns," he said.  </P> <P> The true state of First Executive's finances has been the subject of much  debate, however. On Wednesday, the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's again  substantially lowered its ratings on a variety of First Executive securities  and insurance.  </P></p>

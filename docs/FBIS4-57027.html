			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Paid "Political Statement" entitled "Clarity and Truth To </F> Confront Manipulation and Confusion" issued by the Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity, URNG, on 8 May; place not given]    [Text] During this week, statements have been made and  media campaigns have been conducted to create confusion and  distort the truth. Those statements, in particular, are not  simple opinions but, taken jointly, clear indicators of  concerted objectives to negatively affect the negotiation  process.  <H5>  Cease-Fire, Reality, and Perspective </H5>   It is truly worrisome to see a recalcitrant sector of  private  initiative, which has taken upon itself to represent all  Guatemalan businessmen, and hoist old banners in new times. It  is especially troublesome when this sector attempts to actualize  positions that have not only been defeated in national and  international arenas, but are totally against the spirit and the  letter of a previously agreed negotiation, which was held with  UN participation.    To propose, as the CACIF [Coordinating Committee for  Agriculture, Commercial, Financial, and Industrial Associations]  board has done, that first there must be a cease-fire so that we  can later negotiate what is "pending" is nothing more than a  clear indication that they do not want the peace negotiations to  have any political, economic, or social content. The  negotiations are only intended to get the URNG to give up its  weapons, without solving any of the problems that caused and  maintain the armed conflict.    The current CACIF board's reasoning is not naive. It  attempts to have an emotional impact on the population. This  old and out-of-place concept has been, precisely, one of the  causes of the long and hard war we have endured. The  persistance of this reasoning is a serious and hazardous  obstacle to the attainment of peace. To achieve peace it is  imperative that the previously agreed upon fundamental issues be  seriously and thouroughly discussed, agreed upon, and complied  with.    After we reach agreements on the fundamental issues on the  agenda, using CACIF's words, the "pending" issue would then be  the cease-fire. In this case, changing the order of the factors  completely alters the product. Anybody knows and the current  CACIF board is especially aware that nobody is going to  negotiate the causes of a conflict when it has already ended.    If, as they proclaim, they want peace, they must actively  and  assertively participate, with a positive attitude and social  sensitivity, to find solutions for the country's major problems.  They should also propose initiatives that will contribute to the  advancement of negotiations.    This is the point of definition: Take advantage of the  present opportunity to rectify their position, join society, and  stop going against the people's interests.    The same can be said about the defense minister's position.  He knows perfectly well that this topic unavoidably leads to an  interruption in negotiations. It is contradictory that he  carries out sensationalist publicity stunts in an attempt to  take by surprise the good faith of nationals and foreigners.    The national and international public are aware that most of  the problems and sufferings of people in the conflict area are  caused by the Army's houndings, persecution, and military  actions against the civilian population, especially in the areas  where Communities of Resistant People and programs for returning  refugees exist.    It is not with a cease-fire declaration that we will resolve  our problems. The effective and proper way is to zealously and  thoroughly comply with the Global Human Rights Agreement. In  the end, the current propaganda and sensationalist measures  attempt to diminish the Global Human Rights Agreement will not  guarantee the people's rights nor lead the country anywhere.    We, thus, call for reflection. We ask and demand coherence.  Anything else is diversion and disinformation to avoid  compliance with obligations and the verification process. They  are an obstacle to continuing on the set path.  <H5>  Commission for the Establishment of Human Rights Violations </H5>   We consider it positive that the commission's debate on the  issue is being endorsed by Army members, and that the need for  its establishment is becoming increasingly evident.    The URNG is compelled to state its position on concepts that  provoke confusion. Since the beginning, the URNG has considered  that the establishment of such a commission was, and is, not  only essential but also not postponable because it is a  significant commitment to eradicate impunity, guarantee  democratization, and eradicate forever terrible events which  tarnished and darkened our history. The truth is essential for  all this; it is not vengeance, as some have depicted it.    This commission's functions must center on the issue of  human  rights violations so no one may misconstrue its purposes and  goals. This must be an essential starting point. Events  determine history. An investigation commission must start with  incidents of human rights violations and issue a statement  concerning this.  <H5>  Statements Which Obstruct A Process </H5>   President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has repeated, in an  inexplicable and absurd way, the speech given by former  President Serrano on the negotiation issue. This is  reprehensible, above all because it counters agreements that  were signed and ratified after 10 January.    To proclaim nonexistent military victories and to proclaim  the URNG's alleged defeat at the political and international  level, casts doubts on the government's willingness to  negotiate, gives evidence of profound contradictions and  divisions, and represents obstacles to the peace process. The  current administration's only achievement is the signing of  agreements on the negotiation process. The president and his  government must be aware of this.    His prestige as human rights ombudsman has been criticized  all over the world. His only alternative is to comply with, and  implement, the human rights agreement. He must also give  specific proof that he intends to continue with the negotiation  process.    If the president wants to fulfill his role, and if he wants  this role recognized at the national and the international  level, he must avoid traditional and recalcitrant speeches. It  is incongruent and detrimental to repeat them.    URNG GENERAL COMMAND    [signed] Commander Rolando Moran, Commander Pablo Monsanto,  Commander Gaspar Ilom, and Carlos Gonzalez, secretary, Central  Committee of the PGT [Guatemalan Labor Party]    8 May 1994.</p>

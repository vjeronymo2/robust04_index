			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Letter: Talisman no successor to Taurus Sir, Your review of the Taurus project ('Sudden death of a runaway bull', March 19) contained a clear warning for those hoping to build a long-term solution for the London equity market's settlement requirements on the base of the Talisman system. A key quotation pointed out that Talisman was a 14-year-old system where much of the software is unique or obsolete and will not tolerate interference. However successful Talisman has been, it will be very difficult to extend its functions and its performance even to support a limited system providing facilities for the largest institutions. Any attempt to develop it to a level where it could support rolling settlement and delivery versus payment would almost certainly end in a similar disaster to the Taurus project. Eventually, a modern system will have to be installed, whether it is written as bespoke software or developed from a system in use elsewhere. To be successful, the project must be strongly controlled with a clear and consistent goal towards which the business analysts and technicians can aim. Further, the best technical expertise must be obtained, so input from other areas with greater experience of large, high-performance databases (for example, the airline industry) must be sought. It would seem likely that only the Bank of England would have the authority to overcome vested interests within the City and bring such a project to a successful conclusion. Past history in terms of the gilts and money market settlement systems provides hope that the Bank can and will exert such authority.

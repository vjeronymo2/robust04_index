			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> LACKED DRUG EVIDENCE, OFFICIAL SAYS  </P> <P> A former head of the Canadian Track and Field Assn. denied allegations today  that he ignored evidence about steroid use by athletes.  </P> <P> Wilf Wedmann told a federal inquiry he could not act on allegations that Ben  Johnson and other Canadian athletes were taking steroids because he never had  the evidence -- namely, athletes and coaches willing to testify for the record.  </P> <P> "We need people on the record. We need people that can be put before a hearing  to testify to that effect," Wedmann said.  </P> <P> Wedmann also said he did not have the authority to authorize a "sting"  operation to set a trap for Johnson.  </P></p>

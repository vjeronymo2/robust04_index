			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Abolition of student loans proposed by Lib Dems - Higher Education AN INCREASE in investment in higher education, a doubling of student numbers by the end of the decade and immediate abolition of the government's student loans scheme were proposed by the Liberal Democrats yesterday. In a new policy statement, the party calls for an independent pay review body to give lecturers pay comparability with other professionals. It also advocates the introduction of more flexible degree courses. The Liberal Democrats also propose to abolish parental contributions to students' living costs and to restore their rights to social security benefits - both with heavy cost implications. 'The doors to higher education need opening far wider, giving access to all sections of British society,' said Mr Matthew Taylor, the party's education spokesman.</p>

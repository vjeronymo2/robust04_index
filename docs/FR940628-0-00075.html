			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 195.416(g) states that if localized corrosion pitting is found to exist to a degree where leakage might result, the pipe must be replaced or repaired, or the operating pressure must be reduced commensurate with the strength of the pipe based on the actual remaining wall thickness in the pits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA recognizes that paragraphs (f) and (g) do not provide guidance for an operator's use in determining the strength of the actual remaining wall thickness of corroded steel pipe. To provide such guidance, RSPA proposed amending &sect;195.416(h) to adopt the ASME Manual B31G procedure for determining the remaining strength of corroded steel pipe in existing pipelines. Application of the procedure was proposed to be in accordance with the limitations set out in the B31G Manual. The rule would provide guidance as to whether a corroded region (not penetrating the pipe wall) may be left in service; this option might require a reduction in maximum allowable operating pressure, but may be more economical than replacement or repair of the corroded pipe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ten THLPSSC members voted for the proposal (5 members did not vote).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments relative to &sect;195.416(h) were received from five commenters. One commenter said the proposal to change &sect;195.416(h) is inappropriate and should be redone to be consistent with &sect;192.485. Others stated that the proposal was unnecessarily restrictive because it did not allow the use of other proven industry developed methods for determining the remaining strength of corroded pipelines. The most noteworthy method mentioned was ``A Modified Criterion for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipe (with RSTRENG disk)'' developed by Battelle under the Pipeline Research Committee of the American Gas Association (AGA). (Project PR 3&hyph;805, December 1989, AGA catalog No. L51609). Project PR 3&hyph;805 was undertaken to devise a modified criterion that, while still assuring pipeline integrity, would eliminate as much as possible the excessive specifications embodied in the ASME B31G manual. The AGA modified criterion, using a complex analysis approach, can be carried out by means of a PC-based program called RSTRENG. The modified criterion can also be applied via tables or curves or a long-hand equation if a simplified analysis is preferred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The addition of the modified criterion to the rule does not compromise safety because it merely accepts an established pipeline industry guideline, and does not impose new requirements on the operators. Accordingly, RSPA is amending &sect;195.416(h) to include the AGA/Battelle_A Modified Criterion for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipe (with the computer disk RSTRENG).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Rulemaking Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Impact Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Regulatory Evaluation has been prepared and is available in the docket. RSPA estimates the proposed changes to existing rules would result in an estimated savings of $1,534,000 per year for the hazardous liquid pipeline industry at no cost to the industry, and with no adverse effect on safety. As discussed above, these savings would come largely from the use of new technology, greater flexibility in constructing and operating pipelines, and the elimination of unnecessary requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Federalism Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> RSPA has analyzed the proposed rules under the criteria of Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987). The regulations have no substantial effects on the states, on the current federal-state relationship, or on the current distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Thus, preparation of a federalism assessment is not warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> RSPA criteria for small companies or entities are those with less than $1,000,000 in revenues and are independently owned and operated. Few of the companies subject to this rulemaking meet these criteria. Accordingly, based on the facts available concerning the impact of this proposal, I certify under Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this proposal would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule applies to intrastate and interstate pipeline facilities used in the transportation of hazardous liquids or carbon dioxide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The documentation for the information collection requirements for part 195 was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during the original rulemaking processes. Currently, regulations in part 195 are covered by OMB Control Numbers 2137&hyph;0047 (approved through May 31, 1994), 2137&hyph;0578 (approved through October 31, 1994) and 2137&hyph;0583 (approved through May 31, 1994). There are no new information collection requirements in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 195  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ammonia, Carbon dioxide, Incorporation by reference, Petroleum, Pipeline safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In consideration of the foregoing, RSPA is amending 49 CFR part 195 as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=3 --> PART 195_[AMENDED]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1.

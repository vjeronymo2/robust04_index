			<p>BFN     [Text] Military sources at the Miraflores barracks in La  Paz disclosed yesterday, 13 June, that "all members of Army  Divisions, Air Brigades, and Navy Units, during the past few  hours have expressed their firm support for Armed Forces  Commander General Fernando Sanjines Yanez."    The military sources were asked about the "replacement of  the  commander in chief." They told LOS TIEMPOS today that "nothing  significant will happen during the next few days with the high  military command now that Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the  president of the Republic and general commander of the Armed  Forces, has ratified his confidence in the military commander."    The source stated: "The military garrisons were surprised by  the military prosecutor's recommendation to try General Fernando  Sanjines for allegedly being involved in the sale of material  and spare parts belonging to the Bolivian Air Forces in 1992."    Just hours after Military Prosecutor Ezequiel Block's  recommendation was disclosed, the high military command was  shaken by an unusual movement of troops, and it was rumored that  "the commander in chief would be replaced immediately."    The situation was clarified at a high level after the  president of the Republic "ratified his confidence in Sanjines  as commander in chief of the Armed Forces."</p>

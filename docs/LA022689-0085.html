			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A couple will not seek custody of a 10-year-old girl they believe is their  daughter, but they still want tests done to determine if they are her parents,  their lawyer said. Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., would settle for  a chance to visit with the girl, said John Blakely, the Twiggs' attorney. "We  feel that we should not be denied the right to know that girl as a child," Mrs.  Twigg told the Tampa Tribune in an interview. The Twiggs filed a lawsuit last  year seeking genetic testing of the girl, Kimberly Mays. The girl's father,  Robert Mays, of Sarasota, Fla., is fighting to block the tests. The Twiggs  claim they brought the wrong child home from Hardee Memorial Hospital in  Wauchula, Fla., in 1978, and that Robert and the late Barbara Mays took their  child the same day. The girl the Twiggs reared died of a congenital heart  defect last August.  </P></p>

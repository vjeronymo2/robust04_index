			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Panarin, candidate of historical </F> sciences: "Our People Among Strangers. Russians in the Near  Abroad"]    [Text] Much has already been said about the fate of  Russians living in the near abroad. At the same time a certain  one-sidedness has been characteristic of the reasoning on this  subject: the overseas Russians themselves and the peoples  surrounding them are not usually seen as the characters of  history on whose behavior this solution of the "Russian  question" or the other will depend. There is not, accordingly,  all that much interest in the capacity of either for independent  action, and their mutual relations and aspirations are touched  on only in passing.  <H5>  Weakness of the Strong </H5>   In 1989 Central Asia had a population of 49 million persons.  Russians accounted for almost 20 percent, or 9.5 million of  them. In terms of absolute numbers, Russians were spread within  the region as follows: 6.2 million of them in Kazakhstan, over  1.6 million in Uzbekistan, 900,000 in Kyrgyzstan, 380,000 in  Tajikistan, and 330,000 in Turkmenistan. In terms of the  proportion of Russians in the population, the order is somewhat  different: Kazakhstan 38 percent, Kyrgyzstan, 21 percent,  Turkmenistan, over 9, and Uzbekistan and Tajikistan,  approximately 8 percent.    Proceeding from these figures, Russians represent quite a  sizable force. Especially since they are employed mainly in  industry, construction, and transport. There are among them many  first-class specialists, and their labor creates a proportion of  the national income notably in excess of their proportion of the  population. But the Russians' political importance far from  corresponds to their numbers, educational level, and economic  role. It is possible to speak confidently even about their  political weakness.    To understand the point at issue here, it is necessary to  once again resort to figures. In 1989 from 52 to 57 percent of  Russians in the republics of the region, or approximately 5  million persons, were first-generation immigrants. Of these,  only 1.5 million had lived in Central Asia for over 10 years.  The proportion of persons fluent in the language of the titular  nation was among Russians negligible: from 1 percent in  Kazakhstan to 4.5 percent in Uzbekistan.    Central Asia's Russians are weak for the added reason that  they do not form communities which are really cohesive on the  inside. All too often were they shaken up and shuffled about by  the Soviet authorities. They are socially disconnected, they  have not generated their own traditions, and they have no  experience of joint struggle for their rights and interests.    Russians' adaptation to the new situation is complicated by  their milieu also. It is oppressing the Russians and pushing  them out. There is much in this pressure that is  unpremeditatedly transient. But people usually judge the future  by what the present is like. And it is not inspiring. It is not  even a question of economic difficulties and the slump in the  industries in which Russians are employed or the everyday  manifestations of nationalism. Russians are prepared to put up  with all this. When they leave the region, it is other factors  that are of decisive significance.    First factor. A new role appeared for Russians  with the proclamation of independence. Inasmuch as a whole  number of support structures of the new statehood may be  supported only by them as yet (the energy complex, defense  industry, the borders, technological continuity), the viability  of the states of the region and, with it, the stability of  national power, essentially depend on the Russians. The  politicized groups of the indigenous population understand this  full well. But they see the stabilizing role of the Russians  both as a good thing and as an evil--a threat to their plans for  the building of strong states of the titular nations. And they  calculate: Lest we in time come up against the Russians'  organized resistance to state nationalism, it is not enough  preventing them from creating their own parties. It is necessary  in addition by way of preemption to close all potential schools  of solidarity. Consequently, no "Russian communities," "Russian  universities," and so forth.    Second factor. Actual policy in the region is not  European, and not even Russian. Underlying it is the struggle  between local-cultural communities (journalists have christened  them "clans") for power and resources. It is not aimed  especially against Russians; nonetheless, it excludes them from  unofficial policy simply automatically, on account of their  being "nontitular." And at this time the power structures are  quietly being "purged" of Russians within the framework of  official policy. There is just one outcome: In the face of  rivals, Russians are left without connections, allies, or  sponsors, in the face of the authorities, without the means to  block unacceptable decisions. This is engendering in the  Russians a sense of a lack of political protection and  discrimination, and it cannot be dispelled either by formal  legislative guarantees of equality or by reassuring statements  of presidents.    Third factor. Each new state of the region and the  region as whole have not achieved genuine political stability. A  modern political culture is far from developed here. Titular  nations have not been formed completely, and they have  long-standing claims on one another. Despite the ostensible  splendor, not all is operating smoothly in interstate relations,  either. Together with the growth of the political nationalism of  the titular nations, an increase in the attraction of the  indigenous population to Islam--a religion disposed toward  active interference in policy--has also emerged in recent years.  The influx into the cities of rural youth with a low educational  level has increased. It is seeking for itself a place in the  sun--but the place has been taken by Russians! As the experience  of the Third World has shown, it is among the socially  unsuccessful young migrants that xenophobia rapidly develops and  the propaganda of "simple" solutions to complex problems finds a  response. All this is making Central Asia a place of the  dangerous concentration of possible conflicts. And recollections  of what these conflicts might be like are still fresh: the  conflagrations in Fergana, the Osh beatings, the blood, plunder,  and devastation in Tajikistan.... When stability is real,  representatives of the minority, thinking of the future, may be  guided by sober calculation. When it is only apparent, rational  considerations frequently give way in the face of a fit of  emotion and an endeavor to save oneself, not counting personal  cost, from the oppressive threat of violence.  <H5>  Security Is Not Guaranteed </H5>   It is obvious from what has been said that Russians are  making their continued stay in the region dependent on how the  problem of their security is resolved. Three aspects of security  are for them most important of all here: cultural security,  political security, and physical security. If they are  guaranteed, the majority of Russians will remain where they are.  Russians are united as yet mainly by objective similarity of  situation, and they are seeking not so much joint (group)  security as personal (individual) security. The best evidence of  this is their behavior: they are acting like people deprived of  collective support, and each is relying on himself. And the  Russians are primarily walking away from conflict situations.  This, incidentally, is one of the main reasons why there have as  yet been no bloody clashes between Russians and representatives  of the titular nations in Central Asia.    But the Russians are leaving. And no difficulties are  stopping them. Even though the prices of Russians' apartments  have fallen and hosts of bribe-takers are swarming all over the  emigrants, even though things are difficult in Russia with  regard to accommodations and jobs, Russians keep on coming. It  has to be acknowledged that the masses of Russians have decided  that they have no way of achieving personal security other than  by making their way to Russia.    Is the assertion of a mass departure justified, however?  Here  are figures for Tajikistan: Since the start of 1989 through the  end of 1993, the Russian population declined fourfold. Some  85,000-100,000, the majority of whom are simply not in a  position to leave--they have no money--have remained. Of course,  the flight of Russians from Tajikistan was provoked to a large  extent by the civil war. But let us take neighboring Kyrgyzstan,  where political stability has been maintained thus far and  where, incidentally, the sole Slav university throughout the  region has been inaugurated. In 1989 the net migration exodus of  Russians was 2,200 persons, in 1990, 16,300, in 1991, 17,400, in  1992, 48,500, and in nine months of 1993, almost 60,000. In five  years the Russian minority has "thinned" by 20 percent, and the  average annual growth of the migration wave in 1990-1993 (after  it had suddenly soared, that is) was 170 percent! If this trend  continues even in a modified form, there will by the end of the  century be no Russians left in Kyrgyzstan at all.    So, according to the most guarded calculations, there are no  longer 9.5 million Russians in Central Asia but 8-8.5 million.  The rate of their departure is accelerating. Russians can still  adapt, their exodus may yet be halted. But support from outside  and a policy of protection on the part of Russia are needed for  this. Will such a policy be pursued?    High officials declared recently that Russia would  henceforward take advantage of its position of donor for the  protection of Russians in Central Asia. The question of dual  citizenship was raised also (and has with Turkmenistan already  been settled). In short, Russia has openly proclaimed a policy  of the protection of "compatriots" and indicated that it will  pursue it economically and by legal means.    The adoption of this policy signifies a partial  identification of Russia's national interests with the ethnic  interests of the minority which lives outside it and which, in  accordance with all international rules of law, comes under the  all-embracing (albeit not unconditional) jurisdiction of other  states. A real danger of Russia's infringement of its neighbors'  sovereignty arises. And the main grounds for this is the archaic  "common blood" principle, which is rejected by civilized policy.    Such an approach will hardly win the support of the  international community. It is risky from the viewpoint of  regional security also. The Moscow-Kiev-Almaty triangle contains  the main potential for stability or instability for the entire  former USSR and the geopolitical space adjoining the CIS.  Relations with Ukraine have long left much to be desired. But  the Kazakhstan leg has not, it would seem, been cause for  concern. But Russia's insertion on the political agenda of  "compatriots" as a central problem has already shown that this  is fraught with complications in relations with Kazakhstan.    Nonetheless, the policy of the protection of Russians cannot  be rejected out of hand merely on the grounds that it is not  defended by legal precedent or that it threatens to harm  Russia's relations with its southern neighbors. The problems  bequeathed Russia by the unique state of the USSR are frequently  without precedent also. So they need to be resolved by us  conforming to their essence, to the Soviet historical legacy  embodied in them, not merely to fine world standards. Further,  since the millions of citizens of Russia who voted for  Zhirinovskiy are making of paramount importance the security of  "their," Russian, community (rather the security of national  prestige, even), it is impossible to continue to pursue as  though nothing has happened a policy with the emphasis only on  the security of the individual. The main thing is that the  problem of the Central Asian Russians really does confront  Russia and that the latter must resolve it.  <H5>  The Fourth Path </H5>   Four paths are theoretically open to the Central Asian  Russians: dissolution in the majority (assimilation), return to  Russia (repatriation), separation or the acquisition of  territorial autonomy (sovereignization), and organic inclusion  in the local society with preservation of their ethno-cultural  distinctiveness (incorporation). With assimilation, the need for  protection evaporates. With repatriation, protection is  necessary, but only for the period of immigration. It is far  more important to create for the immigrants human conditions in  Russia. But it is in this sphere that concern for the  "compatriots" is being displayed most niggardly. An emphasis on  sovereignization could lead to open and acute conflicts.  Considering what has already been said about the Russian  minority, it is doubtful that it would anywhere achieve  sovereignization with the purely political support of Russia.  The sovereignization of the Russians is entirely unacceptable to  the local political elites, and for the majority of the  indigenous population also, evidently. Resistance to such  attempts would be bitter. But then the main role in the  protection of Russians would revert to military means, and there  would no longer be either personal or group or regional security.    There remains only the fourth path, whereby economic and  legal means of protection are expedient and paramount--the path  of incorporation. Judging by everything, Russia intends on the  one hand to push onto it those being protected and, on the  other, to constrain its CIS partners to clear this path of  various obstacles. But here is the problem: economic and legal  protection are painfully different in terms of anticipated  effect.    The positive effect of economic protection could be  considerable. In the event of Russia's skillful use of this  lever, the governments of the countries of the region would  agree to grant Russians real guarantees of cultural autonomy.  There would be a great probability also of an easing of the  hidden discrimination against Russians. It would all depend here  on whether the Russians themselves could forgo the habits of a  client and the ways of an "elder brother," and whether there  would be the disappearance in the titular nations of the  suspicions that the Russians want not so much incorporation as  isolation and that they are pining for their former, exclusive  status and could for this reason be a fifth column, the conduits  of imperial designs, and so forth.    A few words about legal protection. Dual-citizenship  agreements would make it a legitimate component of interstate  relations, which is very important for Russia. But they are,  strictly speaking, important for Russians only inasmuch as they  facilitate departure for Russia. Legal protection would do  little to help consolidate the Russian minority and its  cohesion, however, and could even hinder it.    As a whole, whatever accents Russian policy adopts, its  results will depend, all the same, on the behavioral responses  of Russians and the indigenous population, which is relatively  impervious to its influence. This does not mean that a policy of  protection is not needed at all. It is simply that it is not  possible to expect much. It would most likely stimulate not  incorporation, but a gradual exodus to Russia. It would at best  postpone the leave-taking of Central Asia of the majority of  Russians who live there (this would be its dubious, albeit  modest, success), but would under no circumstances put it off  far into the 21st century.</p>

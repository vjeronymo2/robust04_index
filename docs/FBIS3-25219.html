A community leader  in Akwa Ibom State, Mr. Godwin Obote, told newsmen in Lagos that  thousands of people in Akwa Ibom and Cross River States have  fled their homes because of incursions, especially in Bakassi  Peninsula. Mr. Obote suggested the stationing of troops in the  affected areas with the mandate to strike back if the invasion  persisted. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Bridgestone wakes from an American nightmare: Martin Dickson analyses the Japanese company's problems in a foreign market A long American nightmare is finally over for Bridgestone, the Japanese rubber company which found itself in severe difficulties after it snapped up Firestone, the large US tyre manufacturer, in an ambitious Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.74bn) takeover five years ago. This is the first year since then that Bridgestone/Firestone (BFS), the US company formed after the takeover, will make an annual profit. The newly confident company claims to be gaining ground in an intensely competitive market - but so too does Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, the market leader, which last month reported one of its best quarterly results ever. Goodyear had an estimated 15.5 per cent share of the US replacement car tyre market in 1992, compared with 7.5 per cent for Firestone and 3.5 per cent for BFS's separate Bridgestone brand, according to Modern Tire Dealer magazine. The financial upturn is a welcome change for BFS, which lost Dollars 350m in 1990, Dollars 500m the following year and Dollars 146m in 1992 - even though it broke even in the second half of last year. And it is an important development for the company's Japanese parent, which staked much of its future on the 1988 takeover. Before the deal, it was number one in the Asian tyre market, but an also-ran elsewhere. Bridgestone's problems in the US, and the way it has gone about solving them, show that Japanese companies are far from infallible in penetrating foreign markets, particularly when taking over another company rather than building their own business from scratch. 'The problems of Firestone have proved to be far more difficult than anyone expected,' says Mr Sunil Kumar, president of BFS's tyre sales business. Originally, Bridgestone merely wanted to take a majority stake in the Firestone tyre business, but it was pushed into a full takeover when Italy's Pirelli launched a competing offer. It knew that it would face some post-merger difficulties. When it bought a truck tyre plant from Firestone in Tennessee in the early 1980s, it found the equipment run down and labour relations poor. Nevertheless, it remained ill-prepared for the sheer scale of modernisation required and for the headaches of merging two corporate cultures, as well as different manufacturing and distribution systems. Bridgestone was forced in 1991 to pump an additional Dollars 1.4bn of capital into the subsidiary to halve its debt. The problems were compounded by the onset of recession in the US, which cut demand for tyres, and by the Japanese company's 'kid gloves' approach to its acquisition. Rather than aggressively merging the two companies, it initially kept Firestone's sales and marketing operations separate from Bridgestone's, thus losing many of the cost advantages of the deal and fostering competition between the two arms. 'They didn't want to do anything which might injure Firestone,' says Mr Kumar. 'I think they ended up injuring everyone.' He says there were numerous examples of Bridgestone salesmen calling on dealers and trying to encourage them to buy Bridgestone tyres rather than Firestone. However, BFS's fortunes turned for the better in 1991 when the parent company adopted a more hands-on approach, despatching Mr Yoichiro Kaizaki, a senior executive from Tokyo, to replace Mr George Aucott, the then chief executive. 'He changed the attitude of everyone in the company,' says Mr Kumar. 'Before, everyone went around staring at their shoes feeling we were losers.' Mr Kaizaki, who returned to Japan last March to become president of Bridgestone, rapidly consolidated the two marketing operations. He reorganised the company into 21 independent business units, each with responsibility for profits. Whereas the two brands had previously been treated as 'separate but equal', they were now 'together but unequal' - in other words aimed at different market niches. Bridgestone tyres tend to have an up-market performance image, while Firestone is more for the mass market. Mr Kaizaki switched the group's headquarters from Akron, Ohio, where Firestone was based, to Nashville, Tennessee, where Bridgestone had been headquartered. Nashville offered a geographically central location and a fresh beginning. However, BFS is also benefiting from initiatives stretching back to 1988. They include a Dollars 1.5bn manufacturing modernisation programme, announced six months after the takeover; the transfer of Japanese tyre-making technology, including a greenfield, state-of-the-art truck tyre plant in Warren, Tennessee, about to undergo a Dollars 110m expansion; and the introduction of Kaizan, continual manufacturing improvement through the involvement of shopfloor workers. All these factors, says Mr Kenji Shibata, BFS president, have improved productivity, though it remains about 65 to 70 per cent of Bridgestone's Japanese plants. He thinks this could rise to 95 per cent in five years. Differing environmental and social costs mean that parity is unlikely. Mr Masatoshi Ono, BFS chief executive, says that on the manufacturing side the company still needs to become more flexible, shortening product development times and coping better with small production runs. On the marketing side, both brands need to be strengthened. A survey of consumer satisfaction with tyres fitted on new cars, carried out by the market research concern JD Powers, found both Bridgestone and Firestone below the industry average in 1992, behind Pirelli, Michelin and Goodyear. Mr Kumar says: 'It takes a while for the consumer to recognise significant quality improvements.' BFS has no grounds for complacency. It may be in the black, but competition in the global tyre industry and excess manufacturing capacity is keeping tyre prices depressed. It will be a considerable time before Bridgestone gets a decent return on its US investment.  -------------------------------------------------- NORTH AMERICAN CAR TYRE MARKET  -------------------------------------------------- Replacement tyres 1992  -------------------------------------------------- Goodyear                        15.5% Michelin                         8.0% Firestone                        7.5% General                          5.0% Sears                            5.0% Cooper                           4.0% Uniroyal Goodrich                3.5% Bridgestone                      3.5% Kelly                            3.5% Multi-Mile                       3.0%  -------------------------------------------------- Source: Modern Tire Dealer  --------------------------------------------------</p>

Seven hundred and fifty-five drug users and  102 spouses of HIV infected IDU's were interviewed. Nine samples  among 54 from 89 IDU's in cohort were tested as seroconversion.  The seroconversion rate (incidence rate) in IDU's (per hundred  person years) in Ruili, Longchuan, and Luxi as well were 40.0,  12.2 and 0, respectively in 1993, comparing to 43.2, 12.2 and 0  in 1992. Thirty-eight were tested as positive among 108 samples  from 116 newly recruited IDU's. The seroprevalence rates in  these three counties were 85.7 percent, 40.0 percent and 0 in  1993, comparing to 81.8 percent, 44.6 percent and 5.1 percent in  1992. A coordination of the level between seroconversion and  seroprevalence was observed. An increasing trend of  seroprevalence among the spouses of HIV positive IDU's was  found, the seroprevalence rate were 3.1 percent in 1990, 9.8  percent in 1992 and 7.4 percent in 1993. More attention should  be paid to Luxi where the ratio of intravenous drug user  increased rapidly, although fewer positives and later starting  of drug using was found in this county.</p>

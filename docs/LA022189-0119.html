			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH PICKS UP A VOTE: FLORIDA'S REP. GRANT SWITCHES TO GOP  </P> <P> Two-term Florida Democratic Rep. Bill Grant delivered a political gift to  President Bush at the White House today by joining the Republican Party.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to bring Congressman Grant in here to say how pleased I am that  he is switching over to become a Republican," Bush said in opening a White  House news conference with Grant at his side.  </P> <P> Republicans, despite Bush's landslide win over Michael S. Dukakis on Nov. 8,  lost congressional seats to Democrats, who maintain large majorities in the  House and Senate. With the change, Democrats will hold a 258-to-175 majority in  the House. There are two vacancies.  </P> <P> A lifelong Democrat, Grant, 45, had no opposition in the November election.  </P> <P> Grant, who is rated a moderate Democrat by the American Conservative Union,  said he was switching because he can better serve his district "in a working  partnership, with this President, with this Administration and with this  party."  </P> <P> House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), asked about Grant's defection from the  majority party, said: "It took me by surprise, but that's everyone's choice. I  hope he's happy."  </P> <P> His conversion reverses the division of Florida's delegation to Congress,  giving the state 10 Republicans and nine Democrats.  </P></p>

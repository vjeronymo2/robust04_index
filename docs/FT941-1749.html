			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Clinton backs law to combat ship subsidies The Clinton administration has agreed to throw its weight behind legislation now in Congress which would impose fines on new ships built in foreign subsidised shipyards entering US ports. The decision to back the long-delayed legislation comes after leading shipbuilding countries and the US, meeting last week at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris, failed to agree to an end to shipbuilding and repair subsidies. The bill is intended to serve as a leverage in the US effort to end ship dumping, indirect supports, and subsidised export credits. US trade officials and the industry, represented by the Shipbuilders Council of America, are now at odds over the future of the talks. Officials are hoping for another round in April. The Swedish chairman of the talks will prepare a document laying the groundwork for further negotiations. Mr John Stocker, president of the shipbuilders council, said he had lost hope in a negotiated solution. 'Before last week's talks, we were assured by the Clinton administration that this round was it,' Mr Stocker said. 'If agreement couldn't be reached, our negotiators were going to pull the plug. We believe this time, final means final.' The shipbuilders council pushed for the talks when in 1989 it filed a complaint under Section 301 of US trade law. Unsubsidised US shipyards lost their commercial business base during the 1980s because they could not compete against subsidised competition. With the end of the cold war and the reduction of the naval fleet, more shipyards will close. Mr Stocker was critical of European negotiators, who are blaming the failure of the talks on the US. 'While the Japanese and Koreans were clearly interested, at least, in engaging the US side in dialogue, Europe was not,' he said. 'Without the legislation, we will never attain the trade agreement we want.' The council is also critical of the administration, which has reportedly held up 11 applications for a new programme of export credit guarantees, which offer up to 25-year repayment terms. After bilateral talks with Japan and South Korea produced significant breakthroughs, US trade officials thought an end to the negotiations was at last in sight. 'The US, Japan and Korea agreed to one standard on loan repayment terms - 12 years. Europe said No,' an official said. 'The US wanted discipline and a binding dispute settlement on export credit financing. The EU said No.' The EU then brought up the US Jones Act, which allows only US owned, built, and crewed ships to make more than one stop at US ports. US negotiators said this was an operating issue rather than a shipbuilding issue, but that the US was willing to limit the number of new ships built under the act.</p>

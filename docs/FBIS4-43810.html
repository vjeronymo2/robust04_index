			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Guenther Nonnenmacher: "Foreign Policy of </F> Small Steps"]    [Text] It is not expected that foreign policy themes will  decide the results of the Bundestag election in October, but  which foreign policy course prevails in the coming years is of  fateful importance for the future of Germany.    Corrections are necessary. The political world changed in  the  years 1989-90; hence Germany's position in the world also  changed. German politics must draw conclusions from this if it  wants not only to follow the developments resulting from the new  situation but also to help shape them. This does not at all mean  that the foreign policy wheel must be reinvented in Bonn or  Berlin. There are principles, orientations, and ties that have  proven themselves and that ought to be maintained. Of coure that  will not be possible by holding onto what has become customary;  it requires adaptations that are obviously difficult.    An example is the debate on new tasks for the Bundeswehr  that  go beyond national defense and collective defense in the  Atlantic alliance. It is therefore characterized by confusion,  because everything that exceeded this "classic mission" was out  of bounds until 1989. If many politicians today are warning  against a "militarization of German foreign policy," this  absurdity is a result of that situation.    The dispute about missions "out of area" is by no means, as  often asserted, a marginal subject--because intervention with  military means as in Somalia or in the ruined Yugoslavia are  said to be the exception anyway and generally unsuccessful and  because the role of military power in world politics is  increasingly being replaced by the importance of economic power  and scientific-technical capabilities. That may be correct in  part; nevertheless, the dispute about new tasks for the  Bundeswehr leads directly to the core of German foreign policy:  to the question of alliance capacity and hence to linkage with  the West. One of the absurdities is the fact that precisely the  leftists who originally were not pleased about Adenauer's policy  of being tied to the West became ardent supporters of this  policy after unification but simultaneously oppose new tasks for  the Bundeswehr.    If linkage with the West means more than just a feel for a  way of life or the diffuse perception of belonging together  politically and culturally, then the word can only mean that  Germany must be willing to share the responsibility and  subsequent burdens that its partners and allies are prepared to  take on--not only under the coercion of the geopolitical  situation as in the four decades of the postwar era but also  based on its own resolve after consultations and decisions of  competent authorities. Solidarity is not flying blind. Nor can  it be discharged through money and nice words but rather it has  practical consequences that cannot be avoided by resorting to  history or a special national ethos.    That also includes a German participation, even with  soldiers, in the arrangements that will be a precondition for a  peaceful settlement in the former Yugoslavia--possibly in the  guarding of the borders or the formation of buffer zones between  the successor states. Every realistic planning for such a case  requires forces in a magnitude that NATO cannot provide without  German participation in view of the necessary rotation of the  units. Therefore, in the event that agreement is reached on a  lasting and internationally supervised truce, there will be a  call for the Bundeswehr after a year at the latest--not from  Bonn but from Washington and Brussels, Paris and London. If the  Germans were to refuse that, it will have consequences, not only  for relations in the former Yugoslavia but also for the place of  Germany in NATO and for the future of the European Union.    People are tugging at this second anchor of the commitment  to  the West--in part in the leftist and in part in the rightist  corner of the political spectrum. It is said, for example, that  the European Community suffered a failure in 1991, because in  Maastricht it wanted to compartmentalize West Europe instead of  opening up to the East the union that was decided there. Apart  from the fact that the word "compartmentalize" does not become  more correct through repetition: How could one have imagined  such a rapid opening? As a lightning-accession of the Central  and East European countries (by the way, which is in and which  is not?) with full rights and duties? Who would have been  willing to bear the costs? Who would have benefited from the  fact that after the collapse of the Eastern markets the Western  markets would also have run into turbulence? And with which West  European partner would Germany have found support, and not just  politically, but also financially?    The step-by-step political opening of West Europe to the  East  combined with a gradual reduction of customs duties is  disdained, just as is NATO's Partnership for Peace, because that  does not correspond to the image of the "bold design" that many  desk strategists have of politics. But in a world in upheaval,  in a Europe that has not yet found its new shape, it is more  reasonable to proceed in short steps over secure terrain than to  make a great leap and to land in a void.</p>

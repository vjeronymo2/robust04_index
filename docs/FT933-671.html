			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Hong Kong's one for the road: A superhighway link with China is a symbol of growing confidence The map on Gordon Wu's wall says it all. A floor-to-ceiling projection of Guangdong's Pearl river delta shows the path of a 305km motorway Mr Wu is building between Hong Kong and Macao via Guangzhou, the capital of China's most dynamic economic region. Although much delayed, mostly by bureaucratic hurdles, the road's 123km first phase should be carrying traffic by the end of the year, according to Mr Wu. Fresh from a 120mph spin on the newly laid asphalt - there will be no speed limit - he says: 'I can't wait to do it in a Corvette.' Mr Wu's 'superhighway' is, however, no pleasure-run. Apart from being a crucial link between China and its gateway to the west, Hong Kong, the road  -and its developer - symbolise the confidence with which business is betting on China's future as a market economy. It is also a case study of how things get done in China. Viewed from a political angle, however, it is precisely this enmeshing of Hong Kong's economy with the mainland that is undermining governor Chris Patten's efforts to promote democracy in the colony before the handover to China in 1997. The governor says this autumn will be crucial in resolving Britain's impasse with Beijing over Hong Kong's political development. On Friday, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, holds an important meeting in New York with Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart. But what is clear is that, apart from Beijing's opposition to his plans for more democracy in the colony, Mr Patten faces a corrosive rebellion by the Hong Kong business class if Britain and China fail to agree a way forward. Business, which has pervasive influence in Hong Kong, thinks Mr Patten has got it wrong. Mr Wu, reflecting the predominant view in the Chinese business community, states bluntly the case that expatriates prefer to whisper in private. 'Mr Patten is a nice guy and he means well, but he should be a bit more patient,' he says. 'A small place like Hong Kong cannot fight communism with guns or words. Our biggest and only opportunity is to work with them gently and concentrate on the economy, saying to them: 'That's the way you will get the goodies.' ' The road that Mr Wu is building goes right to the heart of these issues. He says the idea first occurred to him on a visit to Guangdong in 1979 - a year after Deng Xiaoping, now 89, assumed power in China and began the process of opening up the country. The decisive moment, however, was the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989, which led to a foreign investment freeze and made China's top leaders eager to encourage projects such as Mr Wu's road. It was only then that anyone paid serious attention to his financial and traffic projections, enabling him to raise Dollars 800m from a consortium of banks to stand alongside the Dollars 200m of equity supplied by his own company, Hopewell Holdings, a construction conglomerate with interests ranging from house building to power stations. The banks were offered an eight-year pay-back, on the basis of traffic projections rising from 15,000 to 35,000 vehicles a day over that period. In China every stage of this process required months of negotiation with provincial officials. Mr Wu tried holding out for total control over the construction work but eventually conceded that the Chinese would take responsibility for two stretches of the first phase. He did, however, win the argument in favour of a six, rather than four, lane highway, arguing that an extra two lanes would add only 19 per cent to the cost of a four-lane road. On tolls, he agreed a figure of 10 US cents per car per kilometre, only for the Chinese authorities to change their minds and ask him to raise the figure to 12 cents. Mr Wu did get his way on quality standards, using British engineers and importing steel, cement and asphalt from around the world. China supplied the labour. The result is a road capable of bearing trucks with maximum loads of 16 tonnes an axle, greater than anything required by existing commercial traffic. Financially, phase one of the deal looks like a winner. Mr Wu is now confident that 30,000 vehicles a day will be diverted from the dusty, truck-choked roads of the Pearl river delta. He calculates that the banks will have their loans repaid in only four years. In the first decade, net profits after maintenance - for which Hopewell has the contract - are to be divided 60:40 between Guangdong and Hopewell. For years 11 to 30, the split is 70:30. But for all of Mr Wu's high-level political contacts, he has not had his way on phase two. Having been unable to agree a satisfactory work split with his partners, he has conceded the original route to the Chinese and mapped out a rival route about 30km to the east. For this road he expects land acquisition to be completed by the end of this year. Though riskier, the potential returns to Hopewell are commensurately higher. He will earn 100 per cent of any net return in the first decade and 50 per cent thereafter. The political pitfalls are obvious, perhaps explaining why Hopewell shares have missed out on Hong Kong's bull market since 1992. In stockbroker language, Hopewell is seen as a 'medium-term China infrastructure play', not the sort of stock to yield short-term rewards for investors. According to businessmen, political calm is required to transform China through economic contact. Mr Wu adds that the key to a successful project is support at the right level, which in China still means Beijing. That is how he has navigated his way through the obfuscation and corruption for which the Chinese bureaucracy is notorious. 'Corruption is everywhere,' he says. The villains, he claims, are at the middle levels of the bureaucracy, where he has found himself under pressure to procure materials of questionable quality and provenance. 'I get ahead in China because I have the support of top people and because they think what I do is good for the country. I don't pay, so I don't get much help from the middle guys.' Corruption, he maintains, is petty by some standards; a matter not of Swiss bank accounts, more of providing cars and overseas study opportunities for the children of Communist party officials. Mr Wu does, however, think that the Chinese authorities are starting to crack down. 'I would not be surprised to see executions,' he says. He is not squeamish about China's system of law and order. But it would be wrong to dismiss Mr Wu as an Asian tycoon ignorant of western political concepts. Educated at Princeton, he named his son after Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence. Arguing for a slower pace of political change in Hong Kong, he rattles through two centuries of US history since Jefferson's declaration: the emancipation of the slaves in the 1860s, women's suffrage in the 1920s, and the civil rights movement in the 1950s. 'Democracy is a very nice word and I believe in it,' he says. 'But these changes should take place over time and not overnight. Mr Patten should be more patient. The House of Lords is still an appointed body after 700 years; why should people worry about functional constituencies being made up from select groups of people?' This is a reference to the complex internal mechanics of the colony's Legislative Council, its 60-strong law-making body, only a third of which will be popularly elected by 1997. Mr Patten faces a battle this autumn to push through a timetable for enhanced accountability, having already watered down his proposals to a point where one important faction of LegCo, headed by lawyer Mr Martin Lee, says that democracy has been betrayed. No one can yet tell whether, or how, London and Beijing will settle their differences. But anxiety is growing that they may not do so this year or perhaps at all, leaving the colony to lurch into Chinese ownership without a sustainable advance in democratic procedures. The point, still difficult to grasp for spectators in western democracies, is that most business leaders view the 1997 handover with equanimity. It is for this reason that many in the business community have ceased trying to persuade Mr Patten to change course. Asked what is his biggest concern about the fateful date, Mr Wu replies: 'Nothing, really. I don't believe China will revert to the communist planned economy thing.' Nor does he accept that Beijing's accession will import the corruption he has wrestled with in Guangdong. Not many in Hong Kong would agree with him. Indeed, spreading corruption is the main fear of a Hong Kong middle class that does not have high-level Beijing connections or the financial resources of top business people. Mr Wu says that within 15 years China will resemble, but on an enormous scale, Taiwan, which has moved in recent years from a plainly authoritarian to a recognisably plural society. The key to this development, he says, has been the influence of young Taiwanese educated abroad, who now have seats in the commanding heights of politics and the economy. The same process is under way throughout China. Not even the death of Deng is seen as altering this course. 'Deng will be sadly missed: he's a great man. Deng and Gorbachev are the great guys of the century. But for China the die is cast.' This leads the conversation back to Thomas J Wu. Fresh from graduation at Princeton - where he has capped his father's grade Cs in engineering with a row of As - TJ, says his father, will probably do a couple of years in the engine room of someone else's business and then perhaps graduate school. But his father's idea of his future in post-1997 Hong Kong could not be clearer. 'I would like him to be running this company.'</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Venezuela proposes telecom share sale VENEZUELA plans to sell Dollars 600m worth of shares in CANTV, the telephone company managed by GTE Corporation of the US, by June this year, Reuter reports from Caracas. Mr Julian Villalba, president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, said that a small block of shares would be issued on the Caracas stock exchange to establish market value and the rest would be placed on foreign stock exchanges. 'We are looking to register them on an exchange, through any mechanism, and it doesn't have to be on Wall Street,' said Mr Villalba. The Dollars 600m in shares would represent one-third of the state's 49 per cent stake in CANTV. The government had said it would sell its stake in the telephone concern in the first quarter of 1993. Recent news reports said the government planned to delay the sale until next year to get a better price. In November 1991, a consortium of companies led by GTE paid Dollars 1.88bn for 40 per cent of CANTV and took managerial control. Another 11 per cent of shares were sold to employees. The government hoped that recent investments worth several hundred million dollars to improve and expand the system would factor into the share price, Mr Villalba said. Mr Villalba said the new sale of shares could be made in the US but officials would look at exchanges in Europe or Asia. Lehman Brothers would be lead underwriters of the sale on foreign exchanges, he said. The government said it expected to raise about Dollars 2bn this year from the privatisation of state companies, including about Dollars 1.2bn from utilities. The controlling US shareholders in New Zealand's Telecom Corporation have extended until September 12, 1994 an option to sell their shareholdings. Under a 1990 agreement, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech of the US bought 100 per cent of Telecom from the New Zealand government, on condition that they reduced their shareholding to 49.9 per cent by September, 1993.</p>

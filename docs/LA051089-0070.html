			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTWOOD ONE GAINS GROUND IN SKIRMISH OVER 'PIRATE RADIO' TAG  </P> <P> Westwood One, the owner of KQLZ-FM, which has dubbed itself "Pirate Radio  100.3," has won a round in its battle to keep piracy off the air waves.  </P> <P> Attorneys for Westwood One recently sent letters to several radio stations  asking that they refrain from using the slogan pirate radio, which they say was  coined by KQLZ program director and morning deejay Scott Shannon.  </P> <P> Four stations that used the term pirate when identifying their stations have  responded by discontinuing use of the moniker, said Westwood One spokeswoman  Katie Garber.  </P> <P> Jacor Communications Inc., which owns WEBN-FM in Cincinnati, WYHY-FM in  Nashville and WFLZ-FM in Tampa, agreed to drop the slogan as of Friday. WHTQ-FM  in Orlando has also agreed to stop all its references to "Rock 'n' Roll  Pirates."  </P> <P> WIOQ-FM based in Philadelphia also received a letter from KQLZ asking it to  stop using pirate radio, but the station is continuing to use the name and does  not intend to stop, according to program director Mark Driscoll, who said that  no one owns the term pirate.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, radio moniker wars continue locally with KFI still trying to  determine under what circumstances it can call itself "talk radio."  </P> <P> Last week U.S. District Court Judge Richard A. Gadbois issued a preliminary  injunction pending the outcome of a trial, stopping the radio station from  using the slogan in conjunction with its call letters. The judge ruled that  until the suit is decided later this year the label belongs to KABC, which has  used the term for 17 years.  </P> <P> "KFI . . . shall be enjoined pending trial from "using the phrase 'KFI Talk  Radio' 'Talk Radio KFI' or any confusingly similar phrase as KFI's trade name  station slogan," Gadbois said in his ruling.  </P> <P> KFI filed a motion for clarification Tuesday asking that the judge remove the  language "or any confusingly similar phrase" because of its lack of clarity.  </P></p>

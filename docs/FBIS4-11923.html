			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Pressure With No Name"] </F>   [Text] There is no doubt that Jordan is being subjected to  tremendous pressures from regional and big powers to fall into  line with new arrangements in the Middle East, especially a full  peace based on the dictates of Israel. That pressure is being  manifested in many ways. In one, Israel wants Jordan to sign a  peace treaty without settling the thorny issues of land, water  and refugees. Unless our borders with Israel and Palestine are  demarcated and fixed there cannot be progress; and unless the  issues of water and refugees are solved to the satisfaction of  all parties no peace treaty can stand the test of time.  Palestinian refugees in Jordan, who number no less than 30 per  cent of the population, will turn into a destabilising factor to  the country's security unless and until their plight is solved  once and for all.    As far as water is concerned, Jordan's population, which is  growing at about three per cent annually, is already running  short of it but due mainly to the uneven sharing of the water  resources with Israel.    In another way, the U.S., which seems to be all the time  going along with whatever policies Israel advocates, is putting  pressure on Jordan on at least two fronts. The first is the  naval blockade against al-'Aqabah, and the second is in the  realm of Jordan-Arab relations. On the first count, Jordan can  only see the blockade as a punishment for Jordan's position  during the Gulf crisis. Since only al-'Aqabah-bound traffic in  the whole of the Near East and the East Mediterranean region is  being checked, the U.S. cannot continue to claim that it is  merely enforcing the regime of sanctions imposed by the U.N.  Security Council against Iraq. Jordan is right to ask whether  the same is being applied to goods destined to Iraq through  Syria, Turkey or Iran. The blockade against al-'Aqabah can only  be interpreted as a cruel tool of pressure on Jordan mandated by  Israel and implemented, with arrogance, by the U.S. and its  erstwhile allies in the Gulf war.    On the Arab front, Jordan cannot understand why it is being  boycotted by other Arab states in the region, especially Saudi  Arabia. Jordan has proven it had nothing to do with Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait. its position on foreign intervention in the  crisis has been vindicated. Some Arab members of the 30-nation  U.S.-led coalition that fought against Iraq are admitting that  the whole treatment of the conflict was a sham. Perhaps because  the Saudi leadership knows very well that the Saudi people  themselves were against foreign intervention, King Fahd has  decided not to "forgive" Jordan for pointing to that since the  very beginning of the crisis.    The prime minister, Dr. 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali, said  recently that the West was not contributing as much as it could  to Jordan's attempts to mend fences with the Saudis.    Well, if the U.S. truly cannot help that cause, Washington  can at least show goodwill by lifting the al-'Aqabah siege right  away. Good intentions by the Americans, translated into a  practical gesture this time, will not only help boost U.S.  standing among Jordanians. it will also serve America's best  interests in the region.</p>

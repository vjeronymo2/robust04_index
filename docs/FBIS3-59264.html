			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wei Liuqing (7614 3966 1987), Xu Shanyou (1776 </F> 0810 0645), and Chen Youdao (7115 2589 6670) of the Rugao  Municipal Family Planning Commission in Jiangsu: "Strategic  Thinking On Comprehensive Family Planning in Impoverished Areas"]    [Excerpts] Shanxi Province is one of the 18 most  impoverished places in China. In all, it has 50 impoverished  counties with a population of 8.5453 million, which occupies  45.5 percent of the province's 110 agricultural counties.  Scattered throughout such areas as Taihang, Taiyue, Hengshan,  and Zhongtiao, it constitutes 29.3 percent of Shanxi's total  population of 29,418,600. For many years, the Shanxi Provincial  Committee and the provincial government have adopted a series of  major and important measures intended to develop the economies  of the impoverished counties, but the average income in 1991 was  still less than 300 yuan, which was 47.2 percent lower than the  provincial average. In addition, 20 percent of the peasants  still have been unable to resolve the problem of getting enough  to eat or warm clothing to wear. Looking into the reasons, we  see that in addition to the restrictions of climate, water  resources, traffic, and production type, backwardness of family  planning work is an important factor. While this backwardness is  due to a very large degree to insufficient comprehensive  handling by relevant departments and various other sectors of  society. [passage omitted]  <H3>  Major Characteristics of Family Planning Work in the  Impoverished Areas </H3>   1. A higher birth rate, with a more rapid population  increase. The fourth census showed that the birth rate in  Shanxi's 50 impoverished counties was up to 25.18 per 1000,  which was 12.9 percent higher than the provincial average for  the same period. The highest birth rate was in Baode county,  which reached as high as 31.23 per 1000. In 1992, based on a  population survey by the provincial Bureau of Statistics, the  birth rate in the 50 impoverished counties was 21.23 per 1000,  which was still 8.4 percent higher than the average level for  Shanxi. In addition, the natural population rate of increase in  the impoverished areas was very high: it was 18.23 per 1000 in  the fourth census and 14.29 per 1000 in 1992, which was,  respectively, 2.17 and 1.64 per 1000 higher than the provincial  average for the same period.    2. The high gross female fertility rate. In 1989, the gross  female fertility rate in the 50 impoverished counties was 3.27,  which was 0.81 higher than the provincial average. Among these,  there were 31 counties in which the gross female fertility rate  was more than three with Ji County having the highest rate,  4.398. In Daning and Fengxi Counties, it was up to 4.259 and  4.123, respectively. Based on our recent investigation, 1992's  gross female fertility rate in the 50 impoverished counties was  still steady at three, with no decrease.    3. The rate of family planning and a high rate of multiple  births. According to figures from the fourth census, the  multiple birth rate in the 50 impoverished counties was up to  34.8 percent, with the highest being 50.3 percent in Pu County;  it was close to 50 percent in Fengxi, Zhongyang, and Baode  Counties. Although these counties were listed as key control  counties by the provincial committee and government, the recent  investigation showed that its multiple birth rate was still  holding at 20 percent, and in some towns and villages was still  higher than 30 percent. Countering this is the fact that the  family planning rate in the impoverished areas tends to be low;  in 1990, the family planning rate in the 50 counties was 40.4  percent, and in 1992, it was 43.9 percent. Both of these figures  were obviously lower than that for all rural areas in Shanxi.    4. A low rate of late marriages and late births, and a high  rate of early marriages and births. [passage omitted] Based on  close monitoring by relevant departments, only about 20 percent  of young men and women persist in late marriage and births  voluntarily, and only about 15 percent of newly married couples  practice later births. Under the domination of traditional  custom, the phenomenon of early marriage, early childbearing,  and illegal marriages were quite popular. It was shown that, in  ten concentrated impoverished counties in Xinzhou, nine counties  on Lulian Mountain and six counties on Xi Mountain in Lingfeng,  the early marriage rate for women has risen to 21.8 percent from  17.6 percent at the time of the fourth census. The early  childbearing rate for women has also risen to 19.7 percent from  15.3 percent at the time of the fourth census, and in a few  individual places, the early marriage and early childbearing  rate even went over 30 percent. [passage omitted]  <H3>  The Current Situation Regarding Comprehensive Handling of  Family Planning Work in the Impoverished Areas </H3>   What we refer to as comprehensive handling of family  planning  work is, under the united leadership of Party committees at  various levels and governments, to inspire, organize, and  coordinate various powers throughout the whole of society,  confirming the division of labor into each relevant department's  position and responsibility. Its objective is to control the  increase in population, improve the quality of the population,  exploit every advantage, take responsibility for each position,  control each link, jointly manage, to create a population  situation with is favorable for building the economy and  developing society. We can examine the current situation of  comprehensive handling of family planning in Shanxi's  impoverished areas from two aspects:  1. Basic methods    A. The leadership, organization, and coordination functions  are carried out well by the various organs of committee and  government. Ten years ago, some prefectures, counties, towns,  villages (residents' committees) all established leading groups  for population and family planning work, which consisted of  departments of organization, personnel, popularization,  education, culture, labor, civil affairs, health, disciplinary  examination, supervision, as well as departments and groups for  workers, youth and women, etc. These were actually the local  leadership organs for comprehensive handling of family planning  work, implementing their authority in leadership, organization,  and coordination. In many localities, the leadership group also  established rules and systems for comprehensive handling of  family planning, confirming and regulating the division of labor  among each relevant department's position and responsibility,  and these were published in formal documents for operations. We  must applaud the issuance of these documents and rules, and the  positive role they played in promoting local family planning  work at that time. Meanwhile, family planning leadership  organizations at various levels resolved many difficult problems  in family planning work by means of major leaders being  personally on the scene, holding coordination meetings, brief  meetings, and associated meetings, etc.    B. The new framework for devoting the whole society to a  unified control has been formed initially. Popularization and  media departments, which include propagation, education,  culture, radio, television, film, and the Party school have all  played definite roles in propagating family planning, basic  national policy, educating masses of peasants, and changing  people's opinions regarding marriage and fertility.  Disciplinary and law enforcement departments, including  organization, personnel, labor, discipline examination,  supervision, public security, law enforcement, procuratorial  work and courts, have assumed certain responsibilities in  strictly controlling cadres. This includes their promotion,  initiating Party members, employment, discovering and handling  excessive births and excessive pregnancies among Party cadres  and employees. They also attack people and matters which damage  family planning work and forcibly enforcing the policy with  "nail families" and "nut families" who have had excessive  births; major administrative departments, including industrial  and commercial, civil affairs, urban construction, insurance,  revenue and expenditures, auditing, etc. have all performed  certain functions in supporting family planning work; functional  departments including planning, statistics, health, family  planning, etc., have all made massive contributions to enforcing  the population plan, supervising implementation policies, supply  services, adopting birth control measures, etc. So we can say,  the framework for handling family plan work in impoverished  areas has been initially formed.    C. The single-vote denial system for family planning has  been  implemented to a certain degree. In order to implement the basic  national policy for family planning, some Party and  administrative departments in the impoverished areas have  implemented the single-vote denial system to a certain degree  and scope. For example, in Liuling County, of only 40-some  cadres promoted in the past year, 15 had their eligibility  cancelled because of excessive births; when the education  department was involved in converting compensated volunteer  teachers to regular State employees, 18 of these people were  turned down for family planning reasons; the land department  denied approval to 57 excessive birth counters' land  applications for housing construction; the operations management  department took back grain rationed land and contracted land  from 265 families with excessive births. In addition, some  localities combined the single-vote denial system with such  matters as small valley management, orchard contracting,  extension of credit, competition in submitting tenders, etc.  There is no doubt that these steps played a positive role in  family planning work in the impoverished areas.    D. Some counties and towns have issued a series of social  and  economic policies favorable to family planning work. In recent  years, in accordance with the Central Party and government's  spirit of family planning "decisions", many impoverished areas  have put developing the economy and controlling the population  in the same position of importance, linked them with the actual  situation of the localities, and issued some social and economic  policies which were favorable to family planning work. Some  examples: in Shelou County, when the small valley management  policy was published, the ability to practice family planning  was factored in, which resulted in favorable treatment for over  2,000 families; Lang County took as its overall concept  "possessing land, this life resource, blocking the big mouth of  excessive births", to favor family planning families in  contracting for reserve land, uncultivated land, etc., through  the means of providing subsidies, while implementing advance  penalties for families with excessive births, before they were  allowed to cultivate the land. This program has been obviously  successful. Liuling County has linked poverty assistance closely  with family planning: when they fixed policy and rules for  arranging poverty assistance capital, verified with poverty  assistance counters, and taking family planning into  consideration, implemented the "six favorites" rule for family  planning families; Long County started from "two favorites"  angle, to implement a project to provide health care for women  and children and compensation for lost service, which was  welcomed by the masses; of six towns in Xin County, Yangjipo,  Xiaojiawa, and Donghui, favored family planning families in  contracting for orchards, making them models for how to get rich  quickly by having fewer children. All of these were beneficial  to family planning work in the improvished areas.    2.Major problems    While approving accomplishments and accumulating  experiences,  we must realize that in the process of comprehensive handling of  family planning in impoverished areas, there are still many  problems, which can be summarized chiefly as:    A. Some grass-roots Party and government major leaders have  a  tendency to "pay attention to the economy and ignore family  planning work". Some counties and towns' major Party and  government leaders are usually busy with projects, applying for  capital, conducting negotiations, and operating enterprises,  while putting little energy into family planning work. The time  they can personally devote to coordinating conflicts between  family planning and other departments is even less. In some  localities there are individual leaders who don't concern  themselves with family planning work at all, which causes family  planning work to always be in a backward status. This tendency  to "pay attention to the economy and ignore family planning  work" is extremely detrimental to population control in the  impoverished areas, and deserves immediate attention.    C. The work which related departments do in support of  family  planning work is stuck in the negative situation of "moving only  when pushed". Our investigation disclosed that although there  were no obvious "collisions" occurring in family planning work  when related departments fixed policies and rules in  impoverished areas, there was always a problem of one kind or  another in implementing policies. For example, on the issue of  promoting cadres, admitting them to Party membership, the family  planning situation is not taken into consideration before  observation and examination of excessive birth counts; it is  only after everything is set that they let the family planning  department express any opinions on the matter, which forces the  family planning to prepare for it in a rush. When implementing  measures designed to encourage the single child family, some  departments and work units have often failed to cash in by  making the excuse that fund were short. When punishing excessive  birth counters, some units deferred dealing with the situation  until receiving a communication from the family planning  department,and some units don't even apply the penalties then.  When doing work in support of family planning work, some units  have partial achievements along with partial failures. For  example, it is common for health departments to undertake a  considerable number of the "four kinds of operations", but there  have also been a great many complications and fake operations.  They judged the sex of the embryo by means of B supersonic  (wave) which causes a massive amount of psychological confusion,  more of a hindrance than a help. The illogical distribution  system regionally also is a problem. Since the implementation of  the production responsibility system, with the cultivated land  divided into two parts--the grain ration land and the  responsible contracted land--the former is allocated according  to number of family members, and the latter according to number  of people in the labor force, but some places allocated lands  totally according to number of family members. When allocating  disaster relief materials or money, the civil affairs department  bases their allocations on number of family members. In this  distribution system, more family members means more cultivated  land, which strengthens the peasants' desire for early births,  multiple births, and having boys. In addition, most departments  only worked on the framework of family planning work. When  dealing with circulating population, the public security and the  industrial and commercial departments completed their work after  checking certification regardless of whether it was true or  false that the applicants would have multiple births later on.  Law enforcement officers often fall back on excuses such as:  there are too many procedures, the measures are too  complicated, or they lack proof to not strictly enforce the law  on "nail families" and "nut families" of excessive births. They  cannot deal effectively with cases of abuse or beatings of  family planning cadres; they have let the perpetrators go  scot-free, with extremely bad effects. When issuing marriage  certifications, the civil affair departments have not strictly  enforced age limitations, plus there has always been the  possibility of "relationship certification" and "friendship  certification". They have shown a lack of enthusiasm and energy  in encouraging marriages and births at a later age, abandoning  "two later" education among young men and women. There have been  some departments doing more verbal and written work in family  planning, but little of an operational nature. When dealing with  Party members and cadres who violate discipline, some  disciplinary examination and supervision departments have only  discussed the matter but not done anything. Personnel and labor  departments did not practice what they announced they would do  in employing, accepting new cadres, and in raising wages and  promoting employees. Cultural, broadcasting, motion picture, and  television departments have very few programs which propagate  family planning ideas.    C. The system of encouragements, rewards, and penalties in  family planning is an "unhealthy situation". In the impoverished  areas, family planning's measures of rewards and penalties  hardly work. On the one hand, in most places, there are no  rewards at all, the so-called preferential treatment of having  only one child with even a five yuan health care fee for an only  child is something that cannot be cashed. However, they would  rather spend money on encouraging sterilization for excessive  birth parents. On the other hand, it was only symbolic in their  collection of social care fees from excessive birth parents. In  impoverished areas, it is common to find the phenomena of no  penalties, penalty replacement, penalty reduction, penalties  which are difficult to collect or not collected at all. Some  village cadres adopt the method of using fines instead of  ligature in order to operate their sterilization work which  actually creates a penalty free situation. Some excessive birth  families cannot afford the penalty fee due to family poverty, so  village cadres have to let them repair roads, plant trees, and  cultivate uncultivated land, and call it penalty replacement.  Many villages charge only five or six yuan for a second birth;  even for multiple excessive births, they only charge something  over 100 yuan, and call it a minor penalty; some excessive birth  parents roam about or cause trouble, beyond the reach of village  cadres' power; also the latter dare not take forceful measures,  and this is called a difficult penalty. Some family planning  cadres did not concern themselves with family planning work for  long periods of time, which led to a great many excessive  births, and formed a protective circle for excessive birth  parents: If they punished one of them, it would anger a group of  them, so in the end they didn't charge penalties at all. All of  these basically had no economically restricting function.    D. There are some "blank points" in family planning work  about which no one seems concerned. Early marriages, early  births, unmarried couples, the rate of these are quite high in  impoverished areas, and is tending to expand. This has a very  great effect on family planning work, but there is no department  dealing with this--that is one point. The geographical region  from which the marriage partners come is extremely small, they  do not have a premarital health examination, and there is no  guarantee of a woman's "three items" of health care. There are  still some individual places where intermarriage of close  relatives exists, and there are very serious instances of  marriage among retarded people or people with hereditary  diseases. These are detrimental to improving population  quality--this is the second point. We call these: "blank points".    E. There is a tendency for less and less in the social  restriction system which is favorable to family planning. In the  new situation of the socialist market economy, some new  situations and problems are appearing in the family planning  social system. One is that since opening up the grain price, the  original urban residence card has lost its original meaning, and  the restriction system of a grain residence card which was  exploited by family planning departments doesn't exist. Another  is that when contracting enterprises, stores, orchards, lands,  uncultivated lands, etc., competition depends on how much you  can put on the bid without any consideration of the family  planning factor. A third is that strengthening the role of the  family has increased the peasants' freedom, so that they think  more about their family and individual profits, and less about  national and collective profits. This is especially prominent in  birth matters. [passage omitted]</p>

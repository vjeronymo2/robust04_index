			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wei Tao [7614 3447]] </F>   [Text] Recently the Dongfang Turbine Plant in Sichuan  formally began experimental manufacture of the first  Sino-Japanese designed 600MW turbogenerator, the largest piece  of thermal power equipment in China. The production of this  equipment marks China's entry into products for the coming  century.    In order to stand tall in a fiercely competitive market,  this  plant set its sights on the world's best and relentlessly went  after high-capacity, low-consumption, and high-level  turbogenerator products, and set a new pattern for product  development. During the "Seventh 5-Year Plan" alone the factory  manufactured over 20 new products, including 50MW, 200MW, and  300MW turbogenerators which have been a boon to industry and are  well regarded both at home and abroad. Thereafter, the plant  leadership realized that to keep up with the rapidly growing  economy the country would need even bigger and better thermal  power equipment, and looking ahead to the next century, they  joined with the Hitachi Corporation in 1991 to design and  produce a 600MW turbogenerator.    Undaunted by the size and the cost of the task, the plant  rounded up a large task force, materials and money, and got into  the development and research manufacture of the "600MW unit."  Early last year, a "600MW office" composed of the best people,  was set up, and they completed the conceptual design and made  changes to the large and sophisticated Hitachi blueprints,  grappled with the design, process and raw materials, made four  adjustments to the new contract grid plan, and improved the  technical training of plant personnel. The plant is now fully  prepared for the trial production of the 600MW turbogenerator,  which will be the factory's ticket for entry into the coming  century.</p>

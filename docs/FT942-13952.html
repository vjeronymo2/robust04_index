			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Arts: Evans of the Ashmolean - Gerald Cadogan pays tribute to the remarkable man who brought the Minoan civilisation to light Arthur Evans, excavator of Knossos, is a Victorian hero who did not die until 1941, soon after hearing that the Germans had captured Crete and installed themselves in the Villa Ariadne, his house at Knossos. Evans is important not only for uncovering the sophisticated early civilisation of Crete and working out by 1906 a history of the Minoans that still holds today, but also for the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford which, without him, would not be the elegant, erudite museum it is such a pleasure to visit today. Arthur Evans: His Life and Times, at the Ashmolean until August 21, is the right tribute in the right place to a remarkable man and a delightful vignette of Victorian and Edwardian England. An eternally curious man, he was an able numismatist - being shortsighted was a help - and his archaeology covered Europe and the Mediterranean. One speciality was the Yugoslav coast and Bosnia, where he had reported for the Manchester Guardian, as an uncompromising Gladstonian champion of the locals, on the fight for freedom from the Ottomans and the Austrians. He lived for a while in Dubrovnik, where he was imprisoned by the Austrians. The ethnic/religious map of Slav territories he prepared in 1913 for the Balkan Committee is still sadly apposite. In Oxford he 're-founded' the Ashmolean. The exhibition comes 110 years after he became its Keeper (and a century after he first visited Crete to try to discover its early scripts, little imagining that the task he started six years later would be to uncover a civilisation). Evans had the luck to be born into a clever, rich family. His father, Sir John Evans, was himself a distinguished archaeologist (as his younger sister Dame Joan Evans also became), who knew Charles Darwin and Augustus Henry Lane Fox (later Pitt Rivers), and who applied evolution to the development of human technology. It was a heady, intellectually exciting world, helped - as so often in the period - by some money. His mother was a Dickinson of the family that made paper at Nash Mills in Hertfordshire. As Keeper of the Ashmolean his triumph was to bring the old museum collections (in the building that is now the Museum of the History of Science) over to the splendid University Galleries of Charles Cockerell, to be primarily a teaching and research collection of art and archaeology, of which a library was an essential part. Not that Benjamin Jowett, Vice-Chancellor of the University and Master of Balliol, thought it a good idea. Evans had a mighty battle with him, which he won with the help of a major backer. CDE Fortnum, of the grocers in Piccadilly, produced collections (of majolica, bronzes and rings) and funding. A decade later Evans's single-minded determination was again essential to buy the site of Knossos from a multitude of peasants, and drive the dig of a large, complicated site which the prehistoric Cretans had occupied for more than 2000 years. Today the Ashmolean is a great museum with many marvellous pieces, such as its Old Master drawings and its Athenian pottery. Its Cretan collection is the best outside Crete, and its library is envied across the world. And I have found over the years that its staff are singularly helpful, and ready to share their knowledge - which art historians and archaeologists know is a great compliment. But, as Evans knew, continuous improvements need space and funds. Behind Cockerell's facade and main galleries the building is a rabbit warren. Much of the ancient pottery lurks in a 'Sunken Court' in the middle of the building which is closed to the public. It is the only space in the building that is left to develop, by contrast with the British Museum which is about to gain a windfall when the British Library leaves the vast Reading Room. The director, Professor Christopher White, plans to instal four floors in the Sunken Court. In this basement, Cockerell made an impressive undercroft with Doric columns. Now used as a workshop, it will become a restaurant (much needed), with a new lecture theatre and space for the growing education service. The ground floor will have a new entrance to the museum and a new shop (with displays kept low to preserve Cockerell's design), and will lead into the Randolph Gallery. Refurbishment has made this hall of sculptures a 19th-century joy, where the steam-cleaned statues stand out against raspberry walls. At the end of the gallery the main staircase has also been redone as a handsome approach to the first-floor picture galleries of Western Art. The most obvious change will be outside, where the patches of grass will make way for a piazza of York stone, with the steps from the street slightly set back and Cockerell's original balustrade reinstated. The architects are Stanton Williams. A still anonymous donor is funding the cost of about Pounds 4.5m. As part of the Campaign for Oxford, the appeal for the Ashmolean has raised Pounds 8.67m in gifts or promises to date. Already, 12 galleries and the stairs have been redone. Dietrich and Joyce von Bothmer are paying for two antiquities floors in the Sunken Court. The Clore Foundation has endowed the Education Officer. Sir Arthur would approve. A hundred years ago after he returned from the first visit to Crete that changed his life, the objects were moved from the old Ashmolean to where they are now. It took from August to November. The most precious pieces went in hand-carts. The exhibition continues until August 21. The Ashmolean has just published Before Knossos . . . Arthur Evans's Travels in the Balkans and Crete by Ann Brown (Pounds 12.95, Pounds 7.95 pb, 85 pages)</p>

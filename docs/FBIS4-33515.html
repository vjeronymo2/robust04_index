			<p>BFN     [Text] Chile will probably be the fifth country to join the  Common Market of the South, Mercosur. Chilean Foreign Minister  Carlos Figueroa and Brazilian counterpart Celso Amorim reported  this news in Belem, Para State on the night of 5 June. Here is  Antonia Marcia Vale's report:    [Begin recording] [Vale] Since the beginning of the Mercosur  negotiations, Chile has refused to participate. The Chilean  foreign minister now states that his country's interest in  joining Mercosur follows President Itamar Franco's proposal, in  Chile in December 1993, to establish a free-trade zone in Latin  America.    Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim asserted that if  Chile joins Mercosur it will be advantageous and represent a  door for Brazilian exports to the Pacific Region market.    [Amorim] This possibility is important for us, not just  because Chile has commercial and political importance or because  of old ties that bind our two countries. Mercosur member  countries have always considered the possibility of Chile  becoming a member. As the Chilean foreign minister said, this  initiative is a result of the current Brazilian Government, of  President Itamar Franco's proposal to establish a South American  free-trade area. This shows we have indeed been working in the  right direction. This possibility gives us enormous  satisfaction.    [Vale] The foreign minister reported that Chile's main  concern about entering Mercosur had been the high taxes charged  by Brazil on imported items. Minister Amorim added that this  difficulty has practically ceased because currently our custom  fees average just 14 percent. [end recording]</p>

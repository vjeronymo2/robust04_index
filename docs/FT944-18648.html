			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Management: Mother knows how to manage best I have just been sent some research by a pair of US doctors, both called Rick, and both world experts on how to cope with difficult people at work. As I read through the tactics they recommend for procrastinators, bullies and whiners, I felt an odd sense of deja vu. The account reminded me of another book, one which belongs not on the management shelves but with the books on yoga and childbirth. It is a slim volume called Getting on with Your Children. All the management techniques are in it, and all are applicable to difficult workmates and to easy ones too. There are sections on the destructive power of criticism, the importance of praise, the need to listen, and on learning from mistakes. Its account of how to make your children independent and responsible could be transcribed word for word into one of those new books on empowerment. Admittedly, the analogy is not perfect: it is not usually appropriate to cuddle your workmates, nor can you confine your colleagues to their cots when they become too tiresome. Equally you cannot fire your children; or expect them to increase your family's revenues. Still there are enough parallels to suggest that the best managers may not be those pinstriped men who have had years in the boardroom and been on all the right management courses. They may be mothers who have successfully brought up large numbers of trying children. Anyone who can deal with a manipulative three-year-old or a two-year-old throwing temper tantrums will find even the worst varieties of wayward behaviour in the office a piece of cake. For over three decades management experts have been preaching ways of making meetings more efficient. Yet so far their advice has not made a jot of difference: the average manager still spends 40 per cent of every day in meetings, and still complains that most of that is a frustrating waste of time. Fresh from the US comes a radical solution - the 'open space' meeting. This turns all the old advice on its head: instead of sticking to an agenda, the agenda is dispensed with altogether. Instead of keeping the session short, these meetings last at least a day, and possibly three. Far from paring numbers to the minimum, everyone is invited - 700 people would not be considered too many at an open space gathering. During the meeting anyone can pin up their ideas on a board and those who agree can sign up to them. The session may then be subdivided into 'workshops' so that the ideas can be thrashed out in more detail. According to Wikima Consulting, which is attempting to import the idea into the UK, these meetings encourage 'unparalleled creativity, motivation and commitment'. Apparently they allow companies to be rebuilt and conflicts to be resolved. There are some peculiar management practices about, but this one takes the biscuit. The Presbyterian Church in the US and the World Bank are great fans of the open space meeting. But then one organisation has faith, and the other is in such a bureaucratic muddle (a former employee said in the FT last week that board members were mushrooms - kept in the dark and fed on garbage) that any change is likely to be an improvement. Some time ago I wrote about employees' evenings, strange occasions at which workers gather with their bosses for a question and answer session over a drink and a few peanuts. Here is an even odder concept: the customers' evening. If you bank with Lloyds, you may have already received an invitation to visit the local branch after hours, for a glass of wine and the opportunity to tell them how you feel about the new open-plan branch layout. I can't think of anything I would like less than to spend a precious evening visiting my bank to discuss whether the lighting is too bright or too dim. Fortunately I am a customer of First Direct, so the question of lighting and comportment of branch staff does not arise. Yet it seems I am in a minority with my stand-offish attitude. So far Lloyds has held over 1,000 of such evenings, making these branch booze ups one of the most popular nights out across the country. The bank says that perfectly normal people turn up: all ages, classes and colours are represented, not just the people who write to newspapers in block capitals or in green ink. Surely all these people cannot be motivated by the free drink, nor by the desire to see the other side of the cashier's glass screen. It seems our banks have a special hold over us. Because they have the knack of making our lives difficult by messing up our affairs and overcharging us, only to be unbelievably slow to rectify matters, they turn the most laid back person into a first rate moaner. There is a pleasure to be had in complaining to the right person, so perhaps an invitation to make a night of it is not to be scoffed at.</p>

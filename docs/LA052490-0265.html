			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PAULA ABDUL ON LINE FOR L.A. GEAR  </P> <P> Singer Paula Abdul is the latest star to hoof it into L.A. Gear's stable of  celebrity sneaker promoters, joining Michael Jackson and Joe Montana with her  own line of footwear.  </P> <P> The endorsement, announced today, is the latest example of manufacturers  betting on celebrities rather than technical features to sell athletic shoes.  Abdul, the Laker cheerleader-turned-video-choreographer-turned-pop-star, used  to pitch Reeboks. Not to be left in the dust, Reebok is now in negotiations  with Madonna.  </P></p>

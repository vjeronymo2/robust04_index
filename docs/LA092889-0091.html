			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LAKEWOOD;  </P> <P> COUNCIL CRITIC ACQUITTED OF GIVING DEATH THREATS  </P> <P> Jack C. Guarino, a long-time critic of Lakewood city government and himself an  unsuccessful City Council candidate, was found not guilty of making death  threats against three public officials.  </P> <P> The acquittal occurred Sept. 20 in the Orange County Superior Courtroom of  Judge Richard Weatherspoon. Guarino, 53, was arrested by sheriff's deputies  Jan. 18 after a rambling message that allegedly contained death threats was  left on the telephone answering machine of Press-Telegram reporter Richard  Howland.  </P> <P> Guarino said: "I'm going to do a little killing," and then named Norwalk  Superior Court Judge Robert Higa, Assemblyman Willard H. Murray (D-Compton) and  Lakewood Assistant City Atty. Scott Nichols.  </P> <P> Guarino, who has tangled several times with Lakewood officials over a court  order to clean up his yard, insisted that the word "killing" referred to  political death. His message, he and his attorney pointed out, also said: "I  won't have to fire a shot," and contained references to the three officials  dying "on the vine."  </P></p>

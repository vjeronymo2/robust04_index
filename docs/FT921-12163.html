			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Observer: Goodbye Gus Few will be down in the mouth to hear from sources well placed to know that we shall not long need to wrap our tongues around one of the unhappier pieces of recent verbal coinage: the Commonwealth of Independent States, alias what used to be most of the Soviet Union. Whatever language it comes in, the title for the uneasy bedfellows of the former Soviet empire is clumsy and cumbersome, besides being virtually meaningless in lacking any geographical indicators. In the UK in particular, it has the added snag of engendering confusion with the British Commonwealth, and the acronym CIS is at least as bad, having hitherto referred to the Charter Institute of Secretaries and the Cooperative Insurance Society. In Germany the acronym is the rather more helpful and familiar GUS, for the Gemeinschaft Unabhangiger Staaten. But it is nevertheless already falling out of fashion in high places. 'We are no longer referring to GUS,' a senior German finance ministry official confided. 'We only talk about the countries of the former Soviet Union. I'm afraid we don't believe it is going to last that long.' As by far the biggest single creditor of the 'countries of the former Soviet Union' (CFSU?), Germany should know best. So long, GUS - or alternatively, CIS transit gloria mundi.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Audrius Baciulis: "A Very Heated and </F> Confidential Meeting"]    [Text] The meeting of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor  Party [LDDP] Presidium, which began at 0700 on Thursday [31  March], was only concluded this morning. According to  information obtained by RESPUBLIKA, the six-hour discussion on  national defense problems was very heated. The meeting was  attended by Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, National Defense  Minister L. Linkevicius, leaders of the LDDP and its faction,  members of the Seimas [parliament] National Security Committee  [NSC] who belong to the LDDP faction, and V. Juskus, chairman of  the Seimas Commission for Investigating Economic Crimes.    Participants in the meeting decided not to provide any  information to the press and restrict themselves to an official  report (by doing this they deprived the press of the chance to  present objective and overall information) which was circulated  yesterday by the government rather than the party spokesman.  According to the information, the meeting heard L. Linkevicius'  report entitled "National Defense: Condition and Perspective,"  discussed the overall concept of defense, the upgrading of the  national defense system, and closer cooperation among the  National Defense Ministry [KAM], the government, and the NSC.    According to RESPUBLIKA information, the larger part of the  meeting was devoted to the clarification of relations between  the KAM and the NSC. The meeting drew the conclusion that there  were no contradictions in principle and proposed to resolve the  existing mutual claims. According to one participant in the  meeting, who wished to remain anonymous, the failure to do so  "can mean trouble." According to the words of another  participant, the meeting demanded the L. Linkevicius toughen up  order in the Army so officers do not discuss whether the Army  needs a commander or not. Participants in the meeting also  insisted on an investigation into the fate of the property of  the [former Soviet] Society for Assisting Army, Air Force, and  Navy. Explanations concerning this issue should be provided by  former National Defense Minister A. Butkevicius and current  Deputy Minister J. Gecas.    NSC members were reprimanded for violating the law and  providing secret information to the press. As the third person  who wanted to remain anonymous said, if NSC members continue to  violate the law, "relevant conclusions will be drawn." Some  representatives of the LDDP faction demanded that the NSC not  admit journalists to its meetings in the future.    The fourth participant of the meeting, who did not want to  be  named, said that V. Juskus, chairman of the Seimas Commissions  for Economic Crimes, had stated with determination that as long  as he headed the commissions, the national defense case  [reference to arms deals] would be investigated to the very end.  J. Juskus demanded that some LDDP faction members did not hang  around the prosecutor's office and interfere with the  investigation. [LDDP faction chief] J. Karosas denied this  information. He told RESPUBLIKA that neither he nor the other  four faction members impeded the investigation of the national  defense case, but only inquired to the prosecutor's office  whether "this matter was not forgotten."    According to information from the editorial office, the next  meeting may address the fate of L. Linkevicius. There were also  proposals to demilitarize the KAM by placing all servicemen and  the counterintelligence service under the Army commander, and to  reduce the staff at the ministry and its International Relations  Department.</p>

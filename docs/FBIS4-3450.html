			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter Su Hung-ju (5685 7703 </F> 0320): "200 Million Pirated Compact Discs Sold Each Year --  Unscrupulous Businessmen Make Profits by Taking Advantage of  Consumer Psychology"]    [Text] Each compact disc is priced at more than 100 Hong  Kong dollars, and ordinary people cannot afford to buy too many,  so pirated CDs, which sell for HK$10 or so apiece, are very much  in vogue. Many people are ready to buy pirated compact discs,  which have become the new favorite of people going to the  mainland for shopping. Statistics show that more than 200  million pirated CDs were sold in the mainland in 1993.  <H5>  As Many as 50 Factories Produce Pirated CDs </H5>   The main reason pirated CDs are in vogue in the mainland is  that some unscrupulous businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan,  taking advantage of the weak sense of copyright and loose law  enforcement in some localities in the mainland, have bribed  concerned local officials or solicited business for persons in  charge of CD manufacturing plants so as to seek the latter's  tacit approval in producing pirated CDs in an almost open way.  As a result, the mainland, particularly the Zhu Jiang Delta  region, has become a center for pirated CDs.    Some retailers running pirated CD businesses in the mainland  say that in their estimation, there are 50 illegal factories  around the Zhu Jiang Delta Region engaged in producing pirated  CDs. These are mainly located in Jiangmen, Zhongshan, Zhuhai,  Foshan, and Maoming. In addition, some pirated CDs are smuggled  into the mainland from Taiwan or Southeast Asia, whereas  recently, some unscrupulous businessmen have set up pirate CD  manufacturing plants in the hinterland to avoid an official  clampdown. Moreover, most of these factories cover up their  activities by manufacturing other kinds of industrial products.  <H5>  Fair Quality, Attractive Prices </H5>   The production cost for pirated CDs is very low, but the  investment in the production line is not that low because,  generally speaking, $2 million is required. Hence, most of  these unlawful factories in the mainland are funded by investors  from Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Southeast Asia. In the earliest  stages, as the market was not large, the retail price of every  pirated CD was over HK$20, but as the market is increasing, and  as the owners of unlawful factories are overtly and covertly  competing with each other for better sales, the retail prices of  pirated CDs have dropped drastically. For example, one can buy  a large number of pirated CDs at HK$11 to HK$12 each. The  retail prices of pirated CDs around the Zhu Jiang Delta Region  now range from 12 to 18 yuan, whereas in Hong Kong, three  pirated CDs are sold for HK$100. People can find such illegal  stalls in some commercial districts from time to time, and  business at these stalls is brisk.    These pirated CDs are not poor-quality and can meet ordinary  consumers' needs. Each of them picks 17 to 18 selected songs by  noted singers, while only 10 songs or so are included in  original CDs and not all of them are good songs. Under such  circumstances, it is natural that pirated CDs are well-received  by consumers. Although Hong Kong Customs already have put up  warning posters in open spaces at every port of entry and exit,  noting that "no one is allowed to carry pirated CDs; once  convicted, one faces a maximum penalty of two years'  imprisonment and a HK$1,000 fine for each disc." However, when  returning to the mainland, many Hong Kong residents cannot but  buy some pirated CDs. Even in open spaces at the Shenzhen Joint  Inspection Building, we can see several stalls that are selling  pirated CDs quite openly, and business is brisk owing to the  great demand.  <H5>  Zhongshan, Guangzhou Become Distribution Centers </H5>   Apart from higher prices than those sold in the mainland, in  Hong Kong we cannot test the sound of a CD we want to buy.  Owing to fiercer competition, however, sellers in the mainland  generally offer good services, and customers can test the sound  of discs as they please. Therefore, a lot of people would  rather buy pirated compact discs in the mainland. A friend of  mine said that he bought as many as 100 pirated CDs and that  most of them are of fair quality.    According to some industry insiders, some of the molds used  to produce pirated CDs are used and discarded molds purchased  directly, and illegally, from factories producing original CDs,  while others are reproduced from songs recorded from radio  broadcasts. Normally, these molds should be replaced after  producing a certain number of CDs, but in order to reduce costs,  pirate businessmen do not replace them. Therefore, some of the  pirated CDs skip over certain parts or have a strong hum.    In addition, the insiders pointed out: Some of the pirated  CDs produced in the mainland are smuggled to Southeast Asian,  European, or American regions, whereas at present, the largest  wholesale market around the Zhu Jiang Delta Region is mainly in  Zhongshan and Guangzhou. The average wholesale price of each  pirated CD ranges from HK$8 to HK$10 (this is the net price of  the disc; that of the plastic pack is not included). Many  purchasers from interior provinces also go there.  <H5>  Following the Law To Stop Piracy </H5>   As a matter of fact, it is believed that pirated CDs will  continue to exist for a long time, until there is a perfect  system of legal control in the mainland. Owing to their cheap  prices and fair quality (with only a certain amount of hum), it  is very difficult for consumers to resist them. Many consumers  hold that unless the prices of original compact discs are marked  down drastically, they will not find these discs more  attractive. Hence, it is believed that to put an end to pirated  CDs, the ultimate method is for businessmen producing original  CDs to play down their motive of making huge profits and let the  market decide prices. Only in this way can the problem be solved.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cyprus Government is working toward convening  an international conference on the Cyprus issue. This statement  was made by Foreign Minister at Larnaca Airport shortly before  his departure this afternoon on an official visit to Moscow. He  said that the Cyprus Government believes that convening an  international conference is a very serious proposal, since the  initiatives taken in the Cyprus issue thus far have failed. He  added: For this reason, we must address the substance of the  problem, which is nothing less than the presence of occupation  troops and settlers in Cyprus. Mr. Mikhailidhis noted: If some  countries agree or disagree, we will see this in the course of  things. The foreign minister further said: In any case, we  will work toward this.    The Cyprus issue will be the basic topic of Mr.  Mikhailidhis'  talks in Moscow and, as he noted, there will also be discussion  of the Russian suggestions included in the options cited in the  UN secretary general's report. He stressed that the Cyprus  Government attaches great importance to his visit to Moscow for  two important reasons: First, because of Russia's noteworthy  active role on the international political scene and, second,  because of its strong interest in Cyprus. He added: Russia's  role will be very decisive in view of the consultations at the  Security Council on the options to be adopted for the  continuation of the peace process in Cyprus.</p>

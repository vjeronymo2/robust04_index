			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVANS' ICONS;  </P> <P> AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHS;  </P> <P> BY WALKER EVANS WITH AN ESSAY BY LINCOLN KIRSTEIN (MUSEUM OF MODERN ART;  DISTRIBUTED BY NEW YORK GRAPHIC SOCIETY BOOKS/LITTLE, BROWN: $40; 205 PP.)  </P> <P> An admired book of photographs by Walker Evans, one of America's most admired  photographers, received its fourth edition recently in conjunction with an  Evans exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. "American Photographs"  was first published in 1938 when perhaps its greatest impact came less as art  than as journalism: It was a stark, deeply moving but utterly unsentimental  presentation of rural poverty during the Great Depression. While the  documentary importance of "American Photographs" remains, the editions of 1962  (a MOMA edition, like that of 1938) and 1975 (East River Press) bespoke that  importance less than they did the steadily growing stature of Evans as a  photographic artist.  </P> <P> Lincoln Kirstein characterized Evans' art as follows:  </P> <P> "The most characteristic single feature of Evans' work is its purity, or even  its puritanism. It is 'straight' photography not only in technique but in the  rigorous directness of its way of looking. All through the pictures in this  book you will search in vain for an angle-shot. Every object is regarded  head-on (see above and Page 1) with the unsparing frankness of a Russian icon  or a Flemish portrait. The facts pile up with the prints.  </P> <P> "This is neither a baroque nor a decorative, but a purely protestant attitude:  meager, stripped, cold, and, on occasion, humorous. It is also the naked,  difficult, solitary attitude of a member revolting from his own class, who  knows best what in it must be uncovered, cauterized and why. The view is  clinical. Evans is a visual doctor, diagnostician rather than specialist. But  he is also the family physician, quiet and dispassionate, before whom even very  old or very sick people are no longer ashamed to reveal themselves.  </P> <P> "There has been no need for Evans to dramatize his material with photographic  tricks, because the material is already, in itself, intensely dramatic. Even  the inanimate things, bureau drawers, pots, tires, bricks, signs, seem waiting  in their own patient dignity, posing for their picture. The pictures of men and  portraits of houses have only that 'expression' which the experience of their  society and times has imposed on them. The faces, even those tired, vicious or  content, are past reflecting accidental emotions. They are isolated and  essentialized. The power of Evans' work lies in the fact that he so details the  effect of circumstances on familiar specimens that the single face, the single  house, the single street, strikes with the strength of overwhelming numbers,  the terrible cumulative force of thousands of faces, houses and streets."  </P> <P> It is worth noting that MOMA made every effort to secure original negatives for  its anniversary edition and that the negative for the photograph reproduced on  Page 1 of Book Review comes from the photography collection of the J. Paul  Getty Museum.  </P></p>

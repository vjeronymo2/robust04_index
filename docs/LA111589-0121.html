			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TUSTIN COUPLE WIN $609,000 IN SUIT OVER WAGES  </P> <P> A Tustin couple who managed a Pomona apartment complex have won $609,000 from  the building's owner for failing to pay them their agreed-upon wages for more  than two years, the couple's attorney said.  </P> <P> Jurors in Los Angeles County Superior Court here awarded $200,000 in punitive  damages and about $409,000 in compensatory damages to Roy and Cornelia  Lululescu, who used to be live-in managers of the 64-unit Tahiti Village  apartments in Pomona, attorney Maurice Mandel said.  </P> <P> The award, rendered last week after a three-week trial, was assessed against  Nick Mallas, a San Juan Capistrano man who owns commercial and residential  rental properties, Mandel said. Mallas and his attorneys could not be reached  for comment.  </P> <P> The Lululescus, who now live in Tustin, contended that Mallas breached their  salary contract by failing to pay them $10 an hour for managing the Tahiti  Village complex and several other properties between September, 1983, and  January, 1986. Mandel said much of the couple's work consisted of complying  with city orders to repair substandard septic tanks and eradicate roaches and  vermin on the property.  </P></p>

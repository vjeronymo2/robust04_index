			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / International Company News: Danish shipyard shares suspended on alliance talks Shares in Burmeister &amp; Wain, the Danish shipyard, were suspended on the Copenhagen stock exchange yesterday, at the company's own request, after it said it was negotiating an alliance with the Swedish marine industrial group Kockums, of Malmo, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. B &amp; W said the two groups had signed a memorandum of agreement which included a provision for a financial engagement in B &amp; W by the Swedish group. The Copenhagen group, which made a net profit of DKr132m (Dollars 22.2m) in 1993 on turnover of DKr2.3bn, said it would make a deficit of DKr275m in 1994 and a loss of at least the same order in 1995. Kockums, which was once a leading European builder of large oil tankers, is today a subsidiary of Celsius, the state-controlled defence industry group. It is a diversified marine industrial group with construction of naval submarines as one of its leading activities. Kockums had a turnover of SKr2.3bn (Dollars 313.3m) and made a net profit of Skr170m last year.</p>

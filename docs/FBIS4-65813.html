			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet </F> by Michel Drancourt in Paris; date not given: "Bank of France  Governor Answers Strong Franc's Detractors"]    [Text] Jean-Claude Trichet, 51, governor of the Bank of  France, is the first governor of an independent Bank of France.  Endowed with a Monetary Policy Council -- an independent group  that defines monetary policy -- its legally defined objective is  to contain inflation and to ensure that a solid currency  contributes to healthy expansion.    He is not sure that public opinion -- including that of  those  in charge politically -- fully supports this goal, but  Jean-Claude Trichet hopes that it will be convinced, by the  results, that monetary stability draws the economy into a  virtuous circle of lasting growth, which in turn promotes new  jobs.    [Drancourt] I propose that the underlying theme of this  interview be the relationship between money and employment. For  many people, the strong franc policy of which you are the  driving force and the symbol is partly the cause of unemployment.    [Trichet] I know that certain people believe this in good  faith. Allow me simply to recall certain facts:    - in general in the world, those economies with stable  currencies are also economies with low unemployment rates:  western Germany, Japan, and Switzerland, to mention just a few  examples.    - the medium-term growth of the French economy has not  suffered from the stable money strategy of the last seven and a  half years, during which our currency has taken up its position  as one of Europe's most stable currencies: Since 1986, annual  economic growth has been 2.3 percent in Western Germany, 2.1  percent in France, 1.8 percent in Great Britain.    - the French recession will have been one of the shortest of  those recorded by the other major industrial countries.    The real problem of the French economy is to understand why  it creates fewer jobs for every one percent growth in gross  domestic product than comparable industrial economies. This is  a vital question which "challenges", as they say, everyone in a  position of responsibility. In my opinion, we must do  everything possible to enrich the "job content" of France's  growth. This presupposes a whole range of structural reforms,  none of which is easy to design and to translate into hard  facts. Coming to monetary policy itself, my own conviction,  shared by those responsible for the currencies of the major  countries, is that there is no contradiction, but rather  complementarity, between a monetary strategy of stability and  credibility and our ability to obtain for our economy the best  possible means of financing with which to promote growth and job  creation. For a given currency, market interest rates, which  are defined in the last analysis by national and international  investors, depend on the judgment by these people of the  long-term value of the currency. If a country's currency is  "credible," investors accept lower market rates. Nowadays this  is clearly visible: The ranking of currencies according to the  greater "resistance" to the rise in long-term U.S. rates  coincides with their "credibility" ranking.    [Drancourt] In his recent book "Les Infortunes de la  Prosperite" [The Misfortunes of Prosperity], Daniel Cohen, a  professor at the Ecole Normale Superieure, evokes good old  Keynes. To end the crisis of his time, he recommended the  "euthanasia" of modest income which represented 30 percent of  domestic product prior to 1914. A transfer took place in the  form of social protection. This would not have been possible  without monetary erosion. The author suggests attacking today's  retired people, by sacrificing monetary solidity, in order to  give work to the working generation. What do you think of this  approach?    [Trichet] One must examine what it means to be part of a  world economy in which modern economies are closely interlinked  and observe that a country like France is not able on its own to  change the shape of this economy. In the 1970's and 1980's, a  vast world market was created. Almost every country, including  the former Soviet Union, adhered to its operating rules. In  this vast market, obtaining the best possible interest rates  demands a currency with maximum possible credibility. For this  reason I do not know any central bank manager who would sing the  praises of monetary erosion. As to the question of whether, in  the West in general and in Europe in particular, achieving a  balance between the working and retired populations and between  young and old is being done well, that is another matter. No  doubt we have to concern ourselves with our demographic  development, which is ineluctably increasing the proportion of  the non-working population, and to draw the necessary  consequences. But I do not believe that these questions are  directly linked to monetary policy.    [Drancourt] Without reverting to the Bible, which recommends  that debts be wiped out every 50 years, one notes a nostalgia  for monetary instability among certain entrepreneurs and other  social categories. Indeed, in their mind, this is one way of  questioning acquired positions, the establishment, and promoting  innovation.    [Trichet] In the long term, one sees clearly that countries  like Germany, Switzerland and Japan, for example, who have opted  for a policy of monetary stability, have had no cause to repent.  Good monetary management has promoted the progress of their  economies and their standard of living. Small- and medium-sized  businesses are strong in these countries. Enterprise creation is  active. And Japan is not the last when it comes to innovation.  Finally I observe that the feeling which the Bank of France  gains from its very many contacts with small, medium and  large-sized enterprises (we question 12,000 of them every month)  is that the interest of the economy and of business in having a  solid monetary base is very widely understood by those in charge  of the economy.    [Drancourt] A strong currency forces companies, so to speak,  to "find their way out through the top." However, for a long  time, in France, some counted on the easy way out. Today they  are suffering competition from low-salary economies. If one is  in the category of enterprises which count on inflation to get  them out of difficulties, one can always find an Asian country  which is cheaper. But it will take time for every company to  move into the higher category. Those who are not yet that far  blame the strong currency and its supporters for their  difficulties and those which result for employment in particular.    [Trichet] Yes, I believe that one can say this: once the  currency is stable, fleeing forward is not a paying proposition.  If inflation can make things easier in the short term, the bill  becomes heavy when the time comes to put one's house in order.  When France used to give in to the temptation of inflation, it  then had to pick up the inevitable costs of regaining control.  This is what used to be known as the "cooling down plan." The  advantage which it thought it had gained was quickly lost. Lax  monetary policy can be like a drug. It procures satisfaction,  but this is short-lived. Then you have to pay the bill. I  notice that those countries which have not ceded to this  temptation have, ultimately, done better. In any event, I would  remind you that the Bank of France's Monetary Policy Council is  bound by law to watch over price stability.    [Drancourt] Does not a country with an aging population need  ultimately to be able to invest capital which secures long-term  earnings, which is one way of guaranteeing its future resources?    [Trichet] Allow me to pose the question differently, without  reference to population data. In an economy based on  international trade, a country like France, with strong  industrial traditions, needs to take global positions in a whole  series of activities and industries. It has to be in a position  to invest large amounts, in particular abroad, something which,  moreover, we have been doing for a number of years: We were the  second largest international industrial investor in 1992. To  carry out such a policy, it is better to have a stable currency  with a strong global purchasing power.    [Drancourt] From now on the Bank of France is autonomous.  What does this mean in terms of responsibility?    [Trichet] Under the law we have a clear responsibility. The  Monetary Policy Council defines our country's monetary policy  with the concern to ensure price stability. It may not receive  or solicit instructions from anyone. Public opinion, it seems  to me, does not question this independence, in particular as the  Monetary Policy Council consists of a woman and men with  recognized competence and with rich and varied experience.    [Drancourt] But there are nonetheless people who do not  accept the Bank's independence, saying that this does not permit  the necessary adaptation.    [Trichet] The Bank's independence is, indeed, something new  in France. Like any new institution, it needs to take its place  in the institutional landscape of our country, as is the case in  Switzerland, the United States or the Netherlands, for example,  not to mention Germany. But independence does not in any way  mean that the Bank of France is outside the field of democracy.  The law itself scrupulously organizes the Monetary Policy  Council's relations with the government and the Bank of France's  relations with the president of the Republic and with  parliament. With regard to the latter, the law states that the  National Assembly's Finance Committee can ask at any time to  hear the governor. And the governor can ask at any time to be  heard by the Finance Committee. This is a very strong link, as  you can see. Finally, in any democracy, any institution --  whatever it may be -- must constantly listen, meditate, decide,  explain and, if possible, convince. This is what the Monetary  Policy Council is determined to do. And it is what we are all  doing together, methodically, not only in Paris but in every  region of France.    [Drancourt] You are, in a way, the ringmaster. Monetary  policy which has been set presupposes, for example, that public  deficits do not increase and that public companies are better  managed.    [Trichet] All Europeans, with the exception of Luxembourg,  are currently having serious problems with the management of  public finances. And I say: all European members of the  European Union [EU], whatever their monetary policies. This is  why 11 European governments have begun "convergence programs"  aimed at regaining control of public deficits. Last November  [Economics Minister] Alphandery presented a convergence plan at  the same time as the German Government. The budget minister in  turn presented a five-year bill relating to the state budget  which was voted last January. In the letter I sent, as required  by law, to the president of the Republic and to parliament, I  indicated that I was very pleased at the commitments made by the  French Government and that it was naturally important that they  be respected.    [Drancourt] You mention the Maastricht Treaty. Part of  public opinion seems to believe that it is not applicable and  even seems to have forgotten it.    [Trichet] The central banks are not there to make laws but  to  apply them. The Maastricht Treaty has been signed, ratified,  and constitutionally approved by the 12 countries of the EU. It  is the law of these countries. If one day the Treaty is  amended, we will apply the amended Treaty. But today my  European colleagues and I are naturally responsible for applying  the Treaty, and that is what we are doing, all together, within  the European Monetary Institute presided over by Mr. Lamfalussy,  with its offices in Frankfurt, and whose director general is Mr.  Raymond, a Frenchman.    [Drancourt] Despite this, we see countries like Great  Britain  and Italy carrying out their own foreign exchange policies.  Either one wants Europe and one follows the rules. Or one does  not follow the rules and does not want Europe. While waiting  for Maastricht to be implemented, how does one correct the risks  of unfair competition?    [Trichet] I believe, like you, that one cannot at one and  the  same time construct a single market and even a simple common  market and neglect the question of monetary organization. The  risk indeed would be that of the erratic handling of exchange  policy creating new and invisible barriers, in contradiction to  the idea of the elimination of all borders. The founders of the  Treaty of Rome got it right when they said that foreign exchange  questions were questions of common interest. And yet at the  time of the signature of the Treaty of Rome, all currencies were  bound by the very strict "Bretton Woods" exchange system. In  Europe I remind you that nine economies out of 12 are part of  the Exchange Rate Mechanism, which is managed jointly by the  "12." Finally, I am struck to see that the North American  countries has just given themselves an embryonic monetary  organization to accompany the single market which is being  created between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. There is  no better illustration of the pertinence of the European  approach.    [Drancourt] Some politicians, if they carry their logic to  the extreme, recommend that France leave the European accords on  monetary matters. What would happen in this case?    [Trichet] This is a question which, as you know, has to be  answered by the government. It is Mr. Alphandery whom you  should pose the question to. Everyone knows what his  convictions are in this area!    [Drancourt] We are going through a deflationary period.  Would  it be wrong in these conditions to increase money supply?    [Trichet] Allow me me to offer two comments, the first about  the "deflationary period," the second about the "economic  situation" and the Monetary Policy Council's strategy. First of  all I should emphasize that for several months now the Bank of  France has been observing that the narrow monetary  aggregates--known as "M1" and "M2"' in our jargon--are proving  much more dynamic. During the past seven months, they have  grown at an average annual rate of seven percent. Here we have  a clear sign of monetary dynamism accompanying and supporting  the movement of recovery which has been under way since November  1993. We are not at all in a "deflationary" situation.  Secondly, I notice that everyone today agrees to say that the  economy is moving again: the experts, the European  institutions, even industrialists. The Bank of France is very  glad about this recovery, which it was the first to observe  through its monthly survey of almost 12,000 business leaders.  Let us remember that the Monetary Policy Council had clearly  indicated, from the time it was established, that it placed  France's monetary policy within the context of sustained  medium-term growth of the order of 3 percent a year. At the  time -- this was at the end of January -- the return to growth  seemed a long way off and our forecasts somewhat fanciful.  Today we have got there and I am convinced that our monetary  policy had more than a little hand in this!    [Drancourt] As long as interest rates were higher than  growth  rates, companies had an interest in "putting their money on the  markets" and reducing their debt rather than investing. Has the  time come for reinvestment?    [Trichet] The period of "deceleration" of investment appears  to be behind us, and it seems that we are now, fortunately  enough, coming into a period of renewed investment. That is  what INSEE [National Institute of Statistics and Economic  Studies] is telling us. Everything is pushing in this  direction. First of all the fact that industries in the  manufacturing sector have a self-financing rate of, on average,  well above 100 percent. This means that they are able to invest  more. Secondly, the fact that order books have filled up again,  in particular with orders from abroad and orders due to stock  movements, and that industrial capacity utilization is rising.  The very sizeable fall in short-term interest rates is also  naturally acting in favor of manufacturing investment. Today,  the three-month rates are at around 5.5 percent instead of 12  percent more than a year ago. Finally the fact that our  long-term interest rates are able -- despite pressure from the  United States -- to remain at a relatively low level close to  the best rates seen in Europe and, when possible, below U.S.  rates, is a further advantage for investment in France.</p>

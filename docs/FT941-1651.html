			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Russian gamble Michel Camdessus, director-general of the International Monetary Fund, has decided to gamble on Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister. If the gamble fails, the IMF will have wasted Dollars 1.5bn, Mr Camdessus will look foolish and the IMF's reputation will have been damaged. If the gamble is successful, however, Russian reform just might become irreversible. In making the decision, Mr Camdessus overruled senior members of his staff. He was right to do so. Whether the west is right to risk the reputation of the IMF in this way is another matter. A country that is promising to keep inflation to 7 per cent a month is hardly the obvious target for IMF assistance. Nor is one with a planned budget deficit of about 10 per cent of gross domestic product. But there was little alternative to jumping in at this stage, other than watching the government drown. The IMF had to start by rewarding intentions, partly because assistance could make them more realistic. If the government does show the determination and capacity to carry out what it has promised, further support should be forthcoming. It will be needed, since the sum now on offer cannot make much difference on its own. A further Dollars 4bn of IMF money is on the table, while the Russian government hopes for a Dollars 600m rehabilitation deal from the World Bank and, more important, a formal rescheduling of its Dollars 80bn debts to western creditors. Even these sums may not be enough to make reform feasible. The old joke made by communist workers was that they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work. Now it might be that the west pre-tends to help us and we pretend to reform. Are they pretending? With Boris Yeltsin apparently hors de combat, everything depends on Mr Chernomyrdin, a former apparatchik allegedly converted to the cause of reform. He should at least be able to do what is now required to obtain the Dollars 1.5bn. But what will happen thereafter? Will the government stick to the budget? Will it pursue the equally important structural economic reforms? Mr Chernomyrdin's contacts and status in the old Russian elite presumably give him a better chance of following through than Mr Yegor Gaidar enjoyed. But the prime minister's determination is more suspect, while the obstacles remain mountainous. The strategy to which the west seems committed - assistance first, followed by measurable performance and then, perhaps, more assistance - is the only feasible one. It is unfortunate, however, that the IMF has been put in charge of the western effort, since the credibility of the institution has been put at stake. It would have been better to empower a plenipotentiary representative of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries instead. But the die is now cast. The Russians must show the gamble was worth taking; the west must respond positively to serious effort at reform.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Food: A poor man's picnic of pig tail pie OXTAIL and ox tongue rejoiced in a revival last winter, when menus in smart places boasted homely dishes such as ox tongue served hot with a spicy Seville orange sauce, oxtail soup and and old-fashioned oxtail stew with dumplings. Now it is the turn of the pig, the humbler cuts are once again finding favour. Heads, trotters and tails are the bits to go for. Bath chaps and pigs head brawn, freckled with parsley, gleaming with jelly and crumb coated, make good eating on a fine summer's day - particularly when partnered with a mustard sauce or a vinaigrette dressing and hard-boiled eggs, capers and gherkins. Even better for a picnic, less hassle for the cook to prepare and less hassle to eat, is a pig tail pie with its double crust of pastry acting like bread to sandwich the meaty filling neatly. Pigs' tails are most easily bought from pork butchers and old family butchers in Ireland, Wales, Wiltshire and north country pig-keeping strongholds. The belief lingers on in these areas that every part of the pig is good for eating except the squeak, and pig tails were a popular treat after a pig slaughter. PIG TAIL PIES (makes 2 x 8 inch pies) The tail of the pig is flavoursome meat and cheap (45p per lb at my butcher last week), but in its absence the pies can be made with belly of pork instead. For poaching: 3lb pigs' tails (ask the butcher to cut them in half); 1 onion; 1 1/2 pt hot water; a slurp of concentrated apple juice or cider vinegar; half a chicken stock cube. For the filling: 1 large or 2 small sharp eating apple(s); 4-5 oz Wensleydale cheese; a bunch of spring onions; about 8 tablespoons chopped mint; 2-3 tablespoons chopped parsley or coriander. For the pastry:  1/2 lb each wholemeal and white flour;  1/4 lb each butter and lard; a generous seasoning of salt and pepper; about 5 tablespoons water to bind; beaten egg to glaze. Wash the tails. Quarter the onion but do not peel it, and tie it loosely in buttermuslin. Put both ingredients into a large pan, pour on the hot water and bring to the boil. Skim, add the apple juice or vinegar, the stock cube and half a teaspoon of salt. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 2 hours. Remove the onion, and set the pan aside until the contents are cold, or leave it overnight if more convenient. Scrape off the surface fat and take the pig tails out of the jellied stock. Cut away the rind and surplus fat, and strip the meat from the bones: the net yield should be about 1 1/4 lb. Peel, core and chop the apple, slice the spring onions and dice the cheese. Mix them together with the chopped pork and herbs. Season with plenty of salt and pepper. The filling should be well flavoured, not insipid. Make the pastry and use half of it to line two metal pie plates measuring about 6 1/2 inches across the bottom and 8 1/2 inches across the top. Divide the filling between the tins, mounding it up well in the centre. Cover with the rest of the pastry, sealing the edges well. Glaze, make a steam hole in the centre of each pie and hold it open by inserting a piece of rolled card. Bake on a preheated baking sheet at 190'-200'C (375'F-400'F) gas mark 5-6 for 35-40 minutes. Let the pies rest for 5-10 minutes when they emerge from the oven. Meanwhile barely melt the jellied stock over a low flame and adjust seasoning to taste. Using a funnel, spoon the warm jellied stock into the pies to plug the gaps and hold the filling together neatly. Leave until the pies are cold and the jelly is set before slicing and eating.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The approval conditions of &sect;6.5 are designed to implement the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of the Act that requires the Secretary to promulgate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations ``to mitigate the adverse effects of solid waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal sites in operation as of September 1, 1984, upon property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the United States.'' As a result of the statutory language,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first condition requires that there be adequate mitigation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse effects from the operation of the disposal site. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second condition requires compliance with all applicable Federal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State, and local laws and regulations. This section, like  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;6.4, requires that there be no hazardous waste disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at any such sites because such activities are incompatible with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the values and purpose of the National Park System and each unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several solid waste disposal sites are currently operated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonfederal parties in units of the National Park System. Most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are on nonfederal lands within the unit boundaries, while others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are on Federal lands within the units. The sites on Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lands often exist because of agreements made as conditions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal acquisition of specific tracts of land. The regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not terminate any existing agreements that are in compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with applicable local, State, and Federal laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6.5(c) prescribes the conditions under which the Regional Director may allow existing solid waste disposal sites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to continue operations. However, the NPS intends that existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solid waste disposal sites operated by nonfederal parties will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not operate indefinitely. Under &sect;6.5(e), a site that reaches its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity may continue operation only if the site meets conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to new sites at &sect;6.4(a). For the purposes of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, the capacity of a solid waste disposal site is that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, volume, or height prescribed in the State-issued permit or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other instrument. Any proposal to extend the capacity of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing solid waste disposal site beyond that specified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit will be treated as a proposal for a new solid waste disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site. Such a proposal is subject to the approval conditions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;6.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is conceivable that communities that lie wholly within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundaries of a unit of the National Park System may exhaust the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity of their existing solid waste disposal sites. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communities may request that the Regional Director permit them to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish a new, or expand an existing, site within the unit. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regional Director must judge such a request under the conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescribed in &sect;6.4. However, the Regional Director will judge a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request for expansion of an existing site under the approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions of &sect;6.5(c), if the operator shows that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The solid waste is generated solely from within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundaries of the unit; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The operator owns or leases the nonfederal lands proposed for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expansion; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The solid waste disposal site lacks road, rail or adequate water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access to any lands outside of the unit for all or substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of the year. A substantial portion of the year consists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of three or more consecutive months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principles of this section govern the NPS. Should the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPS seek to expand an existing solid waste disposal site that has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reached its capacity, such an expansion is to be judged as a ``new''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site, governed by the approval standards of &sect;6.4(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the NPS meets the first and third conditions of &sect;6.5(e)(2), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPS may also expand an existing NPS-operated solid waste disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site that has reached its capacity, under the standards of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;6.5(c), rather than &sect;6.4(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule includes a new section (f) to address concerns about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solid waste incinerators and transfer stations. The proposed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final definition of ``solid waste disposal site'' included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incinerators. The final rule defines solid waste disposal sites to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also include transfer stations. The installation of an incinerator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or a transfer station where there was no site for solid waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal on September 1, 1984 is governed by &sect;6.4. Section 6.5(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governs the continued operation of an incinerator or a transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> station where such a solid waste disposal site existed before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1, 1984. Existing incinerators or transfer stations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> just as any other solid waste disposal site, may continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispose of solid waste within the boundaries of a unit of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Park System only after applying to the NPS under &sect;6.5(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and under the standards of &sect;6.5(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because incinerators or transfer stations generally do not reach capacity and require expansion, &sect;6.5(e) does not apply to them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rather &sect;6.5(e) addresses conventional land-fill solid waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6.5(f) is needed to address the conversion of an existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> land-fill solid waste disposal site to a transfer station after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of this rule. Without &sect;6.5(f), an operator of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing solid waste disposal site, approved under &sect;6.5(c), may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> realize that converting an existing solid waste disposal land-fill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a transfer station requires a request to the NPS Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Director and further NPS review and approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.6&blank;Solid Waste Disposal Sites Within New Additions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the National Park System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is included in the final rule in recognition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact that solid waste disposal sites, either on Federal or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonfederal lands, may be added to the National Park System through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition of new units or the expansion of existing units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Management Policies <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  state that solid waste disposal sites are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compatible with the purpose of the National Park System and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intent of Congress was to eliminate solid waste disposal sites from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the National Park System in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, solid waste disposal sites on Federal or nonfederal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lands included within a unit boundaries must cease operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately upon expiration of the permit or license in effect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date the lands were included within the boundaries of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Park System unit. The NPS will grant no extensions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) applies to solid waste disposal sites on both Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and nonfederal lands included within a National Park System unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the interim, and until the expiration of the permit, permittees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or operators of such sites on Federal or nonfederal lands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the boundaries must submit a permit request and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental report. Thus, paragraph (b) states that an operator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wishing to continue solid waste disposal must request a permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 180 days of the site's designation as lying within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundaries of a National Park System unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule modifies paragraph (c) to delete immediate closure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the NPS remedy under part 6 for an operator on Federal or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonfederal lands who disposes of solid waste on that land without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting NPS approval as specified in paragraph (b). The final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule substitutes instead a broader selection of remedies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties as defined in &sect;6.12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule modifies paragraph (d) to make clear that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while an operator of a solid waste disposal site on lands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System may continue to operate until the expiration of the permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or other license that existed on the date the lands were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated into the unit, such an operator may do so, only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insofar as such operator meets the NPS approval standards of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;6.5(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

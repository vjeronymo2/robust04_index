			<p>BFN     [Text] Hannover, 19 April (MTI) -- Hungary's role at the  Hannover Industrial Fair forms part of preparations for full  membership in the European Union (EU), and Hungary welcomes that  the EU Council today favored its April 1 application, Hungarian  Prime Minister Peter Boross said, addressing the opening of the  Fair today.    Boross thanked Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, saying that  his support was instrumental in today's decision. In his  opening speech, Kohl said that "Europe would be a torso without  Hungary."    Hungary is at this year's Fair as a "partner state", so the  spotlight is on Hungarian businesses. At the Fair, 123  Hungarian firms are displaying new products over 1,800 square  meters.    In his speech, Boross emphasized the importance of Germany's  role in Hungary's foreign trade and business. Last year there  was 8.4 billion German marks trade with Germany, or 24 percent  of Hungarian foreign trade. One third of foreign loans to, and  20 percent of foreign investments in, Hungary come from Germany,  and there are more than 4,000 Hungarian-German joint ventures,  Boross said.</p>

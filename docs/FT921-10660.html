			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Czechoslovak privatisation attracts nearly 8m NEARLY 8m people have subscribed to participate in Czechoslovakia's massive privatisation of state-owned enterprises, baffling authorities which expected only half the response. Queues at local registration offices started to grow earlier this year after private investment funds offered would-be customers a 10-fold return in a year's time. Right-wing parties pushing for the mass privatisation scheme have rejoiced at the rising number of subscribers, which now represent two-thirds of the electorate. The success of the scheme is expected to boost their popularity ahead of next June's elections. Under Czechoslovakia's large-scale privatisation programme, an estimated Kcs250bn (Dollars 8bn) of state-enterprises' equity will be distributed this spring in the form of vouchers. These vouchers will become shares once the privatisation process is completed. The government hopes to privatise half of the country's state-owned enterprises in this manner, by the summer. A further distribution is planned for the autumn. More than 450 private investment funds have mushroomed across the country, offering to invest the vouchers of Czechoslovak citizens who are often confused by the privatisation process and lacking basic information on many state-owned enterprises. If on schedule, the first round of bidding for shares will take place next month. Moreover, less assets than predicted may be available. Officials at the Czech ministry of privatisation said many state-owned companies were entangled in restitution claims and would not be available for distribution by March.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 8 (YONHAP) -- China and North Korea  reaffirmed their alliance Tuesday and vowed bilateral efforts to  strengthen their ties at a high-level meeting here Tuesday,  China's official XINHUA News Agency reported.    XINHUA, however, did not say whether the North Korean  nuclear  crisis, which has escalated into an international controversy,  was mentioned in the meeting.    President Jiang Zemin received a visit by a North Korean  military delegation, led by Chief of General Staff of the  People's Army Choe Kwang, at his office and described  Beijing-Pyongyang ties as "interdependent, like teeth and lips,"  according to XINHUA.    Strengthening and developing the bilateral friendship  remains  a firm policy of the Chinese party and Government and the wish  of the party and the people, Jiang was quoted as saying.    Choe, noting he came to China as bilateral relations are  deepening, said it is also the position of the North Korean  Nodong (Workers') Party to build the two nations' friendship for  generations to come.    XINHUA said Choe conveyed greetings from North Korean  supreme  leader Kim Il-song and his heir-apparent, son Chong-il.  President Jiang reciprocated with greetings to the two Kims.    Choe and his military delegation arrived in Beijing on  Monday  for a week-long visit and met Zhang Wannian, chief of general  staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.    They also met with Chi Haotian, Chinese national defense  minister, after their talks with Jiang and attended a dinner  hosted by Chi.    Despite the notable absence of the nuclear problem in the  Jiang-Choe talks, Western diplomatic sources said the Chinese  leadership will warn North Korea of the chance of war on the  Korean peninsula in case of U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang  while explaining the tense moves within the United States and  the United Nations regarding the nuclear issue.    China's leaders will try to drive home the seriousness of  the  present situation to the North Korean military, especially since  Choe wields considerable influence, the sources said.    They will convey Beijing's position that in order to seek a  solution through dialogue, North Korea must immediately stop  unloading fuel rods from its nuclear reactor, they said.</p>

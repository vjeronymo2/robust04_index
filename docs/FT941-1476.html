			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / The Italian Election: Business ponders which runner to back  -New political system is causing concern in nation's boardrooms There seem to be two parallel election campaigns in Italy. One is the colourful televised spectacle, a parade of new or relaunched parties inflated by rhetoric and garnished with new slogans and logos. The other is the attempt by the same protagonists to appear greyer than their rivals, to shake off or play down potentially embarrassing links with neo-fascism, Marxism and corruption scandals. It is this second campaign which Italy's business community is watching. According to Mr Marco Borsa, editor of the Milan-based business magazine Espansione, companies are fearful of the future. 'They were used to working under the old political system.' That fear is compounded by the fact that it is difficult for the business community to interpret the signals put out by the three main political groupings. As creator of the Fininvest group, Europe's second largest media empire, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Forza Italia's founder, ought to have the edge in winning the entrepreneurial vote. Last Sunday he tried to highlight this strength in a radio debate with his main Progressive opponent, Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). 'In government it's particularly important to have someone concrete, who knows how to organise things, get results and come up with ideas. This activity is much closer to my training than that of a party leader, who may know his party apparatus, and how to handle interviews, party rallies and TV slots, but has never had to deal with the concrete problems of the workplace,' he claimed. But Mr Occhetto has been working hard at home and abroad to offset fears about the Progressive Alliance, whose ranks include not only the PDS but the unabashed hard left of Reconstructed Communism, a party which has frightened investors by threatening to tax government bonds. Last month Mr Occhetto even spent 24 hours in the City of London, reassuring bankers and brokers that his was the party of fiscal prudence, continued privatisation and reform of the public administration. Mr Berlusconi may also have alienated some of the business constituency with a colourful attack on the Confindustria employers' federation earlier this month. He claimed that the federation, of which he is a council member, was not a place for real entrepreneurs. As a result, business support could well be split next Sunday. Indeed, company executives are standing for almost all parties. In Milan, for example, Mr Ernesto Gismondi, head of the Artemide design group, is a Progressive candidate in spite of having been a missile expert and Nato consultant. Under the circumstances, it is hardly surprising that few companies will commit themselves publicly to supporting one group of parties. Confindustria itself eschews political commentary. Instead, the media has speculated about the voting intentions of Mr Gianni Agnelli, head of Fiat and a traditional reference point for the industrial mood of Italy. A party thrown by a Fiat lawyer this week for Mr Valerio Zanone, candidate for the centrist alliance in Turin, was taken as evidence that the Agnellis were backing the centre. Gianni himself has made no clear pronouncements. Certain small businesses, widely courted by prospective candidates, particularly in the north, are more partisan. Mr Beppe Palma co-ordinates a Milan-based lobby group for small and medium-sized enterprises which has pinned its hopes for the past four years on the federalist Northern League. He admits, however, that politicians can easily commit themselves to helping small and medium-sized companies, then forget about them once in power. In any case, according to some entrepreneurs, the final choice may not make much difference. Mr Luciano Benetton, chairman of the international clothing group, points out that all parties face the same challenges as the outgoing technocratic government: reducing unemployment and the public debt, continuing privatisation and reform. Behind the electoral hyperbole, the manifestos of the three main groups are broadly similar. Mr Panfilo Tarantelli, who heads the Milan office of merchant bank Schroders, is similarly calm about the effect on markets. 'There is really nothing in the three programmes which is alarming or would lead to the conclusion that Italy is becoming a risky country (for investment).' In an opinion poll at the beginning of this month for the newspaper Corriere della Sera, institutional investors, fund managers and brokers suggested that an outright victory for the centrist alliance would probably be the best result for the bond and stock markets. Unfortunately for investors, a centrist victory is the least likely outcome. Probably no group will have a majority. But as more cynical observers point out, a few weeks of post-election manoeuvring will at least give those companies still sitting on the fence plenty of time to adjust their politics to the prevailing mood.</p>

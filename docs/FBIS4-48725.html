			<p>BFN     [Text] Brazzaville, 22 May (AFP) -- The Congolese National  Assembly has adopted an Army territorial reorganization plan  that will ensure better liaison between the military leaders and  those of the administrative regions, parliamentary sources  disclosed today.    Indeed, a bill adopted yesterday makes for the creation of  seven military defense regions that will replace the five  military zones that have so far existed. The military leaders  of these seven regions, generals or senior officers, will also  serve as military advisers to the prefects of the country's nine  administrative regions. The military authorities will be  responsible "for the preparation and implementation of  operational defense" before the Army Headquarters, the same  sources explained. Every military region will be subdivided  into districts "corresponding to all or part of an  administrative region," while special arrangements will be made  for border areas.    According to the British magazine, MILITARY BALANCE, the  Congolese Army is made up of about 11,000 men. The government  recently announced its intention to enroll 2,000 young men aged  between 20 and 24 to rejuvenate the Army. It currently has a  very high proportion of officers and noncommissioned officers.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Sport: Costa threatens to blight Courier's springtime in Paris - Tennis  / The French Open draw offers some enthralling contests FOR THE next two weeks, Paris will be the focus of attention for tennis fans everywhere. The defending champions, Jim Courier and Monica Seles, both competing on the slow red clay at the Stade Roland Garros for the fourth time, will be strongly fancied to retain their French Open crowns, even though each was dealt a difficult hand at yesterday's draw. The fact that Seles - also the champion in 1990 - lost in her last final in Rome two weeks ago to Gabriela Sabatini is not important. The 18-year-old Yugoslav had come back from an injury and saw the Italian Open as preparation for the sterner tests ahead in Paris. Courier, by contrast, won emphatically in Rome last week and saw it as a good augury for the two testing weeks that lie ahead. He has had a quiet week of practice and preparation with his travelling coach, Brad Stine, and should be feeling relaxed and confident. Certainly you cannot bet against this rugged, smiling American because there is no finer match player on any surface at the moment. But fate was certainly not smiling on Courier at the draw. In the champion's immediate path lie Thomas Muster of Austria and Alberto Mancini of Argentina, clay-court experts both. Ahead will come stern tests either against Carlos Costa, Courier's victim in the Italian Open final, or Goran Ivanisevic, the strong-serving Croatian left-hander. Beyond lie Courier's pal Pete Sampras, Guy Forget, or last year's finalist, Andre Agassi. It could hardly be more difficult for Courier. Here are the seeds in the top half, in draw order: Courier (No 1) v Jakob Hlasek (16); Costa (9) v Ivanisevic (8); Sampras (3) v Alexander Volkov (14); Agassi (11) v Forget (6). In the lower half the seeds seem less threatened, though there are two intriguing first round clashes. The Wimbledon champion, Michael Stich, faces 39-year-old Jimmy Connors who last year earned a tremendous ovation when levelling at two sets all against the 1989 champion, Michael Chang, before retiring exhausted. I fancy Connors will want to go out in a blaze of glory again this time. Ivan Lendl must play the fine young Spaniard, Sergi Bruguera, who last year beat Boris Becker to win the Monte Carlo tournament but has not been as effective this year. But then, nor has the ageing Lendl. Becker, incidentally, is absent with a leg injury. This is how the seeded players will meet in the bottom half if they all reach their appointed places: Chang (5) v Richard Krajicek (12); Aaron Krickstein (13) v Stich (4); Petr Korda (7) v Lendl (10); Brad Gilbert (15) v Stefan Edberg (2). If there are is to be a surprise winner among the men, Costa could be the one. The 24-year-old right hander from Barcelona looked most impressive when I watched him in Rome, and was clearly enjoying himself as he beat Krickstein, Ferreira, Santoro, Yzaga and Korda before running out of steam against Courier. There is an admirable variety about his game not usually found in Europeans bred on clay. They tend to be one-dimensional baseliners. Not Costa. He was as happy following his serves to the net to deliver a sharp winning volley as he was scurrying across the baseline mixing bullet-like backhand passes with shrewd lobs. He has great touch and imagination, too, which carried the mind back to those other great Spaniards, Manuel Santana and Manolo Orantes. It was all most entertaining - and done with a winning smile that had the excitable Roman girls swooning in the sunshine. It has been a wonderful year for this former Spanish junior champion. In Estoril, Costa won his first Tour title with back-to-back wins over his country's No's 1 and 2, Emilio Sanchez and Bruguera. That was a particularly satisfying moment for one who has been consistently overshadowed at home by less talented but more successful men. This time last year, for instance, Bruguera was ranked at No 5 in the world after that victory over Becker in Monte Carlo. To underline his improvement, Costa promptly went on to Barcelona the following week and won the Spanish championships. In the final, Costa beat Mancini, another man in good form who had won the important tournament in Key Biscayne in March. Then, after proceeding to the final in Madrid, Carlos beat Agassi on the way to the semi-finals in Hamburg, another feather in an already well-decorated bonnet. All this success has lifted Costa's world ranking to No 10 and his season's earnings to almost Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 282,500). The only question mark about his likely success in Paris is the effect this new-found fame and fortune will have on him. If he really believes himself worthy to stand alongside the likes of Courier, Chang and Edberg, then Costa could do some serious damage these next two weeks, though he is desperately unlucky to be so close in the draw to Courier. Come to think of it, Courier is probably cursing his own bad luck. I shall be surprised if there are many surprises in the women's event. So quickly does the form fall away after the top dozen that upsets usually occur only as the result of injury or illness. Nevertheless, Seles will hardly be overjoyed to find Jennifer Capriati and Gabriela Sabatini, the only two women to have beaten her this year, both in her half. First, though, she must beat the amazing young German, Anke Huber, 17, who gave her two really testing matches in Australia. The seeding in the top half has worked out like this: Seles (1) v Huber (9); Mary Pierce (13) v Capriati (5); Sabatini (3) v Katerina Maleeva (11); Leila Meskhi (15) v Conchita Martinez (7). In the lower half the former champion, Steffi Graf, will have noted that Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, who thrashed her (there is no other word) 6-0 6-2 in last year's semi-finals, is cast to meet her there again this time: a tantalising prospect for the fans, but not for Graf who, though successful in Hamburg and Berlin, has shown most erratic form of late. The draw has suggested the following line-up in the bottom half: Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere (8) v Nathalie Tauziat (12); Kamiko Date (14) v Sanchez-Vicario (4); Mary Joe Fernandez (6) v Sabine Appelmans (16); Jana Novotna (10) v Graf (2). As usual, this great championship will provide a feast of entertainment; I, for one, cannot wait to get my feet under the dining table.</p>

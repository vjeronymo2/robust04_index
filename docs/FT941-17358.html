			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Rover to launch Discovery in US Land Rover yesterday announced an April launch for the Discovery four-wheel-drive vehicle in North America. The move is expected to quadruple its sales in the US. The company, which is part of Rover vehicles group, will slot the Discovery between its existing US sales of the luxury Range Rover and the utility Defender ranges. The launch is expected to push Land Rover production to a record level this year. Output at Land Rover's Solihull plant rose by 18 per cent to 68,000 last year, its second best year. Weekly output jumped from 1,290 last January to 1,830 in December. The four-wheel-drive division of the Rover group added 600 jobs, bringing its workforce to 8,500. Mr John Russell, Land Rover commercial director, said sales in the US last year rose by 15.9 per cent to a record 4,907. Discovery prices in the US will begin at just less than Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 20,270). The vehicles will include dual front passenger airbags and anti-lock brakes as standard equipment, and an extended warranty. The prices will be well below UK levels to allow the Discovery to compete in the lower-priced US market against vehicles such as the Ford Explorer and Chrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee. Meanwhile Chrysler, the US vehicle maker, has enjoyed growing success with the UK launch of its US-built Jeep Cherokee and Wrangler four-wheel-drive vehicles. Almost 4,000 were sold in 1993, double the initial target. Rover has run into resistance from white-collar workers reluctant to switch jobs to the assembly line, Mr David Bower, the company's personnel director, said yesterday, Richard Donkin writes. Only 60 clerical staff have made the move after a request for 1,000 volunteers in November, designed as a move towards more flexible working patterns that could help secure the company's promise of no compulsory redundancies among the 33,000 workforce. Mr Bower said that the company would now probably need to recruit as many as 500 new workers after the period for volunteers expired in May. Most staff were being added at the Swindon and Solihull sites, he said, adding: 'We would not force people to do this. If we ended up doing that it would not be in the spirit of what we are trying to become.'</p>

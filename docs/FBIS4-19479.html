			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Ankara, April 18 (A.A.) [Passage omitted]  Foreign Ministry under secretary Ozdem Sanberk returning from a  trip to Jordan and Iraq, told reporters at Ankara's Esenboga  Airport that a memorandum of understanding was reached with  Iraq, adding a team of Iraqi officials will come to Ankara in  the next months to meet on technical details with BOTAS [Turkish  Oil and Natural Gas Company] officials.    He said that the cleaning work could be started within two  to  three months adding, however, that no precise date can be set up  at this point.    Sanberk said that the cleaning work will be for "reparation"  and "saving the pipeline from rotting" therefore not against any  UN imposed sanction.    Sanberk said technicians now had to work out "modalities of  the technicalities of the flushing-out (operation)...." Once  such arrangements are in place, the rescue operation for the  whole Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline system could start.    "Under the plan, the pipelines must be flushed and refilled  for correct maintenance until regular flow is resumed," Sanberk  said.    "The pipeline has not been used for almost three years, it  is  a very valuable asset and we do not want to it to deteriorate,"  he added.    "The purpose was to see whether corrosion had set in and  repair the pipeline to have it ready for the day when the  embargo is lifted," Sanberk said. [passage omitted]    Sanberk said talks during his trip to Baghdad also covered  trade and political issues, including Iraq's latest diplomatic  campaign to get the sanctions lifted or eased.    Ankara has called for easing the embargo but wants Baghdad  to  fully comply with UN demands to scrap its weapons of mass  destruction so the oil and trade ban on Baghdad can be lifted.    It also wants Iraq to recognize the newly-demarcated border  with Kuwait and open a dialogue with Kurds in Northern Iraq.    The three-year-old trade sanctions have caused millions of  dollars in losses to Jordan and Turkey, Iraq's neighbors and  main trade partners.</p>

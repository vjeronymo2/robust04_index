			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Prospects for peaceful S Africa election worsen Prospects for a peaceful election in South Africa appeared dim last night after the country's political leaders acknowledged the failure of last Friday's peace summit, and Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi predicted this would lead to further bloodshed. African National Congress leader Mr Nelson Mandela, speaking at a rally to mark the first anniversary of the assassination of ANC leader Chris Hani, said he would seek a further meeting with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini despite lack of progress at the summit. He said the ANC had offered King Goodwill 'the same rights as Queen Elizabeth of Britain', but the king had rejected his proposal. Mr Mandela was addressing some 15,000 ANC supporters at the Orlando football stadium in the black township of Soweto. They laughed and jeered when he said he had asked the Zulu King three times whether he wanted 'the same rights as Queen Elizabeth or more rights than Queen Elizabeth enjoys', but was unable to obtain a clear answer. 'In spite of that, I am working for peace,' he said, 'because our people in that province (Natal) are dying in scores'. However most political analysts said they believed last Friday's summit marked a watershed in South African politics. Local newspaper headlines proclaimed 'the end of the road', with few commentators confident that a political solution could be found to the ANC-Inkatha dispute before the poll. The ANC-dominated Transitional Executive Council, the multi-party body which oversees government ahead of the April 26-28 elections, is expected to take stronger measures against the KwaZulu government this week, in the wake of the failed peace summit and in response to complaints that the recently declared state of emergency has not quelled violence. Some 144 people have died in Natal since the emergency 10 days ago. The leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Chief Buthelezi, predicted further bloodshed, saying: 'I have never seen the level of anger (among my supporters) as high as the current level.' Violence has cast doubt over the prospects for elections in the province, but South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission, charged with conducting the poll, made clear at the weekend that elections would go ahead none the less. Mr Roelf Meyer, the government's constitutional development minister believed only 60 per cent of Natal's population could vote freely. To overcome obstacles to voting, the IEC said it would erect polling stations on the borders of the KwaZulu homeland, where Inkatha's election boycott campaign is strongest. This would permit KwaZulu residents to travel to peaceful areas to vote. However such measures are likely to have little impact, as Inkatha militants will prevent voters from leaving their homes if they believe they are going to vote. ANC officials say international mediation of the country's constitutional dispute is still due to go ahead this week, but prospects for progress appear slim. Meanwhile the ANC leader also lashed out at the rival National Party at the Soweto rally. 'The NP is a mouse and they think they can fight the ANC, an elephant.'</p>

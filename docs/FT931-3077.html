			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Arts: The Met's new 'Ariadne' - Opera in New York The one success among the Met's new productions this season is almost naughtily sure. Ariadne auf Naxos is wholly about giving the audience what it wants: the unseen proprietor - the Viennese grandee for whom the stage entertainment is supposedly being prepared and enacted - is in reality each spectator in his or her seat. We ask to be amused, touched, stirred, charmed, lulled, and Strauss does it all. So it is perfectly appropriate that this New York version should be directed unashamedly at the musical and dramatic pleasure centres. Ion Marin sustains the sweet nostalgia of the orchestral part, and balances it well to achieve a combination of richness and delicacy; there is the right sense that what we are hearing is something precious and slightly too small, a marvellous chamber arrangement of a symphonic score. The opening-night cast, American except for Ragnar Ulfung as the Major Domo, could hardly have been more suitable. Jessye Norman had only to play herself as operatic grande dame: swift, with what was for her an unusual incisiveness, in the prologue; statuesque and magnificent, rolling out the long phrases without any pretence of real suffering, as Ariadne. Ruth Ann Swenson had all the brilliance and agility needed to complement her as Zerbinetta, but also the strength and fullness to come somewhere near matching her. As Bacchus, it was a nice touch that we should have a surprise, since Thomas Moser has hitherto made his career largely in Europe and as a Mozart tenor: he proved to have all the stature and stamina needed for this part, while maintaining a brightness and care for tone and phrasing. Thomas Stewart, too, was neatly chosen to elicit affection as the Music Master. Susanne Mentzer was the Composer, and I suppose in an ideal world her voice would be a notch bigger and descend with confidence a semitone or two further. But one asks too much: this was a glorious performance, and strikingly different from the Octavian she had been presenting in this theatre until less than a week before. In Rosenkavalier there was always a smile and a bounce in her singing; in Ariadne she showed a different kind of youthfulness - ardour, directed energy, clear focus - and the difference was there as much in her voice as in her stage personality. She caught the steel of ambition that would make an apprentice artist capitulate to occasion. But it was the production, by Elijah Moshinsky in designs by Michael Yeargan, that seemed most conspicuously to want to please the audience, with an aptness that would have seemed distastefully cynical in the performance of a work by any other composer. The first act takes place in a huge architectural cross-section to out-Zeffirelli the Met's Tosca: one sees part of a grand stairway, the back stage of the private theatre, and the below-stairs arrangements of the artists. There is plenty of bustle with supernumaries. People are having trouble hoisting up a backdrop for the performance in the theatre; the Major Domo has a swim of servants after him; the pantomime troupe is expanded to include a rubber-limbed, juggling Pierrot and several children as miniature Harlequins and Zerbinettas. It is the sight of a boy Harlequin that, in a pretty moment, first hints to the Composer that something is amiss. No subterfuge is used to suggest that the second part of the piece takes place in the theatre we have seen being readied in the first. Instead of a cloth backdrop, we are treated to sliding panels, by means of which a night sky, with the constellations figured as on an old star map, can part to reveal a cloudscape or, for the finale, a screamingly vulgar sunset. The nymphs glide on to the set and off again atop high built-up costumes: they look like candles, and turn the production's irony towards campness. Ariadne is swathed in black-purple to leave the full accent on her facial profile. But why Bacchus should arrive looking like the Flying Dutchman is less easy to explain, unless as a demonstration that by now in this opera nothing matters except the projection of meaningless golden sound. 'Ariadne auf Naxos' will be broadcast live from The Met on Radio 3, Saturday 6.30 pm</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mixed fortunes at top US drug groups THE US drugs industry's fortunes appeared varied during the third quarter as leading pharmaceutical groups yesterday unveiled mixed earnings. Upjohn's operating income of 86 cents a share was higher than the 79 cents most analysts had predicted. However, restructuring charges of Dollars 183m in the quarter pushed it into the red with a net deficit of Dollars 30m, or 19 cents. A year earlier it earned Dollars 131m, or 73 cents, including one-time charges of Dollars 15m. It is cutting about 1,500 jobs worldwide, eliminating or reducing manufacturing capacity, and writing-down certain intangible assets as well as increasing its liability reserves. Upjohn expects its restructuring moves to save at least Dollars 150m annually. Excluding one-time items, net income rose 5 per cent in the quarter. Sales edged 1 per cent higher to Dollars 900m. Eli Lilly also posted better-than-expected third-quarter earnings of Dollars 294.4m, or Dollars 1, above the slender 96 cents Wall Street had expected. The previous year, it lost Dollars 268.5m, or 91 cents, including a pre-tax restructuring and other charges of Dollars 519.6m. Lilly blamed pricing pressure for the slim improvement in sales of Dollars 1.53bn from Dollars 1.48bn. Warner-Lambert, on the other hand, disappointed Wall Street with a 5 per cent fall in third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 155.9m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, against Dollars 164.6m, or Dollars 1.22, a year earlier. Its shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 69 3/4 . Warner-Lambert's sales rose to Dollars 1.49bn in the quarter from Dollars 1.44bn. The company blamed previously-disclosed regulatory issues involving its manufacturing operations, and broader-based industry pressures, for its earnings decline. Warner-Lambert has run into trouble with the Food and Drug Administration over record keeping and other violations at its manufacturing plants, especially in Puerto Rico. Manufacturing difficulties have cost it about Dollars 150m in lost sales this year. Mr Arvind Desai, an analyst at Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, said the poor results also reflected intensifying generic competition for the company's Lopid cholesterol-reducing agent.</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Technology and IBM make up Technology, the UK's largest computer reseller, and International Business Machines have made up the quarrel which followed ICL's acquisition of Technology in July 1992, writes Alan Cane. IBM at the time cancelled its pc distribution, forcing the reseller to seek other sources of supply for IBM machines. Technology had been an authorised IBM dealer for nine years. Now IBM has agreed that Technology can sell its economy level Valuepoint range, Thinkpad notebooks and PS/1 computers. IBM's advanced PS/2 computers are not part of the new agreement.</p>

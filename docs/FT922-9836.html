			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / People: Chipping away at Fortress Germany S G Warburg has hired Michael Treichl, previously a managing director at Merrill Lynch in New York, to head up its German corporate finance activities, initially from London. Treichl arrived firmly on the German merger and acquisition scene a couple of years ago with the Pirelli debacle. Merrill was one of the Italians' advisers in the -in all but name - hostile, and unsuccessful, bid for German tyre company Continental. Firmly identified with those chipping away at Fortress Germany, he is well respected by anyone who advocates greater transparency and shareholder democracy among German companies. He joins Warburgs attracted by 'the firm's name .and its special historical links to Germany' and will move to Munich in a year or two as the business builds. While competitors sniff that it has yet to make its mark as a European rather than a UK merchant bank, Warburgs has quietly been assembling some of the juicier mandates around. The privatisation of east German hotel chain Interhotel for instance was a Warburg deal. Probably the most interesting current mandate in Treichl's new stable is Aachener &amp; Munchener, which retained the UK merchant bank after French insurer AGF assembled its 25 per cent stake. Viennese by birth, with an education spanning Eton, Vienna University and Harvard, Treichl, who is now nearly 41, once turned down a job offer from Sir Siegmund Warburg because he wanted to work in America; he joined White Weld in New York instead. His subsequent career took him via CSFB in London and Tokyo, and back to New York for Lazard Freres - where among a long list of big name deals he also admits to having advised Midland on the ill-starred Crocker purchase. He had been at Merrill since 1988 on the international M &amp; A side, and claims to have parted amicably. He tots up the value of completed transactions to his name as 'nearly DM70bn' (Pounds 24bn).</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: US institutions to buy more foreign equities US institutional investors expect to increase substantially their overseas equity exposure over the short and long term, and are likely to focus on emerging markets and smaller-capitalisation issues, according to a recent report. The survey of US banks, insurance companies, mutual funds and pension funds, conducted in July and August by New-York based Broadgate Consultants, found that belief in broad-based economic recovery in Europe, widespread global corporate restructuring and continuing development of emerging markets, especially in Latin America, were fuelling interest in global investments. In the survey, 84 per cent of respondents said that they expected to increase their international equity holdings over the next five years, with three-quarters expecting to allocate 'significantly more funds' offshore over the next 18 months. 'Sophisticated US market participants are not limiting their global investments to larger, high-profile companies,' the report said. Almost 70 per cent of those surveyed said small capitalisation issues had become an essential part of their global programmes. Emerging markets continue to hold great allure, with 74 per cent identifying developing markets in Latin America and Asia as leading opportunities.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Italian industry continues job losses UNEMPLOYMENT in Italian industry continues to rise, especially in companies employing more than 500 persons. According to the latest figures from Istat, the national statistics institute, the level of employment in large companies fell by 6.5 per cent in the first three months of the year compared with the same period last year. During 1992, companies employing more than 500 persons lost on average 5.5 per cent of their workforce, equivalent to 65,000 jobs. The speed of job losses increased during the latter half of 1992 and appears to show no sign of slowing down. Overall 200,000 jobs were lost in industry in 1992. Throughout the economy as a whole, the total out of work is 10.5 per cent. But the true picture of unemployment in industry is masked by extensive use of the government-financed system of temporary lay-offs which extends over a two-year period. The unions, involved in delicate tripartite talks with the government and the employers on a wage pact, fear the consequences of spending cuts on unemployment benefits. In particular, they are concerned that a number of temporary lay-off schemes are now reaching the end of their maximum funding by the government. With the recession refusing to bottom out, job losses could begin to pose a problem for the government.</p>

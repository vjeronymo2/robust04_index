The explosion, which occurred early this morning at the  garage door of Barbagelata's home, located in a residential  district of Montevideo, caused fairly serious damage to the  house and neighboring buildings, but no one was injured.    A commando called the Guard of Artigas, which presumably  groups retired military men and officers on active duty who have  ultra-rightist leanings and who are linked to the old de facto  regime (1971-1984), claimed responsibility for the attack in a  call to EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO newspaper, and justified its  action with its repudiation of "the corrupt judicial system."    After the attack, police found a Guard of Artigas pamphlet  that contains harsh criticism of recent sentences that have been  handed down by the Judicial Branch.    Paules, who was also president of the Military Circle, has  been sentenced to eight months in prison. The sentence, which  was confirmed by two judicial instances, was handed down for the  crime of "disrespect for the president," due to his harsh  criticism of President Luis Alberto Lacalle on 21 October.</p>

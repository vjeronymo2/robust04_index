			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (1): Adapting in hard times - Business schools must adapt to a changing and more discriminating market in harder times.  Companies are seeking more individual attention, and beneath the title 'MBA' lies an ever-wider variety of courses. Serious management education is ceasing to be the preserve of high-flying executives BUSINESS SCHOOLS never had it so good as in the 1980s. Their MBAs became prized commodities; their numbers and earnings soared; so did the salaries of their faculties. And as the 'enterprise culture' swept Reagan's America and Thatcher's Britain, their offspring vied with popes and prelates as arbiters of official morality. Now, it is hard times. Or harder times, at any rate, as recession bites, 'kinder, gentler' values rise uppermost, and schools come to terms with a decade of frenzied expansion. For most, though, it is not a question of decline, but of adaptation - to a new climate, and to a changed market in which individuals and companies show them- selves more discriminating and refuse to buy the old type off-the-peg courses and MBAs. It is also a decade for change in the status of institutions, as the top brass in host universities come to see their business schools as more than simply milch cows to prop up under-funded humanities departments. The US now produces 70,000 MBAs a year from more than 250 accredited programmes; the number of institutions offering MBAs in Britain has almost doubled in a decade - up from 47 to 82; and apart from Germany, whose corporate culture and lengthy first degree programmes have so far kept the business school at bay, the rest of Europe has experienced growth to match. 'There is a now a clear sense of weakening,' says Mr Roger McCormick of the Association of MBAs. 'But in the past decade the growth rate has been so strong that it would have been impossible to maintain it.' The impact of the recession apart, across the sector six trends are clearly marked. First, executive courses - as opposed to degree programmes - are assuming a progress- ively higher profile in manage- ment schools' budgets and out- put. Typically, half an instit- ution's income now comes from courses - programmes anything in length from a few days to a few months' mini-MBA. The drift is also to more company-specific courses, and away from off-the-shelf prog- rammes open to all comers. According to Mr Jean-Michel Beeching, marketing director of the London Business School's executive education programmes: 'Companies used to take whatever business schools had to offer them. Now they are much more mature as customers: they are coming to business schools and saying 'we want' rather than just looking in through the shop window.' European schools are well- attuned to the shift - recog- nising that competition comes not only from other instit- utions, but from increasingly professional in-house or contracted training teams employed by companies themselves. Variations on the theme of 'developing a long-term, inter-active relationship with companies' reverberate around most schools - and are becom- ing more than a slogan in some. British institutions such as Ashridge, Templeton and Henley have long pioneered tailored courses, and almost half of executive-course income at LBS, IMD (Switzerland) and Insead (France) now comes from such programmes. The position in the US is more mixed: some leading schools, notably Harvard and Stanford, stick resolutely to open programmes, while others have become active players in the 'tailored' market. Wharton (Philadelphia) reckons that tailored courses will account for two-thirds of its income within a few years. The second trend is a response to 'the flattening of traditional corporate struc- tures and hierarchies', in the words of Mr George Bain, prin- cipal of the LBS. 'The demand is for a new generation of well-rounded, generalist man- agers - not the dominance of the specialist of old.' Accord- ingly, management education is increasingly seen as an ongoing, not once-for-all, process. The concept of paid sabbatical leave has yet to catch on much beyond acad- eme, but it is the logical goal. 'Internationalisation', a novel concern with management in the public and not-for-profit centres, and the application of new technology - particularly video and inter-active software packages - to management education are the next three trends. They are assessed in articles later in this survey. Many leading business schools will tell you only three truly international schools exist: IMD, Insead and theirs. Most will also say they take the public sector 'seriously' and are in the 'forefront' of applying new technology. Look carefully beneath the blurb in all cases. The sixth trend is a rapid growth in part-time and distance-learning courses. The new-style part-time or distance-learning MBA is a management development programme, geared particularly for those in mid-career - not a magic turnstile to a career shift and a salary hike for thrusting executives in their late 20s. That trend is still working its way through. A survey last year by the Council for National Academic Awards of Britain's 8,000 entrants to MBA courses - who split fairly equally between full-time, part-time and distance courses - found the typical MBA student to be male, 27 and middle-class, doing the degree on his own initiative with only limited help from his employer. A few years hence, 'middle class' should be the sole survivor from that composite. Britain's Open Business School, launched in 1983 and claiming now to train more managers than any other in Europe, is a leading force for change. It has just graduated its first 211 distance-learning MBAs - and has another 4,000 in the system. MBAs are, however, only the icing on the OBS cake: more of its effort is devoted to a certificate in management for first-line managers and a diploma for middle managers. 'It may sound drastic, but there isn't much of a role for middle management in tomorrow's world' is Mr Ludo Van der Heyden's view from Insead - through whose portals middle managers generally pass only on their way up. Professor Andrew Thomson of the OU takes a different view. Drawing a 'British management' pyramid with 0.35m senior managers at the top, 1.3m junior managers at the bottom and 0.8m middle managers in between, he says: 'the high-flyers - the Oxbridge, Ivy League, Grande Ecole group - will make it anyway: we need to be just as concerned with training those at the bottom and in the middle, whose management careers are as likely to move sideways as upwards.' The fate of the British Management Charter Initiative - launched in 1988 after reports that each UK manager received just one day's formal training a year - is instructive in that regard. In numerical terms, its record is mixed. In Leeds only about 50 of the 10,000-odd eligible companies have joined the MCI. But its 'crediting compet- ence' programme for improv- ing management skills has attracted more than 60 Leeds managers in the first five months since its launch. Separ- ately, the Leeds Training and Enterprise Council included Pounds 700,000 in this year's budget for training supervisory and first-line managers - paying up to Pounds 1,000 per manager and Pounds 10,000 per company. Most of the funds are for approved courses developed with - and put on by - Leeds business school, a part of Leeds polytechnic. Leeds Tec is confident the funds will stimulate local businesses to efforts of their own - and not just after the recession. Leeds business school is rather less glamorous than its London counterpart with the same acronym. For the most part its students do not populate the great consulting and investment banking houses; nor do they generally proceed to average salaries of Pounds 38,000 (Insead's 1990 average for MBA graduates taking jobs in Britain). But management education has as much to offer them as their high-flying counterparts - and it is waking up to the challenge.</p>

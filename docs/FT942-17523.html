			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Property: Easter, just the time to see Rome and buy - David Lane investigates the Eternal City's housing market Easter in the Eternal City has a timeless quality. It is a season for pilgrims, drawn to the basilicas and churches, and for art and history lovers, attracted by the galleries, museums and sites of imperial Rome. There could, however, be another type of visitor this year: the prospective property buyer. Prices have fallen steeply during the past two years, dropping by between 20 and 30 per cent in the historic centre over the past 12 months alone. Political uncertainty and the continuing weakness of the economy mean the turning point in the property market has not been reached, although some estate agents expect improvements in the autumn. Others forecast the beginning of next year, while the real pessimists say prices will not start to pick up until 1996. 'There is little money around. The market is still falling and there are good opportunities for finding bargains,' says Greti Walcher Miraglia, of estate agent Internazionale Immobiliare. She says prices in the historic centre (approximately, the area between the Piazza Venezia, the river Tiber, Piazza del Popolo, Piazza Barberini, Santa Maria Maggiore and the Colosseum) have been affected much more than the fringe around the centre and the suburbs. Price falls over the past year have been below 10 per cent in some outlying districts. Despite this, many foreign residents find the centre still costs too much. It also falls short on convenience for those who work in the southern EUR suburb. But the garden district of Casal Palocco, near the Ostia lido and close to Fiumicino airport, has a large expatriate population of businessmen and employees with the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation. Another popular district is the Via Cassia, outside the ring road to the north; it is well located for English schools and the Olgiata golf course. Also favoured by foreigners, including diplomats, is the Parioli area. Separated from the centre by the Villa Borghese park, it has property prices of L6m to L7m a square metre (convert at roughly L2,500 to the pound) that fit between the more expensive historic centre (L8m to L12m per sq m) and those in the EUR-Laurentina-Torrino districts (L3m to L5m per sq m). Casal Palocco, EUR, the Cassia and Parioli have their supporters. But wealthy foreigners without the constraints of working location or schools, and with the time to enjoy Rome's many attractions, opt unerringly for the historic centre. This is the real Rome of palaces, squares, churches, craftsmen's studios, smart shops and restaurants. And where is more central than Largo del Nazareno, a minute's walk from Piazza di Spagna? Here, Internazionale Immobiliare has on its books a recently renovated, fourth floor, split-level flat offering reception room, two bedrooms, two bathrooms and kitchen at L950m. Refurbishment has brought a lift, a service not often found in apartments in this area. 'Two small terraces are an additional attraction in this apartment of about 100 sq m. The building has only four apartments and there is no porterage. But this will keep condominium charges low,' says Walcher Miraglia. Her firm also is selling a fourth floor penthouse in Via del Pellegrino, which runs off the Piazza Campo de' Fiori, close to the Palazzo Farnese. At 75 sq m, this is a small property with a reception room, bedroom, bathroom and kitchen and small terrace, all in good order. There is no lift, though. Price: L600m. 'Most demand is for apartments in the range of 100 to 120 sq m,' says Walcher Miraglia. 'This is considered ideal for a pied-a-terre, as apartments of such size can offer a reception room, two bedrooms and two bathrooms and are easy to manage.' But buyers generally want a terrace or a fine view. Most apartments in the historic centre are either smaller, (around 70 sq m) or much larger (more than 200 sq m). The demand-supply ratio means buyers get more square metres for their lire in larger properties. 'Internazionale Immobiliare has a 400 sq m apartment, in need of restoration, in an historic building in Corso Vittorio for which the asking price is L6m per sq m,' says Walcher Miraglia. Sant Andrea, the prestige property division of Gabetti (Italy's largest estate agency) also has an outstanding large apartment on its books. This takes up the third floor of an 18th century building near the Piazza del Parlamento. 'It is 380 sq m, has been restructured and boasts superb ceilings,' says the agency's Laura Melega. The apartment has a triple-size reception room, five bedrooms, three bathrooms and servants' quarters. Price: L4.7bn. For buyers seeking only a pied-a-terre, rather than part of a palace, Sant Andrea offers a third floor apartment of 100 sq m in a 17th century building in Via Giulia. 'It is hard to imagine anywhere more typical of old Rome,' says Melega. 'It has a reception room, two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom. There is no lift but there are marvellous views of the Tiber and church cupolas.' Price: L800m. Finding the right property should not be difficult in present conditions. Neither is obtaining mortgage finance locally. All the large Italian banks have mortgage lending operations, although bureaucratic procedures can be tiresome and time-consuming. English-speaking purchasers may find it easier to deal with one of the two large UK specialist real estate lenders - the Woolwich building society and Abbey National - that operate in Italy. Certainly, they would be served more quickly. 'Provided the paperwork is in order, the Woolwich can approve a mortgage in three days,' says Massimo Notte, its managing director in Italy. A similar time scale is achieved by Abbey National. In contrast, Italian banks rarely take less than four weeks. Pietro Bertollo, Abbey's manager in Milan, says: 'The term of the mortgage, which covers a maximum of 85 per cent of the value certified by our surveyor, is usually 10 years but it can be lengthened to 15 or 20 years. The variable interest rate is presently 10.8 per cent. We have no problems in lending to non-residents.' Woolwich is equally at ease with non-Italians and non-residents. Like Abbey, it grants mortgages to Britons resident in the UK for buying property in Italy. 'Woolwich lends up to 75 per cent of the property's value. The term is up to 20 years and the variable interest rate is presently 10.6 per cent,' says Notte. Procedures for buying are straightforward. When agreement is reached, the buyer usually deposits 10 per cent of the price. Then, the sale contract is signed before a notary. The declared price is often lower than the price paid, though. Financial factors may, however, reduce some of the appeal of purchasing a Rome pied-a-terre. There is a tax of 4 per cent on the declared value of first homes. A registration tax of 2 per cent adds to mortgage costs, and the notary's fees may be substantial while the annual local property tax amounts to about 0.5 per cent of declared value in Rome, in addition to which there is an annual city charge for rubbish collection. And, as the Eternal City's governors tackle the temporal task of balancing the books, higher property taxes seem likely. Further information: Internazionale Immobiliare, Via V Veneto 96, 00187 Rome.

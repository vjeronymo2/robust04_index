			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / You must remember this . . .: A kiss is just a kiss, says Lucy Kellaway, unless it's a handshake, hug, or bow MY HOST at a recent dinner party came forward to kiss me. He aimed for my right cheek; I went for his left. We changed course at the same instant, and for a while stood shifting our heads from side to side before he landed a kiss on the edge of my mouth. A fellow guest, a woman I knew slightly, put out her hand to be shaken just as I was advancing for a kiss. Two others were introduced: one held his hand out, one did not. The hostess called out a verbal greeting from the sofa. We in Britain are suffering a crisis of uncertainty over how to greet each other. No contact at all? A handshake? A kiss? Two kisses? Which cheek first? Should you make a smacking noise with your lips as if to parody the whole act? Should your lips touch their cheek, or should you just bump jawbones? Until recently, kissing was confined to lovers, family, the young or to Europhiles. That is no longer the case: Teresa Gorman and Peter Shore, who are none of the above, were seen not long ago giving each other a kiss in the lobby of the House of Commons. It seems anyone can kiss anyone; the problem is that there are no ground rules. A good system of greeting should be a) clearly understood by everyone b) in tune with national characteristics c) relatively quick and simple to operate and d) stable over time. The British system fails on all counts. Other countries fare better. Some nations are more kissy than others, but at least all know how they are supposed to behave. In France the number of kisses rises as you go down the social scale: the upper classes kiss twice, the middle classes three times and the working classes four times. Upper class men will kiss a woman's hand, but not if she is young and unmarried, and never in a public place. Above all, their lips and the lady's hand must not meet. 'Kissing is a tribal custom - and you always know what tribe you are in', says Patrick de Jacquelot, London correspondent for Les Echos. In Italy it also a tribal thing: male members of the Mafia kiss on both cheeks, other men do so at their peril. The former prime minister Giulio Andreotti was allegedly spotted doing just that with a well known Mafioso - a kiss which is now being counted as evidence against him. The Germans are compulsive hand-shakers, the Dutch kiss three times as do the Flemish-speaking Belgians, whereas the French-speaking ones kiss twice. The problem with these continental systems is that they are too time consuming, as each member of a group has to exchange the required greeting with every other member. The Japanese method is both simpler and quicker: they do not kiss at all, neither do they touch flesh. The polite greeting is a bow, and even this is reserved for strangers and superiors. The US system fails as it changes with fashion. Until recently a firm handshake was the required greeting everywhere. Lately, the smart set on the East Coast have started kissing each other, and New York has even developed the famous 'Manhattan Air Kiss', in which no contact is made lest it disturbs the make up worn by society women. In Washington the new greeting is a hug. Since President Clinton hugged Al Gore at the inauguration and gave an even bigger one to the poet Maya Angelou, young political hopefuls have been seen wrapping their arms around each other at the smallest excuse. In all countries the consequences of a misjudged kiss can be serious. In Kuwait a peck on the cheek in a public place can land you in prison, and in the US a man kissing a woman in a business setting could be charged with sexual harassment. In Britain at the very least it makes for a sticky beginning or end to a social gathering. Two male colleagues admit to having absent mindedly kissed the husbands of guests in the general flurry of kissing that follows a successful party. So how to avoid such problems? Lesley Kark, chairman of Lucie Clayton, the finishing school, says that if in doubt on any point of etiquette, you should ask. However, it is not always practicable to discuss whether you should kiss someone before doing so, especially as the person you ask may not know the answer themselves. The reason the British are making such a meal of kissing is that we are not tactile people. Let me suggest an alternative way of greeting better suited on us: look the other person in the eye, smile where appropriate and say 'hello'. That meets all the criteria: it is clear, quick, does not offend against our nature, and many people have been doing it for decades. I plan to try, even if the word gets muffled as someone puts their cheek to my mouth.</p>

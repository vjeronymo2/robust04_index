			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (22): The electronic contract SUBCONTRACTING ELECTRONICS by David Boswell McGraw-Hill Pounds 27.95, 264 pages A GROWING number of domestic and multinational companies are sub-contracting or 'out-sourcing' their electronic manufacturing activities as an integral part of their corporate strategies. Based on conservative estimates, contract electronics is already a Pounds 550m-a-year business in the UK and is growing by about 15 per cent a year. In Europe as a whole it represents the fastest growing sector of the electronics industry. Customers range from blue-chip multinationals from both sides of the Atlantic and the Far East, to smaller companies with perhaps little experience of electronics design and assembly. However, businessmen without any direct experience of contract electronics manufacturing face a formidable challenge in deciding whether to 'make or buy', especially if the jargon of the electronics sector and its technology is unfamiliar. Subcontracting Electronics, by David Boswell, a consultant and specialist in surface mount technology, is a practical guide and manual for executives, managers and contract negotiators involved in electronic purchase and supply decisions. His starting point is the belief that the increasing complexity of system design and assembly requires a more professional approach from both customer and supplier. Accordingly, the reader is taken step-by-step through each stage of the contracting process. The first two chapters deal with the structure of electronics industry and the most important factors to be considered in deciding whether to manufacture an electronic product or sub-assembly 'in-house' or to contract out the work. Chapter two identifies the main technological and management theory driving forces behind the trend towards contract electronics manufacturing, including the continuing shift towards shorter product cycles, ever-increasing complexity and the need for greater production flexibility. Arguably this is one of the most important sections of the book and could have been longer and more detailed. But although the author, who is also chairman of the UK-based Surface Mount Club, is clearly an advocate of contract manufacturing, he presents the arguments concisely. Refreshingly, he lists the pitfalls and disadvantages as well as the advantages. Other chapters deal with technologies, contract terms and conditions, how to choose a contractor and costings. Finally there are three fictitious but enlightening 'case studies,' and some helpful definitions and abbreviations for the uninitiated.</p>

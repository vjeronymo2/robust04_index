			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VARIATION ON A THEME: 'LIGHT MY FIRE(BIRD)'  </P> <P> Police said Jorge Sanchez Lua was looking for gasoline, not trouble, but he  wound up with plenty of both.  </P> <P> Around 2 a.m. Saturday, Lua was peacefully filling his tank at a station on  West 19th Street when an angry man walked up and began berating Lua for no  apparent reason.  </P> <P> Police said the man, known only as "Byron," had just been thrown out of a  nearby bar for causing trouble and was still in a trouble mood.  </P> <P> Byron had a one-gallon milk jug with him. He filled it with gasoline, then  began pouring it onto Lua's car and tried to splash some on Lua himself.  </P> <P> "Get back or else!" Byron shouted, and Lua complied.  </P> <P> Police said Byron then took out a cigarette lighter and ignited the car. Before  firefighters doused the flames, the car -- a 1983 Pontiac Firebird -- and part  of the gasoline pump station were reduced to rubble. Lua was unharmed.  </P> <P> Byron walked away and disappeared, police said. If found, he will be arrested  on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, they said.  </P></p>

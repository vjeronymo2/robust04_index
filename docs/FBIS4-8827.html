			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Robert Pick, adjutant, state </F> secretary, and head of the president's military office, by  Zoltan Vereckei; place and date not given: "No One Threatens  Hungary Militarily -- Robert Pick on the Yugoslav Crisis, Arms  Race, Professional Army"]    [Text] Bombing raids rarely advance peace processes,  because every action brings a reaction. However, these raids  are useful for changing the balance of power and, indirectly,  promoting agreements -- Colonel Robert Pick, adjutant, state  secretary, and head of the president's military office, told us.  Robert Pick spoke about the Yugoslav crisis and Hungary's  security policy, and also said that the arms reduction talks in  Vienna are no longer timely.  <H5>  They Failed to Avoid Conflicts </H5>   [Vereckei] In your opinion, the aim of the UN intervention  was to shift the balance in favor of the Bosnians.    [Pick] No, the actions carried out by the NATO aircraft were  hardly big enough to have any serious effect on the balance of  forces in Bosnia. However, the possibility is theoretically  open; it is true, however, that there are many unforeseeable  difficulties hindering a larger action of this kind.    [Vereckei] Many people claim that a timely and more firm  position on the part of the West could have prevented the  escalation of this crisis.    [Pick] I am convinced that the conflict would not have  developed thus far if the United Nations had taken the necessary  steps at the appropriate time. As is well known, the United  Nations also has the task of avoiding conflicts, keeping peace,  and creating peace. However, they failed to prevent the  conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I find this to be a basic  mistake and, although there is no peace, there are peace-keeping  forces present. What is needed in the region is the  establishment of peace, but this requires more troops. In my  opinion, the establishment of peace with the help of armed  forces is theoretically unclear as well: It is difficult to  speak of the establishment of peace in a place where the United  Nations appears as a third party in the conflict. It is unclear  on whose side it can do that and with what means.    [Vereckei] While both the United Nations and the United  States are trying to show determination in continuing the armed  intervention, Russia is opposing this for many reasons. Under  these circumstances, how determined can the United Nations  really be?    [Pick] Precisely to the extent shown by the events of recent  years and the UN security decisions. I do not think that a new  Security Council resolution can go beyond the current tasks, all  the more so because the Russian side would probably veto every  such initiative.    [Vereckei] The AWACS debate in Hungary repeatedly flared up  along with the air raids. It was still possible to explain the  role of the AWACS aircraft flying in Hungarian airspace at the  time of the downing of the Galebs, because the AWACS were only  carrying out their task of supervising the flying ban. However,  in the course of their latest actions, the NATO combat aircraft  attacked ground targets in Bosnia while the reconnaissance  aircraft were flying in Hungarian airspace. In this context,  how can we evaluate Prime Minister Peter Boross' request that  the AWACS aircraft leave Hungary's airspace during combat  actions?    [Pick] I would remind the readers that earlier, at the first  instance involving AWACS aircraft, Jozsef Antall wrote a letter  to NATO in which he asked the following: If a change takes  place in the activity of the AWACS aircraft, a change that  exceeds the framework allowed by the Hungarian Parliament, NATO  officials should take into consideration the fact that the  Hungarian Parliament has to discuss this issue again. I think  that the latest event is only the continuation of previous  events.  <H5>  Avoiding Air Raids in Peace Time </H5>   [Vereckei] Obviously, Hungary's security policy situation is  affected not only by the Yugoslav crisis, but also by every  change taking place in our region. The recent elections in  Ukraine ended with the victory of the pro-Russian leftist  forces, and the voices of Russian extremists dreaming of an  empire are becoming increasingly loud in Russia. Could all this  represent any threat to Hungary in the foreseeable future?    [Pick] I am convinced that, at the moment, Hungary does not  face any military danger. Yeltsin and the Russian Government  have repeatedly pointed out that Russia has no aggressive  intentions toward other countries. Therefore, the extremists do  not represent official policy; besides, such political groups  can also be found in other countries. At the same time, one can  clearly see that Russia wants to continue to be a big power  factor, and it reacts sensitively to any attempt to belittle  this role.    [Vereckei] Contrary to the Vienna armed forces reduction  agreement, Russia does not want to disarm its troops withdrawn  from Europe; instead, Russia would send them to the Caucasus.  Would this mean the end of the Vienna quotas?    [Pick] An agreement lasts as long as the balance of forces  remains as it was at the time of the signature. This balance of  forces has changed considerably since then: The Soviet Union  has disintegrated and the CSFR has separated into two countries.  If it wishes, Russia can exceed the agreements and no one can  stop it.    [Vereckei] It seems increasingly certain that, in exchange  for the outstanding Russian debt, Hungary will receive the S-300  missiles. Although these missiles are clearly defensive  weapons, even the MiG-29 aircraft caused concern in our region.  Can you envisage an arms race in this region started by Hungary?    [Pick] If someone wants to arm himself, he will always find  a proper excuse. Naturally, a race needs several players.  However, no one should forget that Hungary was the only country  to suffer an air-raid in peacetime. It is the task of the  MiG-29 aircraft and the S-300 missiles to avoid the repetition  of such an event.  <H5>  Military Service Could Be Reduced </H5>   [Vereckei] Parliamentary elections will be held in Hungary  in a few weeks. In your opinion, could the basic elements of  Hungary's security policy and its Army organization change  considerably in the case of a change in government?    [Pick] I do not think that any essential change could take  place. The political parties represented in parliament have  repeatedly expressed a unity of views on major security policy  issues. As for the Army structure, this is a scientific issue.  The army has so far been organized within certain perimeters  and such conditions that determine the army's organization will  continue to exist in the future.    [Vereckei] One of the key issues in the debate on the Army  was whether the parties want a professional army or one based on  compulsory conscription. What is your position on this?    [Pick] The Hungarian Army cannot be reorganized into a  professional army in the near future. Theoretically, a  professional army always serves interventionist goals, but  defense is a matter for the entire nation. From a military  viewpoint, it is absolutely clear that a professional army  cannot train the number of reserves needed to fulfill the  requirements of adequate defense, enable the restoration of the  original situation, and make the aggressor give up the desire  for further attacks. At the same time, because of the shortened  period of service and the complex military equipment, the number  of professional soldiers needs to be increased. I would  particularly mention the officers corps here, where the  shortening of military service led to serious consequences.  Disciplinary and court proceedings prove what it means when  there is not enough time to train officers: They do not learn  how to treat people. However, I can envisage a further decrease  in the military service time, but this should be accompanied by  a modernization of the training and mobilization system.    [Vereckei] Looking at the past four years, what was it like  to work with the Defense Ministry and the army?    [Pick] Essentially, we can almost call these relations  cloudless.    [Vereckei] Did you also see the taxi drivers' blockade in  these terms? At that time, the possibility of using the Army  also arose.    [Pick] No, the taxi drivers' blockade was a political issue  and, therefore, it could not cause a conflict between the  ministry and the president's military office.    [Vereckei] Other problems?    [Pick] Occasional professional differences of view, but  these differences are natural within a good working relationship.</p>

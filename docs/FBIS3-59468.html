According to incomplete data, 3,000 to 4,000  people who are either Slovene citizens, of Slovene descent, or  close relatives of Slovene citizens still live in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    At the most, 500 people would be evacuated from Sarajevo  this  time. On 16 December last year, the Slovene Government decided  to evacuate from Bosnia-Herzegovina all Slovene citizens, their  spouses, and their children, except men of draft age who have to  have the permission of the Bosnian Government. Also included in  the evacuation will be also the grandparents of Slovene  citizens, providing they live in the same household.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INNOVATION: U.S. SHOULD WELCOME THE BEST, BRIGHTEST  </P> <P> If the young Albert Einstein appeared today as a Caltech grad student who  wanted to make his career in America, he probably couldn't get a green card.  </P> <P> Unless Albert had a guaranteed job or friendly relatives here, back he would go  to Europe -- no ifs, ands or buts. But he's a genius?! Doesn't matter -- our  country has an immigration policy that deliberately discriminates against  people with brains and skill.  </P> <P> Roughly 650,000 people a year are granted legal immigration status in this  country. Less than 6% are admitted on the basis of expertise -- such as a  Rupert Murdoch. Family connections or political oppression matter most. Our  immigration system is so messed up that an aspiring immigrant's knowledge and  entrepreneurial drive are virtually irrelevant to the Immigration and  Naturalization Service.  </P> <P> "We're surprisingly unaccommodating to business-related immigration," says  Arthur C. Helton, who teaches immigration law at New York University.  </P> <P> That's crazy. From its earliest days, this country's leadership in technical  innovation has depended on a flow of brilliant immigrants looking for a chance  they could never get at home. We entered the Industrial Revolution in 1789 when  Samuel Slater escaped to Rhode Island from England with plans for textile mills  tucked securely in his head. Without emigres from Hitler's Europe, America  wouldn't have built the atomic bomb and established primacy in the physical  sciences. And (ironically) without the Werner von Brauns, we would have no  space program or man on the moon. Computer technology? Our lead can be traced  to immigrants such as An Wang and Intel's Andrew Grove. Asian immigrant  entrepreneurs, often relying on school or family ties to keep them in this  country, are now reshaping California's high-tech industries.  </P> <P> Make no mistake: Innovation comes from immigration. And yet, since legislation  in 1965, our policy has ignored that heritage. "Our immigration policy  certainly isn't dedicated to the entrepreneur," says Peter H. Loewy of  Fragomen, Del Rey &amp; Bernsen, a Los Angeles-based law firm handling  corporate immigration. For the past 20 years, we've paid far more time, money  and attention to illegal immigration.  </P> <P> It's time to change focus. If you believe that our global competitiveness  depends on our "human capital," then we've got to consider an immigration  policy that's designed to attract the world's brightest.  </P> <P> Elitist? You bet. The point is not to turn one's back on the huddled masses  yearning to breathe free but to also be pro-active and extend a welcome to  immigrants with intellectual capital and ambition. Why shouldn't we offer the  best of both worlds -- a refuge for the world's oppressed and an opportunity  for the world's gifted?  </P> <P> Recent events give real urgency to that question. Margaret Thatcher's Britain  has turned its back on Hong Kong, a nation filled with entrepreneurs and  hard-working professionals who fear what China has in store. The best-selling  new magazine there is called Emigrant. Why should Vancouver get the creme de la  creme of Hong Kong's business class? Canada makes immigration far easier than  we do. This country needs the sort of dynamism that these immigrants could  provide. Let's welcome them.  </P> <P> Look at Eastern Europe. There are hundreds of thousands of scientists and  engineers, both superbly educated and technically proficient, in Hungary, East  Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia. Yes, dramatic market reforms are under way.  But does anyone honestly believe that a Hungarian engineer with a great idea  will get venture capital? Or that West Germany will cheerfully absorb all the  engineers that East Germany has to offer? Emigration is limited but possible.  Why shouldn't these highly trained people look to the United States to enjoy  the risks and benefits of a market economy? What's more, why shouldn't we  encourage this as a matter of policy?  </P> <P> It's not as though West Germany and Japan -- our leading economic rivals --  want to compete with us for all this talent and brains. They're historically  immigrant-averse. Great. Let's go with our strength. We know how to cope with  immigration; we know how to provide a chance to those from other lands. Let's  use immigration policy as a tool to enhance our competitiveness in cutting-edge  technologies and not primarily as a source of cheap labor. Let's send a message  to the world that we value the skilled, educated and hard-working mind -- and  that we're prepared to reward it with the gift of opportunity and citizenship.  </P> <P> "We shouldn't put any barriers in place for those who can meaningfully  contribute to our economy," says National Science Foundation Director Erich  Bloch, a German immigrant. "We only hurt ourselves when we do that."  </P> <P> The Simpson-Kennedy Immigration Act of 1989 -- which overwhelmingly passed the  Senate this summer -- is a small but important step in recognizing the  strategic economic importance of immigration policy.  </P> <P> The bill -- which goes to the House next year -- marks the first shift away  from the purely family-centered immigration policy of the past 25 years by  adding 104,000 new slots for immigrants who can bring special skills to this  country. Half those slots go to companies hiring professionally trained foreign  nationals.  </P> <P> The bill also sets up a point system for evaluating "independent immigrants,"  and, as in Canada, confers legal status on foreign entrepreneurs who set up  businesses that employ at least 10 Americans. Capitol insiders say the bill has  a shot.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, mum thus far, would be smart to make Simpson-Kennedy  its own and champion merit-based immigration. It's a natural for the "Education  President." Go an extra step: Give people with master's degrees and Ph.Ds in  science and engineering automatic green cards. Let's be a magnet for technical  talent in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America.  </P> <P> A possible brain drain? We'll see. Our universities educate some of the finest  minds in the world. What's wrong with keeping a few more of them here after  they graduate? Other countries will recognize that their emigres will want to  maintain ties and trade with their homelands.  </P> <P> The world is becoming more open -- and more competitive. We need all the  bright, skilled and motivated people we can get. Our legal immigration policy  is badly broken. Let's fix it. Now.  </P></p>

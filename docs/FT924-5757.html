			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Letter: Attractions of Greek stock market, despite recent slide Sir, Referring to Kerin Hope's article, 'Athens sinks in spite of government reassurance' (October 10), I would like to make the following comments. Indeed the Greek stock market experienced a significant slide in equity prices which brought the ASE composite index to lows not seen for the last 30 months. The problems outlined in the article, namely unrest and fears of war in the former Yugoslavia, the prospect of a harsh 1993 budget and high real interest rates have had an impact on the stock market. As a matter of fact, the prevailing high level of short-term interest rates causes a flow of funds off the stock market into more attractive short-term money instruments and alternative investments. Moreover, the underlying economic conditions (high public-sector borrowing requirements, inflation three times the EC average) make a quick fall in interest rates impossible for the next few months. In spite of the unfavourable business environment the overwhelming majority of listed companies has announced enhanced 1992 half-year results compared with last year. Even if one looks further, an eruption in Serbia's Kosovo region in no way implies that Greece would get involved in the turmoil. The government has given repeated reassurances that Greece has neither any territorial claims against its northern neighbours nor any ambitions to interfere in the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. The government's austerity programme is expected to exhibit positive results by mid-1993. The budget for the 1993 fiscal year foresees a primary surplus of around 5 per cent of the GDP, whereas inflation will fall to single figures by the last quarter of 1993. These positive developments will enable interest rates gradually to come down to reasonable levels, thus encouraging investment and fuelling economic recovery. Bearing all this in mind, the recent decline of the stock market has brought stock prices to very attractive levels, with most companies trading at four to six times their expected 1992 earnings. Like every stock market, the Athens Stock Exchange is vulnerable to cyclical trends. Hence, it is in my belief that the Athens Stock Exchange will rebound sooner rather than later.

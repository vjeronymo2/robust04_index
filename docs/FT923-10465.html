			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Latin American Debt Crisis: Solution passes the test of time  -Ten years ago next month the Latin American debt crisis broke - and threw the world financial system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed the story for the Financial Times from the outset analyse how the crisis was handled. And they pose the question: Is there life after debt? ON August 20 1982, Jesus Silva Herzog set in motion an international crisis of grand proportions. The Mexican finance minister announced to an audience of bankers, gathered at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, that repayment of principal on bank loans was to be halted for three months. Debt payment problems quickly spread to Brazil, Argentina and several other countries. Ten years later, none of the loans has been repaid. The crisis posed a threat to the stability of the industrialised world, where large banks faced collapse. For Latin Americans, the sudden break in the flow of foreign finance began a decade of economic austerity, social problems and political battles over the direction of economic policy. Although borrowers resisted pressure to club together or to default, their relationship with the industrialised world was sorely tested. Within creditor countries, calls for costly grand solutions to the debt problem, reducing the burden on borrowers, were countered by resistance to taxpayer bail-outs of banks. The financial implications of the crisis were appalling. Debtor countries - which had borrowed heavily to finance rapid economic growth amid a frenzy of competition among banks to lend - faced default on a huge scale, with the prospect of being cut off from external funding for years. For governments and banks in the industrialised world, the situation was horrifying. The capital of the largest US banks was exceeded by their loans to the largest borrowers. More immediately alarming was the extent to which foreign branches of Latin American banks had used the short-term money market as a source of funds. As banks balked at renewing credit lines to them, central banks struggled daily to keep the world's payments system going. It was in an atmosphere of hysteria that the leading financial officials and bankers met in Toronto in September 1982 for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. What was to be done? Remarkably, the strategy devised to handle the crisis in its earliest days proved a durable one, still employed although with modifications. It was hatched by Mr Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the US central bank, and Gordon (now Lord) Richardson, governor of the Bank of England, along with Mr Jacques de Larosiere, managing director of the IMF, and Mr Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of the Swiss National Bank and the Bank for International Settlements. Mexico's approach - telling banks that it would defer principal payments while continuing to pay interest - also contributed. The essence was to buy time: stretch out the problem so that debtors could introduce economic changes necessary to restore creditworthiness, and allow creditors to build up their capital sufficiently to absorb the shocks. It was essential for banks that debtors paid interest. If they did not, losses would quickly become intolerable. So, controversially, debtors would receive new loans to enable them to pay interest. At the same time they would reschedule principal repayments on debt of longer than a year's maturity, and embark on economic policies agreed with the IMF. Close collaboration between the main parties was required, and each financing package needed months of tense negotiation. As the long-term nature of the problem became clear, maturities were lengthened and amounts of deferred debt increased under 'multi-year rescheduling agreements'. The initiative launched by Mr James Baker, as US Treasury secretary in 1985, recognised the need for debtor countries to grow, and led to greater emphasis on structural adjustment of economies. It also forced banks to accept lower interest rates and stretch maturities further. Banks' desire to reduce their problem by trading out of it led to a series of innovations which culminated in the initiative launched by Mr Nicholas Brady, Mr Baker's successor, in 1989. The underlying principle was that, if banks treated debt as below face value, by trading loans at a discount, debtors should benefit. Under the Brady Plan deals - the latest of which, for Brazil, was agreed this month - banks voluntarily exchange loans for bonds with either lower face value or lower interest rates, thus reducing the cash burden on debtors. In retrospect, the strategy took a natural course, resulting in gradual diminution of the problem and eventually in the restoration of countries to creditworthiness. But few participants would claim it was all predictable. Each new step brought confrontation and required a phased acceptance of reality by both debtors and creditors. Banks had reluctantly to accept the necessity for, in turn, new lending to delinquent debtors, rescheduling over long periods, lending at below-market rates, large loss provisions (after nearly five years) and finally debt relief. But with Latin America now growing and borrowing again, and banks' capital shored up under new requirements, it may justly be said that the strategy worked.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Venezuela  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Population (Mid-1989):                               19.2m Per capita 1989 GNP:                         Dollars 2,450 Foreign exchange reserves (Mar '92):        Dollars 10.0bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mexico  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Population (Mid-1989):                               84.6m Per capita 1989 GNP:                         Dollars 2,080 Foreign exchange reserves (Dec '91):        Dollars 17.7bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Brazil  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Population (Mid-1989):                              147.3m Per capita 1989 GNP:                         Dollars 2,500 Foreign exchange reserves (Jan '92):        Dollars 10.2bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Peru  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Population (Mid-1989):                               21.2m Per capita 1989 GNP:                         Dollars 1,060 Foreign exchange reserves (Feb '92):         Dollars 2.4bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Chile  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Population (Mid-1989):                                 13m Per capita 1989 GNP:                         Dollars 1,770 Foreign exchange reserves (Feb '92):         Dollars 7.0bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Population (Mid-1989):                               31.9m Per capita 1989 GNP:                         Dollars 2,160 Foreign exchange reserves (Dec '91):         Dollars 6.6bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- External debt  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- US Dollars bn  1985      86      87      88      89      90   91 proj.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total debt, DRS countries   966   1,062   1,194   1,182   1,199   1,281    1,281 Total external debt, all developing countries     1,046   1,147   1,290   1,282   1,306   1,355    1,351  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Countries reporting to World Bank Debtor Reporting System and World Bank staff estimates.

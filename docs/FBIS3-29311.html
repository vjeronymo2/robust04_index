The new deputy secretary, Talbott, in contrast to poor  talker  Secretary of State Christopher, is a glib talker. Basically,  the deputy secretary of state is in charge of interdepartmental  affairs within the Department of State. In the case of Mr.  Talbott, however, he is likely to have many chances to attract  public attention at news conferences.    Besides, Deputy Secretary Talbott is a universally  acknowledged expert on Russia, which is plagued with mounting  confusion.    Mr. Talbott began studying the Russian language when he was  a  student at Hotchkiss, a famed prep school in the Eastern U.S.,  and studied Russian literature at Yale University and at Oxford  which he attended as a Rhodes scholar along with President  Clinton. He is also known for translating the memoirs of former  Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev at the age of 24.    After graduating from universities he worked at TIME  magazine  as an expert reporter on the former Soviet Union and Russian  affairs. He was reported to have indulged himself in Russian  affairs even while the Washington bureau chief, reporting on  U.S. affairs as a whole. After his 30-year-long immersion in  Russia, he can rightly be termed a "Russophile."    His excessively partial concern for Russia is seen as a  little problematic, but he is counted on by many for his  expertise on Russia, where tension and instability continue to  mount. It is because a blueprint for rebuilding Russia drawn up  by the United States and the International Monetary Fund has  greatly gotten out of shape due to the rise of ultranationalist  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, and the resignation of reformist First  Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar, and the expressed  resignation of Economics Minister Fedorov who have pursued  economic democratization and the like.    Meanwhile, a noticeable No. 2 man in Japan's Russian  diplomacy appeared on stage when Japan-Russia relations were not  making any improvement even after Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's formal visit to Japan, as shown by such activities as  Russia's dumping radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan.    Recently Koji Watanabe, former ambassador to Italy, was  appointed ambassador to Russia, but he is not quite an expert on  Russian affairs. So Kazuhiko Togo, former minister to the  United States, was called in to assist Ambassador Watanabe.    Mr. Togo not only has the experience of serving in Moscow  some time ago but also was the Soviet Union Division chief at  the Foreign Ministry when the then President Mikhail Gorbachev  visited Japan. In addition, Mr. Togo, when he was in the United  States as minister at the Japanese Embassy, was said to have  developed a strong friendship with Deputy Secretary of State  Talbott.    It remains to be seen how much influence these two No. 2 men  can exert on future Japan-U.S.-Russia relations.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is considering  imposing limits on the number of banks which revise their  articles of incorporation authorizing them to issue preferred  stock. The reason, according to officials of the Securities  Bureau, is that "there is the risk that they will have an  adverse impact on stock prices" if large numbers of banks revise  their articles of incorporation and if banks which embrace a  strong sense of following the pack embark on a torrent of  preferred stock issuances. However, within the ministry, are  those who recommend prudence in handling the situation, saying,  "It would be excessive to intervene in matters concerning  articles of incorporation," and there is the view that it is  debatable whether the intent of the MOF will assume the form of  effective "guidance."    Preferred stock does not carry voting rights but has  priority  over common stock in the payment of dividends. Preferred stock  often poses a burden in terms of dividends and was rarely issued  in Japan. However, ever since net worth regulations were imposed  on banks in 1993, banks faced the urgent need to increase net  worth and Sakura Bank issued 100 million yen in preferred stock  in March of this year.    Other banks have followed Sakura Bank in considering the  issuance of preferred stock. Normally, they would prefer issuing  common stock at market prices to increase net worth, but  financial institutions are using the majority of their profits  to write off bad loans. Enhancement of capitalization through  issuance of common stock is restricted to companies that enjoy  growing profits and banks are now situated so that they are  currently unable to issue common stock. Although costs of  raising capital are somewhat higher with preferred stock, they  have no choice but to issue such stock.    Issuance of preferred stock requires that the articles of  incorporation be revised at the shareholders' meeting. The  purpose is to revise the articles of incorporation to specify  that the board of directors can exercise the authority to issue  preferred stock.    The MOF is attempting to impose a "hold" on the such  revisions to articles of incorporation. The MOF thinks it can  forestall a stampede in the issuance of preferred stock if the  number of banks revising their articles of incorporation can be  decreased.    The Securities Bureau which exercises jurisdiction over the  stock markets is taking the lead in encouraging a limitation of  such revisions, but the Banking Bureau, which is directly  responsible for banks, voices the need for caution in the area  of "guidance." The reason for such caution is that in terms of  banking administration, changes to charters of incorporation are  submitted after the fact and no authority exists for the  provision of guidance. Further, there was a time when the  Banking Bureau had encouraged banks to issue preferred stock to  increase capitalization and "it would be difficult to tell them  not to revise their articles of incorporation to provide for  preferred stock at this late stage."    Despite such cautionary comments, officials of the  Securities  Bureau insist on limiting changes in the articles of  incorporation and it appears that they have no intention of  withholding "guidance." Some quarters doubt the efficacy of  "guidance" that is not backed up by the cooperation of the  Banking Bureau, but it appears the Securities Bureau is  considering the imposition of adjustments in issuances through  "guidance" directed at underwriting securities firms at the  point of issuance.    In the industrial world, there is the view that the issuance  of large volumes of bank stocks at market prices during the  bubble economy contributed to the lengthy depression of the  stock markets. It appears that recent "guidance" has surfaced  based on comments of that nature. However, a leading life  insurance company official critically states, in reference to  attempts to forestall changes to articles of incorporation even  before issuance of the preferred stock, "Any such attempts  reminds people of the peculiarities of Japanese markets and  should have a negative effect on the markets." It is difficult  to predict the direction to be assumed for the issuance of  banks' preferred stock amidst a general movement for  deregulation.</p>

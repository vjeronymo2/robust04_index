About one hundred prisoners,  some in warders' uniforms, escaped early on Thursday morning  after breaking into the administration block and making holes in  the asbestos roof.    They also briefly held a number of building workers hostage  inside the prison.    One prisoner, convicted robber Thembelani Makeleni, was shot  in a thigh and hand by a warder when he refused to heed warnings  to return to his cell. Makeleni was given first aid by ISD  medics before being taken to hospital.    There had been minor unrest in the prison on Wednesday.    On Thursday most of the staff went to Bisho to attend a  court  hearing on a strike in which they participated in February,  leaving what one decribed as "very few" members at the prison.    One of the builders, Mr David Weimers, said he was tiling  cells when awaiting trial prisoners "came out" and took him and  about 15 of his fellow workers hostage. The prisoners seized  their angle grinder and cut open all the other cells in the  mens' section.    "They held us, they were standing in front of us. They  didn't  hit us or anything," he said.    The men were freed by ISD policemen who came over the roof,  fired warning shots and then lowered a ladder so they could  climb to safety.    They prisoners were "badly angry", Mr Weimers said. "They  say  they have been here too long. They haven't got a government.  That's why they want to come out."    The prisoners broke into a storeroom to obtain warders'  uniforms used in the escape, ransacked offices, ripped metal  window frames out of walls and torched several cells and the  bail and fines office.    After the ISD moved in, and prison staff began returning  about 11AM, the prisoners moved to one courtyard at the back of  the jail.    After negotiations they handed over their weapons to  warders,  watched by ISD members. A SAPA reporter counted about 250  prisoners in the courtyard, some in convict green, others in  civilian clothing. Among the weapons were warders' batons,  kitchen knives, pieces of metal including tripods and a garden  sickle.    According to a watching warder the prisoners had said they  wanted to negotiate with the jail's commanding officer, Maj W  Booi, who was apparently amenable to their request.    Firemen hosed down the burned-out cells.</p>

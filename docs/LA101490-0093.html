			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN SURVIVES 150-FOOT PLUNGE FROM P.V. CLIFF  </P> <P> A Hawthorne woman winding up a low-key birthday celebration early Saturday with  a visit to a Palos Verdes Peninsula cliff accidentally stepped off the edge,  falling 150 feet before becoming entangled in brush, police said.  </P> <P> Irene Annette Wilson, 40, underwent surgery Saturday at Harbor UCLA Medical  Center in Torrance, a hospital official said.  </P> <P> The official declined to detail the woman's injuries but said she was in  serious condition.  </P> <P> According to police, Wilson and a male friend were sitting at the edge of a  cliff in the 1700 block of Paseo Del Mar in Palos Verdes Estates when Wilson  stood up, stepped backward, and plunged 150 feet. Earlier, the pair had spent a  quiet evening dining at a Torrance restaurant to celebrate Wilson's 40th  birthday, police said.  </P> <P> Brush growing at the side of the cliff, 50 feet from the bottom, broke Wilson's  fall, said Ed Jaakola, a lieutenant with the Palos Verdes Estates Police  Department. "That brush probably saved her life," Jaakola said.  </P> <P> Paramedics reached Wilson at about 4 a.m., he said, lowering her to the bottom  of the cliff and sending her to the hospital aboard a Los Angeles County Fire  Department helicopter.  </P></p>

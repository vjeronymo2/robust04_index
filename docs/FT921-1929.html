			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: High volume - Directors' Transactions THE stock market's cautious reaction to the Budget and the general election announcement elicited the expected response from directors: the volume of selling increased. Such a reaction may be due to concern about the possibility of higher tax on capital gains under a Labour administration, although that was not mentioned in John Smith's alternative Budget. Trevor Hemmings, the director in charge of the leisure division at Scottish &amp; Newcastle, has made sales totalling 3.6m shares. Scottish &amp; Newcastle shares have climbed steadily from around 300p in mid 1990. If further evidence of directors locking in substantial capital gains was required, it was provided by Domestic &amp; General, the insurance company. Martin Copley, the chairman and Howard James, the managing director, sold 1m and 100,000 shares respectively at 950p, in both cases reducing their holdings by around 40 per cent. Shares in Domestic &amp; General have risen almost fourfold since the beginning of 1990. We recorded unusually large purchases in BTR just after the announcement of final results. Alan Jackson, the Australian chief executive, bought 100,000 shares at 386.5p while Kathleen O'Donovan, the finance director bought 2,000 shares at the same price. Jackson also chose to exercise an option to buy a further 15,000 shares which he has retained.

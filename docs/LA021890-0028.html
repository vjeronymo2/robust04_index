			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> FORTY SOMETHING: Elektra Records has a big anniversary coming up this May --  its 40th! The label has several events planned for the celebration, most  notably a double album that features present-day Elektra artists covering hits  from earlier label mainstays. So far the lineup includes the Georgia Satellites  doing John Fogerty's "Another Saturday Night," Metallica doing Queen's "Stone  Cold Crazy," the Black Velvet Band doing Warren Zevon's "Werewolves of London,"  the Pixies doing Paul Butterfield's "Born in Chicago," Billy Bragg doing Love's  "Alone Again Or," Linda Ronstadt doing "The Blacksmith" by Cathy &amp; Carol  and (Are you sitting down?!) Faster Pussycat doing Carly Simon's "You're So  Vain." Other artists involved include the Cure, Anita Baker and Teddy  Pendergrast. . . . How's this for an unusual duo? Carla Olson and ex-Rolling  Stones guitarist Mick Taylor will be at the Roxy March 4, where the pair will  record a live album, for release later later this year.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Louise Hidalgo report: "Britain Slow To Cash In as Lebanon </F> Rises From Ruin"]    [Text] Nuhad Barudi, secretary general of Lebanon's  Council for Development and Reconstruction, the body responsible  for overseeing the country's revival after 17 years of civil  war, sweeps a hand over piles of tender documents on his desk.  "The game of markets is a game of risks," he says. "The  Italians, the French, the Germans, even the Scandinavians, have  decided Lebanon is worth the risk. The British seem to have  calculated differently. They must have faith in Lebanon's  resurrection if they are to compete."    It is a little over a year since Rafiq al-Hariri, the  billionaire businessman turned politician who is Lebanon's prime  minister, launched his blueprint for reconstruction after one of  the most destructive civil wars this century ended the country's  reputation as the Middle East's international market place and  financial centre. over 10 years, $12 billion of public money is  to be pumped into rebuilding Lebanon's shattered infrastructure,  from telecommunications, railways and the once famous port of  Beirut to restoring the capital's centre.    The French and Italians have been leading the race to win a  share of the spoils -- already, contracts worth more than $2.5  billion have been awarded or put out to tender -- but British  businesses have been noticeably more hesitant. "The British  seem to be more obsessed than their European counterparts with  Lebanon's recent past," said one Western diplomat. "Businessmen  who come here regard themselves as pioneers, telephoning home as  soon as they leave the airport."    The work ahead is certainly daunting. Beirut's commercial  centre, the old front line, is an eerie wasteland of rubble,  laced with mines and inhabited by Syrian labourers and  squatters. Security remains dicey, as recent bombings aimed at  Christians show.    Sir George Young, Britain's housing minister, returned at  the  weekend from his second mission to Lebanon in less than a year,  optimistic that there are great opportunities for British  companies, particularly in Beirut, where rebuilding of the city  centre, the key element of the reconstruction programmee, should  begin this year. "Britain's strength lies in putting together  the total package," he said. "Lebanon has a fairly developed  building industry of its own. British companies can assist in  project management and financing, in partnership with  Beirut-based businesses."    There are signs of increased interest, following the renewal  of UK export insurance guarantees to Lebanon this year, despite  some criticism that, at 50 million pounds, the cover is too low  when huge infrastructure projects are at stake. "We are  certainly seeing far more companies coming to look," said Jim  McCredie, of KPMG Peat Marwick, project managers to the  development and reconstruction council and one of only two  British consultancy firms to have won contracts. "But so far,  none has returned with a contract."    Rolls-Royce and John Brown Engineering have both  prequalified  for the tender to build two 450-megawatt power stations, as have  Taylor Woodrow and Tilbury Douglas for the $100 million contract  to construct an olympic-sized sports complex in Beirut.  Barclays has been among several banks discussing the  possibility of acting as depositors for British contracts and  Robert Fleming is considering opening a Beirut office. "There  are many opportunities for developing capital markets and  finance-raising in the region," said John Drysdale, a Robert  Fleming director, "and it is rare to find an area where the  American investment banks are not competing." (U.S. companies  are barred from doing business in Lebanon.)    Lebanese officials say that when British companies have bid,  they have pitched their prices too high. Trafalga House, one of  16 bidders for the contract to expand Beirut's airport, the  largest project so far put out to tender under the  reconstruction programme is unlikely to win against a joint  German-Lebanese bid almost $200 million cheaper, for example.  "The Lebanese are renowned for their business acumen and they  want to get their dollars' worth," Mr McCredie said.    Even among Lebanon loyalists, however, there are concerns  about the financing of the reconstruction programmee. So far,  the development and reconstruction council has managed to raise  $1.5 billion in grants, soft loans and commercial loans.    Of this, in spite of Mr al-Hariri's excellent Gulf  credentials (he is a citizen of Saudi Arabia, where he made his  fortune in the 1960's and 1970's), only $350 million has come  from Arab funds. Italy is the foremost foreign donor, having  signed protocols worth $450 million, while the "EC and the  European Investment Bank have committed $25 million and the  World Bank $175 million."    According to Mr Barudi, who used to be an economist with the  United Nations economic commission in New York, the government  aims to raise 36 percent of the nominal capital, less than $4  billion, in loans and aid. The rest will be financed by  internal borrowing and government revenue. However, in an  economy that last year registered a GDP of about $6 billion  (exact statistics are not available, another problem potential  investors face) such sums may be difficult to deliver. The  reconstruction plan envisages a budget surplus by 1996 and a  doubling of Lebanon's GDP by 2002, an aim described by one  Lebanese economist as "a nice idea but unlikely."    The development and reconstruction council and the  government  are relying on a flow of private investment -- projected at $21  billion -- and foreign aid as business confidence in Lebanon  grows. It is looking at tax exemptions for foreign companies  wishing to invest, and tax on big corporations has been cut to  10 percent.    Despite the difficulties, Western economists say Lebanon's  political and economic prospects have not looked as good since  early in the 1960's. Since Mr al-Hariri was appointed, the  Lebanese pound has gained more than 40 percent and a combination  of conservative economic policy and a stable political climate  has lured back nearly $2 billion of Lebanese savings that had  fled overseas, lifting bank deposits by more than a fifth. Last  year, capital inflows helped the economy to grow by 7 percent  and inflation fell below 10 percent for the first time in a  decade.    Oversubscription of the $650 million share issue in  Solidere,  the private-sector company set up to manage the reconstruction  of Beirut's city centre, has been hailed as proof of investors'  confidence in Lebanon's renewal.    But even if Mr al-Hariris ambitious reconstruction plans  succeed, Lebanon is unlikely to regain its pre-war reputation.  Then, Beirut's open port and liberal atmosphere made it an  ideal centre for doing business in the repressive but affluent  Middle East. Banks, in particular, thrived under Lebanon's  Swiss-style secrecy laws.    Now Lebanon is planning for a new era in which Beirut must  vie for business with Cairo, Dubai and Bahrain. Peace, if it  comes, will also mean competition with what a Lebanese columnist  has called the combined genius of the Israelis and the  Palestinians. Mr Barudi admits: "Lebanon will not be able to  play again the idle role it had in the 1950's and 1960's as the  Middle East's financial centre, but we are up to the challenge."</p>

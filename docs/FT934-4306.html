			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Clarke wants unity over welfare state: Rightwing ministers told to tone down rhetoric Mr Kenneth Clarke has told rightwing cabinet colleagues to tone down their rhetoric about the future of the welfare state to minimise the political backlash against planned cuts in unemployment and invalidity benefits. The chancellor's warning that ministers must speak with one voice on the future of welfare provision was endorsed by the full cabinet this week. It was followed by Mr Clarke's public declarations that the government was committed to reforming, not dismantling, the welfare state. Mr Clarke also won cabinet backing for his public statements that the government was committed to maintaining the state pension as a basic building block for retirement. He dismissed the idea floated by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, and by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, that people might be encouraged to opt out of state pensions. In Mr Clarke's view the government's drive to persuade people to make greater private provision for old age must not undermine the notion of the state pension as a bulwark against poverty. He told colleagues that many relatively poor and disadvantaged people could not find suitable substitutes for a basic state scheme. The chancellor has also rejected the idea that the government should aim for a permanent reduction in the size of the welfare state, which at present takes about 45 per cent of national income. He believes that his planned reduction in that share to about 40 per cent would leave it at the level necessary to sustain the welfare state over the long term. In spite of the determination of those on the right of the Tory party to promote family values, Mr Clarke has also given a clear signal that his future Budgets could see the disappearance of the married man's income tax allowance. The allowance, with mortgage interest relief, was cut to 15 per cent with effect from April 1995 in this week's Budget. Mr Clarke acknowledged that the Tories' manifesto pledge meant that mortgage interest relief would survive to the next parliament. He has pointed out that no similar pledge exists on the married man's allowance. He regards this as an anomaly left from the wish not to create 'losers' when independent taxation of husbands and wives was introduced.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Sen. Quentin Kopp of San Francisco said he plans to introduce a legislative  package to abolish the embattled state Board of Equalization and the Franchise  Tax Board and replace them with a Department of Revenue. Under Kopp's plan, the  new department would be overseen by a commissioner appointed by the governor.  Taxpayers wanting to fight the new department's rulings would be heard in a  special tax court. The Board of Equalization has been the subject of numerous  news reports aimed at showing that big taxpayers -- such as utilities and major  corporations -- get property tax breaks after making campaign contributions to  board members. One board member has also been tied to the three-year FBI sting  operation aimed at legislators. Paul Carpenter, a former senator, received a  $20,000 contribution in 1986 from a dummy company set up by FBI agents.  </P></p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Poor rail service leads to BR discounts on 11 lines COMMUTERS on 11 British Rail lines will qualify for the first season ticket discounts to be offered under the Passenger's Charter in the new year, it was announced yesterday. By far the worst performer is InterCity, which has five of its seven routes doing badly enough to trigger 5 per cent discounts for season ticket renewals. Network SouthEast, by contrast, is ending the year with only the Kent Coast line offering discounts, and Regional Railways is meeting targets on all but five of its 23 routes. One reason for Network SouthEast's success is that different targets were set for each of its 15 lines, according to the investment they had received, while InterCity has one performance target for all routes. InterCity says it is unrealistic for all its routes to perform to one standard because, like Network SouthEast's, some badly need investment and others are newly modernised. Its plea for differing targets is believed to have been rejected because that would have meant softening the target for most lines, and the government is not prepared to relax the charter. Three of InterCity's routes - Anglia, West Coast and Cross Country - are failing on punctuality and another two - Midland Main Line and Gatwick Express - on reliability. The performance of Network SouthEast's routes will prompt criticism that its targets are too soft. Next year's targets are likely to be much tougher. The services triggering discounts are Cross Country, East Midlands and Lincs, West Midlands, Cardiff Valleys, and North East.</p>

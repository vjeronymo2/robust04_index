			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: GPA to ask bondholders for debt repayment moratorium GPA GROUP is to ask formally its bondholders on Thursday for a moratorium on debt repayments and the need to swap more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in unsecured debt into equity. The troubled aircraft leasing company was yesterday granted a further temporary waiver of breaches on its banking covenants until May 17, when more than Dollars 50m of bonds mature. Lenders to the group, which has debts of more than Dollars 5.5bn, said a refusal by the bondholders to grant the moratorium on debt repayments would bring the option of examination, the Irish equivalent of administration, one step nearer. The bondholders meeting is being organised by Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the New York brokerage house, in the US, where most of the bondholders are based. DLJ has already held informal meetings with some of the unsecured debt holders. GPA's advisers believe the bonds have been resold many times since the original bond issue was launched last year. One of the group's main lenders said: 'The problem in organising bondholder talks is that by now dentists and doctors in Oregon hold GPA bonds.' However, DLJ is confident that it has identified the biggest bondholders, which include Cigna Corporation, Putnam Management, the mutual fund group, and IDS Financial Services. Some of the bondholders have had talks with Lazard Freres about their restructuring options, which centre on a debt for equity swap. While GPA's banks have all but given up hope of raising new equity through the convertible preference share issue, they are still hoping for a 'white knight' to emerge if the bondholders make concessions. In a separate move, GPA announced that it had already promoted Mr Patrick Blaney, chief operating officer, to its main board five weeks ago. Lenders to the group, which have been concerned that a split could occur between middle management, which is effectively running the business, and senior directors involved in the restructuring, welcomed the move.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tennessee states that it proposes to abandon two exchange services initiated pursuant to agreements dated December 6, 1962, and January 9, 1970. Tennessee indicates that it provided its service under its Rate Schedules X&hyph;16 and X&hyph;27, respectively. Tennessee further states that the services were authorized in Docket Nos. CP63&hyph;181 and CP70&hyph;175, respectively. It is indicated that on April 30, 1993, Tennessee requested that Koch advise whether the services authorized in Docket Nos. CP63&hyph;181 and CP70&hyph;175 were still required and that, if no response was received by May 13, 1993, Tennessee would proceed with abandonment. It is further indicated that Tennessee has received no such response, and, therefore, requests abandonment. Tennessee also states that there has been no activity under either service agreement since 1986. No facilities are proposed to be abandoned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  November 16, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

Columbia states that the sections proposed here for replacement were constructed in 1944 and 1948, using coupled pipeline and are the last coupled sections of Line A between Howell and Mt. Sterling Stations to be replaced. Columbia reports that recent examinations of Line A have confirmed general corrosion to the extent that replacement is required in order to maintain service to Columbia's existing customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage-unwinding depresses Nikkei PROFIT-TAKING and arbitrage-unwinding caused the Nikkei average to fall for the first time in four days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average, which rose 11.75 on Thursday to 17,959.76, closed down 379.07 at 17,580.69 yesterday, a fall of 1.5 per cent on the week. The index traded between 18,192.89 and 17,769.27 on Thursday. Yesterday, the Nikkei opened at the day's high of 17,916.90 and fell to the day's low of 17,490.06 in the afternoon. Volume declined to 300m shares from 380m on Thursday when overseas investors placed orders before Easter. The rise on Thursday was supported by 794 gainers, while 231 issues fell and 97 were unchanged. However, declines led advances yesterday by 690 to 289, with 155 issues unchanged. The Topix index fell 15.96 to 1,321.41 after Thursday's advance of 15.38 to 1,337.37. Large-lot index-linked sell orders by a leading Japanese broker depressed the market. Traders said that while investors were willing to buy stocks at lower levels, most refrained from buying around 18,000. 'A lot of domestic institutions see the near-term resistance level at 18,500,' said Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. High-technology issues, which were firm on Thursday on buying by pension funds and foreigners, fell back. Toshiba fell Y9 to Y630 and Hitachi retreated Y8 to Y832.

Meiji Milk Products fell Y43 to Y736 and Okamoto Industries lost Y20 to Y1,150. But Mitsubishi Gas Chemical rose Y20 to Y460 as buying interest was sparked by the development of a new anti-diabetic drug. Meiji Milk Products rose Y16 to Y744. Financials, which had rebounded on bargain-hunting and short-covering after sharp falls last week, declined. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y70 to Y1,800 and Fuji Bank fell Y20 to Y1,430. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 304.63 to 19,860.39 in volume of 15.5m shares. Investors were cautious after Thursday's rise of 303.28 to 20,165.02, in volume of 21.9m shares.

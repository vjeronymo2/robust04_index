			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Northrop criticises Grumman timetable A timetable proposed by Grumman for a rapid auction of the company has been sharply criticised by Northrop, one of two companies which have launched offers for the defence manufacturer. Grumman, which became a bid target earlier this month, called on Monday for Northrop and rival bidder Martin Marietta to submit their best bids for the company by 5pm on Thursday - a remarkably short takeover timetable by normal US standards. Grumman said this would prevent disruption to its business. However, Northrop, which has the higher of the two bids on the table, complained that Grumman was in essence proposing that Northrop bid against itself. Grumman agreed on March 7 to a friendly Dollars 1.9bn, or Dollars 55 a share, bid from Martin Marietta. However, Northrop, with which Grumman had held secret takeover talks, which ended in January, then launched a hostile Dollars 60-a-share bid, worth Dollars 2.04bn. In a letter to Grumman, Mr Kent Kresa, Northrop chairman, said the proposed timetable continued an 'unlevel playing field'. Northrop, he said, still faced a Dollars 50m 'lock-up' fee, which Grumman has agreed to pay Martin Marietta if another bidder wins control of Grumman. Further, since Northrop had the higher bid on the table, it was 'being asked to bid against a purely hypothetical price increase from Martin Marietta without any notice or knowledge of whether such an increase is in fact submitted'. Mr Kresa said while Grumman's board spoke of wanting 'free and open competitive bidding,' the proposed process was not open: 'It is not in the best interests of Grumman's stockholders to prematurely cut off potential bidding and potentially deprive stockholders of the opportunity to receive the maximum value for their shares.' Lockheed Aeronautical Systems, a division of Lockheed, said it plans to eliminate more than 2,000 jobs by the end of 1995, Reuter reports. The company said the job cuts would result from the pending completion of the P-3 aircraft programme and transition from producing the C-130H airlifter to the new generation C-130J.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 26 Mar (INA)--The newspaper AL-'IRAQ has  denounced U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent statements in  which he announced before the leaders of Jewish organizations in  the United States that he and his government consider Jerusalem  as the united capital of the Zionist entity.    In an article today, the paper notes: During his election  campaign, Clinton competed with his predecessor George Bush to  win Zionist votes by pledging never to forsake the Zionist  entity.    The paper points out that this pledge included Clinton's  readiness to support the Zionist entity by giving it loans and  grants to finance the establishment of settlements in the  occupied West Bank, and assurances that the Zionists will not  find a better friend at times of war or peace.    The paper reviews some of Clinton's actions after he won the  presidential elections. The most important of these actions are  his disavowal of the statement in which he expressed his  readiness to turn over a new leaf in relations with Iraq if Iraq  complied with the UN Security Council resolutions, his missile  attack on Baghdad, and the current scandals in which he and his  family are involved.    The paper notes that the campaign against Clinton's  reputation by the Republicans and certain Zionists is due to the  fact that these circles are not satisfied with the White House  President merely announcing openly that he supports the Zionist  entity, they want him to prove, through words and deeds, that he  will pursue this course, and show that any deviation from this  course will result in blackmailing and exposing him, making him  a lesson to others.</p>

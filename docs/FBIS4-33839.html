			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yolanda Gonzalez Gomez] </F>   [Text] Hermosillo, Sonora State, 8 Jun -- Federal Treasury  Police agents yesterday seized 10,000 rounds of small-arms  ammunition of various calibers at the 21-km marker checkpoint in  Nogales. The ammunition was apparently on its way to Guerrero  State.    The Nogales customs office indicated the seizure was made  after inspecting a Dodge van bearing Oregon State license  plates, from where the shipment destined for Guerrero came.  Hidden inside boxes containing second-hand clothing, tires, and  home appliances, the authorities discovered 7.62-mm, 9-mm, .38  super-, .380-, .22-, and .30-caliber cartridges. Javier Chavez  Rodriguez and Demetrio Goicochea Rodriguez were arrested and  turned over, along with the shipment, to the Federal  Prosecutor's Office in Nogales.</p>

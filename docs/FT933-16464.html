			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Letter: Inquiry needed into pensions policy Sir, Your editorial, 'Second best pensions' (June 30), was accurate in reporting that the National Association of Pension Funds is campaigning for a fundamental national debate on meeting the income needs of the elderly, but was completely wrong in suggesting that this association seeks simply to protect the status quo by claiming that 'the answer lies in the current approach to occupational pensions'. It is because the present system faces a number of problems that the NAPF feels the need for the debate to go far deeper. Changing social trends, such as the increase in part-time employment and greater job mobility, must also be reflected in the debate. The problems with state pensions include the decline in the basic state pension (relative to average earnings), pressure to reduce government expenditure and the impact of demographic changes. The problems facing occupational schemes include the growing burden of complex legislation, particularly in such areas as tax approval and contracting-out, which discourage employers from instituting new pension schemes and extending the membership of existing schemes. The problems facing personal pensions include the heavy initial charges and the all too high proportion of contracts which are confined to the minimum needed to contract out of Serps (state earnings-related pension scheme). It is clear there is a need for some form of partnership between state and private pensions and both occupational and personal pensions will have a critical role in that partnership. While the NAPF will itself be consulting a wide range of other interested parties, we hope the debate will lead to an independent inquiry into retirement income policy ultimately resulting in a political consensus. The issues are too important to be determined by partisan interests and too long term to be dominated by short-term political considerations.

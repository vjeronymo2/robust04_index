			<p>BFN     [Text] The opposition has sharply reacted to the prime  minister's remarks about a possible war with Syria if a  territorial arrangement is not attained with it.    The Likud says that the prime minister's remarks reflect a  lack of wisdom and signal to the Syrians that Israel is  capitulating to their threats and is willing to cede security  assets. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the Likud is  demanding that Mr. Rabin submit to the Knesset all the proposals  that have been relayed to the Syrians recently.    Tzomet says that the prime minister is sapping Israel's  resistance. Moledet says that Mr. Rabin, who has to date talked  about peace, is now speaking about war, which is a clear sign of  his failure.</p>

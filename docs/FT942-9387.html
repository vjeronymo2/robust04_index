			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Devaluation raises questions about Mexico  -The Emerging Investor A poor first quarter performance by large Mexican companies, caused primarily by an 8.6 per cent devaluation of the peso, has foreign investors re-evaluating the creditworthiness of the country's private sector. It has also prompted borrowers to search for new hedging instruments in case of a further fall in the currency's value. Over the past couple of years, Mexican companies have borrowed some Dollars 20bn to take advantage of dollar interest rates being well below those in pesos. In the first quarter of 1994 they paid for it. Exchange rate losses on this debt, reflecting the increased cost of repayment, approached Dollars 1bn. Telmex, Cemex, Aeromexico and other companies were forced to take charges against earnings of Dollars 100m or more. Companies suffered such large losses because they were not active in Mexico's meagre foreign exchange coverage market, where rates are expensive and contracts short. One solution would be for the Banco de Mexico, the central bank, to offer the instruments necessary for the development of a futures market for the peso, allowing companies to hedge their dollar debt with a minimum of fuss. However a return of the peso to the futures market would require the central bank to issue long-term fixed-rate government debt in pesos. At the moment two-year variable-rate notes are the longest the bank offers. In addition, Mr Miguel Mancera, governor of Banco de Mexico, is said to oppose a futures market for fear of losing control over the exchange rate to speculators. However, if the central bank does not move quickly, an offshore parallel peso futures market may develop. For some time, a few companies have been using the cheap dollars lent to them by foreigners for speculative rather than investment purposes. Some stop-gap hedging techniques are beginning to emerge. Tribasa, a construction company, has over-collateralised the toll roads it has recently securitised, placing between 8 per cent and 10 per cent of bond proceeds in offshore dollar accounts, to be used in case of a devaluation. Other companies, such as Grupo Carso, decided to convert a significant portion of their dollar loans to peso debt when domestic rates fell below 9 per cent in February. The arrival of foreign banks to the peso lending market, scheduled for this summer, is also likely to bring new tools for corporate treasurers. One US banker said that a recently approved trade line in dollars was turned down by the soliciting company. 'Instead they want us to teach them how to hedge their current dollar obligations.' Potential investors and lenders say that they are beginning to change the focus of their credit analysis of Mexican companies, with the size of current dollar obligations together with potential foreign exchange earnings becoming more important than overall debt-to-equity ratios. 'The price-driven market is probably over, with fundamental credit analysis replacing spread over treasury as the defining criteria,' said Ms Rebecca Miller of Bear Sterns. 'It's time to be sticking to the knitting.' While companies argue that their capital assets, which increase in value with each fall of the peso, are enough to guarantee their dollar loans, foreign lenders are increasingly seeking to link new capital to actual dollar income. 'We don't lend working capital,' said one US banker in explaining why his bank was unlikely to suffer from the recent devaluation. 'Dollar loans must equal dollar revenues. More than being scared by this first quarter, we remember 1982.' Mexico's shortage of foreign exchange in 1982 presaged the 1980s debt crisis. Even share offerings are being scrutinised for their ability to generate non-peso revenue. Managers handling a recent Dollars 130m public offering of Gruma, Mexico's largest tortilla maker, say that they were only able to get the price they wanted after assuring investors that three-quarters of the revenue would be destined for expansion projects outside Mexico. There is little doubt that Mexican companies, paying local lending rates of about 20 per cent, are still in the market for foreign debt, even in these times of higher risk. 'We need dollars. It is the only way to compete,' said Enrique Flores of Alfa, the steel and petrochemical conglomerate. He was undaunted by first quarter exchange write down of more than Dollars 100m and an overall loss of Dollars 61m. 'This quarter reminded us that we have to watch our proportion (of dollar debt) and make sure we earn some dollars from each new capital investment. But we are still in the market.' Others, if they have sufficient cash in the bank, are likely to try to ride out the instability, not forcing any new dollar issues until cost estimations can be properly determined. For many, it may be the most wise move until the exchange market volatility subsides.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Ten best performing stocks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Friday    Week on   week change Stock                      Country     close    dollars        %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Doktas                     Turkey     0.4450     0.1725     63.31 CSN                        Brazil     0.0238     0.0047     24.44 Usinimas                   Brazil     0.0009     0.0001     17.99 Daewoo Heavy Industries    S Korea   17.4927     2.3853     15.79 Lucky                      S Korea   22.3311     2.7658     14.14 Genting                    Malaysia  12.0713     1.4733    13.990 TPI Polene                 Thailand   6.7736     0.7804     13.02 Bagfas                     Turkey     0.1358     0.0155     12.85 CP Feedmill              Thailand   6.5360     0.6221     10.52 Krisda Mahanakorn          Thailand   3.0897     0.2519      8.88  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Ricardo Montenegro, president of the Chamber of Commerce and  Industries, noted, however, that this reduction might affect  several national reconstruction projects which depend on foreign  aid. Montenegro believes that during the past year our country  achieved substantial economic growth. Therefore, we are more  likely to become independent of foreign aid. This economic  growth will increase year after year and foreign aid, such as  that from the United States, will become dispensable.    [Begin Montenegro recording] We are pleased about this. We  had been told that the aid would be suspended gradually. It is  becoming a reality. We have always believed and felt that as  Salvadorans we should become self-sufficient and stop depending  on friendly countries. [end recording]    This year the U.S. Government might reduce aid to the  country  from $230 million to $94 million, which is 70 percent. Although  the Chamber of Commerce and Industries views this measure with  good eyes, it is anticipated that some projects to be carried  out in keeping with the national reconstruction plan may  experience some delay.    [Begin Montenegro recording] It could be that some projects,  especially those involving reconstruction, might be delayed if  the aid is cut definitely or in large amounts. We are certain  that the U.S. Government is quite aware of the country's  situation. We don't think they will make substantial aid cuts.  [end recording]</p>

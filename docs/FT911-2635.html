			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / International Company News: Dyno profit is slashed by more than half DYNO INDUSTRIER, the Norwegian chemicals and explosives group, saw first-quarter profits, before year-end adjustments, more than halved to NKr46m (Dollars 6.7m) from NKr94m a year earlier. Dyno said the main causes of the weak result were lower profits from stock market trading and increased development costs for one of its high-technology businesses. The Gulf war and US recession also had an impact on the result, it added. Group turnover increased to NKr1.84bn from NKr1.64bn, while operating expenses, before depreciation, rose to NKr1.64bn from NKr1.44bn. The explosives division saw operating profit fall to NKr56m from NKr65m. Dyno warned that its Australian company, which was being restructured, was still operating at a loss, although less than that of last year. The chemicals division suffered a fall in operating profit to NKr35m from NKr50m on turnover up to NKr534m from NKr448m, mainly because of acquisitions. The plastics division saw no change in operating profit of NKr25m, but turnover rose to NKr434m from NKr335m, also because of acquisitions. Dyno forecast an increase in demand and falling prices for most raw materials in 1991.</p>

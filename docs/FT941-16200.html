			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAT pressured Shares in tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries gave up 8 to 555p, in above average trade of 8.2m shares, after Hoare Govett reiterated its negative stance. But the broker denied market talk that it had also downgraded profit expectations. Urging investors to sell the stock, Hoare said: 'Negative cash flow in 1994 and 1995 is likely to impede significant dividend progression.' Analysts at SG Warburg were also reported to have advised investors to sell the stock. The retreat came as the group announced it had merged its two UK based asset management operations to form Threadneedle Asset Management. Conglomerate Tomkins finished a net 3 lighter at 259p, having surrendered an earlier gain that took it to the day's peak of 274p following the release of better than expected first-half figures. Interim profits came in at Pounds 93.8m, around Pounds 5m ahead of forecasts, and analysts quickly moved to make modest upgrades to their full year expectations. However, researchers said the post-results meeting with management was 'unconvincing' and that doubts about the RHM acquisition remain. Volume had reached 7.2m shares by the close. Last week's strong showing by the leisure sector continued, although Rank Organisation was sent into reverse by a combination of profit-taking and nervousness ahead of results due on Thursday. The stock retreated from Friday's all-time high to close 21 down at 1013p. Worries in the market over Rank's full-year figures on Thursday particularly centred around the contribution from the Rank Xerox division. Analysts are forecasting profits of some Pounds 265m. Lesiure and property group Ladbroke was again a feature as its run of positive news continued. After last week's executive changes and flurry of broker recommendations, the company yesterday unveiled its bid for the National Lottery. Analysts were also digesting weekend press reports of further restructuring moves at the group and the possibility of a name change. The stockclimbed 6 to 200p in another hefty day's turnover of 17m shares. Stakis rose 6 to 71p as Hoare Govett recommended the shares amid weekend press reports that the hotel group would report profits in excess of Pounds 10m today. Hoare is looking for Pounds 10.8m and expects a confident trading statement. Jewellery retailer Signet Group soothed investor nerves with a positive trading statement and the shares moved forward 3 1/2 to 31p. A month ago, worries over pre-Christmas trading at the former Ratners chain pushed the shares down to half their current level. Signet said December like-for-like sales were 11 per cent higher than last year and forecast a return to profitability for 1994, compared with a loss of Pounds 40.1m last year. Among other stores groups expected to make trading statements this week, Laura Ashley added 6 at 78p, while Storehouse dipped 5 to 242p. Speculation that Kingfisher will still be pushed into commenting on its Christmas sales continued, although the shares rebounded from last week's mauling to close 8 up at 737p. There was also talk that a securities house, believed to be Smith New Court, had downgraded its profits forecast. Kingfisher, which owns the Comet electrical retail chain, was undermined by a profits warning last week from Dixons. The latter eased a penny to 243p. Oil shares, among the market's best performers last week, were hit by a wave of selling pressure as dealers adopted the view that an emergency meeting of Opec members later this month is now unlikely. The latest stories were accompanied by a steep decline in crude oil prices, which fell around 30 cents a barrel. The next Opec meeting is scheduled for March 25. The influential Middle East Economic Survey said such a meeting is unlikely. BP slipped 4 1/2 to 368p in turnover of 6m shares, while Shell Transport lost 3 1/2 to 739p on 2.9m. Burmah Castrol, a strong performer last week after a broker recommendation, retreated 15 to 848p. In the exploration and production sub-sector, Lasmo's recent strong rally was halted, the shares receding 5 to 123p. Premier Consolidated attracted heavy activity, most of which was accounted for by two trades, with one institution thought to have sold a block of 4.6m shares at 21p apiece. A block of 3m was said to have been sold on at 21 1/4 p a share. TSB, with preliminary results scheduled for Thursday, put on 5 at 259p. Hints that a US institution had sold a block of 200,000 Willis Corroon ADRs into London, equivalent to 1m shares, saw Willis shares slip 4 1/2 to 238 1/2 p.</p>

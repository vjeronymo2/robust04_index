			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Emap expands via Pounds 4m purchase EMAP, the publishing and exhibitions group, has acquired Trenton, an exhibition company and another small slice of the empire of the late Mr Robert Max-well. Having recently paid Pounds 21.5m for most of the business magazines published by Maxwell Business Communications, Emap spent a further Pounds 4m for Trenton. It organises four main national trade fairs in heating and ventilation, packaging, fluids, and commercial fishing. In most cases the exhibitions link up with business magazines. Last week Reed Exhibition Companies bought Evan Steadman Communications, another Maxwell subsidiary, which organises exhibitions in the industrial, scientific, electronic and antiques sectors. The sale of the two exhibition companies means that virtually all of Maxwell Business Communications has now been successfully sold by Price Waterhouse, the administrator to Maxwell Communication Corporation. Mr Alan Barrett, the Price Waterhouse partner responsible for disposing of MBC, said yesterday that a gross total of Pounds 40m had been raised by the disposals, with all businesses continuing to operate and only a handful of redundancies. 'I am very pleased at the outcome,' Mr Barrett said. Emap also announced that it had increased its stake in Kiss FM, the London commercial radio station, from 59 per cent to 94 per cent. Emap now has 75 per cent of the voting rights in the station which claims a regular audience of 1.2m in London, particularly in the 15-24 age group.</p>

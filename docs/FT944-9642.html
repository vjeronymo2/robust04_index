			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Retailers report sales fall Retailers reported a drop in annual sales volumes last month for the first time since December 1992, according to the latest Confederation of British Industry survey of distributive trades, published today. The weakness detected in the survey comes as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, prepares his Budget, which is set to impose already announced tax increases on UK consumers. It also reflects the first full shopping month since UK interest rates were increased by a half a percentage point in September. Official retail sales figures for October will be published on Thursday. While retailing was lacklustre, the wholesaling sector continued to be strong in October, reporting the fastest growth since September 1987. But motor sales remained depressed, with annual sales volumes falling at their sharpest rate since July 1992. The CBI survey found that more retailers reported a fall in sales volumes in October than reported an increase. The negative balance of three percentage points compares with a positive balance of 28 points in September. October sales also fell well short of retailers' expectations. In the CBI's September survey, a positive balance of 27 percentage points of retailers had expected an increase over the next month. The survey's retailing reports over the past three months have been volatile, but the trend continues to show modest, but slowing, growth in sales volumes. Over the three months to July the average positive balance was 17 points; over the three months to October the average balance was nine points. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive traders survey panel, said: 'The levelling off in high-street sales in October is typical of the uneven pattern in sales experienced by most retailers this year. It shows the uncertain trading conditions that retailers still face.' The strongest sectors over the year to October were footwear and leather, durable household goods and off licences. There were sharp declines at furniture and carpet stores, specialist food outlets and chemists. Some sectors have produced volatile results. Clothing stores moved from a positive balance of 59 percentage points in September to a negative balance of five points in October. Furniture and carpet stores moved from plus 60 points to minus 59 points over the same period. The recent divergent performances of the wholesaling and retailing industries differs sharply from the late 1980s, when survey data from the two sectors was closely correlated. Since then wholesalers have built up new markets with customers such as government departments and hotels. A balance of 65 per cent of wholesalers reported annual increases in volumes in October, compared with 55 per cent in September. Unlike the retail sector, reported sales volumes have repeatedly been ahead of expectations. In the motor trade a balance of 31 per cent of dealers reported a fall in sales volumes. This was much worse than the negative balance of 4 per cent in September and compared badly with traders' expectations.</p>

On that occasion, Lieutenant General  Raoul Cedras launched a call for a national debate, the only  means of achieving the union necessary for the rebirth of our  homeland. Gen. Cedras would like this national debate to be an  occasion for the nation to ask itself about itself, about its  future, and to look for solutions to the structural problems  that hinder social evolution and the development of republican  institutions.    The commander in chief of the Haitian Army explained that to  achieve this union, we must, just as the fathers of our  independence did, all decide to unite under one banner. Gen.  Cedras explained that Haitians must complete their dream of  liberty, equality, justice, and fraternity as projected by our  ancestors.    With regard to the current crisis, Gen. Cedras asserted that  the months of suffering have taught us to know ourselves and to  evaluate the men and women of this country. They have taught us  in a very difficult way what meaningless weight [words  indistinct] our lives as men and women, and our future as a  people, before the incomprehensible special interests of a few.</p>

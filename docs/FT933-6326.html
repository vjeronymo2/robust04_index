			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Mail order houses should explain reasons for poor service (1) Sir, Further to Mr Jonathan Price's letter ('Why is mail order so slow?', August 21/22), one explanation could be that some companies enjoy using Mr Price's money for 28 days or longer. Also, they may await orders before ordering stock from suppliers, thus passing on much of their business risk to the manufacturers, who then have to wait for their money. Mail order houses must weigh the danger of being over-dependent on suppliers far away. Shipping in urgent stock by air is risky and costly. Martin E Simons, 24 Granard Avenue, London SW15 6HJ</p>

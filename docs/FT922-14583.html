			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Arts: Eileen Gray 'Eileen Gray' continues at the Design Museum, Butlers Wharf, SE1, until July 5. Industrial perforated metal mesh is the stuff of a folding screen; a standing light brazenly bares an undisguised tungsten tube; chairs contrast gleaming chrome with matt black leather. It is difficult to appreciate that most of the Eileen Gray furniture on show at the Design Museum was conceived before 1930. It is revealing that much of it was made more or less yesterday. Not long before her death in 1976, aged 98, Eileen Gray was 'rediscovered'. 'It is odd how no one has paid homage to Eileen Gray for 30 years: considering that the last person to do so was Le Corbusier,' the architect Joseph Rykwert wrote in Domus in 1968. Exhibitions of her work - not only of furniture, furnishings and fittings, but of her architectural projects, too  -were staged in Vienna, London, Paris, and toured the US. At the beginning of the Seventies, her early, Art Deco lacquer furniture found fabulous prices at auction. By the end of the decade, her minimalist 'design classics' were being reproduced in London by Zeff Aram and in Paris by Andree Putman. The woman who had been dismissed as a mere decorator was hailed as a pioneer of Modern design. The current small 'Designer Profile', tucked into a corner of the cavernous Design Museum, tells us little that we did not already know and omits a great deal. Only the generously proportioned Lota Sofa, with its plump salmon pink canvas cushions and silky black and cinnabar lacquer side box units, alludes to her early Paris interiors. It is hard to imagine it as part of a bizarre, opulent scheme - informed by Cubist and African art - of exotic woods, lustrous lacquers, imaginative lighting effects, abstract rugs, and animal skins. Like so many of her pieces, it seems hauntingly contemporary. Her early work is in danger of being dismissed because it was decorative. The daughter of aristocratic Irish parents, Gray had learnt the technique of oriental lacquer at a workshop in Soho while studying at the Slade in 1898. She moved to Paris in 1902, and 20 years later opened a shop, Jean Desert, as an outlet for the lacquer screens, furniture, lamps, divans, mirrors and rugs made in her two workshops. She was patronised by the couturier and connoisseur Jacques Doucet, and modiste Suzanne Talbot. Coco Chanel commissioned the striped rug on show. Her schemes began to attract the attention of avant-garde designers and architects: JJP Oud of the Dutch de Stijl group; Le Corbusier; and the Romanian architectural critic Jean Badovici. Badovici encouraged her to take up architecture and in 1926 they collaborated on her first house, E-1027, in Roquebrune in the South of France. Practically everything in it was made in her workshops or to her specification. Completed in 1929, and much admired, it prompted Gray to close down Jean Desert and concentrate on architectural projects. She was to build only two houses, both for herself. None of her other progressive schemes were realised, apart from the Paris studio designed for Badovici which made ingenious use of restricted space. With their furniture, furnishings, fixtures and fittings - even down to an aluminium junction box  -E-1027 and her second home, Tempe a Pailla, near Menton (later sold to Graham Sutherland), are near perfect expressions of the functional, informal small house. Far from representing a break with her previous designs and interiors, these highly individual schemes reflect a honing of ideas and of language, now unequivocally Modernist. The Gesamtkunstwerk of E-1027 had its roots in earlier interiors, as did her experimention with unusual industrial materials. A row of tubular steel chairs of the 1920s by Marcel Breuer, Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier - icons of the Modern Movement - make the point that Gray was also experimenting with similar materials and new construction techniques. There is a vestigial luxury too. The pneumatic Bibendum Chair, a fine example of the transition of an idea from the factory floor to the sitting room, was supremely comfortable as well as pleasing to the eye, light, inexpensive and easy to clean. What is so striking about Gray's brand of rationalism is its humanity. She never forgot that her 'units' were homes. Colour was reduced to monochromes but rich textures remained. Much of what is exhibited is of enduring appeal. There is the padded leather Transat chair slung within a lacquered frame, copied by Frank Stella for his own use. A bold lacquer screen is a chequerboard of black blocks and voids that defines space and is penetrated by it. The elegant, ocean-linerish S-Bend Chair made for outdoor use, neatly folds for storage. An occasional table is devised so that its base can slide under a bed or armchair; a corner of a bathroom mirror pivots to suit the user. Gray's designs for flexible, multi-functional furniture, various space-saving storage units, and for prefabricated 'Tube' houses, reflect the prevailing concern to come to terms with the realities of post war life and provide low-cost, compact and functional housing. Similarly, the reappraisal of her work in the past two decades reveals the ultimate sterility of Modernism if divorced from the needs of human beings, in mind, body and spirit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Three leaders of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC) called today for efforts to  protect farmers' interests and arouse their initiative.    The leaders of the CPPCC, known as the leading think-tank in  China, agreed that the question of agriculture was essential to  the success of China's modernization drive.    Addressing a meeting of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC  National Committee, they outlined a number of deep-rooted  problems in China's farming sector and the rural economy.    These included a slow rise in farmers' incomes, the widening  of earnings between urban and rural residents and between  coastal areas and land-locked interior areas, and indications of  possible shortages of major farm products, such as grain,  cotton, cooking oil and sugar.    Yang Rudai, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,  said that the slow increase in farmers' incomes was due  primarily to the ever-rising financial burdens of farmers and  excessive rises in farming-related goods, including fertilizers,  fuel and pesticides.    He said: "Without rural growth and the prosperity of  farmers, it would be impossible for China to expand its economy.  Without rural stability, it would be impossible for China to  enjoy stability.    "For this reason, each reform measure we plan to take must  not be at the expense of the interests of more than 800 million  farmers," he told the meeting.    Qian Zhengying, another vice-chairman of the CPPCC National  Committee, stressed the importance of reinforcing agriculture as  the foundation of the country's economy, in line with the needs  of modernization and a market economy.    She proposed that in drawing up economic development plans,  the government should set appropriate growth rates both for  industrial and agricultural production.    Agriculture should account for seven or eight percent of the  government's investments in fixed assets, she said, adding that  funding for agricultural research should rise to one percent of  agricultural production value.    To this end, the government should earmark an extra 10  billion yuan a year for agricultural infrastructure and  research, and farm- related industries.    Wang Yuzhao, a Standing Committee member of the CPPCC  National Committee, said that by purely relying on accumulation  by farmers, it would be impossible for China to achieve  sustained agricultural growth and modernize agriculture.    Therefore, the government should institute a system in  support of all links of agriculture, such as production,  construction, techniques and circulation, he noted.    He proposed that the government introduce a system to  protect  prices of farm and sideline products by setting the minimum and  maximum prices.    "I think we should gradually introduce a system under which  prices of grain, cotton and other major farm and sideline  products will be formed in a rational manner," he said.    The government should also establish farm price risk-related  funds and a grain reserve system, he added.</p>

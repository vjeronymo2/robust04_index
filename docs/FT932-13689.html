			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Observer: Pounded down Two cheers, perhaps, are due to whichever Whitehall whizz-kid had the idea of binning Britain's old Pounds 1 notes in favour of coins, which were introduced 10 years ago yesterday. Although twice as expensive to produce, the hard stuff withstands the wear and tear of circulation for more than 50 times longer, with an official life expectancy of 40 years. Alas, whether the increased longevity is worthwhile is another question. Valuing the coin at the full 100p on its introduction, the Central Statistical Office says that its purchasing power 10 years later is only 61p. If the buying power continues to fall at the same compound rate, by the time a 1983 coin wears out in 2023, its worth will be less than 14p.</p>

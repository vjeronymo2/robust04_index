			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT TO REOPEN S.F. OFFICES  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court, which was forced to abandon its San Francisco  headquarters because of damage from the quake, announced Monday that it will  resume operations this morning.  </P> <P> One portion of the court building, constructed in 1917, remains too dangerous  to be used and will remain closed, according to Lynn Holton, a court  spokeswoman. The the other half, built in 1957, has been inspected and judged  safe and will serve as the base of operations at least temporarily, she said.  </P></p>

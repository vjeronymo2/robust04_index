			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] At the Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet  session discussion continued on articles of the draft new  constitution of Belarus. Agreement was reached that proposals  for making amendments to the Constitution may be considered by  the Supreme Soviet only in the event of their initiators being  the president, 40 people's deputies, or 150,000 citizens of the  Republic. The deputies also voted unanimously in favor of an  article providing for equal elections, in which all voters have  an identical number of votes and an approximately equal number  of citizens live in each constituency. [passage omitted]    Thus, the new Constitution of the Republic of Belarus was  passed article by article. However, an attempt to pass, in its  first reading, a draft law on the introduction of the  Constitution into operation did not obtain the support of the  majority of deputies.    A draft law on the national archives was passed in its first  reading, and amendments and changes to the civil code of the  Republic of Belarus were considered. With this the session  adjourned its work until 15 March.</p>

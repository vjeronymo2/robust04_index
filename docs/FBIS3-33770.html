He emphasized that the ministry  provides medical and social care to all policemen and to the  families of martyred policemen. He noted in this regard that  two hospitals had been built in Asyut and Tanta to offer  services to policemen in the Delta and Upper Egypt regions.    Al-Alfi pointed out that the current security strategy seeks  to modernize the police department by supplying it with modern  equipment, weapons, and technology, step up security patrols,  and lift the morale of policemen.    The minister denied that the Palestinian organization Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] is involved in terrorism in Egypt.  He noted that Palestinian defendant Samir Isma'il Salih joined  the terrorists in his personal capacity and that he is not  connected with Hamas.    Al-Alfi stressed that efforts are being made to extradite  the  remaining terrorists abroad, adding that so far 23 terrorists  have been repatriated following intensive contacts with the  countries they were in.</p>

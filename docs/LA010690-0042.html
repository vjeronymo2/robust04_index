			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEWITZKY'S DECADE  </P> <P> Notwithstanding limitations of space, both Lewis Segal's and Martin  Bernheimer's Dec. 26 retrospectives on dance in the '80s made a serious  omission.  </P> <P> Bella Lewitzky's accomplishments in the '80s (20th company anniversary,  acclaimed international premieres, etc.) are noteworthy for dance historians,  but L.A.'s media particularly should recognize -- indeed, highlight her  continued success these 10 years.  </P> <P> JOHN KEEPERS and AMY ERNST, Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

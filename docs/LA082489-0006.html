			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSEUM AND DON MUCHMORE  </P> <P> Your article on conflict at the California Museum of Science and Industry  failed to make clear just how important the contribution of the California  Museum Foundation is to the quality of the institution. Virtually all of the  resources for the renaissance of the outdated, run-down museum came from the  fund-raising of the foundation under the leadership of Muchmore. It confirms  our lowest expectations of state bureaucrats that they should be so  antagonistic to a group of volunteers who have produced huge donations to  support a state institution.  </P> <P> I worked for Don Muchmore as chief curator from 1982 through 1987, during its  expansion and renovation into a state-of-the-art science center. He brought an  energetic, goal-driven style into a somnolent bureaucracy. Your description of  him as "imperious" and making "unilateral decisions" does not jibe with the  experience of the professionals he empowered with extensive authority and  opportunity during the rebuilding of the museum.  </P> <P> Muchmore and the California Museum Foundation deserve gratitude, rather than  antagonism, from the state for the renaissance of the museum. The efforts of  the bureaucrats to destroy the foundation are likely to return the museum to  the dreary embarrassment it used to be.  </P> <P> JAY ROUNDS  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / M and S profits rise 1.3%: Group damps hopes of imminent recovery MARKS and Spencer reported a 1.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits last year as it successfully defended its operating margins in severe trading conditions but damped immediate expectations of a consumer-led recovery. The international clothing and food group warned it was still experiencing 'no upturn in UK consumer spending' and plans to close 25 more stores at its loss-making Canadian operations by the end of January. In the year to March 31, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 615.5m to Pounds 623.5m on sales 2 per cent higher at Pounds 6.36bn. Store sales in the UK fell 0.6 per cent to Pounds 4.92bn as the company lost market share due to discounting by competitors. However, Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman and chief executive, said M and S had refused to buy extra sales by cutting prices and was in a strong position to attack when confidence recovered. 'The biggest difference between us and our competitors is that we have sold goods at full price and full margin. Their attempts to build their sales have been at the expense of their profitability,' he said. M and S pre-tax figures were held back by exceptional costs of Pounds 46.9m (Pounds 16m) relating to M and S's voluntary redundancy programme in the UK and rationalisation of its Canadian operations. Stripped of these, pre-tax profits advanced 6.2 per cent to Pounds 670.4m as M and S reined in costs, made productivity gains and lifted operating margins from 11 per cent to 11.7 per cent. Mainland Europe showed good growth and the up-market Brooks Brothers chain in the US and Japan improved its profitability. But Kings Super Markets in the US and the group's three Canadian businesses again disappointed. After swallowing an extraordinary charge of Pounds 29.8m relating to the goodwill write-off and loss on the anticipated disposal of its Canadian Peoples Division, M and S reported a slight rise in earnings per share to 14.8p from 14.7p. A proposed final dividend of 5p will lift the annual pay-out by 6.4 per cent to 7.1p. The company's shares rose 1p to 331p. Mr Mark Husson, retailing analyst at Warburg Securities, said: 'This result must qualify as a rabbit out of a hat. M and S could not buck the trend in terms of absolute demand but it could improve its performance because of its accelerated productivity growth.'

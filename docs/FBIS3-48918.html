			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After a complex and comprehensive inspection, the  State Receiving Committee signed Act 16 with which the  1000-megawatt sixth reactor of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant  has been accepted as suitable for regular functioning.    The sixth reactor is now functioning at full capacity. The  other two reactors -- the second and the fourth -- are also  functioning at full capacity. The capacity of the 440-megawatt  first reactor is constantly being increased on the basis of  tests that are being constantly conducted. At the beginning of  the week, that reactor was connected to the country's power grid.    The 1000-megawatt fifth reactor has been switched off for  repairs and refueling. It is expected that this reactor will be  connected to the power grid by the end of January 1994.</p>

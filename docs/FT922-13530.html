			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Payroll group sold after tax payments go astray JAPANESE banks, already reeling as the Japanese economy falters, are among 500 companies in the UK facing a total loss of up to Pounds 20m following the discovery that PAYE and national insurance payments have gone astray on the way to the Inland Revenue. The financial institutions, including Fuji International and Yamaichi International, were all clients of Payroll Services, a private company that handled about Pounds 30m a month in payroll, PAYE and NI payments. Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, has been appointed to act as provisional liquidator at Payroll Services, and its parent, Wren Group, after the Inland Revenue discovered one of the institutions was behind on its tax payments. The UK's largest banks, which have their own payroll departments, are not believed to be involved. But Payroll Services' client list reads like a Who's Who of international banking. Payroll Services also paid the salaries of the London-based crews of Japan Air Lines, which estimates it will have to pay Pounds 250,000 again to the Inland Revenue to cover missing PAYE and NI contributions. This amount was described by one client, who wished to remain anonymous, as 'small fry' compared with the losses facing other companies. Industrial Bank of Japan said last night it had not suffered any financial damage, having stopped using Payroll Services for making payments last November. Visa International, one of Payroll Services' biggest clients, and Nippon Credit International, said they had stopped using Payroll Services last year. Another large Japanese bank had made credit checks on Payroll Services and was about to segregate its payments. However, Payroll Services failed before a trustee account could be set up. The Inland Revenue has agreed to give Payroll Services' clients a moratorium of a few weeks on paying the missing taxes while Touche Ross establishes how much is missing. The Inland Revenue has made clear, however, that in such cases it still looks to the banks and companies for payment of the taxes. The Pounds 20m believed to be missing is an initial estimate and sources close to the company believe it could be much higher. Touche Ross is investigating all the circumstances surrounding its appointment and has reached no conclusions on why the money has gone missing. Touche Ross said all the directors of Wren Group and Payroll Services had left the company. Mr Terence Wright, who holds all but one of Payroll Services' 5,000 shares, could not be contacted. Yesterday, Touche Ross said a consortium of Payroll Services' clients had bought its goodwill and equipment for a sum understood to be about Pounds 1m.</p>

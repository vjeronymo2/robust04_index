			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): White mineral blocks the sun For those who spend their summer holidays worrying whether the sun is damaging their skin, Masta, part of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has developed a sunblock which, it believes, has advantages over existing cosmetic creams. The lotion, a healthcare rather than a cosmetic preparation, contains the mineral titanium dioxide. It provides a sun protection factor of 15 against UVA and UVB rays. Titanium dioxide provides the white pigment in paint. In the adult formulation of the lotion the whitening is minimised, but for children it is retained to indicate whether the child's skin has been completely covered. Masta: UK, 071 631 4408.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> More than 200 Soviet Muslims marched from a mosque through Tashkent, capital of  Uzbekistan, to press the government to take up their religious demands, the  Soviet news agency Tass reported. It said the demonstrators from the Central  Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan demanded state  intervention in certain religious matters. Tass said Uzbekistan Premier Gayrat  K. Kadyrov told 25 of the demonstrators their demands should be addressed by  the clergy, not the government. Regional religious leaders are to discuss the  demands Monday, Tass said.  </P></p>

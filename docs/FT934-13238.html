			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Two further Lloyd's trusts PATHFINDER prospectuses for two investment trusts for the Lloyd's insurance market backed by Samuel Montagu and SG Warburg were published yesterday. Names voted on Wednesday in favour of new rules permitting Lloyd's to draw capital from corporate members. New London Capital, which is sponsored by SG Warburg, aims to raise Pounds 160m, mainly from institutions. Advised by Chartwell Advisers, a subsidiary of Chartwell Re, a London reinsurance company, it will focus on about 20 separate syndicates, targeting specific sectors of the Lloyd's market. London Insurance Market Investment Trust will be the largest of the new corporate members. It is sponsored by Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank, and James Capel and aims to raise about Pounds 280m, although this could be increased to Pounds 300m. It is expected that some Pounds 70m of this amount will come from retail investors, the remainder having been conditionally placed with institutions. Applications will be for a minimum of 1,000 shares at an offer price of Pounds 100 per share. Limit says that it has obtained binding commitments from 98 syndicates for the provision of Pounds 480m of underwriting capacity. New corporate members can underwrite Pounds 2 of premium income for every Pounds 1 of capital. Eight agencies manage 56 of the syndicates which will be supported by Limit. Fenchurch Underwriting Agencies, the Lloyd's agency, has been retained to advise on a consultancy basis, but Limit does not intend to appoint an external Lloyd's adviser. Approximately 90 per cent of funds will be invested in a portfolio of listed equities, with the balance invested partly in sterling fixed interest securities.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The South Korean government reportedly asked the U.N. command guarding the  border to block a radical student who plans to cross from North Korea as a  symbol of national reunification. Im Suk Yong, 20, traveled to North Korea in  defiance of Seoul to attend a youth festival, and said she intends to walk  through the truce village of Panmunjom between the two Koreas on July 27, the  anniversary of the cease-fire that ended the Korean War in 1953. Under the  armistice, approval from both sides is needed to cross the demilitarized zone.  The chairman of the south's governing party said there will be trouble if the  north permits Im to cross the zone.  </P></p>

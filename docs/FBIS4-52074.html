			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Indonesia does not want the Asia  Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to become a forum through  which certain countries can fulfill their ambitions of obtaining  unilateral benefits after failing to achieve this at the  recently concluded Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.    Minister of Trade Sastro B. Judono told reporters after  meeting with President Suharto here yesterday said that APEC on  the contrary, should be a forum where countries with advanced  economies and those with developing economies can cooperate to  improve their overall economic well being.    Judono was commenting on the new problems which he said had  emerged following the signing of the Final Act of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakech, Morocco.    He said the problem -- which he referred to as "new forms of  protectionist measures" -- were mainly caused by the intention  of several industrialized countries to include non-trade issues  in the global trade rules.    "Cooperation will encourage developing economies to grow  faster and will narrow the widening gap between the rich and  poor countries. This will promote keener competitiveness," he  said.    Judono, who was accompanied by Coordinating Minister for  Industry and Trade Hartarto and Minister/State Secretary  Murdiono, pointed out that before such a state of equilibrium  could be achieved, there would be no use talking about free  trade in the region, since that would only encourage unbalanced  trade.    "APEC should not immediately be turned into a free-trade  zone  because a certain period for cooperation is required to  gradually develop the member countries before they finally reach  a high level of competitiveness, allowing free trade to  proceed," he said.    Commenting on the Marrakech meeting, which he attended,  Judono explained that Indonesia has five years -- or until 1997  -- to adjust its regulations that require foreign investors to  utilize local products.    "Indonesia and several other countries have yet to remove  their regulations which are not in line with the new GATT  rules," he said.    In the implementation of international intellectual property  rights -- concerning copyrights, patents, trademarks, design  rights and the right of trade secrecy -- Judono said it was  agreed that all signatories would adjust their respective  regulations to the international norms.</p>

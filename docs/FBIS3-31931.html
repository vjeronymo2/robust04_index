			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Willie Melgar from the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] Dozens of peasants from the southern coast and other  regions this morning participated in a demonstration to demand  higher salaries for agricultural work. Roadblocks were erected  at the end of the Raul Aguilar Batres Road, in Zone 12 of the  capital, where the demonstrators also burned many tires.    It was reported that peasants, who are traveling to the  capital from other regions to demand a daily minimum pay of 20  quetzals, are staging similar demonstrations. A witness reported  that this morning's demonstration on the Raul Aguilar Batres  Road nearly caused a fight between the demonstrators and  residents of the El Mesquital neighborhood.    Meanwhile, several terrorist devices planted near power  pylons were defused the evening of 27 January. The police made  this report:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified police official] In the past  few hours, based on people's calls and reports, and thanks to  the citizens' cooperation, we were able to defuse a bomb planted  near one of the pylons in Villanueva. We can see it from here.  Bomb technicians defused this bomb at 0200 because of the  possible damage it could have caused to nearby houses. This  device contained aluminized [aluminizada] gunpowder, which is  what has been used to damage the pylons.    We found wire used for electrical installations. We found  the  power source: a nine-volt battery. We found part of a timing  device. As you can see, this is a clock face. This was found at  the downed pylon in Barcenas-Villanueva. We also found  electrical wire and a timing device, which included this clock,  at the pylon in Zone 18 in Las Ilusiones.    This debris suggests a time bomb was involved. These is the  debris found at two places. Bomb technicians, honoring their  motto to protect the citizens, have worked around the clock and  have shown up wherever they were needed.    Five explosive devices of this sort were defused at Los  Antojitos Restaurant on Roosevelt Road at 0800 today. You can  see them here. We urge citizens to continue to help us. We want  them to call the telephone numbers that were announced. We do  not want them to take any chances because we are ready to defuse  such devices at any time.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] where were they found?    [Police official] All the bombs shown here were among those  defused in urban and rural areas. The work was done by explosive  technicians. We are showing them to the citizens to ensure they  can identify such devices. We want them to report any findings.  We do not want them to take any risks. Above all, we want them  to warn children, who have been the main victims so far. This  was the case in the grenade explosions in Mazatenango. We want  to prevent this. [end recording]    Meanwhile, peasant organizations from the countryside and  southern coast marched today toward Guatemala City to demand a  wage of 22.4 quetzals for countryside workers. The peasant  organizations want national and international human rights  groups, especially the United Nations and International Labor  Organization, to pay attention to their problems.    Leaflets distributed during the demonstration carried  messages like: We denounce the unjust and shameful starvation  wages paid by farm owners in the rural areas of Coban, Alta  Verapaz, Baja Verapaz, Peten, and Izabal. We demand that  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio decree a 22.4 quetzal wage  increase for peasants right away because his goal is to fight  poverty, which is what he has repeatedly claimed in the media.  We demand the freedom to organize, mobilize, demonstrate, and  speak out in keeping with Articles 34 and 35 as well as other  articles of the Constitution.    We say no to [word indistinct] and forced recruitment. We  say  no to the popular referendum because it is another attempt to  deceive the people and because the people are not allowed to  participate.    People: Do not allow the same people to deceive us. Join the  struggle because it is the only path. Unican [expansion unknown]  is here!</p>

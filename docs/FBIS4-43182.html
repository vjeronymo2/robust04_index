			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mino Fuccillo: "Berlusconi's Miracle"] </F>   [Text] For over two years, ever since that faraway 5 April  1992, the Italian electorate has been shifting with increasing  velocity, giving rise to veritable "mass migrations." Again  yesterday the citizens of this Republic -- European electors for  a day -- set off in a long procession, lock, stock, and ballot  papers. Their destination: Silvio Berlusconi's government. A  march under the banners of the center-right. A race to  strengthen the victors of two months ago. A massive display of  confidence and a huge, urgent need to become part of the growing  triumphant army. Within the space of a few weeks, millions of  votes have shifted and have transformed what was a relative  majority into the country's absolute majority. Even before his  promised new economic miracle, Silvio Berlusconi has achieved  the miracle of consensus.    Only two months ago the forces of the center-right had 43  percent of the Italian people's votes. A first-past-the-post  system granted them the unquestionable right to govern. But  almost 60 percent of Italians displayed in various ways their  mistrust, if not their hostility, toward them. Yesterday,  however, Silvio Berlusconi achieved something like the landslide  victory for which he called. The combination of the votes of  Forza Italia, the National Alliance [AN], the League, and  Pannella's reform group -- that is, the government majority --  is well over 50 percent.    In Italy now, the opposition to the Berlusconi government is  in the minority, even from the proportional viewpoint. This is  the first, spectacular, effect of the latest "migration" which  enabled Forza Italia to gain an additional 10 percent of votes  over the result of the March elections.    Not only is the majority growing quickly, but its  characteristics are also changing. Forza Italia and the AN now  claim some 44 percent of the votes. In the future, they could  be tempted to go it alone, if necessary, without the League.  Indeed, in a first-past-the-post system it is possible to win  and to govern with near 40 percent. So the way is clear for the  center-right single party, that of Berlusconi and [AN leader]  Fini together. If he wants, [League Secretary] Bossi can follow  the path set out by the other two. If that does not suit him,  he could of course prompt a government crisis, but as of today  we know that the other two can do without him. Like it or not,  the League is cornered, stands watching the procession of voters  toward Berlusconi, and cannot stop it, but can only join it or  remain alone. Like it or not, Panella is also a mere accessory,  a useful adjunct, but an adjunct nevertheless.    The center-right bulldozer runs on a kind of gas that nobody  else has: The Italian people believe in Silvio Berlusconi and  his promises -- at least for the present. This is the key to  yesterday's election result, and it is this that enabled Forza  Italia to reach a level of support that only the DC [Christian  Democratic Party] before it enjoyed. The Italian people believe  in, and want to believe in, a new season of prosperity. They do  not want to let go of the possibility that prosperity will  arrive tomorrow, or even today, and moreover, basically without  much effort. Indeed, they have used their votes to punish those  who doubt it. No reasoning can prevail against it; the  "procession" demolishes every obstacle. It wins new coverts,  thrives on genuine confidence, enlists old forms of opportunism,  and feeds on conformism and hope. And Silvio Berlusconi is in  the driver's seat. He can, if he wants, dump the defeated  League. He can, if he wants, create the great center-right  party with Fini. He can calmly await the arrival of the last  penitents from the drained center.    Indeed, the center that was identified with the DC and the  referendums is not holding together and is inevitably  disintegrating. The Popular Party and Segni's Pact have lost  about one-fourth of the votes they had two months ago. The idea  that nothing can be done either with Forza Italia or with the  progressive forces has not been taken up by the voters. The  center opposition is about to become a mere token stance. So it  is easy to predict that the Popular Party will be subjected to  tensions that could cut it into slices and that one of these  slices will decide to join the "procession."    So while the center is working on a political hypothesis  that  seems insubstantial to the voters, things are certainly not much  better for the progressive forces. Their percentage of the  votes has fallen by a few points but, what is worse, the first  symptoms of political asphyxia are starting to appear. The PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] suffered losses, which shows the  high cost of every week spent contemplating its defeat in March.  If the progressive forces do not change their language, habits,  and political strategy right away, it is likely a long season of  decline will begin for them. It is not just a matter of a  secretary or a leadership group, though one cannot pretend there  is no leadership problem. Now one can hope, for the sake of the  progressive forces, that the PDS will alter its cautious  internal timetable. Now one can hope, for the sake of the  progressive forces, that no one will make any excuses.    The PDS has less than 20 percent, Rete is virtually  nonexistent, and the Democratic Alliance and the Socialists are  decimated. On its own, the Left will die, whichever party  symbol it uses as its banner. And it would be hardly any  consolation for the progressive forces to cite the stability of  Communist Renewal and the modest success of the Greens. There  is no magic spell for the progressive forces and there is  presently no alternative to Berlusconi ready in Italian society.  But at least one thing is clear: The Left, on its own,  commands the support of one Italian in three. If it ever wants  to govern this country it must start changing its  representatives and its language; then it can try to change the  country's political geography and try to halt the "procession."  But it is pointless to stand watching it, knocking on wood.    The vote was for Europe, but the Italian people gladly  forgot  the fact. Instead, en masse, they took the opportunity to shout  that they want to be governed by Silvio Berlusconi and no other.  They did not care too much for subtleties: On the stock  exchange of politics, of social interests and values, more jobs  and less taxes are now worth more than anything else.  Berlusconi does not frighten them; indeed, he attracts them.  And Fini does not frighten them very much either, judging from  the fact that the MSI [Italian Social Movement] paid only a tiny  price for the polemics over government neofascism. Indeed, it  is more likely that the few votes that the National Alliance  lost went to Forza Italia, as though attracted by some kind of  gravitational force. A great number of League supporters have  also become converts to Forza Italia, even though, or perhaps  precisely because, Bossi is threatening to end the idyll. Center  supporters who do not want to miss the promised chance to party  have converted to Forza Italia. However, the procession still  excludes the Left, which has been deprived of all hope and whose  outlook has become uncertain. If there is a leadership out  there, please speak up. It is already very late -- never mind  about tomorrow.    Italy now is placing its trust in and consigning itself to  Silvio Berlusconi. So let him govern, as best he can. As of  today, power is certainly not something he lacks. The country  is following him in a procession, and he and he alone will take  the credit for a new miracle or an old disaster.</p>

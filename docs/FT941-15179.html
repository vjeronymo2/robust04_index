			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Unions criticise job-saving deal Sheffield City Council hopes to repeat last year's model job-saving deal which involved a small cut in pay for its 15,000 employees in return for job security and an extra seven days' holiday. But union officials warn that the deal is unlikely to be accepted for a second year. Compulsory redundancies were avoided last year as a result of the deal, which cut pay by 3.25 per cent. This year, according to union officials, the council wants a further cut of 2.75 per cent but is not offering extra holiday. The deal produced a saving of Pounds 7m for the council last year. This year it needs another Pounds 9m saving in employee costs as part of a Pounds 31m package of cuts. There was strong support for last year's deal from Nupe, the public-service union, and Nalgo - now part of Unison - and narrower support from the GMB general union. But Unison said yesterday: 'We were persuaded to accept a pay cut . . . on the basis that it was going to resolve the budget problems and give the council a year in which to restructure. It seems that we are right back in that position again and it's all been for nothing.'</p>

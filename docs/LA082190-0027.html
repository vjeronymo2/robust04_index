			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOBIL, 2 EXECUTIVES TO BE TRIED IN EXPLOSION  </P> <P> An appellate panel has ruled that Mobil Oil Corp. and two of its former  executives must stand trial on misdemeanor charges stemming from a fatal 1988  explosion at the company's Torrance refinery.  </P> <P> The Superior Court appeals panel ruling overturns South Bay Municipal Court  Judge Thomas Allen's dismissal last year of charges against Mobil and former  managers Wyman Robb and Tom Gregory. Allen had ruled that the parties were not  criminally liable for the explosion because it was caused by a private  contractor, Cal Cat Chemical Co.  </P> <P> The July 15, 1988, explosion left one Cal Cat employee dead and another  seriously burned.  </P></p>

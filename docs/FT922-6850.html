			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / The Finance Bill: Capital gains to company cars: the bill in detail THE GOVERNMENT yesterday set out the policies and effects of the 69 clauses and 17 schedules of the Finance Bill. CUSTOMS AND EXCISE Abolition of fiscal frontiers: Clause 1 and Schedule 1 make provision for Customs to fix the point at which the requirement to pay excise duty takes effect. Clause 2 makes provision for Customs to repay excise duty where the commissioners are satisfied that goods chargeable with duty have not been, and will not be, consumed in the UK. Clause 3 and Schedule 2 are designed to protect the revenue derived from excise duties, for example ensuring that duty is payable when goods leave a warehouse and creating an offence of taking preparatory steps with a view to evasion of duty. Clause 4 limits Customs enforcement powers in relation to people or goods entering or leaving the UK, so as not to prevent, restrict or delay their movements between member states. Clause 5 enables Customs to exercise powers in relation to transfer passengers travelling by air when they reach their eventual UK destination. Other provisions: Clause 6 abolishes excise duty on matches and mechanical lighters. Clause 7 makes provision to exempt members' clubs and similar societies from liability to bingo duty. Clause 8 modifies arrangements for determining the recommended retail price on which the ad valorem element of cigarette duty is based. Clause 9 rectifies minor omissions in regulations that will, after introduction of the beer end-product duty system, make beer duty a preferential debt. Clause 11 sets rates of vehicle excise duty for classes of heavy goods vehicle which will be able to operate in the UK from January 1. Clause 12 repeals provisions relating to exemptions from vehicle excise duty for disabled people. Clause 13 makes minor changes to arrangements for special vehicle registration marks. VALUE ADDED TAX Clause 14 and Schedule 3 introduce changes to VAT law necessary for completion of the single market. Clause 15 ensures that matches remain chargeable with VAT at the standard rate when excise duty on matches is abolished. CAR TAX Clause 16 and Schedule 4 amend the Car Tax Act 1983 in preparation for completion of the single market. INCOME TAX, CORPORATION TAX, AND CAPITAL GAINS TAX Lower rate: Clause 17 makes technical consequential changes following the introduction of the 20p lower rate of income tax. Married couples allowance: Clause 18 and Schedule 5 set out arrangements for couples to agree to allocate the allowance to the wife or to share it or for the wife to opt for it to be split equally, with effect from April 6 1993. Corporation tax charge and rate: Clause 19 sets the main rate of corporation tax for the financial year 1992 at 33 per cent. Clause 20 sets the small companies' rate at 25 per cent. It also sets at one 50th the fraction used for calculating marginal relief for companies whose profits are in a band above the profits limit for the small companies rate. That will be equivalent to a marginal rate within the marginal relief band of 35 per cent. Capital gains tax: Clause 21 provides that, where appropriate, a rate equivalent to the lower rate of income tax will apply in charging an individual's gains to capital gains tax. Groups etc: Clause 22 and Schedule 6 amend the definition of share arrangements for group relief and other tax purposes. It treats options to buy and sell shares, in some circumstances, as if they had been exercised. Clause 23 makes minor changes to ensure that a company leaving a group cannot manipulate the provisions to avoid paying capital gains tax on certain assets previously transferred to it by other members of the group. Charities etc: Clause 24 reduces from Pounds 600 to Pounds 400 the minimum limit for charitable donations qualifying for tax relief under the Gift Aid scheme. Clause 25 relaxes the rules for tax relief for certain charitable covenants. Clause 26 extends the power for the Inland Revenue to inspect charities' records of Gift Aid donations. Interest, dividends and distributions: Clause 27 changes rules for including interest paid to people who are not ordinarily resident from returns to the Inland Revenue. Henceforth, separate declarations of non-ordinarily resident status will not be needed. Clause 26 is required to implement the EC parent/ subsidiary directive, which eliminates the double taxation of dividends and abolishes withholding taxes on them when they are paid to a parent company in another member state. The clause excludes from the charge on both paying and collecting agents' dividends paid by a company that is not resident in the UK to a company that is resident. Exclusion is subject to the latter company's controlling, either directly or indirectly, not less than 10 per cent of the voting power in the former company. Clause 29 amends requirements for companies providing vouchers for dividend payments, so that the shareholder will receive a voucher in all circumstances, including electronic transfer. Securities and deposits: Clause 30 and Schedule 7 take securities out of the charge on deep gain securities where they may deliver a deep gain only by operation of their event of default or event risk clauses. Clause 31 and Schedule 8 prepare for 'dematerialised' certificates of deposit under new arrangements that will eliminate in most cases the creation of paper certificates. Clauses 32, 33, 38 to 44 and 54 implement the EC mergers directive, which defers certain capital-gains charges that might otherwise arise on a cross-border reorganisation. Clause 32 brings capital gains provisions concerning share exchanges fully into conformity with the requirements of the directive. Employee shares: Clause 33 removes the tax charge that can arise on the trustees of an Employee Share Ownership Trust as a result of a share-for-share exchange. Clause 34 removes the charge to tax special benefits received by employee shareholders where benefits are available to at least 90 per cent of shareholders and a majority of shares are held by people who are not employees. Business expansion scheme: Clause 35 ends relief under the BES for shares in unquoted trading companies after the end of 1993. Clause 36 makes it easier for BES companies that raise money for private rented housing to have a property management subsidiary. Clause 37 makes it easier for them to operate mortgage rescue schemes. Transfers of trade: Clause 38 defers capital gains charges where a company resident in one member state transfers all or part of UK trading operations to a company resident in another member state in exchange for securities issued by the transferee company. Clauses 39 and 44 permit the UK to tax gains accruing where a UK resident company transfers a branch or agency situated in another member state to a company resident in a third member state. Relief will be given for any tax that, but for the EC Mergers Directive, would have been payable in the member state where the branch or agency is situated. Clause 40 introduces amendments to the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 consequential upon Clauses 38 and 39. Clause 41 replicates the relief available under Clause 38. Clause 42 replicates the relief available under Clause 39. Clause 43 is consequent upon Clauses 41 and 42. Double taxation relief: Clause 44 in relation to Clauses 39 and 42, provides for double taxation relief on the basis of the tax that would, but for the Mergers Directive, have been payable in the member state where the branch or agency is situated. Clause 45 contains provisions necessary to implement the EC Arbitration Convention, which sets up a mechanism for resolving transfer pricing disputes within the Community. Miscellaneous: Clause 46 introduces lower car fuel scale charges to tax the benefit of free diesel fuel provided by employers for employees' private use in company cars. Clause 47 brings the activity of transporting oil or gas directly abroad from an offshore field within the corporation tax 'ring fence', so that the relevant costs may offset companies' UK oil production profits. Clause 48 and Schedule 9 extend to a friendly society incorporated under the Friendly Societies Act 1992 tax exemptions currently available to unincorporated societies registered under the 1974 Friendly Societies Act. Clause 49 changes, in certain circumstances, the rules for charging rent to income and corporation tax in order to prevent manipulation of those rules to secure a tax deferment. From March 10, where rent is payable in arrears - directly or indirectly - between connected persons, the recipient will be chargeable to tax in a particular chargeable period on the rent that has accrued in that period, and not as at present on the rent the recipient was entitled to receive in that period. Clause 50 modifies, from a date to be appointed, the tax treatment of maintenance payments to take account of the Child Support Agency. Clause 51 and Schedule 10 alter the arrangements for accounting for tax deducted by paying and collecting agents (mainly banks end stockbrokers) from foreign dividends and interest. From October 1 1992 the tax is to be paid to the Inland Revenue within 14 days of the end of the month in which it is deducted. The schedule also abolishes the statutory remuneration agents receive from the Inland Revenue. Clause 52 confirms rates of tax charged on building societies, banks and other deposit takers under the former composite rate tax arrangements for the years 1986-87 to 1989-90. Clause 53 and schedule 11 make tax changes affecting insolvent companies in compulsory liquidation that were carrying on a deposit-taking business. Losses brought forward and certain expenses can be offset against income arising from the trade after it has ceased. CAPITAL ALLOWANCES Clause 54 defers capital allowance balancing charges and other balancing adjustments where Clauses 39 and 41 apply. Clause 55 provides for relief for capital expenditure on computer software. Clause 56 and Schedule 12 amend capital allowances legislation applying to expenditure on buildings constructed in enterprise zones. The Schedule remedies a defect in existing legislation that denies enterprise zone allowances to a purchaser of an unused building who buys it after expiry of the 10-year life of the zone. It also provides that allowances will be available on buildings sold within two years of being brought into use. It restricts enterprise zone allowances to expenditure incurred within 10 years of the expiry of the zone. Clause 57 increases from Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 12,000 the limit on the cost of business cars above which capital allowances and tax relief for lease rentals are restricted. Inheritance tax: Clause 58 increases the starting point for inheritance tax to Pounds 150,000. Clause 59 and Schedule 13 make changes to the rates of relief from inheritance tax for certain business assets and farmland - the higher rate from 50 per cent to 100 per cent, the lower rate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. Shares dealt on the Unlisted Securities Market are treated as unquoted for the purpose of the relief. Petroleum revenue tax: Clause 60 and Schedule 14 provide petroleum revenue tax relief for transporting oil or gas directly abroad from an offshore field and make various consequential changes to the PRT rules. General and special commissioners: Clause 61 allows the lord chancellor to change the names of tribunals that hear tax appeals. Clause 62 and Schedule 15 allow the lord chancellor to introduce procedural rules for hearing tax appeals. Those are planned to came into effect in April 1993. They will include powers for the special commissioners to award costs where either party has acted unreasonably, and to publish selected decisions. Miscellaneous: Clause 63 and Schedule 16 provide for continuity of tax treatment of Northern Ireland Electricity. on pre-privatisation and reorganisation into successor companies. Clause 64 removes the double charge to gas levy and PRT that would otherwise arise when a PRT-exempt contract for sale of North Sea gas ends at a fixed date predetermined in the contract. Clause 65 amends Section 8 of the Treasury Bills Act 1977 to remove the requirement that Treasury bills be countersigned by the comptroller and auditor-general, bringing them into line with other government debt instruments. Clause 66 removes the requirement to publish National Loans Fund and Public Works Loan Board interest rates in London and Edinburgh Gazette each time they are changed.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [RITZAUS Bureau report: "Briton Smuggled 1.5 Tons of </F> Hashish"]    [Text] Sentence: A dozen persons are awaiting trial in a  large hashish case involving, among other individuals, the  chairman of the Association of Criminal Police, KRIM, and a  county government leader. Also in connection with this case,  Copenhagen Municipal Court on Wednesday [6 April] sentenced  Briton Timothy McCarthy to a prison term of six months. He  admitted to having been involved in the smuggling of at least  1.5 tons of hashish and to have earned at least 30 million  kroner.    His 46-year-old compatriot was earlier given the same  sentence for his role in the smuggling incidents. Up to one  dozen more persons are still awaiting trial.    Among those currently jailed in the case is the chairman of  KRIM, a North Zealand county government leader, and a union  official. Police think the indicted individuals have altogether  smuggled in hashish amounting to a street value of 60 million  kroner. The supposed ringleaders can expect to be called before  a grand jury in the fall.    In addition to the prison sentence, McCarthy's sentence  contains a permanent ban on entering Denmark after having served  his prison term and a confiscation of an estate of 400,000  kroner, 100 kg of hashish, and various articles of  communications equipment.</p>

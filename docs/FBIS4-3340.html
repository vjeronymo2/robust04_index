			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ding Genxi (0002 2704 0823)] </F>   [Text] Guiyang, 24 Mar (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a national  meeting of managers of chemical and light industrial companies  here recently, Ma Yimin, vice minister of internal trade, urged  cadres and workers of chemical and light industrial companies,  as well as material supply enterprises throughout the country,  to step up analysis and forecast of the market, to seize the  opportunity to meet challenges, and to push the stamina and  economic efficiency of chemical and light industrial as well as  material supply departments in China to a new height.    He said: This year, with the state further tightening  control over credit, the shortage of funds will remain.  Therefore, all material supply enterprises should take  effective measures to overcome the effect of unfavorable  factors, should tap the potential for increased financial  revenues, and should strive to improve management and operations  and to raise the efficiency of using funds, thereby pushing the  overall efficiency of material supply departments to a new  height.    He said: In recent years, quite a few material supply  enterprises have benefited from market analysis and forecast,  earning profits year after year. However, some enterprises  failed to attach importance to market analysis and to draw an  accurate assessment of the situation, thus performing poorly and  decreasing their efficiency whenever the market fluctuated.  This year, the total demand and supply of capital goods are  both expected to increase by a relatively large margin and to be  balanced in general. However, prices of capital goods will be  affected by the state's policies, energy, communications, and  international market changes, in addition to supply and demand.  Therefore, under the general trend of balanced supply and  demand, we still cannot rule out price fluctuations, or  relatively big price fluctuations of certain commodities in some  regions during a given period of time. Hence, each and every  material supply department is required to obtain a good grasp of  the state's policies in a timely manner, to collect information  of all kinds, and to step up dynamic analysis and forecast of  various commodities in order to keep abreast of market trends  and changes and to make decisions on operational strategies.  Only by so doing can material supply enterprises become  profitable and be able to continually expand and enliven their  operations.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Getting hooked on fish and chips in Japan / A look at Harry Ramsden's global expansion plans Tucked between the virtual reality games, roller hockey and super body clinic at Live UFO, a 12 day outdoor extravaganza in Tokyo's Yoyogi Park recently, was a British fish and chips shop. The incongruous temporary counter was the latest element in a strategy by Harry Ramsden's, the Guiseley, West Yorkshire, quoted fish and chips company, to bring this traditional British dish to Asia. The shop, serving daily more than 500 portions of haddock and chips covered in traditional salt and vinegar, was an experiment to see whether the Japanese would take to the product. A similar stall in Hong Kong had led to a joint-venture there, and the opening two years ago of a highly successful restaurant. Mr Richard Taylor, Harry Ramsden's finance director who spent much of last week in Tokyo scrubbing floors, interviewing Japanese customers and chopping fish - rather slowly according to his Yorkshire-based staff - said he was pleased by the initial results. The haddock portions had to be reduced in size because demand had been higher than expected and there was a risk of running out of fish. 'The question is whether once they had tried it they would come back again,' says Mr Taylor. The reaction was mixed. Mr Katsumi Hidaka, a 29 year old television director, said, with studious understatement, that his portion was 'not terrible'. His wife said the fish was 'greasy' but she might have it again. Ryu, their one year old son, spat his chips out. Nevertheless, the product had generally gone down well, according to Ms Katie Garritt, who cooked the fish and chips over the 12 days and normally works at Harry Ramsden's Guiseley headquarters. 'Sometimes one member of the family would try it, and then all the others would buy portions,' she said. Mr Taylor said demand had been brisk enough to start looking for partners to set up a restaurant in Tokyo. The group was looking for someone who already has experience in the Japanese fast-food market, he explained. Harry Ramsden's hopes to repeat the success of the Hong Kong branch which generates annual sales of Pounds 1.5m - the same turnover as the outlet in Blackpool. 'We market the product as Britain's fast-food, and it's proved extremely successful,' says Mr Taylor. Initially, about half of the clientele in Hong Kong were expatriates, but now more than 80 per cent are Chinese. Additional branches are being opened in Singapore this September and in Melbourne next year. 'Following the success of Hong Kong, we've had approaches from a number of countries across Asia and it's easy to waste a lot of time following them up. It's a question of management resources. But Japan is our priority because of the potential size of the market,' he says. Harry Ramsden's believes it has a recipe for success in Asia. Mr Taylor insists the product is of high quality. 'We don't compromise on fish. We use the best Norwegian haddock cooked at constant temperatures in oil that is constantly changed. Finally, we have Harry Ramsden's unique Yorkshire batter,' he explains. 'We want Harry Ramsden's to become a global brand. In the short-term the greatest returns will be in the UK. But it would be a mistake to saturate the UK and then turn to the rest of the world. We'd probably come a cropper when we internationalised. We need experience now,' says Mr Taylor. The company has eight branches in the UK, with four more scheduled for opening this year, as well as one in Dublin. In Japan, the company is looking for a joint-venture partner, its preferred route for expansion. Harry Ramsden's keeps between 25 per cent and 49 per cent of the joint-venture, with the remainder held by the local partner. 'We could be greedy and keep a higher share, but you have to provide sufficient incentive to make the venture thrive. The partner is key. He, or she, provides knowledge of local tastes, areas and, most importantly, sites,' explains Mr Taylor. By adopting the joint-venture route, Harry Ramsden's would be following the example of Grand Metropolitan's Burger King, which has teamed up with the Seibu Railway's group, and Subway, the US sandwich makers, which forged links with Suntory's First Kitchen. Each Harry Ramsden's restaurant serves one dish to cater for local tastes. In Glasgow, the dish is haggis; in Hong Kong, it is salad; and in Bristol, for some reason, they serve faggots and peas. Mr Taylor says he has not decided what would be appropriate for Japanese palates. Some less greasy fish would probably help.</p>

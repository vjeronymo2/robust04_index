			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Miroslav Lazanski: "From Grbavica to the Serb </F> Pentagon"]    [Text] An ordinary gray telephone on a small black table, a  poor overheated room in a squat private house in the settlement  called Grbavica in the Serbian section of Sarajevo. People are  waiting patiently around the telephone to call their friends and  relatives on the other side of the front, in the Muslim section  of Sarajevo. The telephone represents life, hope and anxiety,  and it is the only line for direct dialing of the number unless  it has been changed or the line is down, and it is located in  the room of the Exchange Commission. The lads in camouflage  uniforms are also here: Rajko Sforcan, Slavisa Tusevljak and  Dragan Divcic, all members of the commission. What dramas they  have witnessed in these two years of war! How many human  destinies have been recited in the room with the gray telephone  on the little black shelf...    Grbavica and Vrace, which are Serb sections of Sarajevo,  seem  ghostly in the twilight. Broken windows, buildings riddled and  wounded by shells and shrapnel, lights flickering behind drapes,  a stray dog here and there, silence in which one can hear the  whistle of the sniper bullet.    And in some parts of Sarajevo there are not only private  bordellos, both voluntary and involuntary, and private prisons,  but there are even private cemeteries. For 20 to 50 marks the  professional killers will murder anyone, and to prove their  rating as 'bad guys' they bury their victims in their own  orderly private cemetery. It is an open and ongoing competition,  and various Celos, Josos and Musos are masters of the life and  death of innocent civilians.  <H5>  The "Comanche" Bunker </H5>   The Lukavica Garrison is a forward command post of the  Sarajevo-Romanija Corps of the Army of the Srpska republic. Maj  Gen Stanislav Galic, that corps's commander, lives here at a  crowflight's distance of 400 meters from the Muslim positions on  Mojmilo Hill, but that does not disturb him very much. His two  bodyguards, military policemen, have the coldest miens the  author of this article has seen on any battlefield in the world:  neither smile nor grimace, no talk, no questions, no answers.  Ice and only ice, so that the atmosphere becomes unpleasant.  General Galic, fortunately, is a sociable fellow who knows what  the media can do. Capt 1st Class Predrag Glusica, a mechanical  engineer from Sarajevo who has spent three years living and  working in Chicago, is also here as his officer for finance,  physical inventories and supply. He is actually the financial  genius of this corps, and he goes right to the first line of  combat.    That front line has somehow been pushed into the background  in the media, so that members of the crew of the Comanche Bunker  on Zlatiste, that is, Babin Zub, emphasize that there is not a  single regular army officer among the fighting men in that area;  they are all reserve officers. Mladen Popovic, Novica Skrba,  Dragisa Tusevljak, Vladimir Skrba, Milutin Trifkovic and Nevenko  Divcic, members of the combat team of the Comanche Bunker, are  only 50 meters from the Muslim positions. "We exchange shouts  with the Muslims every day, both they and we have enough of war.  Half an hour ago a Muslim came to have coffee with us. We  invited him. Now he just keeps hanging around," the "Comanches"  say.    The bunker was improvised from corrugated sheet metal,  bricks, wood, small drums, earth and logs. Inside there is a tin  heater, fire and moisture. Three beds, four chairs, automatic  weapons and rifles with telescopic sights on the walls. Only the  weapons are clean and shiny.    "We spend one day, all 24 hours, on position, the next day  we  go to nearby houses to rest," they say. They are all from  Sarajevo or environs. What is the food like? Bad, couldn't be  worse. "We have not seen meat for five months, nor, by God, have  we seen our defense minister visiting the front lines. Our teeth  are going bad, falling out, our vision is failing because of the  poor diet, but what can you do, we know that this is war, and  there is no other way."  <H5>  A Serbian Pentagon Underground </H5>   The "Comanches" squat in their bunker, the tin heater roars  with the wet wood, the observers strain their eyes at the  loopholes and ramparts, staring into the darkness. The dark  vilayet of Bosnia...    Part of the 4th Battalion of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps is  in a little wood a bit further on from Zlatiste. An elite unit  of the Army of the Srpska republic. Its commander is Maj Radomir  Kojic, height two meters, weight 95 kilograms. When he talks to  the officers and men of the French battalion that is part of the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force], the French get an inferiority  complex, since Maj Kojic is one of the best commandos of the  Serbian army in Bosnia, a participant in the most difficult  missions and operations, always in the front ranks. The French  know that, and that is why they respect him.    To be sure, they have no choice, since they have come from  hot Africa, from Chad, to icebound Jahorina, where Maj Kojic  washes with snow, naked to the waist, and the French wear  bulletproof vests even when they go to the toilet. As a matter  of fact, as soon as it gets a bit 'thick,' the French flee to  Kojic for his care and protection, and he receives them and  looks at them as a snake does a frog.... At least for the  present.    The deadline for the NATO ultimatum has passed, the Army of  the Srpska republic is nevertheless still on the alert. False  positions are being built, the real ones are being fortified.  The UNPROFOR has already lodged an official protest because the  Serbs are building false positions.    "It is up to you to distinguish the real ones from the false  ones," the Serbian side replied. In this game of one-upmanship  and electronic surveillance NATO is especially monitoring the  activity of the general staff of the Serbian army, which has its  central post in the hills of eastern Bosnia. This is actually an  underground command complex that dates from the time of the  former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], the army command post and  headquarters for the Supreme Command of the former Yugoslavia in  case of war. It is all underground, in the hills, resistant even  to the shocks of atomic bombs up to 50 kilotons, everything is  completely self-sufficient and automated. The people who live in  that underground city can be out of touch with the outside world  for as long as six months, that is the extent of their stocks of  food, fuel and ammunition.    There is everything under the sun in that underground  command  post: dormitories, a kitchen, a mess hall, a storeroom, offices,  an operations center, a meeting room, a hospital, sanitary  facilities, a computer center, a tangle of corridors, steel  doors operated hydraulically, special tunnels and camouflaged  entrances, filters or ventilation and kilometers of cable and  pipe. The systems of communications from this command center of  the Army of the Srpska republic cannot be jammed unless the site  is attacked with 50-kiloton atomic bombs. Communications have  been interrupted twice, when the Serbian side was simulating a  nuclear attack: on 7 August 1992, lasting 35 minutes, and on 16  June 1993, lasting 15 minutes. Even the NATO experts were  immediately wondering: Why has the Serbian Pentagon gone silent?</p>

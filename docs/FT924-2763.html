			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Electricity regulator's coal costing attacked PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, provoked a storm of criticism yesterday with publication of a report which concluded that coal was the most expensive fuel for power generation. The report, brought forward deliberately to coincide with the debate about the future of coal, marks a serious setback for the coal lobby as it fights the threat from competing fuels, mainly gas. But the report's chief conclusions were rejected by the power generation industry. Mr Colin Webster, commercial director of National Power, said he was 'utterly amazed' by Prof Littlechild's findings, which he described as 'a nonsense and tendentious'. He said: 'We believe he has done his calculations quite wrongly.' Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, the second largest generator sent a letter to Prof Littlechild accusing him of putting together a rushed report which failed to reflect the true position of the industry. An official said: 'He seems to have conducted an analysis based on a wide margin of error.' British Coal, which has claimed that it is being unfairly squeezed out of the market by the 'dash for gas', said: 'It has to be of concern to the regulator that a large generation company is questioning his analysis.' Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, said the report failed to take full account of fuel costs or the danger of overcapacity in gas-fired plant. The Department of Trade and Industry said it would take account of Prof Littlechild's conclusions but declined any detailed comment. Prof Littlechild's main finding was that electricity companies had not breached their duty to buy electricity as economically as possible in signing gas-based deals. But to reach this conclusion he had to calculate the relative contract price of different fuels. He gave these yesterday as 3.2p a kilowatt hour for coal, 3p for nuclear and 2.7p-3p for gas. National Power said the correct figure for coal was 2.72p. Prof Littlechild's report was welcomed by the electricity distribution industry, whose members were relieved by his conclusion that they had purchased power economically. Gas producers also supported the report as evidence that the UK's gas lobby is being heard. 'Frankly, it's very helpful,' said Mr Tony Craven-Walker, chief executive of Monument Oil and Gas. Monumentis involved in a Pounds 2bn project to develop four oil and gas fields in the Liverpool Bay area which is dependent on PowerGen getting approval for its Connah's Quay gas-fired power station. A British Gas official said: 'It's interesting that this is a preliminary report and we'll look forward to further findings at the end of January.'

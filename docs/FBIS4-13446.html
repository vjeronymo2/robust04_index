			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on address by Assembly speaker Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz </F> al-Sa'dun at the National Assembly in Kuwait on 19  April--recorded]    [Excerpts] The National Assembly, chaired by its speaker  Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sa'dun, held its regular session this  morning. The assembly meeting opened with an address by the  speaker in which he discussed claims by the president of the  so-called Iraqi National Assembly that the Baghdad regime is not  holding any Kuwaiti prisoners, hostages or others, and his  invitation to a delegation from Kuwait's National Assembly to  visit Iraq to verify this. The following is a recording of the  speaker's address:    [Al-Sa'dun] To begin with, this is not the first time an  Iraqi official has made such statements; they have said this on  many occasions. Similar statements were made by the foreign  minister and other officials. We did not take any notice of  them and did not try to respond to them because we felt that  they did not deserve answering. However, the statement made  this time by the speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly,  inviting members of the Kuwaiti National Assembly to discuss  some issues, as he put it, to serve what he described as the  pan-Arab cause, the interests of both sides, in order to achieve  stability and put an end to [word indistinct], compels us to  respond.    What also makes us respond to this statement is his belief  --  as came across clearly in the text of his interview with the INA  - that statements of this kind made by various officials have  been concealed from the Kuwaiti Parliament by the Kuwaiti  Government. Because of this, it is necessary to let the speaker  of the Iraqi National Assemby and the Iraqi regime know the  truth of the position of the Kuwaiti people, all the Kuwaiti  people -- government, people, and parliament.    The position of the Kuwaiti people was not taken today, but  during the darkest of circumstances. It was taken when Kuwait  was occupied, when there were disputes. Yes, let him hear,  there were disputes between us on how to handle matters, but  there were no differences on two issues; on the liberation of  Kuwait when it was occupied and who should govern Kuwait. Let  him know that clearly. [passage omitted]    The stance of the Kuwaiti people toward the Iraqi regime,  its  occupation, and its practices was clear. Despite all that the  Kuwaiti people faced then, not only at the hands of the Iraqi  regime and its army but also at the hands of some of the people  [as heard], our people managed to rise above all their wounds.  Our people managed then, at a people's conference held under  the patronage of his highness the amir and the chairmanship of  his highness the heir apparent, at which representatives of all  sections of Kuwaiti society were present -- our people managed  at that conference to rise above all their wounds and adopt,  with a clearly defined stance, Resolution 15 [words indistinct]  which while condemning the practices of the Iraqi regime made it  clear that the Kuwaiti people do not harbor any malice or grudge  against the Iraqi people. Indeed, we said in Resolution 15 that  part of the suffering faced by the Iraqi people or even all the  suffering faced by the Iraqi people was caused by the Iraqi  regime itself.    It is astonishing to hear what the Iraqi regime, or the  speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly, had to say when he  invited a delegation from the Kuwaiti National Assembly to hold  talks without involving the Kuwaiti Government, as if there were  a government on one side and a National Assembly on the other.  We may have our differences but in the face of these matters we  are one side: the government, the National Assembly, and the  system of government in Kuwait all stand on the same side. This  is what we said then. [applause] [passage omitted]    What does he want from such a meeting? His objective -- as  he said openly --is to enable a delegation from the Kuwaiti  National Assembly, whom they would invite, to acquaint  themselves with all the facts that prove that they have no  Kuwaiti prisoners. The result is already known, as far as he  [as heard] is concerned: There are no prisoners. This is also  aimed at helping the Iraqis to achieve their goals in their  attempts to mislead the international community when they ask  for a lifting of the blockade, arguing that they have responded  to all the resolutions of the international community.    We challenge -- I personally challenge -- the chairman of  the Iraqi National Assembly to present to the international  community evidence that Iraq has responded and accepted  commitment to all the resolutions of the international  community. Perhaps continuous pressure from the international  community would make Iraq submit now. As a result of pressure  it has indeed submitted to all that concerns the search for  weapons. It has responded and carried out articles [words  indistinct] and responded and implemented article [word  indistinct]. But talk about [words indistinct], who is to blame  for this? It is the Iraqi regime itself that is to blame,  because, first, the boycott resolutions did not cover food or  medicine; second, in addition to all [words indistinct] the  international community allowed the Iraqi regime to export some  of its oil so long as it does not exceed [words indistinct].  For this reason, Mr. Speaker [as heard], I [word indistinct]  for these calls and illusions of the Iraqi regime or the  chairman of the so-called Iraqi National Assembly not to  continue. We say it here: the Iraqi regime cannot but [words  indistinct] the problem of prisoners, and particularly Articles  30 and 31 of Resolution [?687], and especially also the  implementation of Resolution [word indistinct]. It cannot but  accept, respect, hand over the prisoners, and not just the  prisoners, not just the hostages. We are always talking about  the prisoners and hostages, but [words indistinct]. The  international resolution speaks about handing over the  prisoners, the hostages, or the bodies, if any, and also [words  indistinct]. The remains of the dead and martyrs are of no less  interest to us than the prisoners themselves.    The Iraqi regime, if it really wanted to return to the fold  of the international community... [pauses] The international  community did not impose sanctions for nothing. The  international community imposed sanctions on the Iraqi regime  for a reason. This reason is the existing aggression, the  aggression against Kuwait, Iraq's holding of POW's, and its lack  of respect for international resolutions. Accordingly, if the  Iraqi regime really wants to lift what it calls the suffering of  the Iraqi people, it must abide by these resolutions because it  is the Iraqi regime itself that is responsible for the plight of  the Iraqi people.    Mr. President [as heard], as I said, many statements were  issued by officials on various occasions which did not make us  respond to them. To remove any false impressions, however, to  ensure that such invitations are not repeated, and to make it  clear to the so-called speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly,  we tell him that all the invitations have reached us and we have  listened to them. Despite all this, they have been rejected.  So that they may not continue misleading the international  community by saying that invitations have been concealed from  the Kuwaiti Parliament, we tell him that the invitation has been  heard and now we want you to hear the Kuwaiti people's rejection  of this offer.    The Iraqi regime has no choice in the POW issue -- and we  challenge the speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly to deny  that the POW's are there -- but to abide by Resolution 187 [as  heard] and to allow international organizations, particularly  the International Committee of the Red Cross, to have access to  the POW's instead of inviting a Kuwaiti National Assembly or  joint Arab delegation. [passage omitted]    We challenge the Iraqi regime respond to these files. We  challenge it to tell us whether each one of these POW's is  present or missing. Official Iraqi documents were given to the  Iraqi regime during the days of the occupation of Kuwait giving  indications on where each prisoner had been taken from, what  camp he had been put in in Kuwait, and what camp he had been  transferred to in Iraq. Furthermore, the regime were also given  documents on where each one of them had been seen for the last  time.    Therefore, the invitation made by the speaker of the  so-called Iraqi National Assembly is rejected. I suggest to the  brothers in the national assembly, for things to be clear, to  ask the brothers in the Foreign Ministry to prepare a clear  statement on the National Assembly stance which ultimately  represents that of the Kuwaiti people and everybody in Kuwait:  government, people, and system vis-a-vis this issue. Thank you  brother president. [end recording]</p>

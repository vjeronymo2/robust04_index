			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'SUN UP' SIGNS OFF WITH GRACE, STYLE  </P> <P> The final episode of "Sun Up San Diego," which aired Friday, was much like the  thousands of episodes that preceded it.  </P> <P> The San Diego Zoo brought animals. Co-host Kathi Diamant smiled constantly,  hugging members of the studio audience. Her partner, Jerry G. Bishop, sang his  own version of "Yesterday." Natasha Josefewitz read a poem.  </P> <P> Above all, though, the show had the warmth and relaxed atmosphere that has  symbolized "Sun Up" for 30 years.  </P> <P> In its three-decade history, San Diego's morning talk show has not been  aggressive like "Donahue" or "Geraldo," nor was it a tabloid like "Sally Jessy  Raphael."  </P> <P> "Sun Up" was representative of the kind of old-time television programs that  once were chauvinistically termed women's shows in the industry. It included  cooking segments and friendly chats with celebrities. A few self-help tips were  usually included.  </P> <P> It was a kinder, gentler talk show.  </P> <P> Although not all the regulars and celebrities were available for Friday's  program, they were there in spirit.  </P> <P> The cancellation came after ratings for the show slumped during the past year,  but that didn't deter more than 100 people from gathering in the KFMB studio to  wish the show a fond farewell. Those tuning into the program for the first time  may not have understood the self-congratulatory and lackadaisical tone of the  final program, but it was quintessential "Sun Up."  </P> <P> Not much happened. People talked to each other and the hosts joked around,  trying desperately to keep things lively.  </P> <P> The final show brought together five "Sun Up" alumni, including Bob Mills, the  program's first host. He brought the show's concept to San Diego when he moved  here from Tulsa, Okla., in 1960.  </P> <P> The other ex-hosts on hand were Sue White, Mel Knoepp, Danuta and Shane, all of  whom shared memories of the show.  </P> <P> Not nearly enough vintage video clips were shown, but everyone told more than  enough stories to satiate the audience. Danuta fondly recalled the day she was  talked into diving into the killer whale pool at Sea World. White's favorite  was the time Mills apparently forgot they were on live television, and turned  to her and said, "Oh hell, it's time for the weather."  </P> <P> The studio atmosphere felt like a reunion. Many friends of Diamant and Bishop  were in the audience, and, during breaks, the hosts walked through the crowd  sharing greetings. Others in the crowd were simply fans who had spent many  mornings with the show. Several said they had seen the first "Sun Up" episode.  </P> <P> One woman held up a sign: "Like the southern belle she is, Kathi Diamant will  rise again."  </P> <P> Dan and Nicola Bernard were on hand to reminisce about their wedding, which  "Sun Up" aired live in 1986.  </P> <P> At least four public relations executives also attended. Through the years,  "Sun Up" has provided a willing forum to spotlight their clients.  </P> <P> " 'Sun Up' was a public relations person's dream," said Nikki Symington, who  owns a local company.  </P> <P> It was clear that an hour was not going to be enough time for all the  reminiscing the audience and hosts wanted to do.  </P> <P> Diamant, who was clearly working to control herself, finally broke into tears  when Bishop sang "Yesterday," as a montage of old photos of Bishop appeared on  the screen. She cried more when producer Pat Elwood joined them on stage, along  with the past hosts.  </P> <P> Finally, they ran a collection of clips, shots of the younger Bishop and  Diamant and the other hosts cavorting with guests.  </P> <P> And then, after 30 years, it was over.  </P></p>

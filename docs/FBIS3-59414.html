			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mona Scarisoreanu: "Eight Tons of Toxic Waste as </F> Humanitarian Assistance--for the Husi Hospital"]    [Text] Mr. Jelev, state secretary, head of the Department  of Environmental Protection in the Ministry of Waters, Forests,  and Environmental Protection, gave the following information  exclusively to ADEVARUL:    "We are constantly confronted with pressures from abroad for  the illegal entry of toxic wastes into Romania. These activities  proceed in the same way as drug trafficking and are therefore  very hard to control. Recently, there have been many of these  situations. The first took place at the Husi hospital. Aid that  was brought into Romania from Germany included about eight tons  of substances that fell under the category of toxic waste,  substances whose expiration dates have passed or even prohibited  substances. Discovered with the assistance of customs organs,  the Vaslui environmental protection agency, and the police, the  load was taken to the border under escort and left the territory  of Romania. It was fortunate that it was identified in time,  before the waste material was unloaded. Otherwise, the problem  of sending it back would have been much more difficult."</p>

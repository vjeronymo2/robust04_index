			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Travel: Please, sir - you don't speak English very well - Mark Hodson eats burnt eggs on a beach near Saigon and then finds Vietnamese schoolchildren don't think much of his accent IT IS not every day in Vietnam that you are invited to eat a cooked breakfast while watching the sun rise over the South China Sea. It even seemed worth the agony of getting up at 5.30. I arrived on the beach thinking it would be deserted. The previous afternoon, there had been just a handful of Saigon businessmen lying around on deck chairs wearing suits and ties. But by 6am, the mist was rising over the town of Nha Trang to reveal dozens of people, young and old, jogging up and down the sand, swimming and practising tai chi. Children in neat school uniforms played badminton without racquets, kicking the shuttlecock studiously over an imaginary net. Loud-hailers strung on lamp posts screamed out tinny tunes and workers' slogans. When I got to his cafe, Chieu yelped with excitement and ran over to shake my hand. 'I'm so glad you came,' he said. 'Sit down. I have coffee and eggs. Yes, eggs]' I was just in time to see the sun rise over the slick, grey water. The palm-lined beach stretched out of eyeshot in brochure-mocking perfection. Women wearing conical rice hats and scarves tied over their mouths swept the sand with long witches' brooms. An old man propped his bicycle against a tree and stood facing out to sea. Then, with great ceremony, he reached to the sky before bending to touch his toes. Breakfast was not going so well. I heard shouting from the kitchen and Chieu's friend came out to explain that they had forgotten the bread. He was very, very sorry. He would go and buy some. I assured him I was in no hurry but the eggs appeared within seconds, conspiring to be both burnt and under-cooked. Chieu's friend stayed to make sure I was enjoying them. I nodded furiously and, between smiles, tried to force down the eggs. Ten minutes later, the bread arrived: warm, oven-fresh baguettes. The cutlery and plate were made of aluminium. At the end of the war, thousands of pieces of abandoned military hardware were re-fashioned into basic commodities; even today, scrap metal remains one of the country's most important industries. Of all the legacies left by the Americans, this seemed the most bizarre: eating off plates that began life as aircraft parts. By the time the coffee arrived, the sun had risen high in the sky and the badminton players had gone to school. Chieu joined me for the customary tea chaser that follows the strong, gritty Vietnamese coffee. A dejected-looking man with a battered Pentax strolled over and asked if he could take my picture. It would cost me 15p. He was one of a dozen photographers who worked the beach, often outnumbering the tourists. He told me he had been a helicopter pilot during the war, fighting with the Americans. 'I was a lootenant,' he announced in a thick Brooklyn accent. Before the war he had taught architecture, but now he was forbidden to take a white-collar job. Later that day, I was back on the beach when a small man wearing thick glasses and a shabby black suit raced after me. 'May I please ask where you are going?' he asked. This was stunningly polite by Vietnamese standards. I had become used to shouts of 'You]' and 'Lien Xo]' ('Soviet]') which children yell at all westerners, mistaking them for Russian advisers. I told him I was just walking. 'So you are English,' he beamed. 'I can recognise your accent. I often listen to the World Service of the BBC. What are you doing in Vietnam?' I said I was a tourist and he looked pleased, nodding and smiling. 'You are very welcome to my country,' he said. 'My name is Dung.' Dung (pronounced Yoom) was 36, married with three children, and taught at a secondary school. He earned about Pounds 3.50 a month at the prevailing exchange rate and lived with his family in one room at the school. Dung topped up his income by translating articles from foreign newspapers. 'Teaching is a good job,' he said. 'I am very lucky.' Next day, I visited Dung's school and sat at the back of an open-air classroom as he gave an English lesson. He read from a tatty, 1960s American textbook, reciting phrases which his pupils would then repeat. That was the lesson. He asked me to take over. Under the watchful gaze of Ho Chi Minh, whose photograph was pinned above my head, I stood in front of 40 wide-eyed teenagers and read out a description of how American children celebrate Christmas. The pupils responded flawlessly, chanting their lines on cue: 'We find our presents. Under the tree.' But when I tried to chat with them individually, asking their names and ages, I drew a blank. They stood sharply to attention but said nothing. Later, I asked Dung about this. He seemed embarrassed. 'I'm very sorry,' he said. 'They have never heard English spoken by an English person. Please do not be offended, but they said your accent was not very good.' A useful brochure is that of the specialist company Asia Voyages, which features 19 countries. It says prices for 1994 are in many cases similar to 1993 and that, if customers wish to vary their hotels, use different airlines or alter their itineraries, this can generally be arranged. Of Vietnam, it says: 'The infrastructure is very poor, particularly outside Saigon and Hanoi, and you can expect very basic accommodation and simplistic food. Domestic flights are often over-booked, delayed and even cancelled, which can mean last-minute adjustments . . . However, the Vietnamese are very friendly and the dramatic scenery and . . . sights more than compensate for the discomfort and inconvenience.' Other countries covered in its new brochure include Bhutan, Burma, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Thailand. Asia Voyages is at 230 Station Road, Addlestone, Surrey KT15 2PH (tel. 0932-820 050).</p>

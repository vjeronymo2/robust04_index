			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- On 17 May, Finance Minister Rubens  Ricupero authorized Osiris Lopes Filho, head of the Federal  Revenue Secretariat [SRF], to implement an administrative  restructuring of the SRF in stages. The SRF now will have an  intelligence service charged with fighting tax evasion.  Ricupero's decision represents a victory for Lopes Filho in his  dispute with Finance Ministry executive secretary Clovis  Carvalho, who has opposed the creation of new positions of trust.    During the first stage, 580 new positions will be created at  a cost of 300,000 Real Value Units (URV's) monthly to fill four  new coordinating offices. The original SRF proposal envisioned  the creation of 2,000 positions at a cost of 1.2 million URV's  monthly.    The following coordinating offices will be created: Fiscal  Intelligence, which will be charged with fighting tax evasion;  Customs Assessment, which will identify cases of undercharging  of export products or overcharging of import items;  Classification and Nomenclature, which will monitor the  technological evolution of products; and Auditing and  Correction, which will oversee internal operations.    Furthermore, 18 special offices will be charged with  appraising the taxable wealth of taxpayers in court hearings, in  addition to their regular assessment duties. The SRF signed an  $80 million contract with the Inter-American Development Bank to  create automated regional centers to become self-sufficient in  data processing operations.    Lopes Filho welcomed Ricupero's decision, which he  characterized as "recognition of the significant role played by  the SRF." The project that appears to be most exciting for him  is the creation of the intelligence service. He said: The SRF  now will have instruments to fight tax evasion crimes.</p>

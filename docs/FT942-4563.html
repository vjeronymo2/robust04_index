			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Gooda admission on policies Profits reported in the 1980s by the Gooda Walker agency's syndicate 290 were largely earned by 'time-and-distance' insurance policies, Mr Derek Walker, the former Gooda Walker chairman, admitted in the High Court yesterday. However, he denied he had traded in these policies in an attempt to attract new Lloyd's Names to his syndicate and so expand his business. Giving evidence in the High Court action brought against the agency by more than 3,000 Names, Mr Walker agreed with Mr Geoffrey Vos QC that his dealing in the policies had helped the spectacular growth of syndicate 290 in the 1980s. Time-and-distance policies are a form of reinsurance to allow syndicates to manage reserves against claims several years after the start of policies. Mr Walker agreed that their use had boosted the syndicates' reported profits in 1981 to Pounds 2.5m from a Pounds 700,000 loss on all other business. In 1987 they took a Pounds 2.4m profit up to Pounds 8.1m, he agreed. The use of such policies by syndicate 290 had come as a surprise in parts of the Lloyd's market and had only been clearly disclosed in 1987, Mr Vos said. Mr Walker replied that the time-and-distance dealings had been disclosed to auditors preparing the syndicate's accounts. Earlier, Mr Walker denied he had been driven to build up syndicate 290 to prove his ability to the market following his Old Bailey trial in 1981 when he was accused of conspiracy and eventually acquitted. Mr Vos asked him whether he had been aware that Mr Peter Green, then Lloyd's chairman, had opposed his return to the insurance market following his trial. Mr Walker said he had been unaware of this. The case continues on Monday.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ fish exports thrive in the cold - Sales were up last year in both value and volume IN SPITE of the worst weather for decades, New Zealand's fish exports thrived last year. The Fishing Industry Board published figures this month showing that in the year to December 31, earnings surged 26.7 per cent to a record NZDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 430m). The optimism raised by the growing importance of New Zealand fish exports has been dampened in recent weeks, however, by the nationwide ban on the taking of shellfish imposed because of the appearance of an as yet unidentified strain of algal bloom. For the first time New Zealanders have been brought face to face with the vulnerability of the fishing industry: until the present outbreak algal infections were unknown, and the country prided itself on its clean coastal waters. While the algae affect only shellfish the fishing industry is concerned that overseas buyers may be put off New Zealand fish in general. This month's figures show the vibrant state of the industry, which is a growing employer with thousands now engaged in processing fish for export. Export earnings rose month by month, even in the harsh stormy winter months when bitterly cold temperatures reduced fish numbers and kept boats in port. Fishing Industry Board figures for the year to December 31 show that the exports of fin fish totalled 204.6m tonnes, a 5 per cent rise from 1991. And the fob value rose 28.5 per cent to NZDollars 855.28m from 1991's NZDollars 665.82m. Earnings for rock lobster, much of which is exported live to Japan and the US, slipped in the last quarter, however, because of recessionary trends and lower catches. The total amount exported of live, whole, and processed rock lobster, known as crayfish in New Zealand, fell 1.5 per cent to 2,792 tonnes; and its value was down 0.4 per cent at NZDollars 101,441,462. There was a remarkable boom in squid catching: helped by weather conditions that were harsh on other species. Cold weather and strong currents from Australia apparently boosted the amount of nutrients in the water, to the squid's advantage. The squid catch for the year to December was up 59 per cent to 44,696 tonnes, which fetched 44.3 per cent more at NZDollars 80.14m. The economic loss caused by the temporary closure of the mussel industry is shown by the increasing production of recent years. In the year to December 31 the value of mussel exports rose 26.3 per cent to NZDollars 48.5m on a 22.2 per cent increase in tonnage produced. New production of scallops led to a 33.7 per cent increase in value to NZDollars 20m. But this was on a production increase of 66.8 per cent to 1,000 tonnes. The new production, mainly from Golden Bay, at the tip of the South Island, has led to a halving in prices to about NZDollars 20 a kilogram. While the remarkably cold water temperatures encouraged the squid, other varieties were far less enthusiastic, especially the important white fish variety hoki, which is now exported in large quantities to Britain, Europe and the US. In the peak fishing month of August only 5.94m tonnes were landed, compared with 13.1m tonnes in the same month in 1991. However hoki exports earned 32.1 per cent more last year, at NZDollars 423m, thanks to a 20 per cent increase in the amount sold in frozen filleted form.</p>

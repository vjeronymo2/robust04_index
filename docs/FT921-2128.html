			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price retreat continues AS GOLD slumped to new near-six-year lows yesterday dealers desperately attempted to identify the east European central bank said to be responsible for the wave of selling that has put relentless downward pressure on the price this week. Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst with the Williams de Broe financial services group, pointed out that, once the market identified the bank, it would know how much gold was likely to sold. She said the Baltic states, which had six tonnes of gold returned by the UK and Sweden recently, were most likely to be responsible. Five central banks - those of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia - told Reuter they had not sold the gold. In London at one stage yesterday the metal's price dropped to Dollars 336.50 a troy ounce. It closed at Dollars 336,85, down Dollars 3.75.</p>

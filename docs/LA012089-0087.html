			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Fifteen years after Congress enacted a law to protect endangered species, most  of the nearly 500 types of animals and plants show no signs of recovery and  many continue their slide toward extinction, a congressional study said. The  General Accounting Office criticized a practice by the Fish and Wildlife  Service of concentrating on high-profile species, such as the bald eagle and  Aleutian Canada goose, over species on the verge of extinction. "Instead of  giving priority to the most endangered species and to those actions needed to  prevent extinctions in the foreseeable future, as required by its guidelines,  FWS instead is concentrating recovery funds on species with high 'public  appeal' and those approaching recovery," the GAO wrote. "FWS officials told GAO  that the desire for a positive public view of the program . . . is motivating  its actions." Rep. Gerry E. Studds (D-Mass.), who requested the study by the  congressional watchdog agency, said the GAO's conclusions "reinforce my own  view that a more serious and professional approach to protecting endangered  species is required if the goals of federal law are to be met."  </P></p>

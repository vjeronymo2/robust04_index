			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Parties back relocation plan RELOCATION of a civil service unit from London to Aberdeen, leading to the creation of a European oil industry centre, will be promised in today's Scottish Conservative manifesto, Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary said yesterday. The plan involves about 80 civil servants from the Department of Energy's Exploration and Development Appraisal Unit, which negotiates and approves oilfield developments. It is calculated that this could save the government Pounds 7m. Mr Neil Kinnock has said relocation would be a certainty under Labour. The Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats also back the idea.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Toshiba and Apple join forces TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics company, and Apple Computer, the US personal computer maker, yesterday joined forces to develop a next-generation portable consumer electronics product capable of reproducing video images and sound from a small laser disc. The agreement is an important item in Apple's strategy of developing a range of hand-held, digital electronic devices as an adjunct to its basic business. Apple calls the devices 'personal digital assistants'. For Toshiba, the agreement opens the possibility of reviving growth in the company's flagging consumer electronics business. Over the past year, Toshiba has quietly withdrawn all its audio products, such as tape recorders and stereo systems, although it remains a large manufacturer of televisions and white goods. The companies yesterday had little specific information about the planned product, except that it would be marketed by the middle of next year and be based on CD-ROM, compact discs with read-only memory. The companies were also talking to Time Warner, the media conglomerate in which Toshiba has a 6.25 per cent stake, about providing titles to play on the machines. Very likely, the machine will have a small display, be capable of reproducing moving video images, and allow for interaction with the user. The companies hoped to sell 5m of the devices annually by 1995. The market for the type of product that Apple and Toshiba have in mind, however, has yet to be established, and is already becoming crowded with potentially competing devices. Indeed, Mr John Sculley, Apple chairman, said Apple would launch a consumer CD-ROM device before Christmas, and it was unclear yesterday how, or whether, the two products would be related. Philips has already launched a CD-I (CD interactive) format that has failed to stimulate much interest in the market. Yesterday, Philips and JVC said they would further develop the format for use as a motion picture singalong karaoke system. Sony has also successfully launched its Data Discman, an electronic book device that allows for simple interactive functions. A basic problem facing all makers of such machines is the lack of appealing software, or titles to play. Both Nintendo and Sega Enterprises have launched CD-ROM machines for games. CDs have attracted attention because they can store a huge amount of textual, video or audio data while allowing almost instant access. Apple is trying to generate excitement among consumers about the devices and is hoping to use its expertise in software development and user interaction to produce a machine that stimulates demand and establishes a de facto industry standard. Apple said it selected Toshiba as a partner because of Toshiba's expertise in semiconductors and miniaturisation, and because of its links with Time Warner. Toshiba also has experience in the consumer electronics field, which Apple lacks. PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, is teaming up with JVC, the Japanese audio equipment manufacturer, to produce a karaoke version of the Dutch company's new 'interactive' compact disc, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. The two companies said yesterday that they expected to be able to make a large number of 'karaoke CDs' available by the end of the year, enabling consumers to enjoy karaoke at home. Compact Disc Interactive (CD-I), which Philips is launching this week in continental Europe after earlier launches in the UK and the US, combines images, sound, graphics, and texts on a single CD. When hooked up to a television, the new CD-I player will be able to play karaoke CDs that flash the words to songs on to the television screen.</p>

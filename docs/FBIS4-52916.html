			<p>BFN     [Text] American serviceman Pvt. Kenneth Markle, convicted  of murdering a Tongduchon bar hostess, will be turned over to  Korean authorities Tuesday to be put in a Korean prison.    The U.S. Forces in Korea notified Friday the Korean  government of its decision to transfer the 22-year-old soldier  from West Virginia on Tuesday in accordance with the Status of  Forces Agreement (SOFA), a spokesman for the Prosecutor  General's Office said yesterday.    Markle, whose sentence of 15 years imprisonment was  confirmed  by the Supreme Court on April 29, will serve his term in Chonan  Juvenile Prison some 100 km south of Seoul.    Under SOFA, U.S. Forces authorities can reject Korean  authorities' request for the transfer of American military  personnel and their family members who "committed crime," and  the former can reject it through "sympathetic consideration."    But the military authorities are obligated to comply with  any  request for the transfer of "convicted criminals."    Markle was sentenced last year to life imprisonment in the  1992 death of the bar hostess, Yun Kum-i, who was then 22, and  the sentence was reduced to 15 years in jail by an appellate  court.</p>

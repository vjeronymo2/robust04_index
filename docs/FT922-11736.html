			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / French car industry criticised on training and productivity THE French car industry must make huge improvements in worker training and cut 2.5 per cent of its labour force annually until the end of the decade if it is to survive, according to a government-commissioned report published yesterday. The study, for the Commissariat Generale au Plan, the state planning commission, says the industry must make 'gigantic efforts' to survive Japanese competition, due to hit the protected French market with full force from 1999 when all import quotas on Japanese cars are due to end. The industry lost 115,000 jobs between 1981 and 1990, but needs to lose many thousands more of their 320,000 direct employees over the next eight years, says the report. The industry's technology is competitive, finds the report, the result of a year-long study by industry and union experts. But the average French car worker compares badly with British counterparts at the Nissan factory in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, which the report finds potentially as efficient as Japanese staff. French car workers are 'relatively old, often little trained or untrained, and sometimes even illiterate ..manual workers do not seem very motivated,' writes Mr Gilbert Rutman, the report's author and honorary president of Elf Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group. The average age of workers at one of Renault's main fact-ories at Flins near Paris is 45, as against 28 at Nissan UK, for example. In 1989, nearly half the French car industry workforce had no professional diploma, it says. Of the total, only 2.4 per cent had a higher diploma as against the 13.1 per cent French national average. Mr Rutman calls for a restructuring plan similar to that of the state-owned steel industry in the 1980s, and for subsidised training schemes to improve young workers' skills.</p>

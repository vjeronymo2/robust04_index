			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> TEAM IS WAITING PATIENTLY FOR BO  </P> <P> Bo Jackson, football's Mr. October, has finished his summer of baseball with  the Kansas City Royals and is expected to join the Raiders soon. How soon?  </P> <P> "Bo will let us know when he's going to arrive," Raider Coach Art Shell said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Jackson usually takes a week or so to refuel his jets. Shell isn't saying how  Jackson will be used in a backfield already stocked with Marcus Allen and Greg  Bell.  </P> <P> "When he gets here, he'll practice, he'll work and he'll get into the rotation  like everyone else," Shell said.  </P> <P> Does Bo do anything like anyone else?  </P> <P> Shell said defensive end Mike Wise's ankle is better, but no decision has been  made on whether he'll play Sunday night against the Bills in Buffalo.

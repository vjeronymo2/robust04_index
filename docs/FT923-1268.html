			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UN peace plan for Cambodia in trouble UNITED NATIONS efforts to ensure free elections in Cambodia are in trouble because of the 'persistent failure' of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group to abide by peace agreements reached in Paris, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, said yesterday. In a report to the Security Council he voiced serious concern over the continuing refusal of the Khmer Rouge to allow UN military and civilian personnel access to the zones it controls. Its forces still eluded demobilisation, he added. Mr Boutros Ghali suggested the co-chairmen of the Paris conference - the French and Indonesian foreign ministers - hold talks to find a way out of what he acknowledged is an impasse. If this proved impossible they could explore 'appropriate steps' to ensure realisation of the fundamental objectives of the accord. With a budget of Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.11bn) the UN operation, begun last November with great fanfare, is the most ambitious of its kind. From the start the Khmer Rouge, the country's largest guerrilla army, was reluctant to co-operate. 'It is clear the time is approaching when some difficult decisions regarding ways and means of pursuing this operation will have to be considered,' Mr Boutros Ghali wrote in a gloomy account of the situation. The Khmer Rouge leadership must be told of the UN's resolve to implement its peace-keeping mandates 'vigorously and to the full'. To that end the Security Council might want to take further action to emphasise the international community's determination to bring peace to Cambodia and enable its people to look to a better future. The UN peace-keeping authority in Cambodia is to take direct control of the country's central bank, a spokesman for the world body said yesterday, Reuter adds from Phnom Penh.</p>

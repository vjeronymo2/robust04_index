			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock attacks PM over jobless LABOUR yesterday stepped up its attack on the government's handling of the economy and claimed that its own Budget measures would lead to falling unemployment in 1993. On the eve of the publication of his party's manifesto, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, criticised Mr John Major for doing nothing to end the recession and for accepting that unemployment would continue to rise for the rest of this year. Speaking at a press conference in London, Mr Kinnock said ministers had no positive plans to pull Britain out of recession. 'In the face of a collapse in investment, skills shortages, rising unemployment, record business failures and rock-bottom confidence, they do nothing. They have not a single useful initiative to offer.' At the same press conference Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said a further 500,000 jobs were at risk during the remainder of this year if present policies continued. He also released figures showing that business failures early this year were running at a rate 25 per cent higher than in the last two months of 1991. Mr Kinnock said his party's Budget would prove far more effective in helping bring the recession to an end. He said Labour's proposals were more 'responsibly reflationary' than those of the government. Although the Budget was fiscally neutral, the party's decision to increase incomes for people earning up to Pounds 21,000 a year, at the expense of top earners, would raise personal spending on necessities rather than more expensive goods. As a result, the party's economic strategy was less prone to being undermined by significant increases in imports. Labour's 'job rich' Budget would therefore be more likely to create more jobs in Britain. Mr Kinnock said Labour would not mislead the nation into believing that 'a switch could be thrown' to move the economy from recession to immediate recovery. But he and Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said that Labour's proposals would begin to take effect as soon as they were implemented. Mr Smith said that his measures would see the rise in unemployment start to slow down late this year, with the number of jobless falling in 1993.</p>

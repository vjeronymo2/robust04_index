			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> 2 TRUSTEES DENOUNCE CHANCELLOR'S RAISE  </P> <P> The Rancho Santiago Community College District Board of Trustees voted in favor  of a $5,500 pay raise to Chancellor Robert D. Jensen this week, but two board  members denounced the decision as too costly.  </P> <P> The raise brings Jensen's annual salary to $102,980.  </P> <P> Trustees Charles (Pete) Maddox and Brian E. Conley said they objected to the  increased salary because of financial burdens on the district. They added that  their opposition was not based on Jensen's job performance.  </P> <P> "There's not a lot of question about his effectiveness as chancellor," Maddox  said. "It's merely a question of economics. We are headed towards some really  tough economic times, and we are all going to have to bite the bullet."  </P> <P> Board President Shirley Ralston defended the pay raise, which she said is  consistent with the cost-of-living adjustment given to all faculty members.  </P> <P> "Everyone else got the same cost-of-living adjustment, so why shouldn't the  chancellor be included?" Ralston said. "He is one of the best chancellors in  the state, and when you don't give him a simple cost-of-living raise, that  sends a message."  </P> <P> Jensen, who has been chancellor of the district since 1984, has a four-year  contract that expires in 1994.  </P></p>

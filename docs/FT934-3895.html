			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Leading Article: The dangers of delay Next Monday is supposed to be a momentous day in Middle East history. Three months ago, standing on the White House lawn, the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation set it as the date when they would start implementing their peace agreement. By then, they would have negotiated a detailed interim agreement for a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Gaza Strip and from an enclave around the West Bank town of Jericho, and for the establishment of a Palestinian self-governing authority in the areas so vacated. The first opportunity for these historic enemies to prove they could live as neighbours would be at hand, and further Israeli treaties with Jordan, Syria and Lebanon might conceivably lie around the corner. This week's reality seems far removed from that euphoric moment. Negotiations on arrangements for Israeli withdrawal are making heavy weather, with the parties apparently far apart on such fundamental issues as the precise West Bank area from which Israel is supposed to be pulling out and the position of Jewish settlements within areas under future Palestinian control. As the danger grows that the peace timetable to which Mr Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Mr Yassir Arafat of the PLO committed themselves on September 13 will slip, so, too, does the risk to the peace process as a whole. Detailed agreements Already, depressingly familiar reflexes are coming to the fore. A spiral of violence in the occupied territories and in Israel proper has claimed 32 Palestinian lives and 16 Israeli ones since the peace agreement was signed. Partly as a result, support for the peace process in Israel has slipped. In the absence of tangible benefits on the ground, dissension among Palestinians in the occupied territories and within the PLO is reaching a new pitch. And a more comprehensive Middle East peace continues to move at the barely visible pace of its slowest but most important partners, Israel and Syria. None of these developments has yet put the prospects of peace in terminal jeopardy. Israel and the PLO have managed in recent weeks to reach detailed agreements on self-rule and security in the Gaza Strip, and are pressing ahead with talks on Jericho and on economic relations. Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, is in the region attempting to nudge things forward. Nevertheless, if the Israeli-PLO timetable does slip, it will be an ominous sign. Setting a date for withdrawal of troops was itself the most important earnest of Israel's intent. Mr Rabin may argue that the really important date is not December 13 but April 13, when Israel has promised to complete its pull-out, and that he would rather have a precise and well-formulated agreement than a rushed and incomplete one. But he should know that in the Middle East, time is always a luxury. There are two particular dangers in the current delay. One is that some particularly horrific act of violence will reverse the momentum towards peace. The other is that Israel will not have a credible Palestinian negotiating partner. Unequal affair This peace agreement has always been an unequal affair, with Mr Rabin negotiating from strength and Mr Arafat from a position of abject weakness. Since its conclusion, however, the difficulties on the Palestinian side have multiplied. To be sure, these problems are in large part of Mr Arafat's own making: even close colleagues who support the peace deal now accuse him of bungling its aftermath by monopolising decision-making and failing to set up a sensible institutional framework for self-rule. None of this augurs well for the PLO chairman in his forthcoming guise as de facto governor of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Yet the fact remains that Mr Arafat is the only person who could have struck the Palestinian side of the Washington agreement, and is still the only leader who can keep enough of the movement together to deliver on the PLO's promises. In the next few days, both Israel and the PLO must make a redoubled effort to reach agreement in time to start at least a limited withdrawal next week. But if they fail, Mr Rabin must be ready with alternative signals that the process remains on course. What cannot be allowed to happen is an uncontrolled slippage.</p>

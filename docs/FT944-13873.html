			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Bolivia's way to shed state sector: Local version of privatisation planned in wake of stabilisation success In government offices in the centre of La Paz, the lights are burning late. Fifteen months into the four-year presidency of Mr Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada, officials are working furiously on the details of a project they hope will change the shape of the Bolivian economy. The project aims at transferring to the private sector state enterprises together responsible for about one-eighth of economic activity. The process is not being called privatisation. Opinion polls, says Mr Edgar Saravia, a senior government official, showed that Bolivians associate privatisation with a loss of national sovereignty and corruption. The Bolivian version - called capitalisation - aims to skirt these perceived objections. It proposes bringing in foreign investors to take a strategic equity stake in the six enterprises, and then a distribution of up to 50 per cent of the remaining shares to the estimated 3.8m adult Bolivians. These shares will be placed in special pension accounts to be drawn on an annuity basis when the holders turn 60. For a country where only 350,000 people - 5 per cent of the population  - have bank accounts, this is an ambitious undertaking. But the government believes it necessary to lift economic growth to levels which will start to have an impact on poverty. The country is the poorest in the western hemisphere after Haiti and, according to the World Bank, about 70 per cent of the population are poor - living on less than a dollar a day. Bolivia was one of the first countries in Latin America to introduce a successful economic stabilisation plan to bring down inflation. In 1985, while planning minister, Mr Sanchez de Losada introduced the programme to attack annual inflation of over 23,000 per cent. Inflation has come down - to a forecast 6.8-7.3 per cent this year from 9.1 per cent last. But growth, while mostly positive - it should reach 4.5 per cent this year - has not been enough to affect poverty levels. Unlike most of its regional neighbours, Bolivia failed to follow its stabilisation plan with privatisations and other reforms of its economic structure. This has meant, the government reasons, inadequate investment and therefore slow growth. Public sector investment at 9 per cent of GDP has been higher than in most Latin American economies. But according to a World Bank report completed this month: 'For the most part, these public resources have been misallocated and invested inefficiently.' Private sector investment has been running at a weak 5 per cent of GDP. The aim is to use capitalisation to develop the productive and export potential, particularly of the energy and mining sectors, and to triple private sector investment. With public investment falling to around 5 per cent, the overall investment rate of 20 per cent or more should help to accelerate growth. There are difficulties with the capitalisation approach. Unlike in a privatisation where government revenues are boosted in the initial years, capitalisation implies short-term costs for the government, because it receives no revenues. This and other reforms will boost the budget deficit next year and in 1996. According to an agreement signed in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund, the deficit will widen to 4.4 per cent of GDP next year, from an estimated 3.3 per cent this year, and in 1996 it will widen further. The government hopes that the sales of the stakes to strategic investors will be completed by July next year. To be capitalised are: YPFB, the state oil company, which accounts for about 9 per cent of GDP. Its greatest resources are gas rather than oil, output of which has been falling slowly since the 1970s. The company's valuation will be boosted substantially - perhaps by two to three times - if potential investors perceive that preliminary agreements to export gas to northern Chile and Brazil will come to fruition soon. It could receive a capital injection of more than Dollars 1bn, according to some private estimates. Entel, the long-distance telephone carrier. It connects 260,000 telephone lines - most run by regionally-based co-operatives. This could, the government estimates, rise to more than 1m by the year 2003. Revenues have grown 70 per cent in the past five years to Dollars 101m last year. ENDE, the state electricity company, and the first to be capitalised. It generates more than a half of Bolivia's electricity. The country's market is small - currently there is 760MW of installed capacity - but it is hoped that the possibility of generating electricity to the country's neighbours will entice investors. ENFE, the state railway company. It could be split into three or left as a single entity. The government may leave it open to allow bidders for one, two or three entities. The lines are likely to remain formally in state hands and handed over in 99-year concessions to the operating companies. LAB, the state-run airline. This is not going to be the easiest capitalisation: a seminar to orientate potential investors was cancelled when only three showed interest in turning up. ENAF, smelters and associated mines. This is essentially what is left of the Bolivian state mining operations that once dominated the economy. The aim is to capitalise the smelters and offer leases on associated mines, which cannot be sold without changing the constitution. After promising an early start to capitalisation, Mr Sanchez de Losada got bogged down with other legislation. An overall capitalisation law was passed, but six more important pieces of legislation are needed for privatisation, including a law establishing a regulatory system for the companies, electricity, telecommunications, and hydrocarbons laws, a tax reform law, and a revised mining code. Despite trouble this month with his governing coalition, the US-educated president appears to have secured for himself the necessary majority in both houses of Congress to pass the legislation. There is a lot riding on capitalisation, and the president knows it. 'All my bets are placed on it. I'm a goner if it doesn't work,' he said in an interview last week.</p>

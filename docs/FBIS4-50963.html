			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- The Information Bureau  of the CPC Central Committee's Propaganda Department sponsored a  national forum of periodicals for professional journalists at  NANFANG RIBAO in Guangzhou 8-10 May. The purpose of the forum  was to study ways to improve the management of journals in  conjunction with the implementation of the national propaganda  and ideological work conference guidelines, to bring into full  play the press' role in correct guidance of public opinion, and  to prompt the media to more effectively carry out the task of  "guiding the people with correct public opinion."    The forum was attended by officials from RENMIN RIBAO'S  XINWEN ZHANXIAN [JOURNALISTIC FRONT], XINHUA NEWS AGENCY's  ZHONGGUO JIZHE [CHINESE JOURNALISTS], and the Central Television  Station's JIANSHI YANJIU [TELEVISION STUDY]; as well as from 15  central and local journalistic periodicals and research  institutes in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei, Sichuan,  Shaanxi, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang. Xu Xinhua, director of the  Information Bureau, chaired and spoke at the forum.    Along with the rapid development of the journalistic  undertaking since reform and opening up, the number of  journalistic periodicals in publication has increased to more  than 30, forming an important component of the journalistic  undertaking. They have played a significant role and achieved  fruitful results in promoting theoretical research of  journalism, pressing for journalistic reform, and enhancing  journalists' political and professional qualities. In the light  of the realities of management, the forum's participants  analyzed in depth the current condition of journalistic  periodicals, exchanged experiences in managing the journals  under new circumstances, and further clarified the orientation  in management. They believed that along with the progress in  reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive, it is  necessary for the journals to bring into full play their role in  correct guidance by studying journalistic theories, summarizing  journalist work experiences, identifying practical problems, and  enhancing the overall quality of journalists.    The forum participants deemed the strengthening of guidance  with ideology and theory as the core issue of the role of  journals in correctly guiding public opinion. How should the  media guide people with correct public opinion in the great  cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics? How  should the media cope with the requirements for developing a  socialist market economy in the course of establishing such a  structure? How should the media keep abreast of the demand for  building socialist spiritual civilization? To find the answers  to these questions, journalistic periodicals should persist in  taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics as the guide and adhere to the party's  basic line in actively guiding journalists to study new  circumstances, to summarize new experiences, and to solve new  problems. They should uphold the principle of party spirit and  the party's basic principles in going all out to conduct the  study of journalistic theories, promoting journalistic reform,  and improving the quality of press publicity. They should  enhance their sense of responsibility and awareness of the  overall interests, of reform and opening up, and of  investigations and study to ensure good reviewing and guidance  work through press publicity. Efforts should be made to publish  journals having more theoretical, salient, relevant, and  creative features.    The forum participants deemed the enhancement of the overall  quality of journalists as one of the journals' major tasks.  Efforts should be made to improve journalists' ethical  standards; and to encourage them to mingle with the masses, to  go deep into reality, to work hard, honestly, and with  self-discipline, and to conscientiously resist "compensated  journalism" and other unhealthy practices. It is necessary to  encourage the journalistic circles to turn out outstanding works  and train talented personnel for producing special columns,  reporters, editors, and commentators well known among readers.  It is also necessary to bring into play the journals' functions  as the "mobile schools of journalism" in helping journalists  improve their political and professional qualities and update  their knowledge and concepts.    The forum participants urged journalistic periodicals to  adhere to their publication objective, and work hard to publish  journals with distinctive features. While improving operations  and management, they should persist in putting social benefits  first, and strive to win support from journalists and to combine  social with economic benefits. Leaders of the relevant  departments and journalistic units should regard improved  management of journals as an important measure for strengthening  theoretical study of journalism and for improving journalists'  quality, and should attach importance to and support journals'  work.    The forum participants also reached a common understanding  on  increasing contacts and coordination to pool the efforts of all.</p>

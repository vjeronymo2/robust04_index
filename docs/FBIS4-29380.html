			<p>BFN     [Text] A news conference was held at our country's embassy  in Moscow on 15 June regarding our country's Foreign Ministry  statement dated 13 June on our withdrawal from the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Reporters from Russian papers and  news agencies attended the news conference.    Our country's ambassador Son Song-pil answered reporters'  questions. He explained in detail the background of our  country's Foreign Ministry statement and pointed out: A  spokesman for our country's Foreign Ministry issued a statement  taking stern measures against the IAEA's unjust maneuvers of  imposing sanctions against our country and its attempt to  intrude into our country's military sites.    The action taken by our country is a due measure against the  IAEA's unjust maneuvers. The IAEA Board of Governors meeting,  following the U.S. policy of crushing the DPRK, adopted a  resolution on suspending the agency's assistance to our country  and demanded the opening of our military sites. This is  obviously the agency's sanctions against us and, in essence, a  prelude to UN sanctions.    Saying that we have made every possible effort regarding the  core refueling operation, the envoy continued that the United  States and the IAEA are, however, making a stir to impose  sanctions and said: The IAEA sanctions are an intolerable  humiliation to our people. Our people cannot negotiate with  someone that infringes upon our nation's sovereignty and  dignity. The more sanctions or pressures that are imposed on  us, the stronger our volition will become and the freer our  peaceful nuclear activities will become The stronger the  pressure becomes, the more our people will sternly deal with it.  It is our principled stance to respond to dialogue with dialogue  and war with war. Sanctions and dialogue are incompatible. It  is absurd that they insist on having dialogue while imposing  pressure and sanctions.    He then answered the reporters' questions.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The former presidential candidate of AD [Democratic  Action], Claudio Fermin, categorically and absolutely rejected  the dissolution of the National Congress advocated by Causa R  [Radical Cause], a party he feels "is based on antidemocratic  concepts; moreover, it does not address what the country needs  for its progress and well-being."    He believes such proposals are common in parties like Causa  R  when they do not win the people's support. "They try to  eliminate all centers of free discussion and to denigrate all  institutions. I think that proposal is not in harmony with the  country's aspirations; we need forums for debate, centers for  legislation, for the supervision of public services, not a  totalitarian, dictatorial schema that is alien from any true  decision-making by the people."    Fermin thus expressed his absolute opposition to the  proposal  by Causa R's Deputy Pablo Medina and added that, as a democrat,  a member of a party that wants a society in which all may  participate and develop programs, he cannot support a proposal  that is compatible with a totalitarian society, which propagates  the view that the best thing is to eliminate parliaments, laws,  and anything else that may be troublesome for minority groups  that want to establish their power over the people and against  the people.    He believes that is the explanation behind Causa R's  proposal. "This organization's behavior is contrary to the  harmonious coexistence of the Venezuelan people."    He said that Medina and his party have made an isolated  proposal that will not go anywhere, "for this society has for  many years grown accustomed to electing municipal councils,  legislatures, mayors, governors, senators and deputies, all of  which provide the foundation for popular representation."</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Beckman Instruments Inc.: The Fullerton company reported first-quarter profit  of $8 million, down 25% from the same period in 1989.  </P> <P> Sales for the quarter were $185.5 million, a decrease of 7% from the year  before. The decrease was blamed on a reduction in government funding for  biological research, unusually large shipments in the 1989 quarter, a movement  by customers toward operating leases instead of purchases and an increase in  research and development expenses. Beckman develops and manufactures automated  systems and supplies used in biological research laboratories.  </P></p>

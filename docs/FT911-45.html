			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Severn Trent places a BET on waste FT-SE Index: 2,486.6 (-37.7) The problem with BET's Pounds 212m agreed sale of Biffa to Severn Trent is its timing. BET not only has a chief executive so new he is unready to elaborate a corporate strategy following the sale; it is also in purdah ahead of its annual results, so the precise shape of its balance sheet can only be guessed at. The most one can say is that BET will now be in much better financial health: it could scarcely be worse. Assuming net debt of Pounds 240m, its gearing might be 40 per cent, against 86 per cent. Treating its AMPS (auction market preferred stock) as debt, gearing has dropped to around 150 per cent. BET has every reason to be satisfied with an exit multiple of 18, close to what it always said the assets should fetch. With a guaranteed 9p final dividend, its shares are already on a prospective yield of 6.7 per cent; add in the interim payment and the yield is just under 10 per cent. This seems about right until the group sets out its plans. Only a few weeks ago, after all, the shares were yielding more than half as much again. It is Severn Trent's shareholders who might have cause for concern, given that the price is well above rumoured sighting shots of nearer Pounds 170m and will probably mean dilution for a couple of years. The diversification into waste management is sensible enough, but Severn's record is hardly inspiring - remember Caird. The quality of Biffa's earnings is not so self-evident that Severn can claim a definite success. Any revaluation of Biffa's implied Pounds 85m of assets will make interesting reading. If it finally does buy Caird later this year, Severn will have a national spread in the management of waste. Shareholders must hope it does not become a waste of management.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Advance at Bear Stearns shows Wall Street bullish BEAR Stearns yesterday provided the first evidence that Wall Street's earnings spree continues unabated when the publicly-owned securities house reported record third-quarter profits of Dollars 110.42m. The firm's profits, which cover the three months to the end of March, were 21 per cent higher than the Dollars 91.34m in the same quarter of 1992, and were made on revenues of Dollars 570.64m, up from Dollars 532.32m a year earlier. Bear Stearns said its strong earnings reflected sig-nificant increases in revenues across most main lines of business. The investment banking unit put in the best performance, with revenues jumping 32 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 87.9m, as the firm rode the boom in demand from US and foreign corporations for stock and bond underwriting services. In the first three months of the year, Bear Stearns was the eighth biggest underwriter of debt and equity on Wall Street, handling 55 issues worth a total of Dollars 11.7bn. Revenues from principal transactions were also up in the third quarter, to a record Dollars 320.3m, 3.5 per cent higher than a year earlier. The firm said its trading of fixed-income and over-the-counter securities was especially busy in the first three months of the year. Commission revenues came in at Dollars 112.7m, up almost 8 per cent on 1992, due to increased demand for the firm's correspondent clearing operations. Bear Stearns' bottom line was helped by a modest 3.7 per cent increase in non-interest expenses to Dollars 387.2m. In comparison, the firm's revenues rose 7.2 per cent in the quarter. The largest component of costs, employee compensation and benefits, rose 5.4 per cent to Dollars 276m. The figures were well received on Wall Street. Buyers bid Bear Stearns' shares up Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 19 at the close on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

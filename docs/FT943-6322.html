			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Corporate disclosure A great deal of nonsense has been talked about the new insider dealing rules which came into force on March 1. The changes were introduced in order to comply with a Brussels directive, not to improve the chances of securing convictions for insider dealing. On the contrary, the authorities believe that, if anything, they could make it more difficult. Admittedly, the new rules have a broader scope and in theory appear severely to restrict informal communications between companies and analysts. But, whatever the letter of the law, the authorities have no interest in preventing normal information flows. It is the cosy chats where analysts' forecasts are steered down with a nudge and a wink that they want to stop and these were banned under the old rules. The scaremongering that accompanied the changes created some alarm and confusion among companies. But the fact that their behaviour seems to have changed little suggests that most were fairly careful about their communications anyway. Most companies believe the new rules make their investor relations more difficult but for those that remain worried about the implications there is one simple rule: when in doubt put an announcement out. Yet companies still seem to be shy of taking the obvious step of issuing quarterly statements.</p>

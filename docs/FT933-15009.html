			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Books: An artistic slant on urban reality / Review of a batch of new interpretations of famous painters and their works THE IMPRESSIONIST AND THE CITY: PISSARRO'S SERIES PAINTINGS by Richard R Brettell and Joachim Pissarro Yale Pounds 35/Pounds 18.95, 230 pages THE COLLECTED WRITINGS OF ROBERTMOTHERWELL edited by Stephanie Terenzio Oxford Pounds 35, 325 pages MARCEL DUCHAMP by Jacques Caumont and Jennifer Gough-Cooper Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 45, 520 pages VISITORS TO the Pissarro exhibition at the Royal Academy in London until October 10 will find their interest in it strengthened by perusal of Richard R. Brettell and Joachim Pissarro's The Impressionist and the City: Pissarro's Series Paintings. Among other things the volume informs us which paintings were shown in Dallas (where the show opened last year) but not in London and vice versa. Since the artist died the components of each series have been dispersed over many collections. When he painted his views of Paris, Rouen, Le Havre and Dieppe, Pissarro's intention was to show the motifs in each city under a variety of different circumstances and effects of light. Joachim Pissarro discusses how the notion of making a series of paintings of a city developed within the Impressionist movement - 'the multiplication of representations of a given site as its aspects change'. This was enthusiastically taken up by Pissarro, who produced these pictures in a burst of creativity in his 60s and early 70s. Before this Pissarro had been exclusively a painter of rural life. In Pissarro's friend Monet's paintings of city life everything within the frame of the painting merges into a unified whole. In his own there is great differentiation; individual figures of horse-driven carriages and pedestrians stand out. The effect is one of crowded, vital humanity within the urban environment. In politics Pissarro was a radical. These paintings also reflect his sympathy with anarchism. Pissarro was born in the Virgin Islands, the son of a French businessman. He angered his parents, who were orthodox Jews, by having an affair with their gentile maidservant, whom he married. She bore him six children. Pissarro and his fellow-Impressionists tried to depict in paint exactly what they saw in the external world. When the American artist Robert Motherwell was a student of philosophy he was greatly influenced by French attitudes to art. That was in the 1940s, when innovative artists in America had turned away from external reality to a 'super-reality' to be found by plumbing the depths of consciousness; hence that unsatisfactory term, surrealism. The Collected Writings of Robert Motherwell, edited by Stephanie Terenzio, reveals how indebted the New York School of painting was to surrealism. Rothko, Kline, De Kooning, Ad Reinhardt: none would have painted the way they did had it not been for French surrealism. They became labelled Abstract Expressionists (a term Motherwell disliked). Piet Mondrian and Marcel Duchamp were living and working in America during the second world war, as were many other foreign artists. It was from contact with Sebastian Matta, the Chilean-born surrealist painter, that Motherwell's own gift for surreal painting was released. Because of his philosophical training, his gift for articulating the basic principles of the movement, Motherwell was frequently invited to lecture about these revolutionary American painters. All his lectures and published writings have now been put together. Though there is a certain amount of repetition, the collection is well edited and it will become essential for an understanding of Abstract Expressionism. Motherwell's trademark was his distinctive use of black as a colour, particularly in his 'Elegy to the Spanish Republic' paintings, where there are usually two smudgy black oval shapes to be seen in the foreground. Bull-fighting is hinted at here: these ovoids are designed to remind us of the testes of a bull. If you think they are not unlike the shapes anyone might make while doodling, you would be right. Doodling, or free-association, is serious activity in this kind of work. Here is Motherwell's description of his own method of work: 'I usually begin a picture with a 'doodle', or with a liquid puddle like a Rorsach image (but not pressed together), or with a line or a dot, or a piece of paper dropped at random on what will be a collage. Then the struggle begins, and endures throughout in a state of anxiety that is ineffable, but obliquely recorded in the inner tensions of the finished canvas'. This account of an approach that relies on the random, the aleatory, is reminiscent of the method of Marcel Duchamp, who progressed from an early form of cubism via surrealism to styles involving 'ready-made' objects like bicycle wheels seen in isolation, styles peculiarly his own. His development is plotted in the Duchamp exhibition at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice, open throughout July. This massive volume on Duchamp, edited by Pontus Hulten with texts by Jacques Caumont and Jennifer Gough-Cooper, is at one end a superbly illustrated catalogue of the exhibition; at the other an account of events in the artist's life organised under astrological signs. Happenings widely separated in time - say, 1928, 1946, 1950 - are entered one after the other because they occurred under the same zodiacal sign. It is a dotty approach to chronology but one that, I feel, Duchamp would have appreciated: it makes interesting reading for his admirers because much of the material has not been published before.</p>

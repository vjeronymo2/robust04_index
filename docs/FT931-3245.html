			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Improved sales, production push Santos to record SANTOS, the Australian energy group, announced a 40 per cent increase in net profit to a record ADollars 163m (USDollars 116m) for the year to the end of December, on turnover up 5 per cent to ADollars 690m. However, the group said this figure was reduced to ADollars 113m after abnormal losses of ADollars 60m, mainly reflecting a ADollars 27.5m write-down in the carrying value of US oil and gas reserves and a ADollars 23m unrealised foreign exchange loss caused by the depreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar. In the previous year, Santos recorded a net loss of ADollars 111m year after abnormal losses of ADollars 223m, including a ADollars 154m write-down against unsuccessful exploration in permit areas in the Timor Sea, between Australia and Indonesia. The group increased the final dividend by 1 cent a share to 11 cents, fully-franked, making a total of 21 cents, compared with 19 cents in the previous year. Santos shares closed 13 cents higher at ADollars 3.32 on the Australian Stock Exchange. Santos attributed the profit improvement to higher production and sales, lower financing costs caused by falling interest rates, higher depreciation charges following increased production, and an increase in the value of oil and gas stocks. The group said its net operating cash-flow had risen 41 per cent to ADollars 409m, which would enable it 'to continue to capitalise on strategic opportunities which emerge in the Australian and international oil and gas markets'. In recent months, Santos has announced acquisitions totalling over ADollars 338m, including a 19.9 per cent stake in Sagasco Holdings and the purchase of the upstream oil and gas interests of Australian Gas Light. Santos said it intended to acquire further shares in Sagasco, with the 'ultimate objective' of obtaining control, subject to a court challenge by the Trade Practices Commission, the competition regulator. The group said it expected production to increase by 6.1 per cent to a record 36.7m barrels of oil equivalent in the current year, aided by the AGL purchase and development in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin in South Australia. 'Overall, Santos' total oil production from all regions in 1993 is forecast to be 10.7m barrels,' the group said.</p>

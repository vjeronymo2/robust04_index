			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anosh Ahamath] </F>   [Text] COLOMBO, April 9 (AFP) -- Security was tightened in  the Sri Lankan capital Saturday after suspected Tamil guerillas  carried out a bombing campaign aimed at disrupting Sri Lanka's  booming tourism industry, officials said.    Two people died and three were wounded in overnight  explosions near the Mount Lavinia beach resort, at the deluxe  Colombo Marriott, Taj Samudra and the three-star Sapphire Hotel,  officials said.    Another bomb went off Saturday morning at the Zoological  Gardens. Despite the large number of visitors, there were no  casualties because the blast occurred in an isolated marshy area.    No foreigners were wounded in the blasts, police said.    K. H. J. Wijayadasa, secretary to President Dingiri Banda  Wijetunga, said the government believed the attacks were carried  out by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which is  fighting for a separate state in the northeast.    "From first indications, from the pattern of explosions, it  looks as if it is a LTTE job," Wijayadasa told reporters shortly  after inspecting a badly damaged toilet at the Marriott.    The bombs went off simultaneously at Marriott, Taj,  frequented by western tourists, and the Sapphire, which is  "usually patronised" by minority Tamils from the LTTE stronghold  of northern Jaffna.    Wijayadasa said that two suspected LTTE rebels died when a  bomb they were carrying exploded prematurely. Another accomplice  was seriously wounded in the blast, he said. A Tamil couple,  guests at Sapphire, were also injured.    Wijayadasa said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe  presided over a high-level security meeting at which it was  decided to tighten security at all hotels in and around Colombo.    He said the explosions were aimed at driving out tourists  from the Indian Ocean island nation.    "Obviously, this is aimed at disrupting tourism and causing  a  certain element of panic. But I think we have escaped fairly  unscathed," Wijayadasa said.    Francis Keenan, the resident general manager of Marriott,  which is part of the American Marriott chain, said that there  had been no panic because the blast occurred inside a toilet  outside the dining hall.    "The guests hardly knew what had happened. They have taken  it  in the correct spirit," said Keenan.    State Minister for Tourism Gamini Lokuge said he hoped the  tourism industry would not be affected as a result of the latest  blasts but said that the authorities have taken "very tight  security measures" to prevent any harm to foreigners.    "I don't think the industry will be affected. To my  knowledge  no guest has decided to leave," Lokuge said.    Lokuge said the industry anticipated a record 450,000  tourists to visit the island this year. About 120,000 tourists  have already arrived in the first three months of the year, he  said.    However, nervous hoteliers and travel agents said they were  adopting a wait-and-see attitude for the moment.    "This is the kind of thing that frightens most tourists.  They  are all sensitive to such incidents, especially the Japanese," a  senior travel agent official said.    Sri Lanka's tourism industry took a heavy battering between  1983 and 1989, when Tamil guerrilla bomb attacks and a separate  anti- government campaign by extremist Sinhalese forced tourists  to keep away from the island.    But the trade began recovering fast after the military  crushed the Sinhalese insurgency in 1989.</p>

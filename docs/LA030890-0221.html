			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DEATH OF HANK GATHERS;  </P> <P> GATHERS TOUCHED THOSE WHO KNEW HIM  </P> <P> I enjoy the writings of Mike Downey and often find his work very humorous.  </P> <P> On Monday, I was deeply moved by Mike's piece and found it difficult to finish  reading it.  </P> <P> My younger brother, Paul, a student at Santa Clara University, was so amazed by  Hank Gathers' performances that he nicknamed him "F-Gathers," as in an F-4  fighter jet. I used to like that nickname, but we'll use it no more. Our  fighter has been shot down.  </P> <P> We will all miss Hank the basketball player, but mostly we will miss Hank the  person.  </P> <P> BILL KOMAR  </P> <P> Playa del Rey  </P></p>

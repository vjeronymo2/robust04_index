			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OAKLAND;  </P> <P> CHURCH WANTS TO FENCE OFF PROSTITUTES  </P> <P> A congregation wants to put a little separation between its church and the  state of its neighborhood. St. Andrew's Roman Catholic Church plans to build a  6-foot-tall, 1,000-foot-long fence around church grounds to keep out  prostitutes who have been bringing customers there. The Rev. John Maxwell said  that even his 92-year-old mother has found used condoms and wrappers on the  steps in front of the rectory where the priests live and in the foliage around  the church.  </P> <P> "We've always had sporadic prostitution, but now it's gotten way out of hand,"  Maxwell said. Vera Brown, a parishioner who works at the church added:  "Sometimes they leave clothes, underwear and even stockings out there." Church  members have raised $8,000 so far to put up the $11,000 fence.  </P></p>

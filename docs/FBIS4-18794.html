			<p>BFN     [Text] An anonymous caller has telephoned a private radio  station claiming that 17 November was responsible for explosions  that took place shortly after midnight at the offices of the  Alico and Nationale Nederlanden insurance companies.    The explosion at Alico's office on 119 Kifisias Avenue was  caused by a 3.5-inch rocket launched from a construction site  across the road. The explosion at Nationale Nederlanden's  office on 131 Kifisias Avenue was caused by a timed explosive  mechanism. The caller who made the claim on behalf of the 17  November organization also said that a few days ago, a British  aircraft carrier was selected as a target by the organization  but the launching mechanism failed.    Around the same time as the explosions in Kifisias Avenue, a  blast occurred by a parked car at 3 Kanaris Street, Stamata,  Attiki. The investigating authorities believe this explosion is  not related with the two bomb attacks on Kifisias Avenue.</p>

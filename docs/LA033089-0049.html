			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ENCINITAS GENERAL PLAN STRICTLY LIMITS GROWTH  </P> <P> Culminating nearly two years of debate and scores of hearings, the Encinitas  City Council on Wednesday adopted the fledgling municipality's first general  plan, an ambitious blueprint for the future that includes strict limits on  growth.  </P> <P> The council approved the plan on a 4-1 vote, with Councilwoman Gail Hano  dissenting because of her opposition to the slow-growth provisions of the  document.  </P> <P> Mayor Anne Omsted said adoption of the plan marks "a milestone in city  history," but echoed Hano's concerns about the tough controls on growth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 200 Units Annually  </P> <P> Omsted expressed hope after the meeting that the council could work together in  the coming months to hammer out less restrictive slow-growth measures  acceptable to all factions in the city, which incorporated in 1986 on a wave of  anti-development sentiment.  </P> <P> Aside from dramatically reducing projected housing densities from the days of  county rule, the new general plan includes a cap on housing construction of  about 200 units annually and requires voter approval for significant changes in  land use or for density increases.  </P> <P> Taken in total, the density reductions would allow a population of 65,000 at  buildout, contrasted with an eventual population of 75,000 under the old county  land-use plans.  </P> <P> City officials say adoption of the plan represents a significant symbolic step  for Encinitas, the final act in throwing off the yoke of county rule.  </P> <P> "I almost feel choked up thinking of all the things we requested for so many  years, all of them finally being put into one general plan," Councilwoman  Marjorie Gaines said before the meeting.  </P> <P> Acting as a sort of municipal constitution, the plan embodies a wide range of  rules and standards for development, among them tighter grading restrictions,  tougher landscaping requirements, strict design reviews and regulations to  better protect environmentally sensitive areas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Effort for Migrants  </P> <P> Although city officials were bullish on the new general plan, critics remained  to the end. In particular, advocates of more low-income housing for migrant  workers mounted a last-ditch effort to alter the plan.  </P> <P> During the past year, migrants camping out in the hills around Encinitas have  come under increasing pressure from local authorities eager to see them  uprooted.  </P> <P> Advocates for the immigrants argue that the city's new plan is a barrier to the  construction of affordable housing for those displaced from their simple homes  of scrap lumber and plastic sheeting in the squalid migrant encampments.  </P> <P> Officials with California Rural Legal Assistance, a group that aids the  impoverished migrants, wrote letters to the city and state in an effort to  argue their case.  </P> <P> "This plan is stunningly exclusionary," Claudia Smith, regional counsel for  California Rural Legal Assistance, said in an interview before the meeting. "It  makes Newport Beach look good. Encinitas officials don't want poor immigrant  workers in any way, shape or form, and this general plan is the proof in the  pudding."  </P> <P> Smith protested an effort by the city to get a one-year extension on Friday's  deadline for adopting the general plan. Under state law, cities have 30 months  after incorporation to approve a general plan, but Encinitas is seeking to  extend its deadline until next year to immunize its land-use plan from legal  challenges while authorities tinker with the document.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Considered Suing  </P> <P> Smith characterized the city's request as "a transparent attempt to foil  litigation for a year." Her group has considered suing the city because of  concerns about the plan's effect on low-income housing.  </P> <P> If the state grants the one-year extension, Smith said, the city should be  allowed to approve construction of large projects consisting of 10 or more  units only if 25% of the homes are set aside as affordable housing.  </P> <P> City Manager Warren Shafer agreed that the city wants the time extension as a  safeguard against litigation.  </P> <P> But he said officials are wary of legal challenges simply because the general  plan is still scheduled for review by the state Coastal Commission, which could  order changes in the document. Moreover, city planners will continue to work on  zoning provisions of the plan during the coming year. A lawsuit or two would  only complicate either process, Shafer said.  </P> <P> Although a suit over the migrant issue could loom, city officials contend that  their greatest concern is a legal challenge by developers.  </P> <P> "Basically, we're just trying to avoid unnecessary litigation and expense,"  Shafer said, noting that officials hope to have the city's plan before the  Coastal Commission for review in the next few months.  </P></p>

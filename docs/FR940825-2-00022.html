			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> All California Gill Net Fisheries (except the CA Klamath River gill net fishery)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of comments were received on the proposal to recategorize all California gill net fisheries based on the mesh size of the gear deployed. One commenter indicated that the State of California passed legislation banning the use of gill nets, thus, making the Federal recategorization of California gill net fisheries unnecessary. Actually, the State of California has not banned the use of gill nets completely, but has only restricted their use in State waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1990, State of California passed the Marine Resources Protection Act (MRPA), which prohibits the use of gill and trammel nets in an area identified as the Marine Resources Protection Zone (MRPZ). The MRPZ includes ocean waters from 0&hyph;3 nautical miles from the California mainland coast, and any manmade breakwater, between a line extending due west from Point Arguello, Santa Barbara County, and a line extending due west from the U.S.-Mexico border. The MRPZ also includes waters less than 35 fathoms (64 m) deep, between Point Fermin, Los Angeles County, and the south jetty at Newport Beach, Orange County. Further, the MRPZ encompasses waters less than 70 fathoms deep, or within 1 mile, whichever is less, of the Channel Islands consisting of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Anacapa, San Nicholas, Santa Barbara, Santa Catalina, and San Clemente Islands. The MRPA also established in perpetuity State legislation restricting the use of gill nets in the waters north of Point Arguello. Despite these prohibitions, there is still an active, but significantly reduced, set gill net fishery in California waters. For example, a set gill net fishery for Pacific herring sac-roe in San Francisco Bay is active during the months of December through March. In addition, there are approximately 20 set gill net vessels that are continuing to fish in the Southern California Bight, and in Central California, there are no water depth restrictions for set gill net fishing between Point Sal and Arguello. The MRPA does not affect the offshore drift gill net fishery for shark and swordfish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other comments were received that were in favor of the change in classification of California gill net fisheries based on mesh size. Although a correlation between mortality rates and mesh size has been observed in California gill net fisheries, this relationship may not be applicable to other gill net fisheries outside California. Therefore, as the commenters noted, this change should not be applied to non-California gill net fisheries until there is information to support such a change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on evidence presented in the notice of the proposed List of Fisheries for 1994 (59 FR 10372, March 4, 1994), reclassification of fisheries that use mesh sizes greater than 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) to Category I and reclassification of fisheries that use mesh sizes less than or equal to 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) to Category III is warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Mid-Atlantic Coastal Gill Net Fishery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although changes to this fishery were not proposed, many comments were received concerning the mid-Atlantic coastal gill net fishery. Commenters indicated that a lack of justification exists for the Category II designation within the inner bays, rivers, and tributaries along the mid-Atlantic coast, and these areas should be reclassified as Category III fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS has evaluated existing information and agrees that the reclassification of certain areas is warranted. The category II classification of the mid-Atlantic coastal gill net fishery will continue to apply to all gill nets set in coastal waters from North Carolina to Nantucket, MA, excluding the segments described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Inshore Mid-Atlantic Gillnet Fisheries: Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts and New York Bight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All gill net fisheries operating landward of the first bridge of any embayment in Rhode Island, southern Massachusetts (to Monomoy Island), Raritan, and lower New York Bays in New York Bight are reclassified as Category III fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Long Island Sound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All gill net fisheries setting nets west of a line from the north fork of the eastern end of Long Island, NY (Orient Point to Plum Island to Fishers Island) to Watch Hill, RI are reclassified as Category III fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

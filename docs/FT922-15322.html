			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / HK government forced to back down over taxes THE Hong Kong government was yesterday forced to cut taxes for middle and lower income groups in next year's budget after a constitutional crisis had been threatened. A chastened Mr Hamish MacLeod, the colony's financial secretary, told Hong Kong's legislature that if it passed his 1992 budget, he would increase personal allowances and review personal tax bands in time for implementation next year. The Legislative Council voted 36-18 in favour of Mr MacLeod's budget. But the vote indicated the desire of conservative members not to plunge the administration into crisis rather than an endorsement of the budget as such. The fight over the budget is more than about who controls the purse strings in Hong Kong. Members of the Legislative Council, especially those who were elected last September rather than appointed, believe they possess a popular mandate and are demanding more say in policy making. After the vote both elected and appointed council members vowed to keep up pressure and said they would vote against a budget proposal to raise property rates.</p>

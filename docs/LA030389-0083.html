			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BONUSES THREATENED BY BILINGUAL POLICY RIFT  </P> <P> The president of the Los Angeles teachers union said Thursday he will oppose a  group's efforts to rescind proposed bonuses for the district's 4,000 bilingual  teachers.  </P> <P> Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said the vote to  rescind the bonuses, sought by Learning English Advocates Drive, a group of  teachers seeking to end bilingual education, "will divide teachers at a crucial  time." The union represents a majority of teachers in the Los Angeles Unified  School District.  </P> <P> The English advocates group has said it will try to reverse the union's policy  of demanding higher pay for the district's 4,000 bilingual classroom teachers.  But the group said Thursday it now may delay the referendum until after the  teachers settle their contract dispute with the district.  </P> <P> District officials said passage of the proposal would make it difficult to  continue bilingual education in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Bad for Teachers'  </P> <P> "The referendum at this time is bad for teachers and it is bad for our  organization," Johnson said. "I hope that it will either be withdrawn or the  membership will reject it."  </P> <P> Bilingual education has been a controversial issue in Los Angeles and  throughout the nation. Advocates say it is the best method for teaching  students who are not fluent in English; opponents say it slows the learning  process. The Los Angeles school district now uses bilingual teachers to  instruct students in basic subjects in languages other than English. Learning  English Advocates Drive has advocated using English with interpreting help from  a bilingual aide.  </P> <P> Johnson and the union's executive board are engaged in a campaign urging the  union's 22,000 members to reject, in a vote next week, the district's current  offer of a 20% pay raise over three years. The union has asked for a 21% raise  over two years.  </P> <P> Johnson said the English advocate group's proposal is causing internal fighting  that could jeopardize the union's position. The executive board late Wednesday  agreed to oppose the English group's proposal, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Latino Parents Angry  </P> <P> Johnson's rejection of the referendum comes amid growing pressure from  bilingual teachers and Latino parents angry over the proposal. The school  district has the nation's largest number of limited English-speaking students,  mostly Latino.  </P> <P> More than 200 teachers and parents met Wednesday at the Eastman Avenue School  in East Los Angeles to sign petitions and write letters on behalf of the  district's bilingual program. Teachers at the meeting said they were critical  of their union for failing to reject the English group's proposal immediately.  </P> <P> A second meeting at the union's downtown headquarters has been planned for  Wednesday, said Mark Meza-Overstreet, a bilingual teacher and leader of the  union's Chicano Education Committee. His committee has begun fund-raising  efforts to pay for mailers and other materials to fight the referendum.  </P> <P> Sally Peterson, president and founder of Learning English Advocates Drive, said  the group is not an English-only organization. But she acknowledged that it  receives financial support from two national English-only organizations: U.S.  English and English First. Peterson said she is disappointed that the union  leadership opposes the group's referendum.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bonuses Called Essential  </P> <P> School district officials and other supporters of bilingual education say the  annual bonuses are essential for recruiting and keeping qualified bilingual  teachers. Without the pay incentives, bilingual teachers would go to other  districts that pay more money, he said.  </P> <P> The district and union negotiators have tentatively agreed on bonuses of up to  $5,000 a year for fully certificated bilingual classroom teachers.  </P> <P> Teachers and district officials say the referendum will have a big effect on  how schools will teach the more than 160,000 Los Angeles students who speak  only limited English, most of them Spanish-speaking. Some studies contend that  elementary pupils tend to progress faster if they are taught academic subjects  in their native language while they are learning English.  </P> <P> But Peterson, a kindergarten teacher at Glenwood Elementary School in Sun  Valley, disputes those studies and said her group favors English-speaking  teachers with bilingual aides.  </P></p>

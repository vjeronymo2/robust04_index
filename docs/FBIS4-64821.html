			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 6 (A.A.) -- Chief of Staff General  Dogan Gures told the Anatolian Agency on Friday [6 May] that the  polemics on the extension of duty for the chief of staff should  be searched for outside his office.    Gures said he has explained his opinion on the issue on many  occasions, adding that when the time comes to transfer duty,  `those who conduct this duty with honor, hand it over to the  next commander with pride. I have already said this is how it  will happen, weeks ago at a meeting where the highest government  officials were present.'    He said there is always available personnel for every post  in  the Turkish Armed Forces.    `In the armed forces, no one can expect any favor and one  does not accept any,' Gures said adding that one refrains as  much as possible from showing negative intentions.    He also thanked Prime Minister Tansu Ciller who made a  statement on the issue.    Earlier on Friday, Ciller said that the authority to extend  the term of duty of the chief of staff belongs entirely to the  political authority.    A statement published by the Office of the Prime Ministry  said that `we may see it profitable and necessary for the  country's well being, to preserve the present command team on  duty under its present shape.'</p>

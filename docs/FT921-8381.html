			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sweden to launch strategy to attract foreign investors A FREE market industrial strategy with a direct appeal to foreign investors is about to be launched in Sweden. 'We want to turn the country into an investment market for buying companies and commercial property,' said Mr Per Westerberg, the industry minister yesterday. 'I want to see Swedish industry become much more internationalised.' The main plank in the strategy is the ambitious industrial privatisation programme due to start in the spring. There are 35 state controlled and partially controlled companies on the list for complete transfer to the private sector with a market value of SKr150bn, amounting to 11.1 per cent of Sweden's gross national product. Mr Westerberg said there will be a sizeable state share issue every spring with a smaller one following each autumn. Five large companies are being prepared for early privatisation. These are the industrial group Celsius, which has a strong defence product portfolio; the steel company SSAB; the mining group LKAB; OK Petroleum; and the food and pharmaceutical conglomerate Procordia which Mr Westerberg insists must be 'broad privatisation with or without Volvo'. One of the companies will be chosen next month for complete flotation in the early summer. None is dependent on state subsidies. All have gone through restructuring and are making healthy profits, according to Mr Westerberg. Only a handful of staff at the industry department will be involved in the process. Outside expertise is being bought in from the banks, auditors and solicitors from home and abroad. Each company on the list will create its team complete with its own management, representatives from the government and, in time it is hoped, from the trade unions. These will formulate the changes required to make their enterprises ready for the market and decide whether further capital is required for them. The final decision on the timing of each privatisation remains with Mr Westerberg but he will be advised by a commission on the appropriate share price and other conditions for each sale. Other measures in the pipeline from Mr Westerberg will involve; The abolition of the distinction between restricted and unrestricted shares. This change will come into force in January 1993 with the completion of the single internal market of the 19 nation European Economic Area although Sweden will continue to allow restrictive access to voting shares which still protect companies from foreign intrusion. The introduction of policies to increase more risk capital, particularly for small companies with changes in capital taxation and tax free loans for new enterprises on the German pattern. The lifting this summer of legal restrictions that hamper new companies being created by foreigners being launched in Sweden. The introduction of competition laws in the autumn with the creation of a new body with teeth to deal with price fixing and monopolies.</p>

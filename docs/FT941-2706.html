			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Danish gas will last 45 years - News in brief Denmark, western Europe's third-biggest oil and gas producer, said yesterday it had known reserves to sustain current oil production levels for 20 years and gas production for 45 years. The Danish Energy Board said it expected Denmark to achieve balance in its energy trade in 1997, meaning that exports of oil and gas would be worth as much as imports of coal. 'The continued high oil and gas production will mean that Denmark's net energy expenditure will fall from DKr2.5bn in 1993 to a balance or a small surplus in 1997,' the board said. The overall self-sufficiency level for both oil and gas was expected to reach more than 140 per cent in 1997, it said, up from 120 per cent in 1993. The surplus, mostly of gas, has been exported to Sweden and Germany.</p>

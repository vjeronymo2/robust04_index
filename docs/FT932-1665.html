			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Bundesbank tries to talk up economy THE Bundesbank yesterday tried to ease pressure on the D-Mark with an upbeat assessment of German economic prospects. There were also some favourable indicators in the key factors influencing the bank's monetary policy, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the central bank's vice-president, told bankers in Munster. But he tempered his optimism with a warning that if the government came up with wrong or unconvincing solutions to the country's deficit difficulties, the currency might suffer from 'over-reactions' in money markets. The economic situation was serious, but there was evidence that the pace of decline was over-stated, he said. 'Free fall' was out of the question. Although output fell 3 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, there were now signs that the situation was stabilising, he claimed. Industrial production had not fallen further, and foreign orders had risen. Meanwhile, growth in the M3 money supply measure was 'rather flatter' than a little while ago, and there were signs that inflation would slacken as the year continued, he said. Nevertheless, the bank had to assess these developments carefully, and proceed cautiously with further monetary relaxation. Money supply must remain the dominant factor in its deliberations, Mr Tietmeyer added. His speech reflected the dilemma facing the central bank's policymakers. On the one hand, the weakening of the German currency - partly as a result of the recession - militates against interest rate cuts. On the other, the bank appears to believe that conditions which will allow a resumption of its monetary easing - to aid economic recovery - are improving. But Mr Tietmeyer made plain that the key to resolving the dilemma lay outside the Bundesbank. 'The limited recent weakening of the D-Mark should be read as an indication of the need for convincing solutions to Germany's home-made problems,' he said. The bank's 'stringent' policies had helped prompt a re-thinking process. 'The more this process produces concrete and binding decisions, the greater the room to manoeuvre on monetary policy,' Mr Tietmeyer added. The Bundesbank is studiously monitoring the government's attempts to cut public spending. Over-blown deficits and public sector borrowing requirements are now among the main causes of excessive growth in money supply, which the bank sees as the prime source of future inflation. A series of small 'dribbling' interest rate cuts came to a sudden stop last month after M3 was found to have lurched through the bank's upper target range in April. Growth slowed slightly again in May to 6.7 per cent annualised, and if it is found to have fallen within the 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent range this month, the bank's main condition for more cuts will have been met. However, if there are no signs of spending restraint, economic data worsens and the D-Mark weakens, further progress will be put in doubt. The Bonn cabinet is due to finalise a package of spending cuts by the end of this month.</p>

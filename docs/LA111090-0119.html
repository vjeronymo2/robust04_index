			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL ORDERED OVER RIGHT OF SAN FRANCISCO TELEVISION STATION TO BROADCAST  EXECUTION  </P> <P> A federal judge Friday refused to throw out a lawsuit seeking an unprecedented  court order that would permit an execution to be televised by a San Francisco  television station.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Robert H. Schnacke rejected a bid by state authorities to  dismiss the suit, saying there must be "appropriate balancing" between concerns  over security and privacy surrounding an execution and the rights of a free  press. A non-jury trial on the issue was set for March 25.  </P></p>

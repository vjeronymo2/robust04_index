			<p>BFN     [Text] Lakhdar Brahimi, emissary of the UN secretary  general, said that he achieved progress during his recent talks  in Yemen. Speaking while on a visit to Abu Dhabi, Brahimi said  that Sanaa had accepted southern proposals concerning the  participation of neutral foreigners in a military committee  tasked with supervising the cease-fire.    Lakhdar Brahimi today briefed United Arab Emirates President  Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan on the recent efforts to  resolve the Yemeni crisis. Following the meeting, Brahimi said  that Sanaa accepted southern proposals concerning the  participation of neutral observers in a military committee whose  task would be to monitor the cease-fire. Brahimi said: I  believe that it is a significant development that the north has  accepted the idea of Yemenis and foreigners [monitoring the  cease-fire]. Therefore, I think that progress has been made.    Brahimi added that Sanaa's decision was conveyed to him  early  this morning. The decision represents a significant development  because Sanaa had previously rejected any foreign role.    According to a southern official, the team of observers may  include officers representing several countries, including the  five permanent members of the UN Security Council as well as  Arab countries such as Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Oman.</p>

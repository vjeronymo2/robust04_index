			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOLIDAY BOWL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> LUNCHEON HAS ADDED MEANING  </P> <P> History joined the football teams from Brigham Young and Texas A&amp;M aboard  the aircraft carrier USS Independence at a luncheon/tour Thursday, and it  wasn't just Holiday Bowl lore.  </P> <P> The carrier returned from the Persian Gulf about a week ago, and team officials  and players were a bit awed.  </P> <P> "As we rounded the corner and came into the parking lot, I looked up at the  Independence and realized this is the ninth time we've had the opportunity at  Brigham Young to be here in this great city and at this great bowl game," BYU  Coach LaVell Edwards said. "And all of a sudden, the realization struck me that  it's a little different perspective this year than what it's been in other  years.  </P> <P> "This is a great experience, and a great opportunity for all of us to be here.  These young men serving on this ship give us pause to stop and think about some  of the events happening around the world."  </P> <P> Said Texas A&amp;M Coach R.C. Slocum: "We're delighted to be here. We think it  is particularly fitting that Texas A&amp;M, a school steeped in military  history, is out here on this boat."  </P> <P> Edwards and Slocum each presented a team jersey to honorary captains for  Saturday's game. Edwards gave Chief Petty Officer Bill Holt, from Spanish Fort,  Utah, a blue BYU jersey. The word "Independence" was lettered across the back  above No. 62 -- the ship's number. Slocum, meanwhile, presented an Aggie jersey  to Lance Cpl. Byron Hall of Tyler, Tex. Hall's jersey was No. 12, for the  traditional Texas A&amp;M 12th man.  </P> <P> Injury report: BYU senior halfback Matt Bellini wasn't going to start  Saturday's game, then he was. Now, he's questionable.  </P> <P> "Whether he does or doesn't (start) really doesn't matter," Edwards said. "He's  going to be suited up and playing -- it just depends on how much he can  handle."  </P> <P> Bellini tore ligaments in his right ankle Nov. 17 against Utah. Senior Stacey  Corley, who started two games and gained 288 yards on 70 carries, will start if  Bellini can't.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the BYU secondary has been hit hard. Junior cornerback Tony  Crutchfield (knee) and senior strong safety Norm Dixon (back spasms) are both  doubtful for Texas A&amp;M. Crutchfield has been nursing his injury all season  and didn't play much in BYU's final two games. He will be replaced by junior  Ervin Lee. Dixon's back, meanwhile, acted up in practice Wednesday. He will be  replaced by junior Josh Arnold.  </P> <P> For Texas A&amp;M, fullback Robert Wilson was sick Thursday with a virus.  </P> <P> What injury? BYU quarterback Ty Detmer was surprised Thursday at a reference in  a newspaper to his shoulder injury.  </P> <P> No big deal, Detmer said. He has a ligament strain in his right shoulder,  suffered Nov. 17 against Utah. He played with pain the next week against Utah  State and Dec. 1 at Hawaii.  </P> <P> "It's not a big deal," he said. "I guess (the newspaper) is looking for some  excitement. I don't know why it came up."  </P> <P> Is the shoulder sore?  </P> <P> "It doesn't hurt to throw."  </P> <P> George Curtis, BYU head trainer, said Detmer has not had any kind of therapy  for shoulder, nor is there a need for any.  </P> <P> Add Detmer: The game isn't the only thing that will be on Detmer's mind  Saturday. His grandfather, Hubert Sr., has cancer and the family doesn't expect  him to be around for next football season.  </P> <P> "He's hanging in there, barely," Detmer said. "This will probably be his last  football game involving me. . . . Some days he will have bad days, and other  times he'll be a little bit better."  </P> <P> Detmer said he spoke with his grandfather, who lives in San Antonio, on  Christmas Day and plans to again after Saturday's game.  </P> <P> Primal scream: There are several traditions at Texas A&amp;M. One is called  "Midnight Yell Practice." It is held at Kyle Field in College Station, Tex., on  the Friday night before home games. The Aggie band starts a parade on campus  and marches to the field, led by A&amp;M Yell Leaders carrying torches.  </P> <P> Tonight, the tradition storms into San Diego County. Texas A&amp;M fans are  planning to hold Midnight Yell Practice at the La Jolla Hyatt. At midnight, of  course.  </P> <P> Holiday Bowl Notes:  </P> <P> Texas A&amp;M kicker Layne Talbot got married Saturday, three days before  Christmas. His wife was due to arrive in San Diego Thursday. Her name is Noel.  We are not making this up. . . . At Thursday's luncheon, Texas A&amp;M fullback  Robert Wilson and BYU quarterback Ty Detmer each received the Admiral's Trophy.  The award goes to a player on each team who exemplifies unselfishness and  teamwork and is selected by a secret ballot from members his team. . . . Square  Pan Pizza hosted the luncheon, so you know what was served. In case you're  wondering, a pizza official said 5,760 slices were prepared -- 240 trays of 24  slices each. . . . BYU Coach LaVell Edwards has been able to spend some time  with his family this week. "First time we've all been together in three years,"  he said. In town are son John, 32, and his wife and three children from New  York; son Jim, 28, with his wife and two children from Nevada; and daughter  Ann, with her husband and four children from Utah. They all arrived Wednesday  afternoon. Edwards' plan was to get Mexican food that night, but he ran into an  hour wait in Old Town so he opted for Italian. . . . The funniest thing to  happen to BYU since the Cougars' Christmas Day arrival? "Probably going to the  otter show, when the walrus spit water," BYU defensive back Brian Mitchell  said. "I think he (spat on) all Texas A&amp;M fans."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WORKER AT CHEVRON CRUSHED TO DEATH  </P> <P> A maintenance worker at the Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo was crushed to  death Monday when a 13-ton bundle of steel pipes shifted and pinned him against  a wall, a refinery spokesman said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Michael J. McKenna, 26, was treated for massive internal injuries by paramedics  but was dead on arrival at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center at 8:55  a.m., according to the hospital.  </P> <P> McKenna was attaching a rigging from a crane to the bundle of 15-foot pipes  when it suddenly shifted, said Rod Spackman of Chevron. McKenna was preparing  the three-foot diameter bundle to be hoisted onto a truck so it could be taken  to a storage yard.  </P> <P> Spackman said the same procedure is followed dozens of times a year without  mishap. The state Occupational Safety and Health Administration is  investigating the accident.  </P> <P> McKenna, a Hermosa Beach resident, had worked at the refinery since June. No  other employee has been killed at the refinery in the last three years, though  a contract worker died in a truck fire in 1985, Spackman said.  </P></p>

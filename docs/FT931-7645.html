			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: TNT loss rises to ADollars 74m in first six months TNT, the Australian transport group, yesterday announced an equity-accounted net loss of ADollars 74.5m (USDollars 50.6m) for the six months to the end of December, compared with a loss of ADollars 51m in the corresponding period of the previous year. TNT warned that trading conditions in the third quarter would be difficult because of seasonal factors, and ruled out a resumption of dividend payments, cancelled last year. The group reported equity-accounted operating profit of ADollars 38.3m, compared with a loss of ADollars 17.5m in the previous first half. Sales revenue was down 38 per cent to ADollars 1.5bn, reflecting the disposal of non-core businesses. The biggest improvement was recorded by Ansett Transport Industries, the airline group owned by TNT and News Corporation. It contributed a profit of ADollars 18.7m, against a loss of ADollars 35.5m. The return to profit at the operating level was in line with directors' forecasts at the end of last year, when the group reported a net loss of more than ADollars 200m. But net profit was cut by abnormal losses of ADollars 80.8m due to foreign exchange losses and the start-up costs of the GD Express Worldwide joint venture with a group of European and North American post offices. Mr David Mortimer, managing director, said TNT still had 'a long way to go'. But he was 'reasonably optimistic' that the group would report a net profit in the first six months of next year. Mr Mortimer said several expressions of interest had been received from potential investors in Ansett following indications from both joint venturers that their shares were for sale. TNT shares closed 1 cent lower at 78 cents on the Australian Stock Exchange. McIlwraith McEacharn, the Australian mining and shipping group, said 'a number of overseas companies' were considering the purchase of a 46 per cent stake in the company owned by TNT. Australian coal mining companies have shown little interest in the shares, which would give the buyer access to McIlwraith's 41 per cent stake in Oakbridge, the New South Wales coal producer.</p>

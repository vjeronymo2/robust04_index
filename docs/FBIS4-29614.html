			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- A government report released  Friday [17 June] says the so-called ''land myth,'' a widespread  faith that land prices never fail to rise in the long run,  provided a sizable thrust to the speculation boom in the mid  1980s that resulted in steep land price inflation.    The annual land white paper for 1993 argues that the myth  added much fuel to the speculative demand for land at that time.    Land speculation first hit the market amid growing  expectations of higher prices stemming from various economic  factors, such as rising corporate earnings, lower interest rates  and surging demand for office space, the report said.    In its first analysis of the speculation bubbles, the report  says land prices eventually took a downturn mainly due to  government emergency measures to cap them, including monetary  and taxation curbs on speculation.    The experiences over the speculation frenzy and its demise,  as well as the following recession, have changed the people's  mind-set concerning land and deflated perennial expectations of  ever-higher land prices.    But the boom leaves some unwelcome remnants, the report  says.  Land price inflation, for instance, has made house ownership in  large cities out of reach for average workers, thereby dampening  their labor incentives.    Moreover, the sharp downswing after the burst of the bubbles  leaves many companies that climbed on the speculation bandwagon  with devastating balance sheets.    In 1993, land prices fell for the third consecutive year,  albeit at a slower rate than the previous two years, in  particular in commercial districts of major cities.    The average price of a new condominium in the Tokyo  Metropolitan Area that was put on the market in 1993 was 49  million yen for a 70-square-meter unit, still 5.8 times the  average annual income of workers in the region, the report says.</p>

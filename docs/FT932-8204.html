			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Nikko pays Dollars 1m SEC penalty THE US subsidiary of the Japanese brokerage house Nikko Securities agreed yesterday to pay a Dollars 1m (Pounds 654,000) fine to settle charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, related to the concealment of an Dollars 18m foreign exchange trading loss incurred by the firm in 1991. Nikko also agreed to conduct a compliance review at its US unit. The three senior executives involved in the case - former chairman Tsuneo Iida, former chief financial officer Masanori Ishikawa, and former head of accounting Susumu Okada - were barred from working in the US securities industry for various periods. The three men no longer work at the firm. The settlement, which Nikko and the three executives agreed to accept without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, concerned an Dollars 18m loss incurred by a Nikko trader on speculative foreign exchange trading in 1991. The SEC said that the firm's US management failed to disclose the loss for several months, hiding it in the company's books and wrongly reporting a profit for the 1991 fiscal year. The Dollars 1m penalty is the largest paid by a non-US securities firm and the fourth biggest fine paid by Japanese securities houses this year. In February, three firms - Daiwa, Nomura and Yamaichi - paid fines from Dollars 50,000 to Dollars 200,000 for various book-keeping irregularities. Daiwa was also fined for its part in the 1991 Salomon bond auction scandal. Nikko refused then to settle with the SEC, claiming the penalties demanded by the agency were too high. The firm described the settlement yesterday as 'reasonable'. The SEC said the Nikko fine, being five times larger than any paid by the other Japanese firms, 'reflects the degree of seriousness the SEC attaches to the misconduct by Nikko'.</p>

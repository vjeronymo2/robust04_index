			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Nikolayevich Rudenko, academic secretary, </F> Department of Physics Engineering Problems of Power Engineering,  Russian Academy of Sciences]    [Abstract] The principal tasks of the Department of Physics  Engineering Problems of Power Engineering of the Russian  Federation Academy of Sciences is to generate knowledge in the  areas of power generation systems research, thermal physics,  electrophysics, new power generation processes and technologies,  and nuclear power engineering safety. Because of the nature of  its activity, the department maintains close ties with industry,  and 14 of its 59 members work in industry. The main results of  the department's activities related to the aforementioned  research areas during the past 2-3 years may be summarized as  follows. The department's main achievement in the area of power  generation systems research has been the development of a theory  and methods of researching and controlling large power  generation systems. Members of the department also collaborated  with the Russian Federation Institute of Power Engineering  Research, Siberian Power Engineering Institute, and other  institutions to develop an energy policy for Russia under the  new economic conditions. The draft policy emphasizes energy  conservation and development of a Russian Federation Unified  Electric Power System that would include provisions for  interaction with the power grids of its neighboring states. The  primary focus in the area of thermal physics has been on  studying the thermophysical and electrophysical properties of  materials over a wide range of state parameters, including  subjecting those materials to different types of intensive  energy fluxes. Strong shock waves have been used to compress and  irreversibly heat materials and then study them at record high  pressures (tens to hundreds of millions of atmospheres) and  temperatures (10[.sup]4[/]-10[.sup]6[/] K). A method of  ``adiabatic expansion of shock-compressed metals'' was developed  and used for the first time in world practice. Among the  department's accomplishments in the area of electrophysics are  studies of electromagnetic and electrical fields, electric  discharges in various media, phenomena occurring in the fine  structures of solids and at the interfaces of different  structures, and the interaction of electromagnetic and electric  fields with the biosphere and infrastructure. The department has  also been actively involved in creating progressive processes of  producing electric power, making complete use of fossil fuel,  conserving energy, and reducing power generation facilities'  harmful effects on the environment. The department is also  collaborating with the Joint Institute of High Temperatures to  develop new-generation steam generators that would put an end to  Russia's lag in the area of gas turbine engineering. The  possibilities of using aviation gas turbine engines for power  generation purposes are also being explored. The department's  associates have made great strides in the area of improving the  safety of nuclear power generation by switching from criterial  dependences to physical modeling of the key processes occurring  during serious accidents at nuclear power plants. The scientific  foundations and software for more exact probability analysis of  the safety of existing and planned nuclear power plants have  been developed along with an expert system on the radiation  consequences of the Chernobyl accident. The recent problems of  financing and organizing scientific research have had a negative  impact on the status of the experimental base of the  department's institutes, as have increasing costs for such  thinks as maintaining and repairing buildings and computer  equipment and maintenance. The ranks of active and future  scientists are decreasing, scientific schools that have taken  decades to create are under threat of collapse, and the influx  of youth into science has decreased sharply. The department is  working with the Russian Federation Ministry of Fuel and Energy  to resolve a number of problems related to developing a state  fuel and energy program, is participating actively in studies  regarding a state scientific-technical program entitled  ``Ecologically Pure Power Generation,'' and is involved in  efforts to integrate the efforts of sectorial and academic  science for the purpose of resolving the scientific-technical  problems of power generation. Special attention is being given  to cooperation between the academy and higher education  institutions. Inadequate funding is having an adverse effect on  the department's ability to pay its personnel adequately, and  the increasing costs of all types of communication is making it  difficult for the department to maintain its ties with regional  scientific centers and industrial regions.

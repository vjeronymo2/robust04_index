			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: HE THROWS A WILD CARD INTO GAME  </P> <P> Wild Thing Williams, a combination of Dizzy Dean and Daffy Duck, hopscotched  through the Wrigley Field dugout Tuesday and then sprang up the steps -- shaggy  hair protruding from his cap, Cap'n Ahab beard fuzzing up his chin -- until he  whooshed right by the Chicago Cubs' last Hall of Famer, Billy Williams, whose  specialties as a player were reliability and restraint. Cub careers are all  these Williamses have ever had in common, trust us.  </P> <P> "All right, everybody watch your lips! I'm getting loose!" Mitch Williams cried  out, to nobody in particular, for no particular reason, and then off he went to  chuck some baseballs.  </P> <P> Billy Williams watched him come and go, shaking his head.  </P> <P> "Wiiiiild thing," he said.  </P> <P> Keep an eye on this deliverer of comic relief, this designated mad hatter, as  the Cubs go after their first National League pennant in 44 years, starting  tonight.  </P> <P> This is the character who, in his first season with the team, came within one  save of Bruce Sutter's club record, but simultaneously became the relief  pitcher Cub fans could and couldn't trust. Maybe he'd throw it over the plate,  or maybe he'd hit Harry Caray in the head. They never knew.  </P> <P> Wild Thing. He makes their hearts sing. He makes everything, well, groovy.  </P> <P> Cub pitcher Rick Sutcliffe, on Mitch Williams: "I pitch like I'm sitting in an  easy chair, and he pitches like his hair's on fire."  </P> <P> Pittsburgh outfielder Andy Van Slyke, on Mitch Williams: "If everybody pitched  like him, I'd quit."  </P> <P> He is the guy who makes Chicago heartbeats flutter like a knuckleball. Not only  do the Cubs have Ryne Sandberg, they also have the second coming of Ryne Duren.  One Mitch pitch goes down the pipe. Next Mitch pitch goes up the screen. Third  Mitch pitch goes across the corner. Fourth Mitch pitch goes around the corner,  out a side exit and into Yum-Yum Donuts, next door to Wrigley.  </P> <P> Wild Thing. They think they love him, but want to know for sure.  </P> <P> Cub fans could hardly believe their eyes when the man who cost them  sweet-swinging Rafael Palmeiro in a nine-player trade toed the rubber on  opening day, proceeded to walk the bases loaded, then proceeded to strike out  the side. That, some will tell you, was his most consistent performance of the  season. That was Mitch Williams on a good day.  </P> <P> Sometimes it's hard to tell a Mitch Williams pitch from a pickoff attempt.  </P> <P> "I'm not even invited to pitcher-catcher meetings before games anymore," Wild  Thing said Tuesday, on the eve of the Cub playoff series against the San  Francisco Giants. "They don't want to say anything to me, because they don't  want me thinking."  </P> <P> When he isn't pitching without thinking, Wild Thing is speaking without  thinking. Or else it just comes out funny. Williams might get into hot water  with some of his teammates if some of his quotes are taken out of context,  condensed into one or two sentences, with all the true meaning and flavor  sacrificed.  </P> <P> For example, while discussing Manager Don Zimmer's occasionally unorthodox  strategy Tuesday, Wild Thing said: "He makes certain moves and a lot of people  look at him like he's got spinach in his teeth."  </P> <P> What you have to understand is the amount of admiration and affection Williams  has for Zimmer, and that he wouldn't for all the world want to sound unkind to  him.  </P> <P> This is the same way he feels toward shortstop Shawon Dunston, so when Williams  says "some of the things he does on the basepaths are almost ignorant," the  truth of the matter is that he is flattering Dunston, talking about how his  teammate is so unbelievably aggressive that opponents can't believe how crazy  his baserunning is.  </P> <P> They feel much the same way about Williams' pitching. Everybody does. They call  him Wild Thing because he is definitely a wildman, and because actor Charlie  Sheen played a character with that nickname in a baseball comedy. But they also  call for him whenever the Cubs need a couple of outs in the ninth inning.  </P> <P> "I don't particularly care what I'm called, as long as they keep calling,"  Williams said. "As long as they're calling me something other than 'bum.' "  </P> <P> What makes Mitch pitch? What can be expected of him from one day to the next?  Almost anything. One day in Pittsburgh, he took a Jeff King line drive in the  temple. Next day, he pitched. Teammates kidded him that the ball hit him in the  one place no damage could be done. This is a franchise that at various times  has had its hands on Sutter, Lee Smith, Guillermo (Willie) Hernandez, Goose  Gossage, Bill Caudill, the late Donnie Moore, even the ace of the Giant bullpen  that opposes them in this series, Craig Lefferts, and often was left agonizing  as these relievers carried other franchises into the playoffs. Last time the  Cubs won a World Series, in 1908, was there even such a thing as a "relief  pitcher?"  </P> <P> Now, here's this goofball with a fastball, Wild Thing Williams, who spends his  spare time at bowling alleys, and gets his lower torso tattooed, and avoids the  barber the way some people avoid the dentist, and today it might be up to him  whether Chicago goes most of the 20th Century without a baseball championship,  North Side or South.  </P> <P> Babe Ruth once pointed toward center field here before swinging. Perhaps Mitch  Williams will point toward the press box before throwing. Anytime he doesn't  kill anybody this series, they ought to give him a save.  </P> <P> NL PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> It's the unknown Cubs against the unhealthy Giants in this series.

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Companies braced for tough balance sheet rules Companies will have to meet tough new requirements when showing capital instruments in balance sheets from June 22 next year, under the final version of a new accounting standard issued today. Financial Reporting Standard 4, produced by the Accounting Standards Board, requires many capital instruments currently classified as equity to be shown as non-equity or liabilities. The ruling will affect exotic instruments designed to circumvent existing rules such as convertible capital bonds. They will increase substantially the apparent borrowings of British companies and boost disclosure in their accounts. The main elements are: Capital instruments must be classified as liabilities if they contain an obligation to transfer cash or other resources. Share capital should be analysed as equity and non-equity. Any which shares which are restricted or have a restricted right to dividends should be shown as non-equity to the value of the full consideration received. Convertible debt should be separately disclosed and included as a liability until it is converted into shareholders' funds. Minority interests in subsidiaries should be analysed between equity and non-equity interests. The board has maintained its position that liabilities such as commercial paper must continue to be classified according to the legal terms of its maturity - generally short-term - unless the same lender is firmly committed to refinance the debt on the same terms.

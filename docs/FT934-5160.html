			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Observer: Paper chased Now that Lord Justice Scott's arms-to-Iraq inquiry has recommenced, senior civil servants are once more subject to the Rottweiler questioning of Presiley Baxendale QC and the pointed interjections of M'lord himself. But the game appears to have moved on. Some recalcitrant Whitehall mandarins are now so convinced that the enquiry will get right to the bottom of how the government sold arms to Iraq without parliament's knowledge that no box or office safe is to being left unopened in a renewed search for evidence, incriminating or otherwise. Some crucial documentation, all meticulously flagged, dated and signed, has suddenly started to appear, along with other papers which were supposed to have been handed over long ago. Profuse apologies to all concerned.</p>

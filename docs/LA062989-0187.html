			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING;  </P> <P> JERRY MEYER IS LATEST OF BROMME'S WINNERS  </P> <P> Ask a successful driver how he became interested in racing and the usual answer  is that his father, or a relative, was a driver or mechanic, or that he started  riding a minibike or driving a go-kart when he was 6 or 7.  </P> <P> Not Jerry Meyer. The California Racing Assn.'s bearded sprint car leader from  Chino didn't have the slightest inclination toward driving a race car until he  was 20.  </P> <P> Then one weekend, he and some friends went to Pismo Beach, rented five Honda  Odysseys and went frolicking across the sand dunes.  </P> <P> "We had so much fun I went right out Monday and bought an Odyssey," Meyer, now  29, recalled. "I thought the other guys were going to do the same thing, but it  turned out I was the only one, so I had no one to ride with.  </P> <P> "I was trying to figure out where I could ride when someone told me about  tracks where they held races. So my folks and I started going to places like  Ascot, Riverside, Corona, anywhere we heard about a race going on.  </P> <P> "After a couple of years, I was winning enough to go on the national circuit  and my folks and I traveled all over the country, running the Odyssey."  </P> <P> In 1984, Meyer and his father heard about a sprint car that Ak Miller and Jack  Lufkin, a couple of Bonneville dry-lake veterans, had for sale.  </P> <P> "They said we could have it for $8,000 so we decided to buy it and try the  CRA," Meyer said. "I told Dad that it would take five years before could expect  to win a main event. That's how tough I felt the competition was in the CRA."  </P> <P> Meyer was rookie of the year in 1985, finished seventh in points in 1986, won  his first race in his parents' car in 1987 and last September got the ride in  the red sprinter owned by Bruce Bromme of Gardena, the most successful car  owner in CRA history. He finished third behind Ron Shuman and Mike Sweeney in  the standings.  </P> <P> Saturday night, Meyer will be in Bromme's No. 3, a Nance chassis with an engine  built by Ron Shaver, in the 50-lap Firecracker 50 at Ascot Park as part of the  Parnelli Jones Firestone CRA championship series.  </P> <P> Bromme's cars have won 137 main events, the last five by Meyer, and five CRA  championships in a career dating to 1938 at Southern Ascot. Before that, Bromme  tagged along with his father, a riding mechanic in the days of Legion Ascot.  </P> <P> Bromme won championships in 1965 with Paul Jones, Parnelli's brother, and in  1980, '81, '82 and '85 with Dean Thompson.  </P> <P> Thompson won 103 races for Bromme, including Firecracker 50s in 1978, '80 and  '82. When Thompson retired in 1985, Bromme began looking for a replacement. He  tried Sweeney, Jeff Haywood, Bubby Jones and Stan Atherton before settling on  Meyer.  </P> <P> "I had been watching the young man and I liked the way he was driving so we got  together toward the end of last year," Bromme said. "I like the way he always  finishes. He doesn't do a lot of crazy things, the way some drivers do."  </P> <P> Meyer holds a 159-point lead over two-time champion Brad Noffsinger as the  season nears its halfway point largely because of his consistency. Meyer has  won only four races, but he has finished in the top 10 in 21 of 23 races this  season and he has made the main event in 75 consecutive races dating to 1985.  </P> <P> Meyer also holds the track record for the half-mile at Ascot of 18.652 seconds,  or 96.504 m.p.h.  </P> <P> His scored his biggest win May 6 at Knoxville, Iowa, the Mecca of sprint car  racing, when he beat dirt track veteran Jack Hewitt, a two-time United States  Auto Club champion from Troy, Ohio, in a 30-lap chase. Meyer started in the  front row and got off the line ahead of pole-sitter Noffsinger, with Hewitt  right on his tailpipe.  </P> <P> "I had always thought it was easier to run out front, but I found out  different," Meyer said. "Hewitt didn't give me a second to relax for 30 laps. I  could hear his motor all the way."  </P> <P> Meyer also won consecutive races at Silver Dollar Speedway in Chico and won his  fourth main event May 20 at Ascot. All of his victories have been over 30 laps  and there has been some speculation about how Meyer will do over 50.  </P> <P> "I'm looking forward to it," he said. "I finished second to Brad (Noffsinger)  on Memorial Day in a 50-lapper after I was running fourth at 30 laps. I passed  Shuman and (John) Redican to get second.  </P> <P> "I don't think the difference between 30 and 50 is as much physical as it is  mental. Another 20 laps means that many more decisions, whether to go high or  go low, or pass a guy in this turn or wait until the next one. You can get real  tired mentally."  </P> <P> Bromme's son, Bruce Jr., 37, is chief mechanic on Meyer's car.  </P> <P> "Driving for the Brommes is so much more enjoyable than driving for myself,"  Meyer said. "Bruce knows what combinations will work and he knows how to set up  the car to keep the driver out of trouble. I just go out and do what the car  will do for me.  </P> <P> "I don't even ask what gears we're running or anything like that. I trust him.  If I asked, I might want them set it up different, and we'd probably run 20th."  </P> <P> After Ascot, the CRA drivers will make an Arizona swing, racing Sunday night at  Manzanita Speedway in Phoenix and Monday night at Raven Raceway in Tucson.  </P> <P> OFF-ROAD -- About 300 cars and trucks are expected to race Saturday in the 18th  annual Soutars-Budweiser Fireworks 250 out of Barstow.

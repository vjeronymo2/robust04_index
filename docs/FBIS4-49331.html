			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee Meets for </F> First Time in Hong Kong; Lu Ping Presides Over Political Affairs  Group Meeting"]    [Text] Yesterday (2 May), the Political and Economic  Affairs Group of the Preliminary Working Committee of the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region [SAR] began a four-day meeting in Hong Kong.    The Political Affairs Group had its first session yesterday,  and it discussed the establishment of a SAR representative  office on the mainland. Members also discussed a report by the  British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee on  Sino-British relations. Lu Ping, deputy chairman and secretary  general of the Preliminary Working Committee, and relevant  mainland members came to Hong Kong specially to attend the  meeting.    The meeting was chaired by Lu Ping. Leung Chan-ying, leader  of the Hong Kong side on the Political Affairs Group, described  the group's first meeting in Hong Kong as having a good  atmosphere and high efficiency.    Yesterday's meeting of the Political Affairs Group was held  at XINHUA Hong Kong Branch's villa in Stanley. After the  meeting, the two leaders briefed the press about their meeting.  Xiao Weiyun, the Chinese side's team leader, said that as  usual, the meeting had assessed the current situation. In  addition, the group also discussed the establishment of the Hong  Kong SAR's representative office in Beijing and reviewed issues  mentioned in previous meetings in order to draft a work report  for submission to the third plenary meeting of the Preliminary  Working Committee. The group will continue to discuss these  issues today.    Leung Chan-ying said that Article 22 of the Basic Law  specifies the relationship between the Hong Kong SAR and the  central and local governments, and the provision mentions that  the SAR Government may set up a representative office in  Beijing; at the same time, various central departments and  various provinces or localities may also set up representative  offices in Hong Kong. However, the discussion remains at an  initial stage, and the final answer will be found in one to two  years.    He added: Concrete operational forms to be further  considered include future connections between the various  departments of the SAR government and the central government.  Will such connections be built between specific departments  directly or effected through a unified channel? What will the  rank of the representative office and its personnel be, and when  is the right time to set up such an office? This will have  close a relationship with the establishment of the SAR in the  initial stage. He pointed out: In the future, the relationship  between the SAR and the central government will not only be  limited to the appointment of officials and certain political  decisions; many economic issues will also be involved. For  example, civilian aviation is one such issue. The handling of  many affairs requires a close relationship between the SAR and  the central government. However, the details have yet to be  considered further.    Before the meeting, no member spoke to the press. Reporters  were divided into two groups. One group were reporters from the  electronic media, and the other were press reporters. They were  allowed into the meeting room to take photographs for five  minutes.    During the photo-session, some reporters asked Lu Ping why  he  did not talk with people on the spot in coming to Hong Kong,  when he would speak publicly to Hong Kong people, and whether  his refusal to meet the Hong Kong governor was against the  Memorandum of Understanding on the airport. Lu Ping just smiled  and did not say anything.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIHANOUK WILLING TO JOIN REGIME IN CAMBODIA;  </P> <P> SETS CONDITIONS TO RETURN AS HEAD OF STATE IN DEAL APART FROM REBEL ALLIES  </P> <P> In an apparent breakthrough in the talks on Cambodia's political future, exiled  Prince Norodom Sihanouk said Wednesday that he is now willing to return to  Phnom Penh as the country's head of state, even if he must abandon his  coalition allies in the ultra-left Khmer Rouge and enter into a new partnership  with the current, Vietnamese-backed government.  </P> <P> At a news conference here after two days of talks, Sihanouk said he had given  the Phnom Penh government clear conditions for his participation in the regime.  These included a constitutional amendment changing Cambodia from a socialist  country to a multi-party system and the setting up of a four-party government  during the transition to free elections.  </P> <P> But Sihanouk made clear after his talks with Cambodian Premier Hun Sen that he  accepts the constitutional changes announced by Phnom Penh as significant  compromises.  </P> <P> "Already we have made tremendous progress in Jakarta," Sihanouk said.  </P> <P> The talks hosted by Indonesia were the third round of discussions in a year  aimed at finding an internal political settlement before Vietnamese forces  complete their scheduled withdrawal by Sept. 30. The Vietnamese invaded  Cambodia in late 1978 and ousted the Khmer Rouge government, which has been  blamed for the deaths of an estimated 1 million Cambodians from killings,  torture and disease during its 3 1/2-year rule.  </P> <P> The 67-year-old Sihanouk gave a bravura performance at a packed press  conference, calling Hun Sen "a bad boy," telling reporters that their frequent  description of his behavior as mercurial was accurate and warning that when he  returns to Bangkok as head of the resistance coalition, he will be required to  issue statements denouncing the latest Cambodian reforms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pondering Deal  </P> <P> But Sihanouk indicated that he is seriously considering a separate deal with  the Hun Sen government that would allow him to return to Phnom Penh as head of  state even if the proposals are rejected by his allies in the resistance, the  Khmer Rouge and rightist followers of former Prime Minister Son Sann.  </P> <P> Son Sann, who also met Hun Sen separately in Jakarta, later pronounced himself  "very surprised" at Sihanouk's remarks. The Khmer Rouge did not participate in  the talks.  </P> <P> Sihanouk said he agreed to meet again with Hun Sen in Paris on July 24, to be  followed the next day by a four-party meeting. In the meantime, he said he  hopes that Hun Sen will make the required changes in the constitution that  would enable him to participate in the government.  </P> <P> Sihanouk said he doubted that the Khmer Rouge would ever agree to compromise  with Hun Sen. After they refuse, he said, there would be a tripartite  government in Phnom Penh.  </P> <P> Among the points of agreement announced by Hun Sen and Sihanouk were the  creation of an "international control mechanism" to monitor the Vietnamese  troop withdrawals and help monitor free elections. Sihanouk dropped his demand  for a U.N. force, and agreed to allow the force to be chosen by an  international conference, with two Western countries, two socialist countries  and two nonaligned countries making up the force.  </P> <P> Sihanouk said he and Hun Sen agreed that after the complete withdrawal of  Vietnamese troops, both sides would stop receiving arms supplies from outside  powers. Asked if he would accept lethal aid from the United States, a move the  Bush Administration is reportedly considering, the prince said his forces  already have enough weapons.  </P> <P> Sihanouk, who ruled Cambodia until his ouster by a right-wing coup in 1970,  said Hun Sen's government had made significant concessions in the new  constitution by accepting the right of private property, a free market, foreign  investment and the declaration of Buddhism as the state religion of Cambodia.  </P> <P> "He's not so bad, my son Hun Sen," Sihanouk said. "He's not quite good."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Multi-Party System  </P> <P> He said he was insisting that the constitution be further amended to remove Hun  Sen's Marxist People's Revolutionary Party as the dominant political party and  replace it with a Western-style multi-party system. Hun Sen said Tuesday that  he would consider the change, adding that it seemed inevitable.  </P> <P> The only stumbling block appeared to be Sihanouk's insistence that the Phnom  Penh government be "reshaped" into a so-called four-party system of government.  This apparently means Hun Sen must accept, in principle at least, the division  of cabinet posts among the four parties, while keeping the existing civil  service intact.  </P> <P> Sihanouk tried to play down the changes he sought, comparing it to the way  Paris dress designers modify an existing pattern -- "like Christian Dior" --  rather than scrapping a political system.  </P> <P> Hun Sen has vehemently refused to accept any suggestion that the Phnom Penh  government be dismantled in advance of elections, saying that only the people  can change the composition of their government. Whether he is prepared to  compromise further by naming Sihanouk supporters to Cabinet posts is an open  question.  </P> <P> "If Hun Sen accepts, I will join my son," he said, referring to the Cambodian  premier. "I will resign as president of Democratic Kampuchea," the name given  to the coalition government-in-exile, "I will go to Phnom Penh as head of  state."  </P> <P> Western analysts believe that for Hun Sen, the prospect of Sihanouk returning  to Cambodia without the Khmer Rouge would be a major triumph. While Sihanouk  has little in the way of a national army to contribute, he has enormous  prestige as the personification of Cambodia, he has international acceptability  and his inclusion as head of state would make it almost impossible for the  United States and other governments to continue withholding recognition from  the Phnom Penh regime, ending the country's isolation.  </P> <P> As recently as Monday, when he met with Vice President Dan Quayle, Sihanouk had  insisted on the need for including the Khmer Rouge in any settlement.  </P> <P> At the news conference, however, Sihanouk denounced the Khmer Rouge as  "criminal" and said that many of his relatives had been among those who  perished during the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia from 1975 to early 1979.  </P> <P> Sihanouk said he told Hun Sen not to worry about the possibility of the Khmer  Rouge joining the new regime in Phnom Penh, a major concern of the current  government, because "they want only one thing -- the continuation of the war."  </P> <P> He said Hun Sen has received assurances from Thailand that the Khmer Rouge,  whose forces operate out of base camps near the Thai-Cambodian border, would be  restrained by the Thai military.  </P> <P> Sihanouk said he rejected Hun Sen's proposal to create a Supreme National  Council, with representatives of each faction, as a compromise way of  eliminating the four-party government.  </P> <P> Sihanouk said he would wait until October or November to decide about joining  the government. By that time, he said, it will be clear that the Vietnamese  have pulled out as they have promised and whether Hun Sen has met his  conditions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SIHANOUK: LONG-EXILED LEADER  </P> <P> Prince Norodom Sihanouk, 67, has agreed conditionally to return to Phnom Penh  as Cambodia's head of state . . . he ruled Cambodia from 1941 to 1970, under  Japan and then France and with a variety of titles, including king, prime  minister and head of state. . . .

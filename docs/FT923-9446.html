			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian sugar mills await further export release INDIAN SUGAR mills are awaiting cabinet approval for the release of a further 500,000 tonnes of exports during the current year. The proposal by the Indian Sugar Mills Association to export this additional quantity has already been approved by the ministries of commerce and food. Indian sugar exports so far this year amount to 275,000 tonnes. Last year the country exported 525,000 tonnes. In a recent submission to the prime minister's office, ISMA said that in view of the bumper production of 13.4m tonnes of sugar during the 1991-92 (October-September) season, compared with 12m tonnes last year, India could easily export up to 1m tonnes, worth about Rs8bn (Pounds 140m). 'Even though export is a losing proposition for the industry, we must sell 1m tonnes abroad to manage the surplus,' said Mr Om Dhanuka, spokesman for ISMA. The Indian Sugar &amp; General Industry Exim Corporation, which handles exports for the industry, has sold to buyers in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Kenya, Bulgaria and Russia. Bumper sugar production for three consecutive years has convinced the federal government that India must remain a regular exporter of the commodity. The long-term export strategy that is being formulated will provide for a minimum export every year, irrespective of the size of sugar production. According to Mr Dhanuka, the government accepts that foreign buyers must see India as a regular source of supply. The government believes that for the strategy to be effective it will have to provide for the creation of a buffer stock and import of sugar in times of shortage. According to ISMA, the government should create a buffer stock of 1m tonnes out of more than 4m tonnes of sugar to be carried over into 1992-93. Maintaining the stock would not strain government finances as there is already a levy of Rs9 a quintal (100 kg) on the industry for the purpose.</p>

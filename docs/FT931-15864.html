			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney cuts prices to attract local visitors EURO DISNEY is slashing the price of entry for local residents to the EuroDisneyland theme park near Paris in an attempt to boost attendance during the slack winter season. For the next three months people living in Ile de France, the region around the FFr4.2bn (Dollars 770m) park including Paris and its suburbs, will be able to visit EuroDisneyland for FFr150, rather than the usual FFr225. Tickets for children under 12 have been reduced, from FFr150 to FFr100. The price-cuts will be accompanied by extensive advertising in Ile de France. Euro Disney, which has been clouded by speculation about disappointing attendance and merchandise sales, said the programme was similar to local promotions run by the original US theme parks owned by Walt Disney, its parent company. One problem has been the unexpectedly low level of attendance by the French. Originally Euro Disney had expected to attract 11m visitors in the park's first year. But executives have recently confirmed the level of attendance is likely to be around 10.5m. The park had 7m visitors in its first six months. Euro Disney said yesterday October was a 'good' month, November was 'slow', but Christmas was 'very good'. Euro Disney recently announced a pre-tax loss of FFr339m for the year to September 30. Mr Richard Simon, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York, forecasts a steeper pre-tax loss of FFr750m for the current year.</p>

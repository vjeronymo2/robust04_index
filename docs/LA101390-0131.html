			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMPANY SUES TO END BUILDING MORATORIUM;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: TAYLOR WOODROW HOMES SEEKS QUIT CLAIM TO DISPUTED LAGUNA NIGUEL  LAND, $25 MILLION.  </P> <P> Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd. filed suit Friday to force Laguna Niguel  to lift a building moratorium imposed in July when it was disclosed that the  district attorney was investigating a land transaction in the developer's  Marina Hills planned community.  </P> <P> The suit also asks an Orange County Superior Court judge to enforce a quit  claim deed in which public control over the land -- 96 acres of open space --  was deeded to Taylor Woodrow. The action seeks to void an earlier offer of  dedication in which a previous property owner set the land aside as potential  parkland.  </P> <P> In a related action, Taylor Woodrow Homes filed a $25-million damage claim  against the city for lost earnings and goodwill. The company alleges that it  has been unable to fulfill contractual commitments to suppliers and other  subcontractors or to sell its houses on the disputed land.  </P> <P> "We are reluctantly pursuing this action in order to protect Taylor Woodrow's  interest," said Taylor Woodrow Homes President Gordon Tippell. "We had hoped to  resolve and conclude the issue with the city but were unfortunately unable to  do so."  </P> <P> Attorneys for the company said they were forced to file the suit Friday because  they faced a 90-day deadline established by state law for challenging the  council's July 17 decision.  </P> <P> After a late-night marathon meeting in July, the council voted to deny building  permits for houses not yet begun on the undeveloped portions of the 96 acres  and to sue Taylor Woodrow Homes for damages to the land, part of which already  holds houses. City officials have said they will maintain the moratorium until  the criminal investigation is complete.  </P> <P> The legal action Friday came four days before the Orange County grand jury is  scheduled to begin hearing testimony concerning the land transaction.  </P> <P> Councilmen James F. Krembas signed the deed to Taylor Woodrow Homes in  February, 1988, acting then as vice president of the community service district  that preceded Laguna Niguel cityhood. Krembas has denied any impropriety and  said he mistakenly signed the deed in the belief that it was part of another  transaction.  </P> <P> Taylor Woodrow Homes executives maintain that Krembas' signature was only  ministerial. They say the transaction was legal and approved by the Orange  County Planning Commission after "hundreds of hours of community meetings,  discussions and public hearings."  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel City Manager Tim Casey said Friday that the company's suit was  "not unexpected," although he said he was unaware of a 90-day statute of  limitations.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel Councilman Paul M. Christiansen dismissed the suit as "part of a  public relations program" by Taylor Woodrow Homes in the days before the  opening of grand jury hearings into the matter.  </P></p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: On the threshold of a third phase - Asea Brown Boveri is looking for expansion Mr Percy Barnevik may court controversy with his opinions on thorny issues such as western aid for the former Soviet Union, but he has always preferred to hit the headlines by announcing good news from Asea Brown Boveri. Last week, he wasted no opportunity to do so. Reaching the UK table on a whistle-stop tour of a Copenhagen dining room, where journalists from 35 countries were tucking in at ABB's annual results shindig, Mr Barnevik revealed with some pleasure that ABB UK had notched up the group's biggest improvement in earnings last year. The president and chief executive of Europe's largest electrical engineering group is in confident, almost sprightly mood by his standards these days, and not only because of the performance of ABB UK. The entire group's pre-tax profits after financial items rose by 7 per cent last year to Dollars 1.19bn, in spite of a 4 per cent fall in revenues to Dollars 28.3bn. In dollar terms, that may not look too exciting - ABB's pre-tax earnings have, after all, hovered around Dollars 1.1bn since 1990. Mr Barnevik, though, sees a deeper meaning in the result than simply marking the return to rising profits after a slight dip in 1992. For one thing, he points out, profits expressed in local currencies rose by an average 25 per cent on a 6 per cent increase in revenues, a better indication of underlying trends. More significantly for the long-term future of the company, its 206,000 employees and Europe's role in the world engineering industry, he believes ABB is standing on the threshold of a new phase in its short corporate history. Phase one, from 1988 to 1990, saw the creation of the company from the engineering interests of Sweden's Asea and Brown Boveri of Switzerland, followed by heady growth and acquisitions in an expanding market. Phase two, from 1991 to 1993, was one of consolidation and selected growth. Amid deep recession in Europe and North America, 47,000 jobs were cut amid restructuring and reorganisation in western countries. On the other hand growth opportunities mainly in Asia and the former communist countries of eastern Europe and, more recently the old Soviet Union, have added 35,000 new jobs. The aim has been to exploit fast-growing new markets while laying the foundations for profitable growth in western countries when they emerge from the recession. This culminated last year with a reorganisation designed to improve global co-ordination and efficiency, and a net Dollars 596m non-recurring charge due mainly to restructuring in the second half of the year. Now, says Mr Barnevik, ABB has reached another turning point, and a third phase - expansion - is beginning. With the recession over for practical purposes, he says, ABB can go for growth and reap the benefits of restructuring which will be completed by this autumn, and will save Dollars 200m in a full year. Mr Barnevik may be one of Europe's most admired industrial strategists and visionaries, but hard-nosed City analysts judge ABB by its financial performance. By hitting the accelerator now, though, they believe he has every chance to achieve the expansion profitably. 'If ABB can't deliver earnings growth after all their restructuring, it's pretty well lights out for everyone else,' says Mr Russ Mould of S. G. Warburg Securities. Mr Barnevik is in sight of achieving a cherished financial target that looked even beyond him two years ago - a 10 per cent operating margin (return on operating profits after depreciation) and thus come closer to the profitability of its big rival General Electric of the US. The margin rose from 6.1 per cent in 1992 to 7.7 per cent last year, and Mr Mould believes ABB could get very close to reaching 10 per cent within a couple of years. A lot more restructuring goes on behind the scenes, he says, than is apparent from ABB's publicly announced reorganisation measures, such as the 1992 dismemberment of the old environmental services business segment. There is also considerable scope for synergies, and hence savings in the newly created power transmission and distribution segment and the biggest new segment, industry and building systems, which employs nearly 86,000 people alone. Here, in particular, Mr Barnevik will be under pressure to prove he has not created a conglomerate within a Leviathan. Better market conditions in western markets will help lift profits but the biggest contributions to earnings improvement will come from new markets. The fact that ABB is already making good profits in countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic is a hopeful sign for the future, says Mr Mould. In the Asia Pacific region, ABB is trying to boost its already significant presence - Dollars 3.6bn of sales last year - by becoming a true 'insider'. In power transmission and distribution alone, for example, it has 20 plants and plans another 23 over the next few years. And it may not matter that all ABB's competitors - General Electric and Westinghouse of the US, Siemens and GEC Alsthom from Europe - are doing much the same, because the growth prospects are so mindboggling. China, says Mr Barnevik, needs to increase its power capacity by 15,000MW to 18,000MW a year - compared with the 15,000MW built by Switzerland over the past 100 years.</p>

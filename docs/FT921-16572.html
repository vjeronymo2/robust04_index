			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Brazil's economy awaits 'flight to modernity' BRAZIL finished 1991 with an inflation rate of 460 per cent and an economy growing at only 0.5 per cent, with zero growth forecast for 1992, according to government figures, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. The growth rate for Venezuela, Chile, Mexico and Argentina last year averaged 5 per cent. Brazil is lagging behind the rest of the continent in many areas. Its privatisation programme started only in October; it has still to reach an accord with the International Monetary Fund and creditor banks; and its import tariffs continue to be the highest. The country's minimum salary, at less than Dollars 40 (Pounds 21.90) a month, is lower than that of Bolivia. But this year is seen as a turning point in which the economic shock plans that characterised the last five years will be abandoned in favour of attacking the fiscal deficit, now accepted as the root cause of inflation. Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, told businessmen in Rio this week: 'We are like passengers awaiting flight 2000 to modernity. This is our last call.' However, his team is still relying on tight monetary policy as its main anti-inflation weapon. Since September this has plunged the country into deep recession. A Gallup poll published this week found that 1991 was seen as the worst year in the last 10 and that 1992 was expected to be even tougher. Forty-one per cent thought last year was bad or terrible while only 17 per cent had a good year. Seventy-one per cent expect unemployment to increase this year. President Fernando Collor, whose popularity has shrunk to as little as 8 per cent according to some polls, hit out at the news media for their pessimistic prognoses for 1992. He claimed the opinion polls reflected the sacrifices of 1991: 'The measures we have adopted are not exactly the kind which reap applause.' But it is not all bad news. In December, for the second consecutive month, inflation fell slightly to around 24 per cent a month. This month the IMF is expected to approve a Dollars 2bn standby facility after an 11th-hour congressional approval of the tax reform, which is seen as the first step towards fiscal adjustment. Yesterday import tariffs were reduced by an average of 6 per cent, with those for cars coming down from 60 to 50 per cent.</p>

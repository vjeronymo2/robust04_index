			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Lords to consider Lloyd's duty to Names LLOYD'S OF London faces fresh embarrassment next week when the long-running Oakeley Vaughan court case returns to a public arena. Public hearings in the House of Lords begin on Monday to consider whether Lloyd's has a duty of care to Names who lose money through the 'misdeeds' of their agents. The immediate dispute is over whether the matter should be decided as a preliminary issue or as part of the main body of the case. The hearings are expected to last four days. The proceedings are related to a case in which members of syndicates managed by the Oakeley Vaughan Underwriting Agency in the 1980s allege that negligence by Lloyd's was responsible for losses of more than Pounds 5m. Meanwhile, solicitors acting for 600 Names expect today to issue motions for 'about 10' separate injunctions in order to prevent Lloyd's from drawing on deposits held with agents. The Names - individuals whose assets back underwriting at the insurance market - are members of syndicates specialising in catastrophe re-insurance which have made heavy losses. Labour MPs are continuing to add to the series of early-day motions critical of Lloyd's that have appeared on the Commons order paper recently. Mr Max Madden, the MP for Bradford West, will today question whether Mr David Coleridge is the right person to be Lloyd's chairman. This follows yesterday's call from Mr Bob Cryer, his fellow Bradford MP, for Mr Coleridge to condemn the use by working members of devices to divest themselves of assets which might otherwise have been vulnerable to the market's unlimited liability. Also yesterday the authorities at Lloyd's distanced themselves from the preliminary discussions that senior figures in the market have been holding with ministers and the Bank of England about measures to ease the liquidity problems of many agents. Lloyd's said yesterday that 'centrally' it had not been involved in any discussion with the Bank of England about possible financial assistance. It also said it had made no request for assistance from the Bank or from ministers. Lloyd's insisted that the Corporation of Lloyd's - the body that provides regulatory and back-up services to the market's 150 agents and 300 or so underwriting syndicates - is free from debt.

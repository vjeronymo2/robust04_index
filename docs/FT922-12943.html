			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Jobs: Mixed signs from employment market - Advertised demand for managers still depressed despite pick-up for executive-search consultants FIRST the best news. The Jobs column cannot remember when it last heard from so many headhunters wanting posts they are offering dangled before FT readers. What's more, not all of them are for insolvency specialists. Indeed, the influx makes such a welcome change that to refrain from outlining the offers right away might seem tantamount to looking a gift horse in the mouth. But, having lately backed other horses of optimistic colour that turned out to be the Trojan variety, I will first mention some news which is not so good. Its nub is in the table alongside, drawn from the MSL International consultancy's quarterly counts of executive jobs advertised in UK national journals. Each post so offered is counted as one, no matter how many ads for it appear. The table refers to the 12-month period ended on March 31 in each of the past five years. The top part shows the 12-monthly counts for each of eight broad categories of executive work. Next comes the total, which is then broken down into the all-category tallies for the three-monthly periods. As may be seen, the table gives a sadder view of advertised demand than the preliminary results of the latest count, which MSL released for publication as Britain went to the polls last Thursday. Those figures focused primarily on the tally for January-March this year which showed a 13.1 per cent rise on the previous three months. The only trouble is that the demand almost always goes up between the last quarter of one year and the first of the next. The average rise between them over the dozen years since 1980 has been 19.8 per cent. So 1991-92's 13.1 per cent is not much to cheer about. There is admittedly better news in the latest quarter's marketing and sales tally, not given in the table, which shows a 4.4 per cent rise on January-March last year. In general, however, advertised demand stays low. True, it may have been held down by recruiters waiting to see the election result. But I doubt whether that would account for the 514 jobs by which the latest quarter fell short of January-March 1991. That is nevertheless perfectly compatible with the reported upturn in business for executive-searchers and so-called contingency recruiters who keep large registers of job-seekers in various fields. With so many good people out of work or under threat, employers may reasonably think they can obtain suitable recruits by such methods without advertising. As long as those big 'buffer stocks' of candidates remain, recovery in advertised demand is apt to be delayed. My hunch is that there will be no marked increase until after the summer holiday. NOW to some jobs. All are offered through recruiters who, being unable to name their clients, promise to abide by applicants' requests not to be identified to the employer at this stage of the hunt. The first post, for a divisional managing director of a technical engineering arm of a British group, is being handled by Bob Archibold of Archibold Rae Consultants (11-13 The Broadway, Newbury, Berkshire RG13 1AS; tel 0635 33445, fax 0635 36701.) Based not far from London, the division has a Pounds 100m turnover and embraces 17 companies in several countries. End-uses for its products range from motor vehicles and farming machinery to precision electronic and medical equipment. Besides having a relevant degree, candidates should have built profits as head of a Pounds 50m-Pounds 70m-turnover technical operation with branches abroad. Acquisition experience also wanted. Pay Pounds 100,000 or so, with car and prospect of share-options. Next to Scotland where a UK group's subsidiary seeks a chief accountant through Antony Taylor (Taylor and Taylor, 28 Buckingham Palace Rd, London SW1W 0RJ; tel 071-828 7234, fax 071-630-0235). Applicants should be qualified accountants skilled in people-management as well as having success in the technical part of the job: to maintain tight financial control across the multi-site company, including overseas offshoots. Salary about Pounds 35,000, plus car. Thence to a marketing and sales directorship with a European group's promotional-printing sub-sidiary in Wales, offered by Dermot Hoare of Mandate Consultants (109 Jermyn St, London SW1Y 6HB; tel 071-586 3653, fax 071-911 0614). On top of proven marketing and sales ability in a similar business, candidates should have the general management skills to earn swift promotion to chief executive. Salary indicator Pounds 45,000 with bonus on results. Rest negotiable. Lastly to two jobs in Hungary and another pair in Czechoslovakia, offered by Graham Walker of Anthony Nevile International (69 Midton Rd, Ayr, Scotland KA7 2TW; tel 0292 287969, fax 0292 611038). All are with acquisitions of a London-based mining company. The Czechoslovakian venture is in industrial-mineral quarrying, and needs a general manager and a sales and marketing manager. The Hungarian centres on quality stone for buildings, and needs a finance director and a production manager. Candidates must in all cases have relevant skills and industrial backgrounds, plus appropriate language ability (German would do except in the finance post which requires Hungarian) and overseas experience. Salaries range upwards from UK equivalent of Pounds 45,000, with expatriate perks where justified.</p>

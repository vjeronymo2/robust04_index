			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / People: Tegner - on the Crest of a float Ian Tegner says he has 'four paid jobs and four unpaid ones'. His latest paid post is to become non-executive chairman of Crest Packaging, which is planning its public flotation for the end of this month. He adds that to his non-executive directorship of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, his independent directorship with Teeside Power, and his non-executive chairmanship of a company called Control Risks Group. Tegner took early retirement from Midland Bank at the end of 1989, where he had been director of group finance. Before that he had been finance director of Bowater Industries between 1971 and 1986. The joys of retirement for Tegner are that 'I only have to take on things that I have a real interest in'. He is fascinated by the nature of the business of Control Risks which, among other high-profile (but otherwise confidential) tasks, was responsible for the security operations involved in the liquidation of BCCI. Control Risks advises companies and individuals on preventing risks, but it also handles responses when trouble - such as 'product extortion', or blackmail related to tampering with products - breaks out. The company recruits its staff largely from the armed forces, police and fire services, 'all of which provide sufficiently for people to retire at an age when they still have plenty of energy' to do other things, says Tegner. It's clearly a philosophy he endorses; his four 'unpaid' jobs all require energy. He is on the board of the English Touring Opera company  - 'I say we are the Heineken of the opera world, taking opera to parts of the country it normally never goes'; of MacIntyre Care, a charity assisting people with educational disabilities; of the Argyllshire Gathering, which organises bagpipe competitions and highland games in Scotland; and of the Countryside Trust, which exists to help urban children understand the operations of the countryside. He sees his interest in Crest - subject of a management buy-out from Bowater in May 1985 - as being a continuation of the central theme that guides his activities these days; get involved with what you find interesting, whatever that might be.</p>

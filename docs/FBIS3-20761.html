However, they do not exclude  the possibility of closer cooperation between the PPS and the  OPZZ in the future, at the expense of the alliance with the SdRP  (Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [the inheritor of the  communist party and main party in the SLD]).    "We are not interested in factional games and scissions. We  want only to force the SLD to correct the economic policy," says  Ikonowicz. He foresees pressures exerted on members of his Sejm  club and commission. At the same time, OPZZ chairman Ewa  Spychalska formed her own group of trade unionist deputies and  senators from within the SLD parliamentary club.    Piotr Ikonowicz was born in May 1956 in Pruszkow. He is a  graduate of the Department of Law and Administration of Warsaw  University. Following completion of his studies, he was employed  as a reporter for NSZZ Solidarity [Independent Self-Governing  Trade Union "Solidarity"], Mazowsze region, and also as a  translator. In November 1987, he founded the PPS, which is bound  to the traditions of the PPS formed in 1892. Ikonowicz publishes  ROBOTNIK (The Worker), a publication of the Interfactory Workers  Committee of Solidarity. He is a member of the Association of  Polish Translators and of the Association of Polish Journalists.    Since November 1992, Ikonowicz has chaired the PPS Executive  Council. In July 1993, for his role in initiating the idea of an  electoral coalition with the SLD, against the Council's will,  the Council wanted to dismiss him from his function as chairman  and remove him from the party. Ikonowicz maintained his position  and won a seat in the Sejm from the SLD list.    He is married and has a daughter. His hobbies are soccer and  billiards.</p>

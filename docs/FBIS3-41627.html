The head of this department,  Commodore Viktor (Sakharov) told us about the recent dumping of  some of the Pacific Fleet's radioactive waste intothe Sea of  Japan, which all but caused complications in Russo-Japanese  relations.    [Begin (Sakharov) recording in Russian, fading into  English translation] The dumping on 17 October was planned.  It was sanctioned by the Russian Ministry of Environmental  Protection. Some 90 cubic meters of liquid radioactive waste  were dumped into the Sea of Japan. Their total activity was  0.38 Curie. Everything was done according to schedule in the  presence of an official from the ministry. The surface layer of  the sea was monitored throughout the dumping. The gamma  radiation at a distance of 20 meters from the dumping site did  not exceed the background radiation. [end recording]    Asked whether the Navy could give up dumping at sea,  (Sakharov) said this: The Navy has a big problem. It so far has  no shore installations for radioactive waste disposal and it  won't have them until after 1997. So it has to use the methods  it has employed up to now. In general, (Sakharov) believes the  Navy should not be concerned with the storage or disposal of  radioactive waste. The problem should be dealt with on a  national scale by a single state body. In other words, the Navy  should turn its waste over to some reprocessing plant and pay  for its services. Such plants would reprocess the waste of all  the ministries and other agencies that operate nuclear  installations.    Asked how the problem is dealt with in other countries,  (Sakharov) provided this information: Nearly all the countries  operating nuclear power installations face the same problems.  Until recently, most of them dumped liquid radioactive waste  into the sea. Commodore (Sakharov) says he and his colleagues  are well aware that this is no solution to the problem. The  problem has to be solved radically. Eventually the radioactive  waste dumped into the sea will worsen the environmental  situation, first locally in individual areas and then on a  bigger scale affecting the animal and plant world and human  beings. The problem can hardly be solved by the Navy or, for  that matter, by the country. It has to be tackled by all  nations since humanity has no intention of giving up nuclear  power.</p>

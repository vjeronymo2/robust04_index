			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (21): A market is born - Telecommunications unchained The dynamics of the telecommunications business have once again proved irresistible, writes Christopher Parkes. The latest demonstration of the market's momentum occurred in Bonn in mid-September when the German postal ministry performed an unexpected about-face. Mr Wolfgang Botsch, post minister, setting aside objections from Deutsche Telekom and European Union colleagues, announced he was no longer inclined to delay liberalisation of Germany's monopoly on telecommunications. Instead, he favoured opening networks to competition on January 1, 1998, the date previously set by the EU for liberalising markets for telecoms services (provided through links rented from the mostly state monopolies). In a clear signal to Paris that the unwritten go-slow alliance between Germany and France was at an end, he said Bonn would consider going it alone in the absence of consensus. Since the deadline - early 1996 - for the first tranche of the privatisation of the existing state monopoly had already been fixed, Mr Botsch's announcement completed the timetable for the opening of the free-market era in the German telecoms sector. The U-turn was all the more striking in the light of the German government's earlier foot-dragging. For example, Bonn initially interpreted and applied the 1989 EU regulation allowing the transmission of speech within closed user groups in its most restrictive form. Although the regulation was intended to allow companies to use their own networks freely for internal voice telephone services, the German interpretation said permission would not be granted for groups made up of legally independent subsidiaries. Only under pressure from eminent companies such as BASF chemicals and Colonia insurance, did Bonn finally relent: at the end of 1992. It was not until mid-1992 that the first licence for a private mobile phone service was granted to a consortium led by Mannesmann. However, Mr Botsch's latest statements prompted the leading private contenders for a share of the market to spring promptly into action. The energy-based conglomerates, primarily RWE, Veba and Viag, better known for their protectionist attitudes towards their electricity distribution 'rights' than for their competitive instincts, strove to catch the investors' eye with the unveiling of grander and grander designs. Veba, for example, scored something of a coup when it announced an agreement in principle with the federal railways, allowing it to lay its cables and optical fibres along the national track and signalling networks. The group, proclaimed chairman, Mr Ulrich Hartmann, was to invest DM6bn, create 10,000 jobs and take a 10 per cent share of a DM100bn-a-year market by 2003. Days later, RWE claimed it was to fatten its product portfolio by taking over Preussag's mobile phone business. Supported by the influential DIHT federal chamber of trade and industry, the newcomers have since harassed Mr Botsch increasingly with demands for access to the market even before the start of 1998. The pressure from the private sector for 'freedom now' stems partly from the desire to spread their networks and their wings in the interests of gaining practical experience, the better to compete at home and elsewhere with established private operators from the US and the UK. But the main attraction is the conviction that glittering prizes await the front runners. In less than 10 years, the prophets say, telecoms in all its manifestations could be Germany's biggest-selling industry, outstripping automobiles and engineering. The scale of the prospective profits defies calculation, but even the most conservative estimates appear dramatic. For example, a basic comparison carried out in 1992 showed telecommunications sales per head of population in the US were DM960 a year compared with DM520 in Germany. Market analysts have extrapolated that this alone implies a sales 'gap' of DM20bn a year to be bridged, even before additional services and products are taken into account. Veba, for example, forecasts double-digit annual growth in some services in the period from 1993 to the end of 1997. It envisages a 22 per cent a year potential expansion in mobile telephones, 32 per cent in added value services and 15 per cent annually in cable television (excluding pay TV). By 2003, the company says, Germany's main markets will be worth almost DM100bn. But ambition is one thing and reality is another. Despite considerable heavyweight public/investor relations work, the energy distributors' projects have failed to ignite investors' interest. One possible reason is that the proliferation of contenders and consortium partners has made it difficult to pick winners. The relatively long-term nature of most of their projects also suggests there is no need to rush. Analysts have chosen the energy groups as the most obvious because of their existing infrastructural advantages: electricity distribution networks already equipped with copper cable or optical fibres, and experience operating extensive internal data and telephony services. Although there will certainly be plenty of niches for service providers without networks of their own, such a role has already been rejected by the Preussag steel and engineering group, which recently sold its burgeoning mobile telephone business to RWE. But even some of those deemed most likely to succeed are taking a circumspect view. Viag, which is reputed to have the most extensive optical fibre network  - some 4,000km courtesy of its Bayernwerk subsidiary - recently excluded telecoms from a list of future 'core' activities. It was placed instead among 'supplementary' businesses which might in future become mainstream operations.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                  SALES PROSPECTS FOR WEST EUROPEAN AND                     GERMAN TELECOMS MARKETS (DMBN)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  GERMANY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       +% pa  +% pa Sectors                             1993  1998  2003  (93-98)  (99-03)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cable TV                              6    11    15    12.9%     6.4% Added Value Services                  7    16    25    18.0%     9.3% Data Transmission                    36    55    76     8.8%     6.7% Mobile Telecoms                      14    29    41    15.7%     7.2% International long distance speech   45    59    68     5.6%     2.9% National long distance speech        86   104   116     3.9%     2.2% Local speech                         50    60    65     3.7%      16% TOTAL                               244   334   406     6.5%     4.0%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                             WESTERN EUROPE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       +% pa  +% pa Sectors                             1993  1998  2003  (93-98)  (99-03)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cable TV                              2     4     5    14.9%     4.6% Added Value Services                  1     4     6    32.0%     8.4% Data Transmission                     8    13    16    10.2%     4.2% Mobile Telecoms                       3     8    12   21.76%     8.4% International long distance speech   10    12    14     3.7%     3.1% National long distance speech        18    21    24     3.1%     2.7% Local speech                         12    15    17     4.6%     2.5% TOTAL                                54    77    94     7.4%     4.1%  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: VEBA  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

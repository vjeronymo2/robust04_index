			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Management buy-out at Sharelink SHARELINK, one of the UK's three big private client stockbrokers, has been bought out by its managers for an undisclosed sum. The group, which regularly handles more than 10 per cent of the bargains on the UK stock market, was launched in the late 1980s with backing from BT, which owned 64.7 per cent of the company. Albert E Sharpe, the Birmingham-based stockbroking group, had 31.3 per cent. The sale reflects BT's aim of concentrating on its core telecommunications business. The buy-out, agreed at the weekend, is being backed by Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures and CINVen, which invests on behalf of the British Coal and British Rail pension funds. As part of the deal Mr David Jones, chairman, will increase his stake in the company from 4 per cent to 20 per cent. Sharelink, which conducts business over the telephone or through a postal service, was launched as a low-cost rival to existing stockbrokers, and has won a market share equal to the two other leaders, Barclays and NatWest Stockbrokers. Mr Jones was fresh to the stockbroking world when he approached BT with the idea for Sharelink in 1986. His vision of a low-cost, automated dealing service has helped to reshape the UK's retail stockbroking industry, forcing other brokers to reduce their own cost bases to compete. Sharelink made profits of Pounds 2.6m in the year to March 31 1991 and slightly less in the year to this March, though profits have yet to be disclosed.</p>

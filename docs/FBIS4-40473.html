			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Asin: "Duma Perpetuates Serfdom In </F> Agriculture"]    [Text] That was the assessment made by democrat deputies  of the law "On Agricultural Cooperatives," which has passed its  first reading in the lower house of the Russian parliament.  This document consecrates the "indivisible land" of the  existing collective farm-cooperatives and makes it impossible to  allocate a plot (a share) of land to a collective farmer who  wants to break away. The peasant's unconditional right to  freely determine his own fate is replaced by whatever decision  is reached by a general meeting, which is easily manipulated by  our rural feudal lords. In approving the law the deputies were  not deterred by the fact that many articles in the above law  contravene the Russian Federation Civil Code which earlier also  passed its first reading in this same Duma.    Igor Lukhashev, a deputy in the "Yabloko" faction, described  the passing of the draft law as "perpetuating the basis for  feudal relations in agriculture." In the voting, the document  was supported by 248 deputies, with 50 voting against. Such is  the real value of the present attempts by people in the Duma to  pose as fighters for human rights.</p>

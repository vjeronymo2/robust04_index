It also should illustrate the role of information resources in conducting policy analysis and drafting legislation as well as the role of archival materials in establishing the legislature's official legal record.

National legislatures in these countries have the opportunity to gain greater independence, develop more effective legislation and take steps to serve more forcefully as a balance to executive power. The viability and institutional independence of these legislative bodies could be enhanced by the services of trained staff prepared to play a support role for lawmakers and the legislative process. Legislative staff also are well paced to provide continuity regardless of the legislature's partisan make-up or the political fortunes of elected representatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the United States, Congress and state legislatures employ professional staff to conduct research, draft legislation, analyze budgets, maintain records, monitor compliance with legislation and perform other duties. In many cases, professional staff provide these services on a non-partisan basis. For example, on Capitol Hill, the Office of the Legislative Counsel assists committees in drafting and amending legislation. The clerk of the House and secretary of the Senate, selected by the majority party, assist in processing legislation and performing various reporting functions. The House Office of the Law Revision Counsel updates and publishes an official classification of U.S. laws. In drafting bills, lawmakers rely on non-partisan support organizations such as the Congressional Research Service, which analyzes public policy issues, and the Congressional Budget Office, which provides analyses of fiscal issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie breaks through to new peak ANOTHER session of heavy demand for shares across the range of the London stock market took the FT-SE Index through the 2,800 barrier to a new all-time peak yesterday. At the close, the Footsie was 18 points up at 2,807.7, after breaking through the previous closing high of 2,792 in early trading. Once again, the market was featured by strong buying of the second-tier stocks. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index outpaced the Footsie by a factor of two, gaining 33.8, or 1.2 per cent, to 2,817.4. Traders reported significant support from the institutions, and were borne out by continued strength in Seaq-reported business at 831.4m shares, compared with 940.4m on Friday, when retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.60bn. Optimism for a revival in the UK economy next year was encouraged by a report from the Birmingham Chamber of Industry and Commerce which indicated 'slow but steady' recovery in business in this important UK manufacturing area. The move into cyclical stocks, likely to benefit quickly from economic recovery, was reflected in a subdued performance from the blue chip defensive issues, which lagged behind the rest of the stock market yesterday. A heavy programme of delayed deals in leading stocks was reported after the official close. A shortage of stock led to a strong advance in stock index futures, although turnover remained thin. Having opened at 2,818, selling from a leading independent house sent the March contract on the FT-SE Index into retreat and it fell to a low for the day of 2,809 at around 10.00am. However, dealers moving to cover short positions led to a squeeze in March, and it moved ahead for the rest of the session with demand particularly strong in the last 90 minutes of trading. March ended at 2,848, up 33 from Friday's close and around 22 points above its estimated fair value premium of 19 to cash. Turnover, at around 6,000 lots, was poor. Volume in the traded options was down from Friday's high figure but still healthy at 33,811 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option traded 16,945, while a big trade in Glaxo just before the close made it the most active stock option of the day.</p>

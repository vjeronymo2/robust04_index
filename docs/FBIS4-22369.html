			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [ARMENPRESS report: "They Took Advantage of the Crisis: In </F> the Republic of Armenia Procuracy"]    [Text] Taking advantage of the difficulties that have  developed in the republic as a result of the economic crisis, a  number of officials in a position to dispose of material values  have abused their official position and committed grand theft of  material values and money. The procuracy organs have  investigated, brought charges, and handed over to the courts a  number of criminal cases initiated in connection with  thefts.    For instance, in 1993 the City of Dilizhan Procuracy checked  the system of bread supply for the population and uncovered  abuses that existed in this area. Taking advantage of lack of  control in the bread supply system and accounting lapses, Lianna  Akopyan, purchaser-shipper of the city trade administration--a  financially liable person--submitted false trade and  transportation invoices and forged and altered documents,  stealing 119,766 units of bread for a total amount of 1,773,722  rubles [R]. When on leave, L. Akopyan also managed to arrange  for her son to formally replace her as purchaser-shipper and,  putting together falsified documents under his signature as  well, stole another 15,233 units of bread totalling R495,057.    L. Akopyan was charged under Part 4 of Article 60 and  Article  187 of the Republic of Armenia Criminal Code, and chief  accountant A. Kazaryan--under Article 184 of the Republic of  Armenia Criminal Code. In the course of the preliminary  investigation, damages to the state in the amount of R2,268,779  have been reimbursed. The City of Dilizhan People's Court  sentenced L. Akopyan to a prison term, and A. Kazaryan to  correctional labor.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   Using the fact that the Armmolprom Association, in order to  ensure uninterrupted operation of facilities vitally important  for the population in the environment of a fuel and energy  crisis, permitted milk plants to purchase fuel for cash, the  administration of the Akhuryansk milk plant, for the purpose of  meeting its own fuel needs, issued from its cash reserves in  1993 in two separate authorizations R622,462 to Gurgen  Petrosyan, a person authorized to make purchases of liquid fuel.  The latter appropriated the money, and in order to create the  illusion that fuel had been purchased, filled the storage tanks  with 8,935 liters of water. In addition, he appropriated 1,268  liters of fuel that belonged to the plant and in order to cover  the tracks of the crime left open the faucet of the storage  tank, through which about [number missing] liters of gasoline  remaining in it spilled out.    Petrosyan's criminal actions caused R748,000 in damage to  the  state. He was charged under Part 4 of Article 90 of the Republic  of Armenia Criminal Code. In the course of preliminary  investigation the damages to the state were completely  reimbursed.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   Ostensibly with the purpose of organizing production and  processing animal husbandry products, in 1991 Robert Avetisyan  signed a contract with Artashat sovkhoz on leasing two  barnyards. It transpired later that this contract provided him  with a basis for obtaining and appropriating a bank loan.    An operating account for R31,000 in short-term credit was  opened in the Artashat branch of the Republic of Armenia  Joint-Stock Commercial Bank. The next day R. Avetisyan  transferred this money to the Savings Bank as designated for G.  Apikyan and E. Mkhitaryan--ostensibly in payment for cattle  purchased from them, and received this money and appropriated  it. In May, R. Avetisyan, under the guise of paying wages,  received a short-term loan for R19,500 in the Artashat branch of  Agrobank, and another R42,000 in July, ostensibly to pay for  cattle purchased. He also appropriated this money.    Continuing his criminal activities, by falsifying documents  over the period 1991-1993, R. Avetisyan received from the state  in the form of loans and appropriated R992,132. R. Avetisyan was  charged under Part 4 of Article 90 of the Republic of Armenia  Criminal Code.    The damage to the state has been reimbursed, and R.  Avetisyan  has been sentenced to a long prison term by the court collegium  for criminal matters of the Republic of Armenia Supreme Court.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   Charges under Part 4 of Article 90 of Republic of Armenia  Criminal Code have been brought against Silve Agadzhanyan,  warehouse director at the Yerevan ethyl alcohol plant. Taking  advantage of lax plant security with respect to material goods,  over the period July-September 1993 she stole R751,680 worth of  acetic acid from material goods entrusted to her. The stolen  goods were discovered and confiscated. S. Agadzhanyan's case was  referred to the Republic of Armenia Supreme Court with a  petition to refer it to the court.</p>

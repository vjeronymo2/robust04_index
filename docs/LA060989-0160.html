			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW POLICY LETS COUNTY REJECT PROJECTS THAT WOULD BURDEN SCHOOLS  </P> <P> In a major victory for school districts struggling to absorb skyrocketing  enrollments, the Los Angeles County counsel said Thursday that the Board of  Supervisors has the power to reject residential developments if the projects  will overburden crowded school systems.  </P> <P> The opinion by County Counsel DeWitt W. Clinton reversed a county policy which  held that the board could not consider the potential impact on schools when  judging a proposed development's application for a zone change.  </P> <P> The new policy in effect gives school district officials the power to negotiate  with developers, granting approval to new construction in return for land,  money or other aid.  </P> <P> School officials hailed Clinton's opinion, but builders said it would delay or  kill their projects and would unjustly force developers to shoulder more  responsibility for building new schools in rapidly growing parts of the county,  especially the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> To curry the favor of school districts, developers may have to scale back  projects, donate land for school sites or pay higher fees, said Don V. Collin,  legal counsel to the California Building Industry Assn. in Sacramento. "The  blackmail system is beginning to work," he said, referring to the power of  school officials to extract concessions from builders.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich predicted that the opinion would open "floodgates of  litigation" between schools and developers. He also said a change in the  board's policy could force developers to pay more for schools than required  under a state school financing law.  </P> <P> Board Chairman Ed Edelman told the other supervisors at their meeting Thursday  that it is clear the board and the Regional Planning Commission will have to  reassess the criteria they use to weigh development proposals. "We're in a new  era, gentlemen," he said.  </P> <P> Edelman said the board will take the opinion into account, although it may not  always side with districts opposing developments. Depending on the case, he  said, the supervisors may back the demands of school officials or determine  that a new housing project would not unreasonably burden a district.  </P> <P> County attorneys based the opinion on a ruling by the Court of Appeal in San  Diego last November that upheld the San Diego City Council's denial of a zoning  change for a housing tract proposed by Mira Development Corp. The appellate  court issued a narrow ruling that applied only to projects requiring zone  changes and plan amendments.  </P> <P> Until Thursday, the precedent set by the Mira decision had not been felt  because no school district had attempted to use it as an argument against  approval of a development, Collin said.  </P> <P> But at Thursday's board meeting, zone changes and plan amendments were proposed  that would allow two developers to build 517 houses and condominiums in  Castaic. The Castaic Union School District and William S. Hart Union High  School District opposed the developments and cited the Mira decision, saying  the developments would funnel hundreds of students into two already crowded  school systems.  </P> <P> Diane Jacob, a past president of the California School Boards Assn., called  Thursday's action by the Los Angeles County government significant because  other cities and counties may be influenced by the state's most populous  county.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decision Was Delayed  </P> <P> A decision on the two developments had been delayed until the county counsel  could review the Mira decision. At Antonovich's urging, the two developers will  meet with officials of the two school districts to negotiate solutions to the  districts' concerns.  </P> <P> Kenneth B. Bley, an attorney for Valencia Co., said the school districts would  have an unfair advantage in the negotiations. The company hopes to build 191  houses and 300 condominiums in Castaic. "You're allowing the school districts  to make an offer the developers cannot refuse," he said.  </P> <P> But Clyde Smyth, superintendent of the Hart district, said school officials  would not take advantage of developers. "I don't think the developers should  have to handle the whole problem," Smyth said. "I don't think that's right."  </P> <P> Jacob, who chairs a school financing committee for the California school board  group, praised the Mira decision but feared its impact would be short lived.  The decision relied on a provision in a 1987 state law that requires developers  to pay school districts $1.56 for every square foot of new residential  construction they build.  </P> <P> The aim of the state law, she said, was to establish specific developer  contributions for building new schools. Since the Mira decision could force  developers to pay more than those fees, it goes against the spirit of the law,  Jacob said. She predicted builders would push for legislation to eliminate the  provision that produced the Mira decision.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County counsel's opinion marks a change of fortune for the  Castaic and Hart districts.  </P> <P> In June, 1987, the two districts joined three other Santa Clarita Valley school  systems in proposing a special tax on new construction, averaging $6,300 a  unit, to build schools. Voters overwhelmingly approved the tax, but in February  the state Supreme Court let stand a Court of Appeal ruling that declared the  tax unconstitutional.  </P> <P> Now the county counsel's opinion has opened the door to the possibility that  the Santa Clarita districts could reap benefits comparable, if not better, than  those declared illegal by the appellate court.  </P></p>

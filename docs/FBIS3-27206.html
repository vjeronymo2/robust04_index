			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Pan Hui-lien (33821920 5571): "Liu Guinan </F> (0491 2710 2809), Deputy Director of the Political Department of  the Guangzhou Military Region, Says Hong Kong People Will Be  Invited To Watch the Training of Soldiers of the People's  Liberation Army To Be Garrisoned in Hong Kong"]    [Text] Guangzhou -- Liu Guinan, deputy director of the  Political Department of the Guangzhou Military Region, disclosed  yesterday that arrangements are to be made for some Hong Kong  people to watch the training of People's Liberation Army [PLA]  soldiers in April and May who are to be garrisoned in Hong Kong  in future. Concrete arrangements will be made by the XINHUA Hong  Kong Branch in a unified manner.    Liu Guinan, head of a 33-member delegation of the PLA  deputies to the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress, is  attending the Second Session of the Eighth Guangdong Provincial  People's Congress in Guangzhou. He refused to disclose whether  the Hong Kong personalities will go to Guangzhou or Shenzhen to  watch the training; however, he said that the military, being  aware of Hong Kong residents' concern over PLA soldiers to be  garrisoned in Hong Kong, has planned to arrange for some Hong  Kong personalities to watch the training of the PLA soldiers in  April and May. As to whether or not those who will watch the  training are members of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC)  or people's deputies, and whether or not journalists will be  allowed to accompany the personalities, will be studied and  dealt with by the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch.    When the PWC was established in Beijing in July of last  year,  some of its members suggested that the military should make  arrangements for some PWC members to watch the training of the  PLA soldiers to be garrisoned in Hong Kong in order to improve  the impression of the PLA on Hong Kong people and to reduce the  latter's worries. After that, Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, head of the  Hong Kong side of the PWC Social and Security Subcommittee, also  formally put forward such a request to Xu Huizi, deputy chief of  General Staff of the PLA and a member of the subcommittee, at a  subcommittee meeting at the end of September last year, but no  arrangement was made by the military.    Tsui Sze-men, member of the Standing Committee of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference and PWC member, disclosed earlier that  it was learned that the military planned to make arrangements  for PWC members to go to Shenzhen in October of last year to  watch the training of PLA soldiers to be garrisoned in Hong  Kong, but because the Sino-British talks on constitutional  affairs entered a crucial moment at that time and the political  atmosphere was quite tense, the Chinese side put the plan aside.    According to another report, an official of the Guangdong  Provincial Propaganda Department disclosed yesterday that on the  morning of 1 March, a ceremony will be held at the Shenzhen  Reservoir to celebrate the completion of the third-phase  expansion of the project for water supplied by Dong Jiang and to  mark the 29th anniversary of supplying water to Hong Kong. The  official, however, refused to confirm whether or not Premier Li  Peng will attend the ceremony.</p>

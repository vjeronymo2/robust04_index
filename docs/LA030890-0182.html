			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT&amp;T MAY OFFER MASTERCARD AND VISA  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is expected to offer MasterCard and Visa  credit cards this month in a bid to boost revenues from consumers, industry  analysts said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The long-distance telephone giant has been studying such a move for some time.  </P> <P> Analysts said AT&amp;T will probably offer the cards to most of the 40 million  holders of its phone credit cards. Spokesman Walter Murphy declined to specify  AT&amp;T's plans for charge cards. Last year the company confirmed that it was  studying such a move.  </P> <P> "We've looked at ways to advance the AT&amp;T card (as a product)," Murphy said  Wednesday, adding that the company has hired three senior executives in the  credit card industry to work in its consumer financial services unit.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T's large call-card customer base, combined with its billing and  computer capabilities, would give the company significant advantages if it  decided to issue regular cards for additional revenue, industry analysts said.  </P> <P> The cards would be good for purchases at stores, restaurants, hotels and other  retail locations, unlike the phone cards, which are good only for long-distance  calling.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T's entry into consumer credit cards would have far-reaching  consequences for the competitive credit card business.  </P> <P> "AT&amp;T is the world's largest transaction-processing company today," said  Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Charles Nichols.  </P> <P> Analysts said AT&amp;T has contracted with Total Systems Services, a unit of  Synovus Financial Corp., as its initial data processor. Synovus, formerly known  as CB&amp;T Bancshares, is a Columbus, Ga., bank. The phone company plans to  attract customers by waiving annual card fees in the first year and charging  interest rates of 14% to 15%, well below prevailing rates, industry sources  said.  </P> <P> "It doesn't take much to throw a little insert into someone's phone bill (to  offer them a new card)," Nichols said. "They will make it as easy as possible."  </P></p>

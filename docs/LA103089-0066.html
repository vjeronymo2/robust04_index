			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARY FREE TO LEAVE ALLIANCE, SOVIET AIDE SAYS;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: A U.S. OFFICIAL EXPRESSES SKEPTICISM BUT SAYS OLD ASSUMPTIONS MUST  BE QUESTIONED.  </P> <P> A Soviet Communist Party official said Sunday that Hungary may quit the  Moscow-led Warsaw Pact if it chooses to do so, a development that the State  Department's top Europe expert called "welcome news, if it is correct, but that  is not what the Soviet government has been saying."  </P> <P> Nikolai V. Shishlin, a spokesman for the Central Committee of the Soviet  Communist Party, said that Moscow "will respect the Hungarian choice"  concerning continuing membership in the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet-controlled East  European military alliance. But Shishlin said that the Budapest government has  said it intends to remain in the pact at least for the time being, despite the  decision of the Hungarian Communist Party to reorganize itself as a democratic  socialist party in a multi-party state.  </P> <P> Raymond R. Seitz, assistant secretary of state for European affairs, expressed  surprise at Shishlin's remarks, which he said are at odds with what the Soviet  government has been saying. But he said events in Eastern Europe are moving so  fast that all previous assumptions now must be questioned. It is even  conceivable, he said, that the Warsaw Pact might disintegrate.  </P> <P> However, Seitz suggested no new Western response to changes in Eastern Europe.  He said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization must remain intact, even if  its Communist rival disbands, because NATO "has an important political role" in  addition to its status as a military alliance.  </P> <P> In a related interview on the CBS-TV program "Face the Nation," Yevgeny M.  Primakov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, said any  member of the Warsaw Pact is free to leave the East Bloc military alliance.  Without specifically mentioning Hungary, Primakov said that "every country,  every state and every people have the right of choice."  </P> <P> Despite Seitz's expression of surprise, this was not the Soviets' first  reference to the possibility of increased independence within the Warsaw Pact.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has on several occasions made references  to non-interference in the affairs of the East Bloc. Only last Wednesday,  during his visit to Finland, Gorbachev declared: "We have no right, moral or  political right, to interfere (in Eastern Europe). We assume others will not  interfere, either."  </P> <P> Gorbachev's foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, has said that every  member of the Warsaw Pact has the right to formulate its own foreign policy, a  position affirmed by the pact members themselves at a recent meeting. And some  of Gorbachev's senior advisers have speculated publicly that Hungary might in  fact decide to quit the military alliance.  </P> <P> Shishlin also said that the division of Germany "should be changed, and it will  be changed," although he did not predict when. However, he said, Moscow objects  to the West German policy of refusing to acknowledge a separate East German  citizenship because it believes East Germany "is a normal state" that is  entitled to all aspects of sovereignty.  </P> <P> Seitz said that the United States has supported German reunification for years,  but "everyone recognizes that we have to be very careful" in dealing with the  issue.  </P> <P> The exchange between Shishlin and Seitz, interviewed separately on the ABC-TV  program "This Week With David Brinkley," dramatizes the Bush Administration's  caution in reacting to the upheaval in Eastern Europe. The U.S. government has  been hectoring the Soviet Union and its satellites to move toward multi-party  democracy and free-market economics for more than 40 years. But the  Administration now seems to be uncertain how to respond when Hungary and  Poland, at least, appear to be moving in that direction.  </P> <P> Gregory F. Treverton, a fellow in European Studies of the Council on Foreign  Relations in New York, said that the Administration seems to be dominated by  "congenital pessimists" who are unwilling to move forcefully to address events  that could be nurtured into major ideological victory for Washington.  </P> <P> "The only compelling argument I can come up with for why the Administration is  playing it so coolly is that none of us know where we are going, so things can  turn out bad as well as good," he said in a recent telephone interview.  </P> <P> When President Bush visited Eastern Europe last July, he announced an aid  package of $119 million for Poland and $31 million for Hungary. But, responding  to Democrats' complaints that the aid was too little, Bush increased his  proposal in stages to a total of about $452 million. Congressional Democrats  are supporting an aid plan almost twice that large.  </P> <P> But, despite the seeming bipartisan agreement on the need for substantial U.S.  support for democratization and economic reform, the Poland-Hungary bill is  bogged down in the Senate in a domestic political battle that has nothing to do  with foreign policy. Republican lawmakers have attached Bush's cherished  capital gains tax cut plan to the bill, touching off a Democratic filibuster.  There is no indication when the lawmakers might act on the aid program.  </P> <P> In remarks Sunday on the NBC-TV program "Meet the Press," Sen. George J.  Mitchell (D-Me.), the majority leader, declared, "Obviously, capital gains has  nothing to do with aid to Poland and Hungary, and I hope very much we will be  able to proceed with what President Bush has said is a high priority for him --  aid to Poland and Hungary."  </P> <P> Interviewed on the same program, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), the minority leader,  complained that the Democrats are trying to double the Administration program.  "That's how Democrats help; they always double everything."  </P> <P> Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), interviewed on "Face the Nation," said that the  Administration's approach to Eastern Europe is "timid." He said that linking  the Poland and Hungary aid package to the capital gains tax plan "demeans our  effort to promote democracy in Eastern Europe."  </P> <P> Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, interviewed on Cable News Network's  Evans and Novak program, said that the Administration wants to avoid "a bidding  war" over aid to Poland and Hungary.  </P> <P> "It's not a matter of just escalating the amount of money we throw over there,"  he said.  </P> <P> However, critics maintain that Bush, by tripling his own proposal in just three  months, has opened himself to suggestions that the figures are just pulled out  of the air.  </P> <P> Experts on the economic situation in Eastern Europe maintain that both Poland  and Hungary need private capital -- in the form of joint ventures -- more than  government-to-government aid. But these specialists say that substantial  governmental assistance is needed as well, primarily to cushion the shock of  conversion to free-market economics.  </P> <P> "You do have a shock on the economic system when you go from a controlled  economy to a free system," U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Richard Lesher  said recently. "There is usually a decline in real wages, which will make  people say, 'We thought the market would make things better, but they are  worse.' "  </P> <P> In the 1970s, a large amount of Western aid was poured into Poland in the form  of loans that were not used efficiently. As a result, the country wasted the  money and was left saddled with debt. This time, however, both Poland and  Hungary agree that Western aid should be tied to specific economic reform  programs.  </P> <P> A staff economist for the Senate-House Economic Committee said that both Poland  and Hungary can absorb substantial aid programs. The question, he said, is not  the amount but whether the aid is tailored to projects that will end the  emphasis on heavy industry left over from the Stalinist era.  </P> <P> "Obviously, there are limits to U.S. capacity to help other nations, but what  is happening is not only of great historical significance, but these countries  are in a large sense responding to U.S. policy pronouncements and pressures  over decades," the economist said. "Now that these countries are moving in the  direction the United States has urged them to go, there is a sense that the  United States ought to be a little more forthcoming to encourage these new  movements."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Michael Parks, in Moscow, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

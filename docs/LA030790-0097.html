			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MITSUBISHI, DAIMLER-BENZ TO STRENGTHEN TIES;  </P> <P> GLOBAL INDUSTRY: EXECUTIVES OF THE JAPANESE AND WEST GERMAN CONGLOMERATES AGREE  TO FORM AN ALLIANCE. THE MOVE WOULD GIVE THEM BOTH AN EDGE IN WORLD BUSINESS.  </P> <P> In an apparent strategy to gain access to the united European Economic  Community market after 1992, Japan's largest industrial group announced Tuesday  that it was negotiating with its West German counterpart to expand cooperation  in electronics, aerospace and a range of other fields.  </P> <P> Mitsubishi Corp., the core company of the giant Mitsubishi conglomerate, said  its top executives had met last weekend in Singapore with executives of the  Daimler-Benz group and agreed to strengthen business ties between the two  groups, which already cooperate in the automotive sector.  </P> <P> Mitsubishi said in a statement that increased cooperation would be pursued in  "high-growth industries" that would "benefit from development on a global scale  and make effective use of the skills of both groups."  </P> <P> Although details of the proposed business alliance were not spelled out, the  move can be expected to give both groups a stronger edge in international  competition in the years to come.  </P> <P> Daimler-Benz, which includes the auto manufacturer Mercedes-Benz, would gain  access to Japanese high technology, and companies in the Mitsubishi group would  enjoy marketing channels in post-1992 Europe, where the Japanese fear the rise  of trade protectionism.  </P> <P> "The concrete details are yet to be worked out," Yoshio Taniguchi, executive  vice president of Mitsubishi Corp., told the Asahi newspaper. "In any event, we  have made a cooperative relationship."  </P> <P> Shinroku Morohashi, president of Mitsubishi Corp., the general trading firm  that coordinates the activities of the 41 companies in the Mitsubishi group,  led the delegation to Singapore last weekend. He was joined by the heads of  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Motors and Mitsubishi Electric.  </P> <P> From the West German side, Daimler-Benz Chairman Edzard Reuter led  representatives from the electronics giant AEG, Deutsche Aerospace and  Daimler-Benz Inter Services, the group's trading company.  </P> <P> "There was a far-reaching exchange of ideas about ways to expand the  relationship beyond the automotive sector, where Mercedes Benz and Mitsubishi  Motors Corp. have enjoyed close ties," Mitsubishi's statement said.  </P> <P> The top executives will continue to hold talks periodically, with the next  meeting set for 1991, Mitsubishi said.  </P> <P> Mitsubishi Motors currently sells Mercedes-Benzes in Japan through its domestic  distribution network.  </P> <P> The Mitsubishi Group, with combined annual revenues of close to $200 billion,  is descended from a zaibatsu, a prewar industrial and financial conglomerate.  </P> <P> Companies in the group have recently attracted attention in the United States  for aggressive business activities:  </P> <P> * Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the leader in Japan's defense industry, is the  main contractor on the controversial FSX fighter development project, which has  become the symbol of "techno-nationalism" friction between Japan and the United  States.  </P> <P> * Mitsubishi Estate raised hackles at the end of October by purchasing a 51%  stake in New York's Rockefeller Center, a conspicuous landmark property that  symbolized Japan's surge in investment in U.S. real estate.  </P> <P> * Mitsubishi Corp. announced in January it would finance an $850-million  leveraged buyout of Pittsburgh-based Aristech Chemical Corp. in an apparent bid  to gain inroads into the American petrochemical market.  </P> <P> Taniguchi, Mitsubishi Corp.'s vice president, said at the news conference  Tuesday that the tie-up should not be perceived as threatening to the United  States since nothing concrete had been decided yet.  </P> <P> Taniguchi reportedly said, "It is inconceivable that this would aggravate the  American side, and we have no intention whatsoever to aggravate the American  side."  </P> <P> Mitsubishi officials said the areas of cooperation with Daimler-Benz would  exclude activities in the defense industry, according to Japanese press  reports.  </P></p>

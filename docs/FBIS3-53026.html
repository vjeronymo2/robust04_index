			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "The Significance of  International Attention," AL-THAWRAH says: Over the past 20  years, no summit between two or more world leaders has received  as much attention as the upcoming summit between Presidents  Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. An objective analysis of the  significance of this exceptional attention will show that the  reason for this is that the Syrian-U.S. summit is an important,  historic event on whose results depends the future of the entire  Middle East.    AL-THAWRAH adds: The summit, as it is planned for, is a  meeting for peace in the Middle East. Its major topic is how to  end the deadlock in the peace process that resulted from  Israel's intransigent policy.    AL-THAWRAH goes on: Certainly, President Clinton, who has  already emphasized his eagerness to meet President al-Asad, will  ascertain Syria's true desire to achieve peace in the region,  its serious stance toward the peace process, and its unchanging  concern to provide all the means possible to make this process  succeed and achieve its major objective -- a comprehensive  solution based on a just, full peace.    AL-THAWRAH concludes: The purpose of the al-Asad-Clinton  summit is to rectify the course of the peace process and give it  a new momentum to ensure that it will make progress.    Under the headline "The Geneva Summit," TISHRIN says: Rarely  have we seen political meetings that received a broad political  and media attention that equals the attention focused now on the  expected summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill  Clinton.    Since the announcement of the meeting, politicians and  newsmen have been expressing their views and the world media  organs -- in their various political shades and professional  levels -- have been full of articles and commentaries about this  major event.    TISHRIN says this attention has not come out of a vacuum. It  is truly a natural outcome of the weight of the two presidents  and reflects, at the same time, the hopes pinned by  international quarters regarding the possibility of advancing  the peace process in this region, which occupies the heart of  the world and represents a mainstay of the life cycle in it.    TISHRIN adds: The international community, which is seeking  peace and stability in the Middle East, has found out after many  long experiences that this goal is impossible to achieve away  from Syria and its views. No settlement can survive unless it  is just and comprehensive, ends the causes of injustice and  aggression, and restores rights to their legitimate owners.  President Hafiz al-Asad is the person who proposed this theory  and who has borne the burden of convincing the world of it. He  has succeeded, and thus provided the objective means for the  Madrid conference and opened the door for the possibility of  achieving real peace in the region.    TISHRIN also highlights the media capabilities mobilized by  Zionism to disturb the atmosphere of the upcoming summit between  Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. The paper points out that  Zionism spared Syria no false accusations and also practiced all  kinds of blackmail and intimidation against the U.S.  Administration.    TISHRIN concludes: We hope that the summit will succeed and  achieve its objectives and fulfill the great hopes pinned on it  by reviving the march of a comprehensive settlement and  achieving a just and lasting peace in the region that would end  occupation and restore usurped Arab rights. Syria has made, and  will continue to make, positive contributions toward this end.    Commenting on the importance of supporting Syria's stands,  AL-BA'TH says: The Damascus Declaration foreign ministers were  very clear when they asserted that a unified Arab position is  what enables the nation to restore all of its rights in  accordance with UN resolutions.    The paper notes that the meetings of the Damascus  Declaration  foreign ministers over the past two days have paid special  attention to the importance of the upcoming summit between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton under the current  circumstances.    The paper says that the Damascus Declaration foreign  ministers did not forget to stress Syria's important, vital role  in ensuring the success of the peace process. They affirmed  their countries' support for President Hafiz al-Asad, who is  maneuvering the ship while demonstrating rare courage and wisdom.    AL-BA'TH concludes: It is very important for Syria to go to  the Geneva summit while standing on firm ground and having the  support of all its Arab brothers in order to achieve a just,  comprehensive peace that restores Arab rights in full, keeps  harm out of their way, and thus provides them with strength and  impregnability.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Ireland digs in for long siege over punt THE Irish government appears to be digging in for a long siege, lasting months rather than weeks, in its defence of the punt and its membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Ireland's return to borrowing in the foreign currency market in the past week, and the launching on Tuesday of an IPounds 50m 'market development fund' to protect 30,000 manufacturing jobs put at risk as a result of sterling's free float outside the ERM, are signals that no one in government is about to unfurl the white flag of devaluation yet. In announcing the fund on Tuesday, Mr Des O'Malley, the trade and commerce minister, said 'We are hopeful that we will not have to increase the exchequer borrowing requirement as we have made savings this year. But we do need to assist those companies affected by the crisis'. The fund is to be disbursed over the next six months, at a rate of IPounds 50 a week per job under threat, and is equivalent to approximately 20 per cent of the average industrial wage. 'We hope the problem will not be prolonged,' Mr O'Malley said, adding that a review would be made in December. Some European diplomats were yesterday questioning whether the measures amounted to state aids to industry and involved elements of market distortion in breach of EC competition rules. 'It seems more like a market protection fund rather than a market development fund,' said one. Mr O'Malley said that he did not anticipate any problems with the package under EC competition law, 'as we already have agreement with the EC for a market development fund. This will be an extension of it'. The success of the government's strategy will depend, however, on whether it will be possible to reduce interest rates within the next few weeks. Inflation is running at less than an annualised 3 per cent, but Dublin one-month interbank money market rates have shot up to over 17 per cent. As one market analyst said yesterday: 'If they continue for long at these levels, growth in the economy will come to a full stop'. By announcing last week that it intends to raise up to a total of IPounds 500m in foreign currency to replace short-term Irish gilts, the government is signalling that a devaluation is not planned. The government's current foreign debt is close to IPounds 9bn, two-thirds of which is denominated in D-Marks and Swiss francs. Were Ireland to devalue to sterling's current level against the D-Mark, the government's annual debt service bill would increase by some IPounds 70-100m, equivalent to a 1-1.5p in the pound increase in income tax - a move that would only be undertaken as a last resort.</p>

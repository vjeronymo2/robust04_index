			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei weakens as Hong Kong jumps 2 per cent LACK OF fresh news and low volume in the first week of trading after the new year holiday left share prices weak, writes Bethan Hutton in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 151.50 down at 16,842.58. The day's high of 17,013.34 came shortly after the opening, and the index fell to a low of 16,688.47 in the early afternoon. Volume, at 160m shares, remained at the low level set by Monday's half-day 80m. Declining stocks outnumbered gainers by 667 to 202, with 160 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 7.68 to 1,298.13, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.39 to 1,058.46. Weak futures prompted arbitrage program-selling in the morning, and downward pressure continued in the afternoon following reports that the Finance Ministry would not allow investment trusts to postpone the redemption of Y2.8 trillion (million million) worth of funds which are likely to mature below their purchase price later this year. Brokers are not expecting the market to pick up significantly until later in the year, but support buying from public pension funds, which are expected to return to the market later this week, could provide a temporary boost. Mr Ueki Yasuo, general manager of Nikko Securities' equities operations group, said the market would be pulled down by outstanding levels of tokkin funds and investment trust funds in the short term, but that those factors would be outweighed by buying by public pension funds and foreign investors. He predicted a range of 16,000 to 24,000 for the Nikkei during 1993, with the lower level prevailing in the early part of the year. Mr Chris Newton of James Capel said: 'There is no obvious technical level of support until we reach 16,000. If we breach 16,000 I would think we would see fairly hefty buying coming from pension funds and also probably from foreigners, who in the main are convinced that 16,000 is around the bottom.' Isuzu Motors was the most actively traded stock for the second day running, declining Y6 to Y338 on rumours about management changes. Nippon Housing Loan hit a high of Y327 in active trading before falling back to Y308, down Y10 on the day on profit-taking. Mitsumi Electric climbed Y30 to Y1,140 on the expectation of growth in component exports to the US as its economy recovers, and on news that Mitsumi is supplying components to game software companies. Nippon Steel shed Y4 to Y289 in arbitrage-linked selling. In Osaka the OSE average finished 159 off at 18,424 in volume of 18.9m shares. Roundup TRADING IN the Pacific Rim was active for the time of year. HONG KONG finished 2 per cent higher on US buying. The Hang Seng index jumped 110.23 to 5,548.03 in turnover of HKDollars 1.71bn, up from Monday's 12-month low of HKDollars 956m. Brokers said sentiment was boosted by an interview with Governor Chris Patten in Monday's London Evening Standard which suggested that there could be a compromise regarding his democratic reform proposals for the colony. SINGAPORE soared on foreign buying of blue chips, and dealers forecast further rises to test the all-time high of 1,607.12 set in March 1990. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 31.24 ahead at 1,562.35, the highest level since June 1991 when it hit 1,565.58. Volume was an active 156.82m shares. KUALA LUMPUR finished lower after a heavy fall in Multi-purpose group shares sparked selling across the board. The composite index lost 1.94 at 630.89 in volume of 84.3m shares, compared with Monday's 72.4m. Multi-purpose and its associates fell on a lack of news about approval from China to start a gaming venture there. Dunlop Estates dropped MDollars 1.50 to MDollars 6.40 and Magnum was down 35 cents at MDollars 8.20. Multi-purpose shed 21 cents to MDollars 1.69 in volume of 12.63m shares. TAIWAN reversed early gains to end lower on this year's first day of trade. Political worries ahead of a cabinet reshuffle, expected by early February, weighed on prices. The weighted index, more than 30 points higher at one stage, ended 34.88 down at 3,342.18 in moderate turnover of TDollars 8.7bn. SEOUL retreated on profit-taking after Monday's sharp gain. The composite index dipped 6.62 to 690.79 in turnover of Won667.62bn. Construction issues were higher on hopes of a planned relaxation of government restrictions on property development. Hyundai Engineering and Construction finished the day's limit up, gaining Won800 at Won19,000. AUSTRALIA ran into a late burst of profit-taking after opening sharply ahead. The All Ordinaries index closed at 1,564.8, up 4.3 but after touching 1,574.7, in turnover of ADollars 454.7m. BHP dragged the market down in late selling, losing 4 cents to ADollars 13.56. NEW ZEALAND rose in the first trading session of the year, the NZSE-40 index adding 16.59 at 1,583.43 in NZDollars 18.5m turnover. Fletcher Challenge advanced 15 cents to NZDollars 2.60.</p>

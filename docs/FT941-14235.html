			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Manager wins 'too pretty for job' case An area sales manager who was told by her bosses that she was too pretty for her job has won her claim for sex discrimination and unfair dismissal. Ms Tracey Gatehouse, 24, went to an industrial tribunal in Liverpool last year after leaving her Pounds 9,500-a-year job at Warrington-based gaming machine operators Stretton Leisure, a subsidiary of brewers Greenall Whitley. The managing director had said he objected to her looking 'disco-fied' and the regional sales manager told her her good looks could make the wives of pub landlords jealous as she toured premises. The tribunal yesterday found by a majority that Mr Barrett's comments were 'gratuitous and offensively put'. It will later fix compensation unless the parties can agree a financial settlement.</p>

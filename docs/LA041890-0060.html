			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> LAWSUIT FILED ON POLLUTION OF BAY  </P> <P> Five environmental groups, including the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund and  Citizens for a Better Environment, filed suit in U.S. District Court in San  Francisco to force the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to impose cleanup  rules for southern San Francisco Bay. The suit alleges that California missed a  Feb. 4 deadline to submit "individual control strategies" required by the Clean  Water Act for four major pollution sources -- sewage plants run by the cities  of San Jose and Santa Clara, Palo Alto, and Sunnyvale -- as well as local storm  drains.  </P></p>

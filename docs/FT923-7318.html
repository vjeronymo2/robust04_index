			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Bundesbank defends rate increase THE Bundesbank has delivered a ringing justification of last month's decision to raise the discount rate by 0.75 points to 8.75 per cent, and emphasised that the German inflation outlook is still far from bright. In its monthly report issued today the Bundesbank makes a sternly orthodox defence of its monetary policies. It appears to be partly aimed at lowering expectations of an early easing of credit policies following last month's fall in the 'headline' inflation rate. Insisting that the underlying level of German inflation  - at around 4 per cent  - is still too high, the Bundesbank said that tolerance of inflation at current levels would damage German economic prospects. This applied especially in eastern Germany, where higher inflation would damage the outlook for investment and jobs. The Bundesbank's unbending stance on inflation supports the view that the central bank will remain reluctant to carry out large-scale intervention to support the dollar at its current low levels. Analysts have suggested that the Bundesbank's half-hearted participation in dollar support operations reflects its conviction that a strong D-Mark helps bring down inflation. On last month's 0.75 points interest rate rise, the bank said: 'Had we delayed, there would have been negative consequences.' This would have involved the risk of 'losing the credibility' of its policy of monetary stability. Despite signs of a German economic downturn, the Bundesbank argued that it was not taking any 'indefensible risks' with the German economy. As for European partners which have complained about the Bundesbank's policies, the bank said further currency integration would be helped by a convergence of inflation at the lowest possible level. It said there was no justification for growth in money supply substantially above the 3.5 to 5.5 per cent target range, even though a number of special factors help to explain this year's overshooting. 'There is no question that (the outlook for) money supply growth is too strong in the medium-term', the Bundesbank said. In May and June money supply growth ran at 8.8 and 8.7 per cent respectively and analysts are expecting the figure for July, to be published in the next week, to be around 8.4 per cent. The outlook for inflation is still a cause for concern, especially because of this year's wage rises and introduction of higher value added tax next January, the Bundesbank said.</p>

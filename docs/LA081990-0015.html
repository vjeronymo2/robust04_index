			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LADIES HOME PRISON  </P> <P> I am 30 years old, and I am sick of the slurs that housewife and motherhood  receive in our modern world, especially through the media. We are made to  believe that life is much better now for women because of the women's  liberation movement.  </P> <P> I beg to differ. At no other time has our country been crippled from the  effects of divorce, adultery, alcohol and drug abuse, wife and child abuse,  apathy, and moral and spiritual lethargy. At no time has the traditional family  been under such attack. And today mothers are less in the home than ever  before.  </P> <P> May I suggest that the "dreary and isolated drudgery" that some women face is  in trying to be liberated from their traditional role and missing the simple  pleasures of keeping a well-ordered and healthy home? Please don't assume that  meeting the basic needs of one's family with efficiency and economy cannot be a  pleasurable thing.  </P> <P> KELLI M. KENNEDY  </P> <P> Avalon  </P></p>

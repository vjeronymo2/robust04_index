			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Further setback on higher turnover NERVOUSNESS on both the political and economic fronts continued to bear down on the London stock market yesterday, and the fourth negative session this week set the stage for the close today of the equity trading account. A sharp increase in trading volume was largely confined to a switching operation affecting several leading stocks in the FT-SE list, and traders maintained that the institutions were still backing away across the wider range of UK equities. Once again, the New York market played an ambivalent role in the London equity sector. Traders remained cautious over the near-term outlook for the Dow, but UK stocks closed above the day's lows as Wall Street edged higher in early trading, after losing 15.21 in the previous session. The London market closed with a fall of 12.8 on the FT-SE Index for a final reading of 2,534.3, with the investment mood subdued at the close of trading. A temporary scare at the beginning of the session appeared to reflect a mistaken reading of a report on the potential implications for several Footsie stocks of the proposed changes in accounting standards. The report has been prepared, but not yet published, by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK investment bank, which rejected the initial market comments as 'totally incorrect' and stressed that it had not changed investment recommendations on the stocks concerned. With trends in the London money markets now no longer indicating an early reduction in domestic base rates, equities opened the session without support, and were soon down by more than 11 points on the Footsie scale. Rumours of further pending political scandals were largely discounted, however, and in the absence of significant selling, share prices rallied and moved briefly into positive territory. But gains were rapidly and sharply reversed when clients of County NatWest acted on the investment bank's recommendation of a switch out of the leading oil stocks and into telecommunications issues. At least one very large institutional client was believed to be prominent in the switch. The market sagged by 17.4 points to touch FT-SE 2,529.7. Traders identified a large mixed trading programme from a UK investment bank which took the heart out of a stock market already lacking in genuine investment support. Share prices rallied towards the close when Wall Street, which is still an uncertain factor ahead of the payroll and employment statistics to be published today, opened steadily. Trading volume through the Seaq network rose to 539.1m shares from the 491.8m of the previous session. Yesterday's total took in heavy contributions from British Petroleum, Shell, BT and Racal Electronics. Retail business totalled Pounds 954.8m on Wednesday, an improvement from daily levels at the beginning of the week, but still disappointing by standards of market profitability. Strategists commented that political factors have played an increased role this week in the wake of the disclosures by Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the UK Liberal Democrats. This has focused attention on the latest public opinion polls, which are expected to appear in the UK newspapers this morning.</p>

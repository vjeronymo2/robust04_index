(NAN/PANA) -- Another detained  Nigerian national drug law enforcement agent, Audu Adams, has  been released by the country's Miscellaneous Offences Tribunal.  Tribunal chairman Justice Funmilayo Oni-Okpaku ordered the  release Tuesday, in view of the appeal made by the director of  public prosecution, Wonu Folami, that Adams never saw the drug  exhibits till the day the tribunal went to inspect them. Folami  also urged the tribunal to release the remaining 10 agents  detained in order for them to continue investigations in the  case. But the tribunal chairman declined to grant her request,  saying that the officials were charged with interfering with the  exhibit and, as such, would not be released, until evidence to  the contrary was provided.    On the continuous silence by Joe Brown Akubueze, the man who  imported drugs into Nigeria, Justice Oni-Okpaku ruled that it  was clear that the accused had no intention of securing a lawyer  and was deliberately delaying the proceedings by refusing to  speak up in court.    In another development, one Oluyemi Abisayo, surety to  socialite Jennifer Madike, was arrested Tuesday and brought to  the tribunal because Madike, who was ordered to appear before  the tribunal, could not be found. The tribunal ordered Abisayo  to assist the police "in getting Jennifer" while the case was  adjourned to 15 February.</p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> POLEMICAL HORRORS OF THE NUCLEAR WINTER;  </P> <P> A PATH WHERE NO MAN THOUGHT: NUCLEAR WINTER AND THE END OF THE ARMS RACE, BY  CARL SAGAN AND RICHARD TURCO. RANDOM HOUSE INC. $18.95, CLOTH; 320 PAGES  </P> <P> While some officials in the Reagan Administration predicted that Americans  could survive a nuclear war "with enough shovels" to dig for cover, the picture  presented by many working scientists is far darker. In this provocative study  of the dangers of nuclear proliferation, astrophysicists Carl Sagan and Richard  Turco argue that smoke clouds will occlude the sun's warming effects after a  full-scale nuclear war, bringing the bone-wracking chill and darkness of an  arctic winter.  </P> <P> The image, to be sure, is emotionally jarring, but it might not be entirely  true. Scientists unrepresented in these sometimes polemical pages have argued  that the evidence gathered so far -- from volcanic eruptions at Mt. St. Helens  to forest fires in Yellowstone -- does not support the most dire predictions.  </P> <P> Some scientists differ only on the degree of destruction, not disputing the  inevitability of a catastrophe. Other differences are more fundamentally  scientific, dealing, for example, with the validity of the convection current  modeling the authors use to predict effects from the area immediately adjacent  to the Earth -- the troposphere -- up to the stratosphere.  </P> <P> In the final analysis, neither the authors nor their critics can muster  arguments that are based on more than the imperfect art of computer modeling,  whose failures at predicting weather are well-known to those who live in  volatile regions such as the tropical storm belt.  </P> <P> Still, we cannot afford to wager if the horrendous consequences of nuclear  winter are even remotely possible. A miscalculation could precipitate enormous  climatic and environmental changes and ultimately kill a substantial fraction  of humankind as well as the worsen of the quality of life for the minority who  survived.  </P> <P> While not always persuasive as scientists, Sagan and Turco are effective  politicians, revealing some of the duplicity that has surrounded the politics  of nuclear deterrence and the senselessness of the belief that a strategy which  threatens all of us nonetheless protects some of us. Also well-reasoned is  their call for a nuclear strategy based on the principle of minimum sufficient  deterrence.  </P> <P> Publication of "Path Where No Man Thought" is particularly timely in view of  the brinkmanship in the Middle East into which we have been thrust. As we  possibly edge toward war, can there be a more pertinent or greater  recommendation to ponder carefully these authors' arguments, lest we stumble  into a situation no thoughtful person would wish? Surely an aroused public is  the greatest deterrent to a nuclear winter, and this book will help inform  their discretion.  </P> <P> Next: Jonathan Kirsch reviews "Olga" by Fernando Morais (Grove).  </P></p>

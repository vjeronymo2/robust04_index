			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 14 (AFP) -- Air France will probably  report a loss of eight billion to nine billion francs ($1.37 to  1.54 billion) for 1993, French transport minister Bernard Bosson  told the Senate on Thursday [14 April].    He said the troubled airline would announce the figure  "within a few days," adding that airline "officials informed the  government after a substantial delay."    The most recent official forecast was for a loss of 7.5  billion francs last year.    Bosson added that the government would grant 20 billion  francs' worth of aid to the company in three installments over  three years, "depending on concrete results" of the airline's  recovery efforts. The first half (10 billion francs) will be  paid after the European Commission in Brussels approves the  company's restructuring plans, he said.</p>

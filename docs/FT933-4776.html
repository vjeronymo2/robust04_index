			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / The Renault-Volvo Merger: A marriage to respect sensitivities THE merger agreement between Renault and Volvo bears the hallmarks of a carefully-arranged marriage. The problem the two groups faced in achieving their merger was to overcome the sensitivities involved in uniting two powerful industrial groups while respecting their relative balance of power. The solution is a complex division of financial and management structures which give the French government, Renault's principal shareholder, the stronger hand. At the core of the agreement is the creation of two separate bodies, a holding company, called RVC, and Renault-Volvo Automotive, the linchpin of the organisation, which pools all the automotive interests and financial subsidiaries of both groups. Volvo's non-automotive businesses, such as its marine engines and food interests, will not be part of this company. Renault-Volvo Automotive will conduct the business operations of the new group. It will be responsible for all strategic and management decisions. RVC will have no management role. Its task, say the companies, is to safeguard the interests of shareholders. In both of the new bodies, the French will be the dominant partner. The French state will hold 51 per cent of RVC through Renault SA, which is owned 100 per cent by the French government. The French state will also hold directly 46.3 per cent of Renault-Volvo Automotive. AB Volvo will hold 49 per cent of RVC and 17.85 per cent of Renault-Volvo Automotive. Renault and Volvo described the agreement as balanced. 'It is a fact that Renault is twice as big as Volvo and so naturally that is reflected in the equity structure,' the companies said in a statement yesterday. If French interests are dominant in the financial structure they are also stronger at the management level. Mr Louis Schweitzer, the current chairman of Renault, will become chairman of Renault-Volvo Automotive's management board and be in charge of the day-to-day running of the group. RVC will be governed by a six-member board - three appointed by Renault and three by Volvo. The chairman of the board, who holds the casting vote, will, however, be nominated by Renault SA. Both RVC and Renault-Volvo Automotive will be based in France. But if Volvo is the junior partner, it remains a powerful one, due to a system of checks and balances within the merger agreement. The most important includes the establishment of a supervisory board. Such a body, common in German industry, is highly unusual in France. It will appoint Renault-Volvo Automotive's management board and will decide on what the companies describe as 'major financial issues'. The chairman of the supervisory board will be proposed by Volvo. Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the current Volvo chairman, is expected to take this post. Beneath him will be an 18-member board, reduced to 14 after the sale of the French government's share in Renault-Volvo Automotive which is expected by 1995. The 18 members will comprise six representatives from the French state, three representatives from AB Volvo, three members from the international business community chosen for their expertise, and six employee representatives from the Renault-Volvo Automotive group. Volvo's hand is also strengthened by the terms of the shareholders' agreement which will be valid for 25 years following the initiation of the merger on January 1 1994. Both Renault and Volvo will be able to terminate the shareholders' agreement at the end of the eighth year of the merger, subject to two years' prior notice. According to a statement from the joint group, the shareholders' agree-ment will establish the balance of power between Renault and Volvo in what are described as 'vital matters'. On other subjects, sub-mitted to shareholders, the statement says, a simple majority will be sufficient. In practice, this appears to give Volvo a veto power over important issues such as the raising of capital and investments in new products and facilities. 'It is an important means of limiting Renault's power,' said one Paris-based automobile industry analyst. 'It gives some reassurance to Volvo's shareholders.' Such reassurance, which runs through the terms of the agreement, will determine whether the merger runs smoothly. Both Renault and Volvo will hope it prevents outbursts of marital strife.</p>

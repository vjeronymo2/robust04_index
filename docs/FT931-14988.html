			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Families in need increase by 50% THE NUMBER of families receiving income support rose from 2.9m in 1979 to 4.1m in 1989 according to statistics published by the Commons social security committee yesterday, Alan Pike writes. By 1989, 6.98m people were living in households dependent on income support, compared with 4.57m in 1979. The main groups accounting for the growth were single parents, the unemployed and long-term sick and disabled people. Over the same period there was a rise of almost 50 per cent in the number of families with incomes below benefit level - up from 2.05m to 2.97m. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said the report demonstrated that during the 1980s the incomes of those on state benefits had grown at only half the rate of the population as a whole. He said the prime minister, 'the self-declared prophet of the classless society', should read the report with shame. Social Security Committee. Low Income Statistics: Low Income Families 1979-1989.

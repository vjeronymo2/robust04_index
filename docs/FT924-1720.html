			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Vodaphone wins Australian licence THE Australian government yesterday awarded a licence to operate a third mobile telephone network to a consortium led by Vodafone, the UK telecommunications group. Mr Bob Collins, the communications minister, said the Arena GSM consortium would pay ADollars 140m (USDollars 96.6m) for the licence, which attracted offers from four consortia. The Arena consortium comprises Vodafone and two Australian companies, AAP Telecommunications and Exicom. The main competitor for the licence is believed to have been a consortium led by Singapore Telecommunications. The government said the Arena offer would create about 5,000 jobs. Arena is believed to have promised to direct research and development spending to Australia to help develop the local telecommunications industry. Arena will compete with mobile services offered by Australia Telecom, the government-owned carrier, and Optus, a consortium owned by BellSouth of the US, Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, and Mayne Nickless, the Australian transport group. Australia Telecom and Optus have provided competing analogue mobile services since July, but will switch to group special mobile (GSM) digital services next year. All the bidders for the third licence offered to use digital technology from the commencement of services. But Arena is thought to have won partly because of its experience in operating GSM in Europe.</p>

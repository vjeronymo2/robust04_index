			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TREVINO TRAILS BIES BY 6 SHOTS  </P> <P> Lee Trevino fought off a balky putter and shot another 69, but fell another  shot off the pace at Royal Kaanapali Golf Club in Hawaii Friday in the second  round of his debut on the Senior PGA Tour.  </P> <P> His 36-hole total of 138 left him six shots behind leader Don Bies going into  Saturday's final round of the Kaanapali tournament.  </P> <P> "I don't think I can win it now," said Trevino. "Not the way Bies is playing.  I'd have to shoot nine-under to do it."  </P> <P> Bies, playing in the same group with Trevino, shot an eight-under 64 and was at  132.  </P> <P> Dale Douglass, who hasn't made a bogey in the tournament, was alone at 133  after a 67.  </P> <P> Charles Coody, with a 65, and Tom Shaw, whose 66 included a double bogey from  the pond on the final hole, were tied at 135.  </P> <P> Gene Littler, with a 68, and first-round leader Joe Jimenez were next at 137.  </P> <P> Trevino, five shots back at the start of the day, birdied three of his first  six holes and appeared ready to make a run at the lead.  </P> <P> But his putter went bad on the back nine, and he was shaking a graying head and  muttering and mumbling in frustration.  </P> <P> "My putter got me. But I'm not surprised," said Trevino, who predicted early in  the week that his fortunes would ride on his putter.  </P> <P> South African David Frost had eight birdies en route to a six-under-par 66 and  took a three-stroke lead in Sun City, South Africa, at the halfway point of the  Million Dollar Challenge.  </P> <P> Frost, playing better than when he won the World Series of Golf in August,  ended the storm-interrupted round with a total of 133, 11-under-par.  </P> <P> American Tim Simpson, who played steadily but dropped a shot at the eighth hole  when he hurried a putt during a lightning flash, was in second place at 136.  Simpson, who shot a 69, and Frost had shared the opening-round lead with Scott  Hoch, another American, after shooting 67s.  </P> <P> Hoch played the second round in par 72 and fell to third place at 139, six  strokes behind Frost.  </P> <P> "I gather they didn't roll the greens today, which meant they were a lot  slower, and I kept leaving my putts short," Hoch said.  </P> <P> Blaine McCallister and Charlie Epps capped a round of 60 with their second  eagle of the day on the final hole to take a one-stroke after the second round  of the Chrysler PGA Team Championships at the Cypress Course in Wellington,  Fla.  </P> <P> McCallister and Epps had a seven-under-par 29 on the back nine. Their 36-hole  score of 123, 21 under par, is one stroke better than the teams of Rick  Fehr-Kent Kluba and Mike Hulbert-Bob Tway.  </P></p>

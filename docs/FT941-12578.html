			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Car industry fears diesel crisis: Sales surge could be jeopardised by government report on pollution The scale of the surge in diesel-vehicle sales in the UK new-car market has caught the motor industry by surprise. Sales rose from fewer than 10,000 a year at the start of the 1980s to about 120,000 in 1988 - 6 per cent of the market. Last year the total was 340,472, a fifth of the market. The rise has continued this month. An angry industry was last night wondering whether the boom will be slowed or even halted by publication of the Department of the Environment's Quality of Urban Air Review Group study. The report warned that a bigger diesel-car population could lead to a worsening of emissions of nitrogen oxides (Nox) and particles containing carcinogens - claims rejected by the industry. A similar report in Germany in the late 1980s brought diesel car growth to a halt, although it is now recovering. While the industry claims that it has no reason to favour either form of vehicle, it fears confusion among motorists about the merits or hazards of diesel cars may lead to deferred purchasing decisions, slowing the new-car market's recovery from recession. Diesels have been the single-biggest growth sector as motorists have been attracted by the 25 per cent to 30 per cent better fuel economy compared with petrol equivalents. This is particularly so now that purchase-price premiums demanded for diesels are reducing sharply. Growth has also been encouraged by a widespread view that diesels are more environmentally friendly than petrol engines, partly because they produce substantially less carbon dioxide than petrol cars, thus helping to combat global warming. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the Retail Motor Industry Federation and leading component makers all argue that the report - which they complain was compiled without consulting industry sources - ignored several factors. These include developments in engine technology, specific advantages of diesel engines during short, urban journeys, and the greater consistency of diesel emissions over the life of a vehicle compared with the breakdown in efficiency of petrol engines. According to Mr John Mardell, chief engineer at Lucas Diesel Systems, although Nox emissions initially are higher than with a petrol car, the emissions even from a catalyst-equipped petrol car worsen steadily over the vehicle's life so that the total balances out. On short journeys, pollutant emissions from a petrol car can be 16 times higher than with a diesel, Mr Mardell says. Mr Ernie Thompson, SMMT chief executive, says that 85 per cent of vehicle pollution is attributable to elderly or poorly maintained vehicles. Diesel Vehicle Emissions and Urban Air Quality.

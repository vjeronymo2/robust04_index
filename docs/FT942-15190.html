			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Emap acquires Cap Nationwide for Pounds 18m Emap, the media group, yesterday announced its largest move so far into information-based publishing with the Pounds 17.9m purchase of Cap Nationwide Motor Research. Cap specialises in the publication of vehicle price guides for cars, lorries and motorcycles - information that is provided through monthly books, computer disks and on-line services. The Cap titles include the Black Book, covering car prices, the Red Book, covering commercial vehicles, and the Green Book for motorcycle and marine prices. The deal is being paid for half in cash and half in loan stock. In the year ended last September, Cap achieved profits before tax of Pounds 1.4m with more than 90 per cent of revenues coming from regular subscriptions. 'Cap represents Emap's first acquisition in information-based publishing and its biggest development in this market so far,' Mr Colin Morrison, chairman of Emap Business Communications, said yesterday. Since the acquisition two years ago of most of the titles of the Maxwell Communication Group in a Pounds 32m deal, Emap has been expanding in the sector. Its business communications division, formed in February by bringing together the business publishing and exhibition interests, has an annualised turnover of some Pounds 100m.</p>

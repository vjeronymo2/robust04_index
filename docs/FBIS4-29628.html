What remains to be seen is who will represent  East Timor:    [Begin Ramos Horta, Revolutionary Front for an Independent  East Timor, spokesman abroad telephone recording] What we want  is to obtain a status of a permanent observer country. East  Timor is not yet an independent country but we have the right to  have an observer representation at the summit. If East Timor  were an independent country, we would then be a country with  full rights. We have been told by the PALOPs [Portuguese  Speaking African Countries] and Brazil that the East Timor issue  will be on the agenda, that there will be an East Timorese  resistance representation, and what remains to be defined is who  will represent East Timor, who will represent the East Timorese  resistance.

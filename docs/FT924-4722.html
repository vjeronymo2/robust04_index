			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Observer: Back to base For 'black box' read blank box. It was quite a publicity coup for Russian President Boris Yeltsin when he delivered the 'black box' of the Korean airliner downed by the Soviets in 1983. But now the Koreans are having second thoughts. Yeltsin had promised that his 'black box' contained the flight and cockpit tapes that would solve the mystery of why the airliner strayed off course over Soviet territory before being shot down, with the loss of 296 lives. However, the Koreans have now disclosed that when they opened the 'black box', they found that not only was the important flight data recorder tape missing, but that the cockpit voice tapes were copies of the original. And bad ones, at that. Two of the four tapes had been recorded backwards.</p>

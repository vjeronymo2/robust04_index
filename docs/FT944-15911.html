			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Books: Prince's mistress comes a cropper - A look at the haunting story of a spirited but doomed 18th century single mother MRS JORDAN'S PROFESSION: THE STORY OF THE GREAT ACTRESS AND THE FUTURE KING by Claire Tomalin Viking Pounds 18, 414 pages In 1811, the most famous and beautiful actress in England was in her dressing room when she was handed a letter. It announced that her husband, the father of ten of her 13 children, was leaving her to seek better marriage prospects. She could negotiate a settlement, but if she caused trouble, she knew she would lose custody of the family. She went on stage, gave a thrilling performance, burst into tears when another character described her as 'laughing drunk', and slid into the wings. Five years later she died, penniless and forgotten. The actress was Dora Jordan and her common-law husband was the future King William IV, with whom she lived in domestic bliss for 21 years. At the core of the nation's history, she entertained for him, was friends with the Prince Regent, with Charles James Fox and the playwright Sheridan. But her glittering menage was built on social ambiguity and political corruption; beneath was a vulnerable single mother who literally sang for her supper. Like the comic part she acted while her heart was breaking, her life hinged on the gulf between appearance and reality. This is a riveting biography. In recent years, blockbuster Lives have centred on Victorians. Tomalin is one of several major biographers now reversing that trend to fix on the 18th century. Her book conjures up a rich, alluring period which, in its brittle decadence and love of scandal and flamboyance, often seems closer than the 19th century to our own times. Public life and individual privacy; the limits of sexual freedom; the place of art in society; working mums; her tale resounds with our most topical issues. Dora Jordan was born in 1761 into a family of strolling players. At 21, she supported her deserted mother and her own illegitimate daughter on the provincial boards. By 25, she had made the roles of Rosalind and Viola her own - Charles Lamb called her 'Shakespeare's woman' - and she played Wycherly's Country Wife for her London debut. In all three parts her mix of toughness and vulnerability shone, and soon she was a popular star. She earned Pounds 200 a year from Sheridan's Drury Lane theatre at a time when Jane Austen thought Pounds 140 an ample living for a clergyman and his family; a single benefit night doubled her annual salary, and admirers threw purses containing Pounds 300 at her as she took curtain calls. Tomalin is inspired on the wit and razzle dazzle of Drury Lane, in the 1780s a magnet for politicians, intellectuals, kings. The cat's cradle of partner-swapping among the Sheridans, the Royals and Dora recalls Cos fan Tutte - there was even a Royal dinner party in 1789 where the men dressed up as Turks and invited their wives to identify them with kisses, only to burst in through a side door and reveal the Turks as servants. That Cos was written in Vienna that year makes Europe seem small and homogeneous. But as in the opera, the bright sheen turned dark. Prince William, heavily in debt, cast about for a rich wife; there are shades of the new sentimental 19th century morality when he found one barely older than his daughters and wrote: 'She is doomed, poor dear innocent creature, to be my wife.' Dora's girls had to live with governesses in the Prince's household, and her boys were sent to the army. Dora lent money to a son-in-law who defaulted, and made her bankrupt, and the Royal lawyers urged her abroad to avoid arrrest. Neither pride nor avarice, she wrote, but 'the loss of my only remaining comfort, the hope I used to live on from time to time, of seeing my children,' made her desperate to return. She died alone in Boulogne. William, like Leontes in A Winter's Tale, remorsefully commissioned a life-sized statue, but neither he nor Queen Victoria - who banished the statue to the sculptor's studio - was keen to revive Dora's memory. Tomalin is never stridently political; but a burning sense of outrage at Dora's social and sexual helplessness, at bigoted illegitimacy laws and at the hardship of a lifetime of births and miscarriages - Dora's colleague Sarah Siddons once went into labour on stage - fuelled this account. It is the most haunting biography I have read this year.</p>

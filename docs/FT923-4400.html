			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE GLAXO Holdings, the pharmaceuticals group, is likely to show on Thursday pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 of Pounds 1.4bn-Pounds 1.46bn (Pounds 1.28bn a year earlier) and a dividend of 16p-20p a share (14p). Sales of Zantac, the ulcer drug, almost half its turnover, have been eroded by Astra's competing Losec and other drugs in Europe. But Zantac's US and UK sales have held up. Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment company, is expected to announce tomorrow interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 35m-Pounds 43m (Pounds 95.2m). Forecasts of the dividend range from a rise to 3.6p to a cut. The wide range of estimates follow a company warning in June that first-half profits would be less than half last year's figure. Prudential Corporation, the insurance and financial services group, is expected to post increased interim pre-tax profits on Wednesday to Pounds 225m-Pounds 240m (Pounds 170m). Life insurance profits are expected to increase marginally. But its general insurance business should produce sharply reduced losses. Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, the shipping and property group, is expected to report on Wednesday interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 90-Pounds 95m, little changed from last time. The stock market will be watching if the dividend, which is likely to be uncovered, is maintained. BTR, the industrial conglomerate, is forecast to unveil on Thursday a slight increase in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 440m from Pounds 428m. News of economic recovery or the further rationalisation of Hawker Siddeley, acquired last November, will be eagerly anticipated. Cadbury Schweppes is expected to justify the same day its premium rating in the food sector by reporting interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 115m-Pounds 120m (Pounds 111.5m). A modest dividend increase is also expected. United Biscuits is expected to present a less happy picture with its interims on Friday. Cost-cutting and improved efficiency have helped the company limit the impact of the UK recession but fierce competition continues for Keebler, its US biscuit and snacks subsidiary. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 70m-Pounds 75m (Pounds 86.1m) are forecast. Shell Transport and Trading is expected on Thursday to announce an increase in its interim dividend to between 9.1p and 9.4p from 8.9p last year. Royal Dutch is seen increasing its dividend to Fl 3.65 from Fl 3.45. On Wednesday Hillsdown Holdings is expected to show only a small rise at the pre-tax level from last year's Pounds 77.6m, but the interim dividend should be safe. Operating profits will be down but the saving on interest after last year's rights issue will offset that. Thursday sees results from Booker, which has changed its reporting period. On the new basis, profits should be up a touch on last time's Pounds 32.9m - perhaps to Pounds 33.5m. But on the old basis including June, profits are expected to be down.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Albanian People in Macedonia Are </F> Discriminated Against"]    [Text] In connection with the acceptance of Macedonia in  the CSCE, the leadership of the People's Democratic Party [of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]]  addressed the following statement to the CSCE Ministerial  Council in Prague:    "On the basis of the reality that the protection of peace  and  security in Macedonia is a condition for the containment of the  conflict in the Balkans and beyond, and on the basis of  commitments of the international community in this area, the  People's Democratic Party, represented for the first time in the  parliament of the FYROM, with the aim of surmounting problems as  quickly as possible, considers that it is legitimate to inform  the CSCE of the following:    1. About 40 percent of the total population of Macedonia are  ethnic Albanians (the official figure is 21 percent).    2. Ever since it gained its independence, this state has  been  operating as an ethnic state of only the Macedonian  (Slavo-Macedonian) people in all segments of decisionmaking,  both in the highest state institutions and in other institutions  of the economy, culture, media, etc.    3. Albanian deputies are outnumbered and outvoted in the  parliament of Macedonia since there is no consensual  decisionmaking. This resulted in the approval of the  Constitution and of many laws that placed the Albanian  population in a discriminatory position, especially in the  fields of education, culture, privatization of capital, the  media, the status of citizens, etc.    The government is completely centralized and concentrated  into central organs while, in reality, there is no local  government.    5. In cities in which Albanians are the majority population,  the administration intentionally complicates the procedures for  getting simple documents. A person has to wait for weeks to get  a birth certificate.    6. The law on citizenship in Macedonia proclaimed about  100,000 Albanians as stateless persons, through no fault of  their own, by applying the condition of 15 years of  uninterrupted residence in the country as a basic condition for  citizenship.    7. The last elections were discriminatory. For example, the  electoral constituency of an Albanian deputy had an average of  8,000 voters while the constituency of a Macedonian deputy had  4,000 voters. Now they are intending to hold new elections with  only cosmetic changes of the same laws.    8. Albanians are not allowed to have their mother tongue as  the language of instruction in higher education, while only 2.8  percent of the Albanians are studying in Macedonian  universities, where Macedonian is the language of instruction.    9. The structures of the central and local government and of  the judiciary are ethnically pure or have token Albanians, while  more than 300 Albanian lawyers in Macedonia are looking for work.    10. An Albanian party (the Party for Democratic Prosperity)  took part in the coalition government with five ministers out of  a desire to contribute to correcting the situation, but it was  determined that the Republic of Macedonia just used them as  window dressing for the international community. This failure  caused serious problems for the party and it split into two  parts. This radicalism is to the advantage of all.    11. The present government blames the lack of changes on the  Macedonian radicalism of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian  Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian  Unity] party (the ethnic Macedonian party). But the government  did not mobilize the resources under its control to change the  anti-Albanian attitude.    12. The present government blames the previous government  for  fact that Albanians are not included in the government  structures, but this does not explain why the new areas which  are being established in this country, such as diplomacy,  continue to be set up on a single-nationality basis.    Many findings have been presented in the reports of various  international and governmental associations, including the  report to the 50th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights  which was held in mid-February of this year.    Therefore, we think that it is a juridical, moral, and  humanitarian necessity for this issue to be considered as one of  the primary issues for the maintenance of peace and security in  the region.    The People's Democratic Party believes that conditions  should  be set for the admission of Macedonia to the CSCE; that is, the  FYROM Government should be obliged to enter into principled  political discussions with the Albanian side through the  intermediary of the CSCE, for the purpose of creating  constitutional-juridical conditions for the achievement of real  ethnic equality in the FYROM", says the Position Statement of  the Leadership of the People's Democratic Party which was sent  to the Ministerial Council of the CSCE in Prague.</p>

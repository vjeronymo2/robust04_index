			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / France and Italy to study high tech links THE Italian government has agreed to form a technical committee with experts from its state holding company IRI and representatives of SGS-Thomson, the debt-laden Franco-Italian microchip venture. The group is to study ways in which Italy can participate in French plans to boost technological development under French Prime Minister Mrs Edith Cresson's high technology plan for French industry. The agreement follows talks at a dinner in Rome last night between Mrs Cresson, Mr Giulio Andreotti, the Italian prime minister, and Mr Franco Nobili, head of IRI. Mrs Cresson was appealing to a sceptical Italy to contribute up to Dollars 225m (Pounds 125m) towards SGS-Thomson's immediate needs, estimated at a total of Dollars 500m. Mr Andreotti was careful not to alienate Mrs Cresson's overtures. However, he is understood to have pointed out the country was due to face elections in April and that any financial commitments to SGS-Thomson's capital increase could not come until later in the year. In principle Italy is anxious to become involved in advanced technology. However IRI is constrained by its high indebtedness and the increasingly scarce resources of the Treasury. The technical committee agreed last night was thus seen as a compromise between these two positions. Refinancing for SGS-Thomson is an important part of the Paris government's project to create a FFr75bn (Pounds 7.7bn) turnover nuclear energy-to-electronics company by merging the civil nuclear and electronics activities of Thomson, the state-owned electronics group, and CEA-Industrie, a nuclear plant and fuel company. Mrs Cresson yesterday began a two-day visit to the French and Italian plants in the new group, which the government wants to get into operation by mid-year under the name Thomson CEA Industrie. IRI and its subsidiaries hold 45 per cent in SGS-Thomson.</p>

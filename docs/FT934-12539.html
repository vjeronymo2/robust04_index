			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sweden studies partial sale of electricity generator THE SWEDISH government is to consider urgently a partial privatisation of Vattenfall, Europe's sixth-largest electricity producer, to enable the company to raise SKr4bn (Dollars 497m) in new capital. Mr Per Westerberg, industry minister, said yesterday the government could not afford such a sum. He was replying formally to a request from the state-owned company for a capital injection. However, the minister said he understood Vattenfall's need for new capital. The right-centre government would discuss urgently a suggestion by the company that it be allowed to raise the money through a share issue to Swedish institutions and its employees. Mr Westerberg stressed the government had no intention of giving up its control of Vattenfall, which produces about half of Sweden's electricity needs, mainly through hydro and nuclear power generation. He also ruled out a break-up of the group. However, it is clear that a share issue on the scale suggested would not significantly erode the state's dominance of the group, said by officials to be worth upwards of SKr60bn. Since coming to power two years ago, the coalition, led by prime minister Carl Bildt's conservative Moderate Party, has begun working through a list of 35 wholly or partly state-owned companies it wants to sell off. This year, it completed the SKr2.2bn flotation of Celsius, the defence group, and is now working on the disposal of its big holdings in Procordia, the pharmaceuticals and food group, and the OK Petroleum group. Vattenfall is the dominant - though not a monopoly - producer and supplier of electricity in Sweden. It delivers about 80m megawatt hours a year, including exports of more than 9m megawatt hours - three times as much power as Sydkraft, its biggest private-sector Swedish competitor. It ranks itself sixth in Europe, behind EDF of France, ENEL of Italy, RWE of Germany, and Britain's National Power and Powergen. It has recently been converted into a limited liability company. It said yesterday it needed the capital injection to invest in production, transmission and distribution facilities. These would strengthen the group in the face of growing competition in Sweden and throughout Europe.</p>

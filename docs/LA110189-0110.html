			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'RENT-A-JUDGES' MIGHT HARM COURT SYSTEM, LAWYERS SAY ;  </P> <P> JUDICIARY: BAR OFFICIALS WARN OF A TREND THAT COULD LEAD TO A 'PRIVATE JUSTICE  SYSTEM' FOR THE WEALTHY AND PLACE AN ADDED STRAIN ON THE PUBLIC LEGAL  STRUCTURE.  </P> <P> Leaders of state and national lawyers' groups warned in Los Angeles on Tuesday  that increased use of private "rent-a-judges" to settle disputes may be leading  to a two-tiered system of justice -- one for the rich and one for the poor.  </P> <P> Robert Raven, president of the American Bar Assn. last year, told a committee  investigating rent-a-judges that he fears the evolution of "a private justice  system for those who can afford it, and an even more crippled system for the  poor and those charged with crimes."  </P> <P> Rent-a-judges are retired judges who are usually hired by businesses or wealthy  individuals to preside over the settlement of their disputes. Those who cannot  afford their fees must wait as long as five years for their civil disputes to  come to trial in some busy urban areas.  </P> <P> Raven said courts in the nation's urban areas are already overburdened and have  had to cut back drastically on the number of civil jury trials to accommodate  soaring numbers of criminal cases involving drugs. Criminal cases have  constitutional priority over civil cases.  </P> <P> Raven told the committee, appointed by California Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas,  that he expects the situation to worsen.  </P> <P> "As we begin to put more and more resources into the criminal justice system,  which we must do, the civil system will be overwhelmed in two or three years,"  Raven told the committee at a public hearing.  </P> <P> Alan Rothenberg, president of the State Bar of California, echoed Raven's  remarks, saying the civil justice system in California is already overwhelmed.  </P> <P> Rothenberg said he feared that increased use of private judges by the  well-to-do will lessen political pressures to provide more resources for public  courts.  </P> <P> Private judges hire themselves out at fees that often reach $250 an hour or  more for mediation or binding arbitration. In addition, with the approval of  sitting judges, private judges can conduct trials or referee certain pretrial  disputes.  </P> <P> More and more litigants are hiring private judges to resolve commercial and  family disputes, legal experts say. But because much of the work takes place in  private, no public agency knows exactly how much of it goes on.  </P> <P> Some experts who fear the phenomenon of private judging warn that it poses a  threat of "brain drain" to the public court system. These experts say they are  concerned that talented judges will be tempted to retire early by the prospect  of making more money under cushier working conditions.  </P> <P> But John C. Woolley, president of the California Judges Assn. and a Superior  Court judge in Orange County, disputed that theory.  </P> <P> He pointed to a statistical study by the National Center for State Courts that  showed the pace of judges' retirements holding steady throughout the 1980s.  Woolley said he does not see private judging as "a fearsome force that will do  in the public system."  </P> <P> John K. Trotter, a retired California Court of Appeal judge who heads the  largest rent-a-judge operation in California, agreed.  </P> <P> Trotter, whose firm, Judicial Arbitration &amp; Mediation Services, has 91  judges handling about 7,000 cases this year, said he could not understand why  retired judges were being singled out for scrutiny.  </P> <P> He said there is nothing new about resolving disputes outside court, noting  that the 63-year-old American Arbitration Assn. handles 50,000 cases a year,  that the securities industry routinely uses arbitration in its disputes, and  that mediation and arbitration are widely used by school districts, labor  unions and medical providers.  </P> <P> "If all of these other forms of private, consensual, paid-for dispute  resolution processes do not demean the courts, it is difficult to assume the  existence of private judging will," Trotter said.  </P></p>

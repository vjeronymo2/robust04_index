			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'CAGNEY, LACEY' PRODUCER WINS $2-MILLION SUIT  </P> <P> A jury has awarded television producer Mace Neufeld more than $2 million in a  breach-of-contract suit against fellow "Cagney &amp; Lacey" producer Barney  Rosenzweig and Orion Pictures Corp.  </P> <P> After a 16-day trial, a Superior Court jury in Santa Monica on Wednesday  assessed Rosenzweig $1.25 million and Orion $758,978, plus interest amounting  to an additional $500,000.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Laurence Rittenband will decide Oct. 9 whether to certify,  reduce or overturn the verdict.  </P> <P> "In my judgment, there is absolutely no legal basis for either the judge or the  Court of Appeal to diminish or reverse the jury award," said Neufeld's  attorney, Daniel C. Rosenberg.  </P> <P> Neither Orion nor Rosenzweig would comment, saying the matter is still in the  courts.  </P> <P> Neufeld said he had contracts with Orion, then Filmways, and Rosenzweig  entitling him to 50% of whatever the studio paid Rosenzweig during the first  five years of "Cagney &amp; Lacey." The 1982-88 CBS police drama starring  Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly was a Rosenzweig Prods.-Mace Neufeld production.  </P> <P> Rosenzweig made more than $5 million from the series in addition to the amount  included in his original contract, Neufeld said, arguing that he was entitled  to a corresponding increase.  </P></p>

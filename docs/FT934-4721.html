			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Anglo United reduces deficit to Pounds 6.5m Anglo United reported a sharply reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.5m for the six months to September 30, helped by a 'significant recovery' in its Coalite smokeless fuel business. On sales from continuing operations of Pounds 236m (Pounds 244m), profit before interest was Pounds 5.7m, against a Pounds 6.4m loss in the comparable period. Interest payable of Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 16.2m) meant that losses at the pre-tax stage narrowed from Pounds 22.6m to Pounds 6.5m. The results for the first half of 1992 were hit by the Pounds 11.2m costs connected to its bank restructuring, abortive disposals and loan write-offs. Mr Harold Cottam, chairman, said that in the period under review efforts had been focused on improving divisional performance. The Pounds 2m profits advance to Pounds 4.8m in the smokeless fuels division had been achieved mainly through cost reductions. These had offset reduced demand for coal from electricity generators and for the various industrial services provided to British Coal. Lower demand from agrochemical producers hit the liquid fuels and chemicals division, which had an operating loss of Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 200,000). Mr Cottam said operating profits from other businesses rose to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.2m), excluding Dundee, Perth &amp; London Shipping, sold in March. Losses per share were cut to 0.8p (7.1p).</p>

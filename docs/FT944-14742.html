			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Observer: Eastern promise Michael Heseltine, in his role as Britain's trade supremo, is currently in Malaysia, doing a bit of bridge building after the lifting of Malaysia's ban on government contracts to British companies. Among the sights are two 85- storey towers, being built in Kuala Lumpur's city centre; the Malaysians say they will be the world's tallest. Britain's trade and industry secretary was impressed. Apparently the development reminded him very much of London's Canary Wharf project. Given the terrific problems Canary Wharf has gone through, hardly the most tactful of remarks. Or maybe he was being deviously ironic?</p>

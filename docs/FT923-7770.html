			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Check those statements - Banks rush to calm customers after computer problems hit dealings with credit cards USERS OF credit cards should check their statements with particular care following news this week of glitches in the computers processing their accounts. Those affected most are the 250,000 holders of National Westminster gold cards although problems also have been reported by users of Visa, Access and Mastercards issued by the Midland, Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Among the difficulties reported have been: Cards swallowed by cash machines. Cards refused authorisation when retailers request it. Wrong charges for late payment. Incorrect charges for interest. Delays in direct debits. Fees for non-existent cash advances. Incorrect amounts debited. Wrong transaction dates on statements. The banks moved hastily this week to calm customers. Lloyds stressed that errors had affected only about 40 of its gold card clients and concerned direct debits which were paid incorrectly. It said it had contacted all these customers to correct the errors. Midland said it was aware of about 100 cases in which payment received against the bill for the previous month had not been shown on the most recent statement. Royal Bank of Scotland said the errors it knew about totalled 'well under three figures.' These concerned cards not being authorised and the problems had been sorted out. NatWest appears to have had far more trouble than the others. It said it was still unable to determine exactly how many customers had been affected but it considered the difficulties significant enough to send letters to all its gold card-holders. It said most of these errors concerned relatively small amounts, such as fees for cash advances not made or late-payment fees where payments had been received. NatWest also is sending a letter - which will be enclosed with their next statement - to every one of its other 4.75m card-holders explaining that incorrect transaction dates may be shown. The bank also has stressed that no customer will be left out of pocket because of errors. The problems were caused last month during conversion from one piece of computer software to another, more modern version by First Data Resources, which processes 10m credit card accounts from its centres in Basildon and Southend. Executives now are confident that the remaining problems have been ironed out. The new software is designed to operate more quickly and is more secure. It also can offer a range of new facilities. For example, card-providers now can supply statements to their customers with two columns for dates: the existing column, which shows the date on which money has been debited from the account; and a new column which shows the date on which the original transaction took place. Gary Tobin, a senior vice-president at First Data Corporation, the parent of FDR, stresses that there are many stages at which problems with credit cards can arise. Often, these are not the fault of the computer processors, he adds. Cards may be refused at cash machines because these have run out of money; and by either machines or retailers because a customer's credit limit has been reached. There can be faults with telephone equipment or with the computers used by the banks. At least one positive element for the banks has come from all this week's negative publicity: persuading customers to look at their credit card and other bank statements more closely. Royal Bank of Scotland says: 'We would recommend customers at any time making a point of checking their statements against their vouchers. Actually, it is an anti-fraud measure against abuse.' Midland adds: 'We would always advise people to check their statements for their own peace of mind.'</p>

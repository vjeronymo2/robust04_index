			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Paul </F> Schulmeister in Vienna on 17 February -- recorded]    [Text] [Mock] I hope very much that, considering this  serious ultimatum, Serbia, its representatives, and the Bosnian  Serbs will realize after all that it makes no sense to start a  military conflict and that they will withdraw the heavy weapons.    After all that has been resolved and promised in the past  two  years, I understand that there are doubts. However, one has to  realize that the credibility of another organization, that is,  NATO, will be very much jeopardized if a threat that was  formulated in great detail and based on legitimate Security  Council resolutions is not taken seriously.    [Schulmeister] What would this mean for Europe's security in  the future? What would this mean, for example, for Austria's  security?    [Mock] Security in general, already very much endangered  today, would be further jeopardized. One would only have to  wait for the next conflict of this kind to arise and Europe  would again fall back into the chaos that occasionally existed  in the past. Here I am thinking in particular of the 30's.    [Schulmeister] If this NATO ultimatum also proved to be an  empty threat in the end, would this mean that Europe's security  would be even more endangered in the future?    [Mock] It would be very bad for Europe's security and for  us. The medium-sized and small countries in particular have to  depend on the observation of legal rules. A very big state  still can take comfort in the fact that it has nuclear weapons  anyway, and things of that sort. Therefore, this would really  be a major setback, from the moral point of view as well. What  proclaims Europe is no longer respected. One has to expect that  the bad example of aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Croatia would be imitated elsewhere.</p>

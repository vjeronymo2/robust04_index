			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [PASASON Editorial 1 February: "We Wish the Thai </F> Parliamentary Delegation Glorious Success in Its Visit to the  Lao People's Democratic Republic"]    [Text] Today, in response to an invitation of His  Excellency [H.E.] Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National  Assembly of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], a  delegation of the Thai Parliament led by H.E. Professor Marut  Bunnak, speaker of the House of Representatives and president of  the Parliament of the Kingdom of Thailand, has arrived in  Vientiane for an official friendship visit to our country. The  visit is scheduled to take place from 1 to 3 February. On this  glorious occasion, residents of Vientiane as well as the  multiethnic Lao people throughout the country, together with  leaders and all members of the National Assembly of the LPDR,  would like to welcome the parliamentary delegation of the  Kingdom of Thailand and extend it their warmest salutations.  The Lao people are also elated and highly honored to have an  opportunity to welcome the high-level state guests of the  parliament of a neighboring country, who have brought with them  to the Vientiane residents and all the multiethnic Lao people  the spirit of solidarity and neighborliness of the Thai people.    The peoples of Laos and Thailand are neighboring peoples who  have maintained the traditions of fraternal affection and  solidarity since ancient times. The two peoples have adhered to  a similar, fine culture and customs. They can also understand  each other's language without having to resort to interpreters.  With these fine traditions of relations, though there have been  certain difficulties and occasional disputes over the border  issue in the past, the two sides have successfully settled the  difficulties and disputes on the basis of the spirit of  fraternity and respect for each other's independence and  sovereignty. They have together continued to systematically  settle the remaining problems based on the principles of  international law and the concrete benefits for the two peoples  and countries.    Based on the aforesaid spirit, the relations between the two  countries have been developed in many respects: for example, in  the economic field. Over recent years, especially following the  implementation of the policy of building a market-oriented  economy and broadening the economic cooperation with foreign  countries, relations and cooperation in various fields -- as,  for example, in investment for doing business with Thailand --  have been rapidly expanded. At present, most investors making  investments in Laos are from Thailand. The exchanges of trade  and the visits between the Lao and Thai peoples, in particular  the legal economic activities carried out along the border areas  of the two countries, have significantly contributed to building  and developing the countries and improving the living conditions  of the two peoples with each passing day. All these have served  as favorable conditions for the peoples of the two countries to  achieve mutual understanding, as well as to check and smash  schemes and acts of ill-intentioned elements, who have intended  to disrupt and sabotage the Lao-Thai relations, in order to  create a good atmosphere for the opening of the Mekong bridge --  the first Lao-Thai friendship bridge -- scheduled to be held in  April this year.    During the visit to the LPDR on this occasion, H.E. Prof.  Marut Bunnak and his parliamentary delegation of the Kingdom of  Thailand will pay courtesy calls on H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan,  president of state, and H.E. Khamtai Siphandon, prime minister  of the LPDR. Noteworthy is that the Thai parliamentary  delegation will also hold talks with a LPDR National Assembly  delegation to discuss ways of increasingly promoting and  expanding the existing bilateral relations and cooperation.  H.E. Prof. Marut Bunnak and his delegation are also scheduled  to visit various cultural places, including the Phakeo Buddha  and the That Louang Pagoda temples, and a number of economic  establishments in Vientiane municipality.    Our Vientiane residents, as well as all multiethnic Lao  people throughout the country, wish the Thai parliamentary  delegation glorious success in the official friendship visit to  the LPDR on this occasion in order to significantly contribute  to strengthening the fraternal solidarity and friendship between  the two peoples of Laos and Thailand and enhancing relations and  cooperation in the economic field between the two countries as  well as in the legislative field between the National Assembly  of the LPDR and the Parliament of the Kingdom of Thailand. May  the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the National  Assembly of the LPDR and the Parliament of the Kingdom of  Thailand be increasingly developed and strengthened!</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Center Union chairman Romualdas Ozolas by </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] While the politicians on TV are telling us about  stabilization and improvement of living standards, what the  people are saying is often quite the opposite: There is chaos in  politics and there is stabilization of poverty in the families.    According to Romualdas Ozolas, Chairman of the Center Union  and member of the Lithuanian Seimas, amid all this apparent  confusion a common trend can be traced.    [Ozolas] In a nutshell this can be described as follows:  fight for property. There are the left-wingers and there are  the right-wingers, both sides are interested in grabbing as much  as possible. This is carried out by using all means available --  those which are permitted and those which are not. Therefore  the racket which is kicked up around it quite often amounts to  demagogue, intrigue, and plain deception.    I think that this all should disperse after the distribution  of property has been completed, after the state property has  been transferred into the hands of individual persons. This is  natural, only the trouble is that in the meantime, lawlessness  and disrespect to state institutions reign. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Do you agree that the distribution of property  will be completed by 1996, namely by the time when the term of  the members of the current parliament runs out. Then, as Prime  Minister Adolfas Slezevicius pledged, the law on declaration of  income and property by the state officials will come into  operation.    [Ozolas] I think that in principle this is what is being  planned: to introduce the declaration on income and property  around 1996. At that time, the current top-ranking state  officials and those who rank below them and yet are capable of  grabbing something will no longer have to worry about their  reputation and especially about their political reputation.  Whether they are re-elected or not, this would be of no further  importance. Therefore the government will make efforts to stay  in power until the end of term and then as God wills.    There is a possibility that the current left-wing government  would have to step down earlier. It is possible that this could  be beneficial, however, if the right-wingers propose a similar  policy, which is to support large capital -- only then, I would  not see any difference whether Lithuania is ruled by rich  left-wingers or by rich right-wingers. [passage omitted]    I am very much concerned that the law on income and property  declaration by the most senior state officials has not been  introduced. I hope that we will push this law through although  it will be somewhat spoiled, but then it would be better than  nothing. It is simply annoying to hear about human rights  violations in this matter when we know that this law is the  basic means for the introduction of law and order in the  financial life of the country. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] At today's news conference, you also spoke about  international affairs and you mentioned that the forthcoming  visit by the Ukrainian president may become one of the most  important events of early 1994.    [Ozolas] The Ukraine is the most important neighbor and a  possible ally of Lithuania in Central Europe. There will  practically be no Eastern Europe without the Ukraine and the  Baltic countries. There would be fragments and pieces of it,  such as the Vyshegrad group or the Baltic states without it.  The appearance of the sovereign Ukraine in Europe, and I say  this believing that the Ukraine will continue to proceed towards  her absolute independence from Russia... [pauses] If she fails  to do this then our cooperation would be very much restricted.  [passage omitted] However, if the Ukraine gets more and more  independent, than I think both Lithuania and the Ukraine would  have something to say concerning setting to right the life in  Europe.    [Reporter] The Ukraine and Lithuania can cooperate not only  in the economic sphere. You also attach great importance to the  military union.    [Ozolas] To speak about a union would be too bold. So far  there is no need to start designing such a union. However, if  NATO continues to act as it has until now, then the countries of  central and Eastern Europe would have to look for a way out of  this situation and to set up their own security by their own  efforts. Who else apart from the Ukraine can help Lithuania in  such a situation and take care of the independence and security?  In a political sense the Ukraine is neutral enough towards  Lithuania and the Baltic states and the Ukraine has a great  interest in Central Europe which cannot exist without Lithuania  and the Baltic states. [passage omitted] These are mutual  interests to put Europe in good order which would guarantee our  independent life and peace in Europe. The Russian  aggressiveness which is being manifested every day would  inevitably influence Western Europe and I think that Western  Europe will react to it by making similar steps. In this  respect Central Europe has great possibilities for setting up a  balance in Europe.    [Reporter] At the same time you said that NATO is at present  not interested in cooperation with Eastern and central European  countries.    [Ozolas] I would like to put it differently. It is  interested not in pushing aside Russia which, feeling this  interest of the United States as the main ally of Western  Europe, endeavors to exert influence on Western Europe and the  United States to be helpful. [sentence as heard]. This means  the restoration of the former Soviet Union's expanse, and thus  Russia mentions with exceptional ferocity the Baltic states.  NATO responded to all this with silence. Clinton, our dear  young president, also preferred to be silent. He even said that  he himself would talk to the Baltic states about not insulting  the Russian speaking people.    This is confusion by the U.S. president and much criticism  has been levelled at him about this in his own country. I think  that his telephone call to Latvia's president was an attempt to  correct his behavior. But this is a very significant fact that  a big state will always better understand another big state than  a small one.    Therefore we say that we must pin our hopes on NATO, but  mostly we must depend on our strength, incidentally, also with  regard to our possible allies who live close by.</p>

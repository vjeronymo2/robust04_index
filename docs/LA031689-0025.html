			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLOBAL ROLE DEMANDS A 15-CARRIER NAVY  </P> <P> The Navy aircraft-carrier battle group is the most needed and most worked asset  in our nation's military arsenal. Yet despite the historically proven value of  these ships, defense critics continue to make annual assaults on these  backbones of our national and maritime strategy. Their goal apparently is a  reduction of battle groups from the present number of 15. But to accomplish  such a reduction would be a tragic mistake. For our Navy to meet its global  peacetime requirements at a prudent level of risk to our country, 15 is the  minimum number we can deploy. (In a global conflict, we would need 20 such  battle groups, a figure continually validated by regional military commanders  and through in-depth studies by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.)  </P> <P> Any discussion of carrier battle groups -- in fact, any discussion of the Navy  -- must be undertaken with an understanding of the geopolitical framework of  our country. As a maritime nation, our economic survival is dependent on the  seas. Our vital interests are expressed in a web of more than 40 treaty  relationships with binding coalitions for mutual defense. These relationships,  together with the commercial dependencies that support our economy, shape our  national security objectives. Stated simply, global commitments set the  environment in which we live, work and prosper.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Soviet threat has not abated, despite the rhetoric of a  brilliant public-relations campaign by Moscow. Soviet military spending  continues to absorb a disproportionate amount of its gross national product.  The growing Soviet navy is clearly offense-oriented with global reach. New and  very capable warships of every type continue to be produced.  </P> <P> Additionally, low-intensity conflicts in the Third World provide a global  threat from terrorists and other fanatics.  </P> <P> If we intend to secure our national- security interests, freedom of the seas is  still a primary requisite. This means possessing a Navy deployed in strategic  regions of the globe where it is needed to deter war and, if that fails, to  respond with force.  </P> <P> No Administration, regardless of political persuasion, has been able to solve  this protection problem with other means of force. A Navy operating in regional  waters near potential conflict provides an advantage that cannot be  approximated by forces based in the United States, regardless of how ready they  may be.  </P> <P> If we are not going to have a permanent presence based overseas with our  closest allies, then the only practical means of applying adequate force to a  crisis and promoting regional stability beyond our own borders is to have that  presence on station in international waters and airspace.  </P> <P> Electronically integrated, the carrier battle group -- its complement of 80 to  90 multimission aircraft and accompanying cruisers, destroyers and submarines  -- provides a four-dimensional warfare capability. At a time when the battle  sphere has expanded from the radar horizon to more than 1,000 miles, the  carrier battle group provides a capability unmatched by any other military  component inexistence.  </P> <P> Highly mobile and flexible, the battle group sends a strong political signal to  an adversary. If need be, it can take complete control of an area. But if  military power is not required and a political situation is stabilized, the  battle group can simply steam away with no signals of retreat or weakness.  </P> <P> But why 15 carrier groups? Because a lesser number presents us with two  unacceptable results: The first is that we will be forced to abdicate some  global commitments, which would lead to diminished influence throughout an  increasingly economically interdependent, multipolar and militarized world.  </P> <P> And because U.S. commitments will not decline, we cannot afford to take the  strategic risk of a reduced carrier force structure. To meet our level of  commitments with fewer forces would result in each ship and aircraft squadron  having to be under way more, be gone from home longer and work harder. During  the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, the aircraft carrier Eisenhower battle  group was deployed for 254 days with only five days in port.  </P> <P> Meeting our commitments with a smaller carrier force will result in cost  increases, not savings. Overhaul and maintenance costs would go up, as we saw  in the Vietnam era. Retention would go down, just as we saw in the 1970s when  new commitments were added without an increase in carrier numbers. We ran  sailors and their families into the ground and paid for it. So many chose to  leave the Navy then that we were left with quantifiably lower levels of  readiness -- and a much-reduced level of confidence. This represents an  institutional risk we cannot afford.  </P> <P> At our nation's founding, Congress mandated that the Navy protect us and and  ensure our survival and prosperity. Congress recognized our country as being  maritime-dependent, and that fact has not changed.  </P></p>

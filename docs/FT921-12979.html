			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Coles Myer to put agribusiness unit up for sale COLES MYER, Australia's biggest retailer, has signalled further concentration on its core operations with a decision to put its Sandhurst Farms agribusiness offshoot up for sale. Mr Brian Quinn, chief executive, announced the move yesterday, saying the company could no longer justify retention of a business of such magnitude. 'We are predominantly a retail operation and fresh food manufacture no longer fits comfortably into our business structure,' he said. 'Further, the rapid expansion of Sandhurst means that it has outgrown the reason for its acquisition which was to supply dairy and beef products to our supermarkets divisions.' Coles Myer acquired Sandhurst in 1987 and developed it into one of the country's largest agribusiness operations with annual sales of about ADollars 120m (USDollars 88.2m) involving 75m litres of milk and 60,000 head of cattle.</p>

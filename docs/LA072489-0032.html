			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> At least 100,000 people in the United States now have AIDS. When the monthly  total for July is compiled and released in late August, Centers for Disease  Control experts are sure that America's count of total AIDS cases will, for the  first time, officially pass 100,000. Many experts have admitted that the AIDS  case total is a rough estimate, but what the official total does emphasize is  that there has been no retreat or slowing in the statistical march of AIDS. By  1992, the federal agency expects there will be a cumulative total of 365,000  confirmed cases of AIDS. The agency also predicts that within three years the  total number of U.S. residents killed by AIDS will reach 263,000.  </P></p>

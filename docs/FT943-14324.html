			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Street-digging code aims to save trees A national code of conduct on the way streets are dug up is to be launched this autumn by the power, gas, water and telecommunications industries to try to protect thousands of endangered trees. Environmentalists and local authorities are concerned about serious damage to trees caused particularly by cable television companies digging up pavements and severing roots. Professor Chris Baines, an environmental consultant who is leading a campaign to protect street trees, told a conference in Norwich yesterday that few trees would be left within a few years because cable companies were licensed to dig 60,000 miles of trenches by the year 2000. He called for a change in the law which excludes utilities and cable companies from local authority planning controls when digging up streets. He said: 'Trees provide the air-conditioning for our towns and cities. It is criminal to destroy them when we are becoming increasingly worried about the effects of traffic pollution.' He said trenches dug by cable companies and utilities severed roots which provided water, oxygen and anchorage. Almost all these roots lay close to the surface. Draft rules for a voluntary code of conduct have been prepared for the Arboricultural Association and the National Joint Utilities Group representing all leading utilities. The working party which devised the rules was chaired by the Department of the Environment and included the Cable Television Association and local authority tree officers. It is hoped that all local authorities will adopt the code, which is expected to call for the use of small-bore tunnelling close to trees wherever possible. It says trenches near trees should be hand-dug to protect roots if tunnelling is impossible, arguing that the increased cost is likely to be small compared with the total installation bill. Repair and maintenance techniques which do not require pavements to be excavated will be encouraged. Designers and planners will be asked to keep services at a safe distance from mature trees in new developments.</p>

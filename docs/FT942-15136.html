			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Markets: House prices rises - At a Glance Quarterly figures for the Halifax house price index show a rise of 1.8 per cent in the first three months of this year. The year-on-year figure shows a rise of 2.6 per cent, against a year-on-year rise of 3.8 per cent reported in March. The Halifax says this is further evidence of a continued gentle recovery in house prices, and it predicts an increase of about 5 per cent during 1994. A regional breakdown of statistics reveals that prices fell in several regions during the first quarter. Most of these falls were small, but prices in the North West fell back by 1.1 per cent, and in East Anglia by 1.3 per cent. However, East Anglia saw an annual increase of 4.3 per cent, while the figure for the North West was 1.3 per cent, and the annual increase in the West Midlands was only 0.2 per cent.</p>

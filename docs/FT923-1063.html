			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Venezuela to stay in Opec ECUADOR'S recent decision to withdraw as a full member of Opec and seek associate member status will have no effect on Venezuela's policy toward the organisation, said Mr Alirio Parra, Minister of Energy and Mines. Despite private sector calls for Venezuela to pull out of Opec, the government of President Carlos Andres Perez has rejected the notion and the president himself is a strong advocate of Opec unity.</p>

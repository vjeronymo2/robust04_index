			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Renault and Volvo to merge in weeks THE MERGER of Renault, the French state-controlled motor group, and Volvo, its Swedish partner, should be completed by the end of this month, according to Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister. Mr Longuet also confirmed in an interview with Les Echos, the French financial daily, that he saw Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, and Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company, as key candidates for the first round of the privatisation programme. He was also considering plans to merge Thomson-TCE and Thomson-CSF, the consumer and defence electronics arms of the Thomson industrial group. The French government has for some time been anxious to finalise Renault's merger with Volvo. The two have been in partnership since 1990 and have since stepped up their co-operation. Mr Longuet said negotiations were being concluded and he 'hoped' to complete the deal by August as a precursor to privatising the combined company. In the meantime, he said that Elf Aquitaine and Rhone-Poulenc were 'neck and neck' in the race to be the first industrial companies to be sold. The French government, which earlier this week passed its privatisation bill through parliament, is expected later this month to announce the names of between three and six companies scheduled for sale in the first phase of privatisation. The sales will start in September and continue until early next year. The privatisations form part of Mr Longuet's long-term strategy of reducing the state's role in French industry. He has already affirmed that the new government will be more rigorous than its predecessors in its treatment of ailing public sector companies. He singled out Bull, the loss-making computer concern, as one company which needed 'taking in hand'. Bull, which earlier this week announced plans to reduce its worldwide workforce by 6,500 by the end of 1994, is seeking a capital injection from the government. Mr Longuet said he planned by the end of this month to present his recapitalisation proposals to the EC. Thomson merger, Page 31</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RULES TO SHUT LOOPHOLES IN RENT CONTROL  APPROVED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday gave final approval to an ordinance  intended to close loopholes used by landlords to increase rents beyond  city-mandated limits for rent-stabilized apartments.  </P> <P> In an unanimous vote, the council approved changes in the 10-year-old rent  stabilization ordinance that eliminate a landlord's right to remove apartments  from rent control by making substantial capital improvements to the units. Also  eliminated was a landlord's right to evict tenants while doing major  rehabilitation work, then re-rent the units at market rates.  </P> <P> New rules also were established for dealing with repair costs -- from new  faucets to carpets or appliances.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: DELTA BURKE'S ABSENCE FROM SHOW MAY BE A WARNING  </P> <P> CONSPICUOUS by her absence this week on "Designing Women" was Delta Burke. Her  character -- Suzanne Sugarbaker -- was talked about but never seen during the  episode.  </P> <P> What does this mean? Probably nothing, but Delta may well remember the fate  that befell Suzanne Somers some seasons ago when she became embroiled in a  dispute with her producers on "Three's Company." They held Somers to her  contract but reduced her role to less than nothing. Her career never quite  regained its luster after that.  </P> <P> Delta told Barbara Walters that she is "willing to risk her reputation and  career" once again, in an enormous public forum, to trash her producers, Linda  Bloodworth-Thomason and Harry Thomason.  </P> <P> She said, amid tears, that she wanted to put it all behind her, but . . . well,  going on TV and accusing people you work with of "betraying you" is not a  constructive first step to burying the past.  </P> <P> I'm not getting on Delta's case. I was the first to champion her at the height  of what she considered to be her "weight problem" when the tabloids were filled  with stories that she was losing her job and husband etc. I pointed out that  her character had become even funnier and had lost no sex appeal because of her  added curves.  </P> <P> Dixie Carter told me that Delta's weight gain had not mattered to the show  "because her face is so gorgeous. And, anyway, she's so talented." Linda  Bloodworth-Thomason also told me that they had never minded about Delta's  growing plump; it was Delta who minded.  </P> <P> I missed Delta the other night on "DW." I just hope I don't continue to miss  her. (People who score in TV always think that the grass will be greener when  they are out of their hit show. It doesn't usually work that way!)  </P> <P> CONSIDER THIS! The distinguished law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  &amp; Garrison with the Iran-Contra legal star Arthur Liman heading the defense  are said to have earned anywhere from $60 million to $100 million in fees from  defending Michael Milken. At one point, it is known they were bringing in $2.5  million a month.  </P> <P> For this defense, Milken received 10 years in jail, a $600-million fine, and  500 hours of community service when he gets out of jail someday.  </P> <P> Maybe Milken would have done better with Legal Aid.  </P></p>

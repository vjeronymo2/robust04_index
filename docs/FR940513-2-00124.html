			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fee Alternative 3, BLM-Forest Service Proposed Action, would adopt a fee formula using a base value ($3.96) updated annually by a Forage Value Index. The $3.96 base value represents a midrange between the results obtained through the use of two methods for estimating a fair base value. The proposed fee would be phased in over the years 1995 through 1997. Thereafter, annual increases or decreases in the grazing fee resulting from changes in the forage value index would be limited to 25 percent of the amount charged the previous year to provide for a measure of stability that would facilitate business planning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal would establish 1996 as the base year for the forage value index. The forage value index would not be used to annually adjust the fee in response to market conditions until the year 1997. This proposed rule would establish the 1995 grazing fee at $2.75, and the 1996 grazing fee at $3.50. Thereafter the fee would be calculated, using the base value of $3.96 multiplied by the revised forage value index. By definition, the forage value index in the year 1997 would equal one; yielding a 1997 grazing fee of $3.96. In subsequent years the calculated fee would depend on the changes in the market rate for private grazing land leases as reflected by the forage value index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fee incentive criteria would be developed during the first 2 years of a 3-year fee phase-in period. The third year of the phase-in would not be implemented until the incentive criteria are developed. Instead a base value of $3.50 would be substituted in 1997. Fee Alternative 4, Regional Fees, is the same as the proposed action fee, except that a different base value would be applied to six pricing regions. The regional base values would be derived from the 1983 Federal Land Forage Appraisal (updated in 1992). The regional base values would be annually updated using the Forage Value Index. The annual fee would not differ by more than 25 percent from the fee charged in the previous year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fee Alternative 5, Federal Forage Fee Formula, was developed by the Western Livestock Producers Alliance. It is based on a 3-year average of private grazing land lease rates for 16 western states. The formula uses multipliers of private land lease rates and deducts the updated 1966 nonfee costs described in the proposed fee alternative. That amount is multiplied by the percentage difference of cash receipts per cow for federal and nonfederal livestock producers. The annual fee would not differ by more than 25 percent from the fee charged in the previous year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fee Alternative 6, PRIA with Surcharges, would use the fee under the PRIA fee alternative ($1.86 for 1993) and add a surcharge to cover the cost of administering the grazing program at the local Forest Service and BLM administrative level. Each year the fee would be limited to twice the fee produced by the PRIA formula. After a 1-year phase-in, the surcharge would not differ by more than 10 percent from the previous year's surcharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fee Alternative 7, Competitive Bidding System, would use competitive bidding to set grazing fees. The successful bidder would be required to adhere to the terms of the permit and perform specific management practices and facilities maintenance. The terms of the permit would be part of the bid process, allowing bidders themselves to estimate the market value of the forage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public participation has occurred throughout the EIS process.

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / CrossRail team plans to split from partners CrossRail, the Pounds 2bn project for an east-west main line rail link beneath London, is to establish itself as a separate company with a chief executive recrui-ted from the private sector. The CrossRail scheme is a joint venture between British Rail, London Transport and Railtrack. Its three promoters are keen to see it become independent. According to Mr Geoff Maynard, BR director of London rail development, this would make it easier to bring in private sector partners and would allow managers to focus their energies on the project. At present CrossRail has to compete with other projects being pursued by BR, London Transport and Railtrack. The CrossRail team is working on plans to revive the project by means of the Transport and Works Act, an alternative to the private bill procedure under which the scheme was rejected by parliament in May. A private bill committee of four MPs objected to it on the grounds that traffic estimates made in the late 1980s were no longer relevant and that the project was not sufficiently integrated into other rail lines. A draft order seeking powers under the act will be put to parliament next May. The Transport and Works Act procedure being followed will allow detailed objections to be dealt with at a public enquiry rather than in parliament. It would also allow construction work to start in early to mid-1997 for completion in about 2002. Mr Maynard said headhunters had been recruited to find a chief executive for the project, It was likely he or she would come from the private sector. The appointment would be made early next year. It would be up to the chief executive to decide on the body set up to take over the project, but it is likely initially to be a company with the three original promoters as shareholders. Private sector shareholders could be brought in later. Some private sector companies in the engineering and construction field have criticised the CrossRail project as over-ambitious and expensive. They have proposed a simpler scheme which involves upgrading existing underground lines. Mr Maynard said private sector partners would be expected to co-operate in building a system to carry main line trains under London 'and not just tinker with the Underground network'.</p>

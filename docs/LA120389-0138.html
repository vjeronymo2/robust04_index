			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PARAMEDICS' PLIGHT  </P> <P> Are the people of San Diego following the salary negotiations between Hartson  and the union that now represents the paramedics who answer the call when we  dial 911? The paramedics are asking for a 24% increase, while Hartson wants to  give them 3.5%.  </P> <P> Many people are surprised when they learn what goes into becoming a paramedic  and what rewards him when he is certified. The one I know was accepted at  paramedic school only after working a year as an emergency medical technician.  The course of study was so rigorous that UC San Diego advised students that  those who attempted to work while attending school had a high failure rate.  Most of the students had to be supported by parents or spouses; several were  unable to complete the course, but received no refund. Tuition at that time was  $4,000 in advance, and the course took eight months. Books were several hundred  dollars more.  </P> <P> The paramedic I know has been working for Hartson long enough that he has  received one raise. He now makes $6.70 an hour. Because he works 24-hour shifts  he is able to hold down another full-time job on his days off. It is a menial  job that requires no education, but it pays more than $6.70 an hour. He must do  this in order to pay his rent. He has no dependents, so he is able to afford  working as a paramedic, a job he dearly loves. He works Christmas, Thanksgiving  and New Year, but he knew that going in, and he doesn't mind. Once in a while,  he is able to save someone's life, or comfort them before they die, so he is  rewarded.  </P> <P> I remember when Eastern Airlines went on strike a chart appeared on my  television screen showing the salary scales for baggage handlers at various  airlines. I was a little taken aback to see that they made around $14 an hour.  </P> <P> Business travelers and frequent flyers of San Diego, please ask yourself this  question. Does it make a lot of sense to you that the worker who takes your  suitcase off the plane and puts it on a conveyor belt makes more than twice as  much as the worker who restarts your heart for you when you have your heart  attack?  </P> <P> Do you think that this standard is in keeping with the priorities of the people  of San Diego? If it does not represent your priorities, let your City Council  know.  </P> <P> DIANA STRAIN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

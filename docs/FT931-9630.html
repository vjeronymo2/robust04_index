			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Observer: Bulb push Don't panic if you find your children staring fixedly at the ceiling. Likely as not they are carrying out a national light bulb audit on behalf of the government's energy efficiency office. It's all part of a campaign, given a big push by BBC's Blue Peter TV programme yesterday, to save the planet from global warming by persuading the population to install energy-saving compact fluorescent lights (CFLs). The new bulbs' attraction is that they use only a third of the energy of the conventional product and last eight times as long. The snag is they cost 20 times as much. Hence Britain's Lighting Industry Federation has scored an enviable marketing coup by persuading the BBC to boost its new product. It even managed to get the prime minister and opposition leader to agree about something on camera - that the bulb is a good idea.</p>

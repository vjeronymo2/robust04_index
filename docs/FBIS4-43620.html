			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Metin Sever and Orhan Gokdemir: "The Economic </F> Crisis Is an Obstacle Before a Military Solution Too"]    [Text] "It started six years ago, it can be completed in  two years. However, because nobody is being paid, work came to  a standstill one month ago. The contracting firm KISKA is owed  about 150 billion Turkish Lira [TL] [approximately $4.5  million]. We come and go with armored vehicles. The working  area was raided three times, five vehicles were set on fire,  three people were killed. Meanwhile, there is no money. Nobody  knows how the payments will be made. There are 75 armed guards,  two armored vehicles, and 50 soldiers. Also, State Water Works  guards are on duty night and day."    That is how an official of KISKA described the state of  affairs at the Dicle dam, part of the GAP [Southeast Anatolia  Project]. The same official pointed out that work has stopped at  the Kralkizi and Batman dams as well.    The stories about the gravity of the economic situation in  the southeast are not restricted only to the shattering of the  dreams about GAP. Rumors are spreading that the soldiers  serving in the southeast have not been receiving their salaries  for some time. Furthermore, it is being said that the state,  including the army and the bureaucracy, owes billions of liras  to the shopkeepers in the area.    A few days ago, journalist Yalcin Dogan wrote in his column  in MILLIYET: "We are collapsing together with our state and  middle classes. We are going through the saddest, most critical  period of the republican era. It is not a joke, we are  collapsing." Turkey is going through a serious economic crisis  that makes everyone feel we are collapsing. However, there is  no agreement on the reasons for the crisis.    Since 1990, Turkey has been increasingly sinking into a  terrorism quagmire. Consequently, more and more are asking:  "Maybe our economic problems are caused by terrorism?" This  question can be answered only if we look at the costs of  terrorism.    Here is a list of the expenditures for fighting terrorism  only in 1992: TL5 trillion to pay 44,372 village guards, TL30  trillion for security buildings, TL3.6 trillion in compensation  to civil servants, TL6.5 trillion paid to military, judicial,  and MIT [National Intelligence Agency] personnel, TL13 trillion  for one operation in northern Iraq.    These figures doubled in the two years since then. At the  end of 1993, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said that the struggle  being waged against the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] in the  southeast will cost TL400 trillion. During the past one year  and a half, the number of village guards grew to 51,450 and  their cost doubled to TL10 trillion. The cost of a policeman  serving in the southeast is almost three times as high as his  colleague in the west. A teacher who receives TL5 million in  the west, receives double that amount in the southeast.    Some 300,000 soldiers serve in the area. Every military  personnel serving in the region receives TL4 million as  "compensation for carrying weapons." So far, 400 helicopters  have been bought to be used in the struggle against terrorism.  Their cost is unbelievable: One Sikorsky costs $8.5 million,  one Cobra $4 million and one SuperCobra $12 million. At an  average of TL250 billion a piece, the total cost is TL100  trillion. The hourly flight cost of these helicopters is as  follows: $2,049 for the Cobra, $8,460 for the Super Cobra, and  $2,049 for the Sikorsky. Their average flight cost is more than  TL180 million. If 50 helicopters fly two hours per day the cost  is TL18 billion. If you add to that the cost of flight of  warplanes, another TL18 billion, the bill comes to TL36 billion  per day.    The state expenditures for "fighting terrorism" are not  restricted to that. For example, you must add to that the "Apo  [PKK leader Ocalan's nom de guerre] compensation." In order to  keep some 200,000 civil servants in the state of emergency  region, the state pays them, under the State of Emergency Law,  compensation termed by the public the "Apo compensation." The  yearly total of this compensation is TL6 trillion. This is in  addition to the cost of military, judicial, MIT, and other  secret organization personnel who are excluded by Law 657. The  latter figure is around TL10 trillion.    Lately, many circles are expressing the same view, and  loudly: "The war economy implemented by the government because  of the struggle against the PKK in the southeast has gone  bankrupt." The economic cost of this struggle was TL100  trillion in 1993 figures and will be TL400 trillion in 1994.  This has upset all the balances. The first result of this is  that the regional economy has become completely paralyzed. The  shopkeepers have moved to the west, sales have come to a  complete standstill, bank branches are closing one after the  other, checks cannot be cashed, and premiums are almost nil.  Also, the future is unknown for GAP -- a project which had  formed the cornerstone of the state's long-term program for the  region.    Ahmet Ozer, the GAP Municipalities Union secretary general,  describes the situation: "There is no substantial industry in  the region. Whatever there is is either being sold and closed  down. The region still needs state support. The state's policy  of encouragement has gone completely bankrupt. As a result,  there are many half-built installations or installations that  have been completed but are closed due to a lack of funds. When  industry and investments did not develop, dependent intermediate  and side- industries also failed to develop, paralyzing the  economy. Following the 5 April economic decisions, the sale of  cars and electrical household appliances dropped steeply, and  many shops had to close down. Another result of the 5 April  decisions was that the GAP came to a standstill. There are  several half-completed dam projects now, workers are being laid  off, contractors and the state cannot pay their debts to the  shopkeepers and others who are owed money. The GAP was the only  means to eliminate the interregional imbalances, to keep the  economy alive, and to create jobs. Therefore, it should have  been kept out of the 5 April economic package. The most  important of all is that nobody is doing anything about the  security expenditures in the southeast, even though they play a  major role in creating the reasons for the package in the first  place."  <H5>  Our Neighbors Also Face Difficulties </H5>   It is not only the region that is affected by the suspension  of the GAP investments. The GAP includes several dam projects  that were supposed to be used as trump cards in influencing and  controlling the military, political, and strategic forces of our  southern neighbors Syria and Iraq. The suspension of the  investments made the water issue among Syria, Turkey, and Iraq  uncertain as well. It is a known fact that various  misunderstandings cropped up between Turkey and its two southern  neighbors which use the waters of Firat and Dicle when Turkey  began to build the dams. Especially Syria reacted strongly when  less water began to flow in Firat with the development of the  GAP. Syria took the problem to international organizations. In  return, Turkey claimed that Syria was supporting the PKK and  instigating the Kurds within the GAP in order to prevent the  construction of the project. These developments strained the  relations between the two countries which even resorted to  taking military measures.    In fact, the Turkish General Staff changed its former  assessment and announced that the "threat" to Turkey comes from  the "south." This meant that the military buildup would be in  the southeast. It also meant that the GAP investments would be  traded for military expenditures.    The growing expectations that a "water war" will break out  in  the Middle East is laying a heavy load on the economies of the  two countries. Observing these developments with concern,  Turkey gave up the idea of reforming its big and lumbering army.  It also suspended the GAP which it earlier considered as an  economic guarantee.    On the other hand, the weapons Turkey has been buying only  from the United States and Germany since 1990 are enough to  equip an army. UN figures show that the tanks and armored  vehicles bought from these two countries in 1993 are equal to  the number in the British Army. Most of these weapons are being  deployed in the southeast. It is observed that great  difficulties are being encountered in paying for these weapons  especially after the 5 April economic package.  <H5>  "The Terrorist Increment" </H5>   Nobody doubts that the picture at the end of 1994 will be  very dark. The additional burden of the war in the southeast  created a TL124 trillion deficit in the 1993 budget. Professor  Dogu Ergil says the following about the real dimensions of this  burden: "We can get a picture about the cost of terrorism by  looking at the budget figures. In 1993, the consolidated budget  revenues were set at TL344.4 trillion, and the expenditures at  TL397 trillion. The TL53.3 trillion deficit was to be covered  with internal and external loans. In the first seven months of  the year, the government borrowed this amount. Now, it either  had to print money, or it had to borrow some more. To meet the  expenditures until the end of the year, another TL130 trillion  was needed. That was the `terrorist increment.'    "The cost of fighting terrorism is terrible. We lose cash  and investments stop. When you fight terrorism hard, you stop  big projects such as the GAP. The construction of the Batman  and Dicle dams stopped. That is a terrible cost to pay. It is  true, many PKK members are being killed in the southeast, but at  a very great cost."    It seems that the deficit is impossible to close regardless  of all the saving policies implemented in other fields. No one  knows what the deficit will be in 1994. We can say, however,  that the economic crisis looms as an obstacle before a military  solution.</p>

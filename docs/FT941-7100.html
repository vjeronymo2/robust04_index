			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Oil executive fined Pounds 120,000 for BCCI fraud Mr Mohammed Baqi, the former managing director of Attock Oil, was fined Pounds 120,000 at the Old Bailey yesterday after being convicted of conspiring to inflate fraudulently the profits of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International by Dollars 90m. Mr Baqi was found guilty on six counts of conspiring to furnish false information but acquitted on a further two similar charges. The judge ordered him to pay Pounds 50,000 towards the prosecution costs and Pounds 70,000 towards his legal aid. Judge Neil Denison, explaining why he was not jailing Mr Baqi, said the businessman had been used by more powerful men in BCCI and they had escaped justice. Mr Baqi had neither sought personal gain nor intended to cause loss to the depositors of the collapsed bank, he said. The judge made no order to disqualify Mr Baqi from being a company director. The conviction is the second successful prosecution brought so far by the Serious Fraud Office over the collapse of BCCI. Mr Sayed Ali Akbar, a former head of BCCI's international treasury division, was jailed for six years last September after confessing to 16 charges of false accounting involving Dollars 746m. During Mr Baqi's trial the prosecution outlined how he conspired with senior members of BCCI to help them perpetrate the bank's multi-billion dollar international fraud by signing false audit-confirmation requests and letters confirming that Attock Oil owed management fees to the bank. The prosecution said the effect of these was to confirm to Price Waterhouse, the BCCI auditors, that the bank was owed Dollars 90m by Attock Oil, so creating a false impression of the bank's profitability. The prosecution said the main perpetrator of this part of the overall BCCI fraud was Mr Basheer Chowdry, a former manager with the bank's UK operations, with whom the Attock Oil head had regular dealings. Mr Chowdry had left for Pakistan after the collapse of the bank in June 1991 and was now out of reach of the British authorities, the court was told. Lawyers for Mr Baqi said during the trial that he had been made a scapegoat for the collapse of the bank and they questioned why he had been prosecuted when staff from both Price Waterhouse and the Bank of England had failed to act when the signs of fraud had started to emerge. During cross-examination one Price Waterhouse witness admitted that his firm had failed always to use best-practice methods when auditing the BCCI books. Mr Baqi left court yesterday without commenting. He intends to return permanently to his native Pakistan.</p>

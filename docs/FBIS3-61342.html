			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.V. Aleksashenko, deputy minister of finance of </F> the Russian Federation: "To Perfect the Process of Drafting  Territorial Budgets"]    [Text] The fall has come--the time to draft budgets. Our  success in the coming year will largely depend on the results of  this effort. This is why we should concentrate on the mutual  relations between budgets and changes in the tax system in the  coming year without embarking on theoretical discussions about  how things happen in our country and why, which at present  claims too much effort and time.    First of all, it must be understood that the budget is a  mechanism that operates continuously, every day. By virtue of a  number of circumstances of restructuring, radical changes of  some kind in the budget during the calendar, financial year are  virtually impossible. We are bound by laws and obligations;  besides, the economic situation is quite difficult. Under the  circumstances, it is natural that all our hopes for the better  may only be attached to 1 January of next year, and new patterns  of some kind and their implementation may only be planned for  that period.    Perhaps no one sees our budget in its entirety or has an  idea  of its status. This is not surprising; after all, the budget is  supplemented on a daily basis by the decisions of various  authorities concerning new expenditures and grants of relief.  Crowds (another word is hard to find) of visitors push decisions  advantageous to them in the government. The adopted laws force  the state to spend tremendous funds for programs whose  effectiveness is dubious. The law on grain, the law on the  social status of servicemen, and the law on guarantees to  northerners are the best-known of such laws. These three laws,  when fully implemented, result in expenditures of approximately  20 trillion rubles [R]. Of course, servicemen should be  protected, the northerners should be helped, and our agrarians  are facing a difficult situation. However, when we are told that  we should pay world prices for grain to agrarians, plus  compensate them for one-third of their expenditures, plus offset  50 percent of the cost of machinery, 40 percent of the cost of  fertilizer, and 30 percent of the cost of motor fuel and  lubricants, it will turn out that the grain price for the state  in our country is greater than in the world, whereas the wages  of kolkhoz members do not reach even 10 percent of world levels.  The question is: Where is this money going? We invest tremendous  funds in agriculture, but the result is zilch.    In late July, a representative of the Tula Oblast  administration, who had "pushed through" a government decree on  conducting an experiment in the agro-industrial complex, came to  see me and said: "We need R15 billion in easy credit, in which  case we will produce additional agricultural output worth R15  billion." I was somewhat taken aback by these numbers and said:  "Well, fine--we will give you R15 billion, the interest rate  being 170 percent annually; this means approximately another  R23-R24 billion. The total amount of expenditures will come to  R42 billion, and the increment in output--R15 billion. Are the  outlays and the returns commensurate?" One would think that  budget expenditures should be viewed not only from the point of  view of political lobbying; the time has come to look at whether  such expenditures are needed from the point of view of the  result produced.    Frankly, the situation that is emerging in the tax sphere  and  in the sphere of budgetary federalism, in mutual relations  between the federation and its components does not satisfy the  government. We would like to have greater precision and clarity  in this matter and less room for case-by-case decisions. As far  as taxes are concerned, the government has a clear-cut position.  The government evaluates the situation quite soberly and  believes that it makes absolutely no sense to introduce some new  taxes, some kind of large, heavy, complex taxes. We will not be  in a position to collect more than 50 percent of the gross  domestic product. At the same time, we are not currently in a  position to reduce the tax burden on the economy. Last year, all  revenues and receipts that the state collected for the budget  and all off-budget funds came to approximately 48 percent of the  gross domestic product. For comparison, this number comes to 40  percent in the countries of Western Europe, the European  Community, and to 30 percent of the gross domestic product in  the United States and Japan. To be sure, there are the examples  of Denmark and Sweden where, respectively, 54 and 51 percent of  the gross domestic product is collected. However, in this case,  too, this is rather an exception from the rule.    Therefore, elsewhere they collect less taxes, and we collect  more. However, in addition to this we should say that the  deficit of state finance last year came to approximately another  30 percent of the gross domestic product. That is to say, we  collect 48 percent, and we print money for another 30 percent.  The state is facing a unique economic situation whereby it may  spend not only its revenues (the funds it collects in the form  of taxes); it may generally meet all of its needs by using the  printing press--simply printing money. In this case, all  citizens of the country will pay an inflationary tax: by putting  new money into circulation, we depreciate each ruble that is in  circulation.    At present, the federal budget receives approximately one  ruble in three (which it spends on expenditures) out of the  credit of the Central Bank, i.e., one ruble in each three that  the budget pays as wages, allowances, retirement benefits, and  investment is not backed by anything. This is new money that  depreciates the money already available in the country. Under  the circumstances, it is impossible to resolutely up and reduce  the tax load by a factor of two if we still strive to avoid  hyperinflation.    At the same time, there is potential for reducing the tax  burden. Out of the 48 percent of the gross domestic product that  we collected in the form of taxes in 1993, 16.5 percent or  slightly more went to off-budget funds: the Retirement Fund, the  Social Security Fund, the Employment Fund, and another  approximately two dozen small funds. As far as off-budget funds  set up by the government are concerned, a decision in principle  has already been made to the effect that from 1994 on, all of  them will be incorporated into the budget, and the government  will no longer have off-budget funds. There is a problem with  off-budget funds that were managed and controlled by the Supreme  Soviet. Out of the monies that the off-budget funds collected  last year, approximately one-third of the funds remained unused  (out of the 16.5 percent, which the off-budget funds collected,  5.5 percent remained in accounts). This says only that  enterprises pay social insurance withholdings and those to the  Retirement Fund (to all enterprises, these are just other  taxes), but these monies are not used in any way. From the point  of view of the state, they are not productive. Let us say  frankly that the monies are used there for mercenary purposes:  They are placed in deposit accounts at a low rate of interest,  with someone collecting the difference.    Under the circumstances, it would be feasible to allocate  the  temporarily unobligated monies of the off-budget funds, a  certain proportion of them (70-80 percent), to the acquisition  of state securities so that the federal budget would be able to  borrow money from off-budget funds, pay a certain rate of  interest to them, and spend it for budget expenditures, thus  restricting inflationary pressures.    In principle, the current tax system (as an aggregate of  taxes, i.e., the list of 42 taxes) satisfies the government.  Five or six key taxes generate 95 percent of the budget  receipts. The rest of the taxes are needed to perform a  regulatory function and to maintain the revenue base of local  budgets.    While not seeing it fit to change the tax system, the  government considers it necessary to focus its efforts on  implementing the principles of the Federation Treaty with regard  to the budget and tax system.    Understandably, the list of local and regional taxes that  now  exists is not in a position to meet the financial needs of our  regions. At present, the situation is such that out of 89  regions, 41 regions receive from the federal budget 40 percent  of the funds that this budget spends (this is the total volume  of grants). Out of these 41 regions, 22 regions receive more  than 60 percent. In general, there are fewer than 20 regions not  receiving grants in our country as a whole. This is why it is  clear that some kind of a substantive approach to the division  of the collected taxes should be implemented in our country, in  our federation. The practice of the world indicates that in  principle there are three approaches to solving this problem.    The first approach is to have different taxes. The  federation  would introduce its own taxes, components of the  federation--their own taxes, and the local organs of  power--their own. The rights and responsibilities of various  levels of authority in laying taxes should be divided: there  should be federal taxes, taxes of the components of the  federation, and local taxes. Correspondingly, each level of  authority should introduce taxes that are entirely taken in by  its budget.    That is to say, if someone wants to increase his revenues,  he  should introduce new taxes, and thus also be held politically  accountable by his population. "You want to spend money--so tell  us what are you collecting it for and how"--this principle  should be the same for all authorities, so that everything will  be precise and clear, and that no region will visit Moscow and  bargain for better conditions for themselves than for the  neighboring regions. Everyone should be responsible for his  decisions. In conjunction with this, it is necessary to  authorize the components of the federation and the local organs  of power to introduce their own taxes, and to establish and  revise the rates of the taxes that now exist. Are some kind of  upper-limit restrictions needed in the process or not? The  Ministry of Finance believes that these restrictions do not  work; a way will always be found to circumvent them. However, in  principle, this issue exists.    The second approach is for a tax, for example, the profit  tax, to combine rates: the federal level of power will introduce  its own rate, the regional level--its own rate, and the local  level--its own rate.    The third approach calls for tax revenue sharing. In our  country, the value-added tax that is distributed between the  federation and components of the federation is a vivid example.    The practice of what we call developed countries testifies  to  the fact that nobody has succeeded in adhering to just one  principle. No budgetary system is built on a single principle,  that is, nowhere do just different taxes or the combination of  rates exist. As a rule, a combination of all three, or in rare  instances two out of the three aforementioned approaches, is  used. In view of this, it is not possible by any means to agree  with the popular proposal to divide taxes: to give the profit  tax to the regions, and to give the entire value-added tax to  the federal budget. From a purely financial standpoint,  approximately equal amounts emerge, that is to say, the federal  budget will not lose, but the regions will because the  distribution of the profit tax throughout the territory of the  country is much more uneven than that of the value-added tax.  According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance, 17 regions  stand to win from the introduction of this arrangement, and the  rest of the regions will lose. This means just one thing--that  the need of the regions for additional financing will increase.    Moreover, the Ministry of Finance believes that neither the  federal budget nor the budgets of components of the federation  can be held hostage by a single tax. All kinds of things may  happen to the profit tax in a region: For example, a large-scale  conversion program may begin, or else a natural disaster may  occur there, the entire industrial sector could shut down, and  there would be no receipts of the profit tax. What then? It will  always be very difficult for both the federation and components  of the federation in such emergency situations.    This is why in our country, under our conditions, we should  implement a combination of all three of these methods. In  particular, the Ministry of Finance proposes to combine rates of  the profit tax: to make the profit tax both a federal tax and a  tax of the components of the federation so that the federal  parliament will introduce its own tax rate, which will apply to  all enterprises throughout the country, and representative  organs of power of components of the federation will introduce  their rates.    At the same time, the Ministry of Finance believes that the  profit tax and the personal income tax should be paid by all  citizens and all enterprises. These should be federal taxes; at  the same time, only a particular proportion of them will be  federal. This is one of the principles that forms the foundation  of the state. Uniform taxes and uniform currency--this is what  should unite all of us. Each individual residing in the  territory of our country or each enterprise operating in the  territory of our country that generates profits through its  activities must pay taxes to the federal budget primarily to  perform common functions that exist in our country.    The Ministry of Finance proposes to share and give to the  regions a proportion of proceeds by virtue of the value-added  tax.    The rate of the value-added tax should be established in its  entirety by the federal parliament and should be shared on a  uniform principle between the federal and regional budgets.    At present, these allowances are differentiated: between 20  and 50 percent is taken in by the budgets of the components of  the federation. Unfortunately, personal preferences play a  considerable role in whether the number 20, 28, 43, or 50 is  laid down.    The current situation is such that one-half of the regions  receive substantial grants from the federal budget. Generally  speaking, it makes no difference whether a region receives 20 or  50 percent; something will still have to be given to it  additionally. However, the position of the Ministry of Finance  is that uniformity in mutual relations should be introduced in a  radical manner. As we see it, 25 percent of the proceeds by  virtue of the value-added tax should be given to regions, and  the uniform norm should apply to all. Everyone should stand on  an equal footing and be guided by uniform rules.    The concept of differentiating the rate of the value-added  tax cannot be supported by any means. Technically, the  value-added tax is very complicated. A system for refunding  monies exists within it; if we introduce various rates in  different regions of our country, our financial system will go  crazy: To conduct all such resettlements, we will have to know  the rates of the value-added tax that exist in each of 89  components of the federation.    A similar experiment has already been conducted in Brazil,  where each state introduced different rates of the value-added  tax. However, this was very quickly abandoned because the  financial system became chaotic.    Understandably, disproportions will arise anyway, regardless  of the manner in which territorial budgets are drawn up. There  will still be regions (more than one-half) that will need  financial support even after we make use of all theoretical  tax-sharing arrangements. This is why it is proposed to  introduce two types of transfer payments, payments from the  federal budget to regional budgets. One payment would be given  as general replenishment for the revenue base in the event that  the per capita total of federal taxes in a specific region is  lower than in the country as a whole. A proportion of this could  be compensated from the federal budget. The second payment (in  conventional terms--"social") in the event that the total per  capita social expenditures are substantially lower in a  particular place than in the economic region on the average.  Once again, the federal budget may defray a certain proportion  of these expenditures.    According to calculations, the implementation of this  arrangement on the basis of 1993 statistics results in the  following: one-third of the regions win, one-third of the  regions lose, the situation of one-third remains the way it  exists now. In the process, the issue of regions that lose  heavily is very complicated. There are regions that will lose up  to 60-65 percent of their present-day income. Understandably,  some kind of individual solutions should be sought.    At present, there are regions that receive 85-95 percent of  the funds for their expenditures from the federal budget.  Understandably, others cannot shoulder the tax burden for them.  If someone wants to finance large expenditures in his territory,  let him set his taxes himself, or ask for assistance, subjecting  his budgets to control by the Ministry of Finance in order to  make it possible to determine how rationally money is being  spent. This procedure should possibly have some political  conditions attached to it, but everyone should know clearly: If  you want to have assistance beyond certain rules that exist in  our country be so kind as to do this openly.</p>

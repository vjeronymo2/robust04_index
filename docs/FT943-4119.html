			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Easier to bring to account Sir, Government refusal to legislate for the interest on non-payment of accounts is but a small part of the UK business scene which has long since branded us as a third world country ('Venturing capital', August 25). Some of the others are: 1) The right to bounce cheques ad infinitum. 2) The time taken for courts to approve debts. Even when debts are approved for collection, the system for doing so is outrageous, with bailiffs rarely visiting as required - and going away as soon as someone says 'boo'. The time they take is sufficient to allow anyone to disappear with any remaining assets. 3) Complex court procedures for redress. They are as costly as for any complex action, when they should be part of a simple 'business court' and easy to operate in a business climate. Business disputes should be able to go through the business court directly if the parties do not wish/are unable to go through the various agencies currently available, most of which do not have any legal standing. For an easy reference to countries which operate easy, workable and efficient systems I suggest examination of systems in operation in Switzerland and Germany.

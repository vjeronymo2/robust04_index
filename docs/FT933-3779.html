			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Markets: Gold prices still in decline - At a glance Gold prices continued to decline this week. On Friday afternoon, gold was fixed at Dollars 351.50 a troy ounce in London, after a morning fixing of Dollars 356. The price has tumbled from a high of Dollars 406.70 an ounce at the peak of the recent rally on August 2. It has fallen about Dollars 15 so far this month, and is now back to levels last seen in April. One of the factors in Friday's price fall was an unexpected drop in the US producer price index. Recent trading has been driven largely by investment funds using computer investment programmes in the New York market, as physical demand for gold from traditional consumers in the Middle and Far East has been weakened by the high prices.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Wang Zhaoguo,  director of the Office of Taiwan Affairs of the State Council,  today stressed that China resolutely opposes any forms of claims  and actions regarding "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan".    Wang, also vice-chairman of the National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),  reiterated that China also resolutely opposes any attempts to  create "Taiwan independence."    Wang made the remark at the Third Meeting of the First  Council of the Chinese Mainland's Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).    After reviewing the progress between the relations across  the  Taiwan Strait, Wang said that the relations across the Taiwan  Strait saw great development last year.    He said that the publication of the White Paper "The Taiwan  Question and the Reunification of China" made a complete and  systematic exposition of China's principled stance and policies  on the Taiwan issue, producing a realistic and far-reaching  impact on the development of the relations across the straits  and the reunification of China.    Wang said that at the 48th General Assembly of the United  Nations, the Taiwan authorities' attempt to "participate in the  United Nations" was thwarted.    He noted that recently some people in Taiwan advocated a  step  by step approach to two Chinas, which roused serious attention  and vigilance on China's mainland.    However, he said, Taiwan patriots including men of insight  among the Taiwan authorities have made great efforts to develop  the relations across the straits.    Last year the Taiwan authorities relaxed some restrictions  over exchanges between the mainland and Taiwan and adopted some  measures conducive to promoting mutual understanding and  exchanges across the Strait.    He said, "We hope the Taiwan authorities uphold the sense of  Chinese nation and truly adhere to the principle of one China so  as to contribute to the development of the relations across the  straits and the peaceful reunification of the motherland."    Wang spoke highly of ARATS' work to promote the exchanges  between the mainland and Taiwan in the past two years.    He said that from January to November last year, the  indirect  trade value between the two sides reached 12.1 billion U.S.  dollars.    Last year more than 1.5 million Taiwan compatriots visited  the mainland and more and more mainland people also went to  Taiwan.    He called on ARATS to make efforts to promote exchanges of  mail services, air and shipping services and trade across the  straits, promote exchanges and cooperation between the people on  the two sides, and especially to develop economic cooperation.    ARATS should help related sectors and localities to solve  the  problems arising in the exchanges between the people of the two  sides and protect the legal rights and interests of the mainland  and Taiwan people, he added.    He urged ARATS to promote talks on economic and civil  affairs  with its Taiwan counterpart.    He said that the leaders of ARATS and the Taiwan-based  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will regularly hold talks in  line with the agreements concluded at the "Wang-Ku" meeting and  he hoped that ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan and SEF Chairman Ku  Chen-fu will hold their second meeting soon.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpts] Israel will allow Palestinians residing in East  Jerusalem to be elected to the autonomy council in the elections  to be held in the territories at the end of the interim  arrangement, if they hold dual residency: in Jerusalem and in  the West Bank. This proposal was raised in internal  deliberations held recently in Jerusalem in anticipation of the  next phase of the talks with the PLO. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Israel has informed the PLO that it will not  allow  members of the temporary Palestinian Authority, operating in the  self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho, to serve in the same  capacity in Jerusalem. This restriction will also apply to  Faysal al-Husayni. [passage omitted]    Security sources told the cabinet yesterday that the number  of terror incidents in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and the  incidence of rioting in the West continues to drop.    The sources noted that the number of summer visits to the  territories is expected to increase by 70 percent over last  year. According to them, over 10,000 visitors might arrive every  day, and there will apparently be a great deal of pressure at  the Allenby Bridge crossing.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Market place confused on environment Sir, Ian Rodger ('Accounting for 'green' efforts', September 29) is critical of Ciba's recent corporate environmental report for its apparent lack of clarity and comprehensiveness. He is focusing on the wrong target. He should be focusing upon the way the market place is treating environmental issues. Despite expressions of good intent from governments and inter-governmental agencies, the market is in a state of confusion. There is no obvious way of turning sustainable development into sustainable profits, particularly when the economy needs rebuilding after recession. Consumers are showing resistance to paying a premium for environmental goods. Many companies, rather than adopting the government preferred route of Batneec (Best available technology not entailing excessive cost) are driven by poor profitability Catnip (Cheapest available technology not involving prosecution)] Environmental management systems from the British Standards Institute (BS7750) and the EC (Emas) are complex, confusing and unnecessary for the vast majority of businesses. The EC eco-labelling initiative is proving difficult to get into effective operation. (How do all those bureaucratic processes fit with de-regulation?) With such a confused market we cannot expect companies to be clear about the best ways of reporting. When the legislators, institutional investors and consumers are clear about what they want, the market will deliver it and companies will tell us how it is done. The cart needs a horse - preferably at the front. A S Hearne, managing director, RPS Group, Centurion Court, 85 Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxfordshire OX14 4RY</p>

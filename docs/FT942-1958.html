			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Hong Kong talks make good progress: Officials say China's doubts about airport seem to have been met The former mansion of Banque Indochine's general manager in Hong Kong was the venue yesterday for what might well have been the turning point in Britain and China's long running row over Hong Kong. Standing on the steps above the terrace of Seabourne Villa, a large colonial house built in 1905, Mr Hugh Davies, the UK's representative to the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), which deals with the details of Hong Kong's 1997 transfer to China, proclaimed that 'excellent progress' had been made on the first day of the three-day meeting. Mr Davies said a top bilateral group would meet on Friday to discuss financing Hong Kong's HKDollars 159bn (Pounds 13.5bn) airport project. Government officials later said China's previous concerns about financing the airport and its connecting railway, including the issues of land sales and debt, appeared to have been met. Short of fresh demands, officials could think of no reason why the financial plan could not be agreed on Friday. Over the past few months China has signalled a desire to repair relations with Britain and get back to work on Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty. But in terms of what Britain and China need to do by 1997 the airport is like the visible part of an iceberg - largely hidden from public view is a vast amount of work which remains to be done. Awaiting the attention of the JLG is, among other things, the regularisation of Hong Kong's law, sorting out the colony's air services agreements, the extension of the colony's container port, and determining what sort of travel documents Hong Kong citizens will use after 1997. At Seabourne Villa, Mr Davies and Mr Guo Fengmin, his Chinese counterpart both acknowledged the tightness of the timetable ahead. Mr Guo noted at yesterday's photocall: 'There are only three years until 1997 and there are a lot of problems for the JLG to discuss if a smooth transition is to be guaranteed.' The need for a 'smooth transition' may well be the motive propelling China toward agreement. But some Hong Kong government officials will only believe Beijing has had a change of heart when they see concrete evidence of it. The Chinese walked away from a deal on military land and are busily trying to extract further concessions from the UK. At Friday's meeting of the Airport Committee, Beijing may decide on one further turn of the screw to see if more can be extracted from a colonial government keen to show the world that its relations with China are returning to normal.</p>

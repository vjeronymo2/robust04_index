			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: ECONOMY BEACH TOWNS NOT FAR FROM LISBON  </P> <P> Young travelers who reach Lisbon usually head south to soak up the sun on the  popular Algarve coast. Yet near Lisbon are interesting and economical stops to  make before you head for the beautiful beaches.  </P> <P> Take a break from big-city sightseeing by riding an electric train from  downtown Lisbon to the popular beach-front coastal towns of Estoril and  Cascais. It takes 35 minutes to get to Estoril, and the cost is only 105  escudos (about 75 cents U.S.).  </P> <P> The beaches aren't like the Algarve but they are sandy, something you can't  always count on when you visit European waterfront towns.  </P> <P> Estoril was once home to European royalty and the wealthy. The beautiful villas  that surround Europe's largest casino still remain.  </P> <P> Cascais is just a little farther along the coast. It's the next stop by train,  or you can walk along the waterfront, which is dominated by the remains of a  guard tower.  </P> <P> Cascais, a town of trendy shops and restaurants, has evolved out of the winding  streets of a small fishing village. Colorful fishing boats and nets add to the  atmosphere of the cheerful, busy beachfront.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not for Backpackers  </P> <P> This area does not cater to the backpacking traveler, but at a few budget  hotels rates for a double start at 2,000 escudos ($14 U.S.) in the winter  season and 3,500 escudos in summer. Tourist information offices in both towns  give directions.  </P> <P> From Estoril take a 45-minute bus trip to Sintra. Because of its palaces and  gardens, Sintra has been called the "fairy-tale city of Portugal."  </P> <P> Buses leave each hour. The fare is 170 escudos ($1.20 U.S.).  </P> <P> Another interesting option is to travel inland from Lisbon to Evora, one of the  oldest cities of the Iberian Peninsula.  </P> <P> Evora is often referred to as Portugal's "museum town." When the Romans were  there during the second century they built a beautiful temple to their goddess  Diana. Much still remains.  </P> <P> An excellent regional museum is housed in what was once the Bishop's Palace.  For the bizarre, visit the Church of St. Francis; walls are decorated with the  skulls and bones of about 5,000 monks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fast Bus Service  </P> <P> If you are traveling on a Eurailpass you can use it to reach Evora from Lisbon.  The trip takes about three hours. On many routes in Portugal, buses provide  more frequent and faster service than trains.  </P> <P> A two-hour express bus from Lisbon to Evora costs 650 escudos. The non-express  bus service takes about three hours and costs 585 escudos.  </P> <P> It's best to start in Evora at the tourist information office, which faces the  main Praca Do Giraldo square. You can store your luggage at the bus or rail  station but the rail station is not as central.  </P> <P> At the tourist information office you can get a list of lodgings and a map with  directions to the youth hostel, formerly a private home, at 32 Rua de  Corredoura. It's a 10-minute walk from the tourist office. The hostel opens  between 5:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., depending on the season, and has a curfew at  10:30 p.m.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Showers May Be Cold  </P> <P> At 500 escudos for accommodations and continental breakfast, the price is  right. But don't count on hot water for the showers.  </P> <P> The hostel staff is helpful with information about sights to see, good  economical restaurants and bus and rail information. Kitchen facilities are  available. A supermarket is near the main bus terminal.  </P> <P> In Portugal, International Student Identity Cards are good for free admission  to 30 museums and palaces (this does not include private museums).  </P> <P> The fee for exchanging traveler's checks is high, however. One bank charged 500  escudos, plus 45 escudos tax. So shop around and try not to make more  transactions than necessary.  </P> <P> For more information on travel to Portugal, contact the Portuguese National  Tourist Office, 590 Fifth Ave., New York 10036, (212) 354-4403.  </P></p>

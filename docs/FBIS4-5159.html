			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- "All the forces opposed  to division and confrontation, all the classes and strata  aspiring after national reconciliation and unity should turn out  as one to open up a decisive phase for carrying into practice  the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation,"  said the Central Committee of the South Korean National  Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in an open letter to the people  from all walks of life in South Korea on April 5, the  Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported.    The letter was published on the lapse of one year since the  great leader President Kim Il-song put forward the "10-point  programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the  reunification of the country".    It said if the 10-point programme of the great national  unity  is to be realized, it is important, above all, to wage a  vigorous struggle to remove the forces of war and confrontation,  the separatist forces that block reconciliation and great unity  between the South and the North of the country and also to fight  for the abrogation of the "National Security Law", an  anti-national, anti-reunification evil law.    "The entire people," it stressed, "cherishing deep in mind  the pride of having sagacious Comrade Kim Chong-il, the  distinguished leader of the present times, at the head of the  nation, should unite under the grand banner of great national  unity and dynamically advance towards the establishment of a  confederal, unified state, independent, peaceful and neutral."</p>

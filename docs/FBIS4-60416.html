			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by security affairs correspondent Sharon Sade] </F>   [Text] The decline in the defense industries' sales to the  local market and in budget allocations for security-related  research and development [R&amp;D] projects will continue as the  peace process makes progress. This was stated yesterday by  Defense Ministry Director General David 'Ivri at a seminar on  Israel's security in an era of peace, held at the Jaffee Center  for Strategic Studies.    According to him, "this will happen because a growing part  of  the defense budget, which has not changed much, is earmarked for  ongoing needs resulted from the political process, such as the  redeployment of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] units and  investments in the protection of settlements. This comes at the  expense of purchases from the defense industries and the  allocation of funds for security-related R&amp;D."    "This is why," 'Ivri said, "the industries will have to  prepare for this on their own and find alternative marketing  solutions to compensate for the expected decline in income." He  added that the more progress the peace process makes, the less  prominent will the defense industries be in the framework of the  defense establishment. Hence, their continued existence will  become a national matter.    'Ivri went on to say that additional resources must be  located for security R&amp;D projects because this will help  Israel  sustain its technological qualitative edge, which is a major  part of its deterrent ability, and could help the industries  offer attractive products on the international markets.    'Ivri believes that the peace process is not the only thing  to impact on the defense industries. They will mainly be  affected by the state of the international markets, because most  of the Israeli products -- some two-thirds -- are sold to  foreign costumers. At the same time, 'Ivri criticized the  prevailing sentiment that the decline in weapons sales on the  international market is the main reason for the deteriorated  condition of the defense industries.    'Ivri presented data that show that the scope of Israel's  defense exports rose by 75 percent between 1978 and 1992, while  sales by other countries dropped 45 percent during the same  period, and that decline continues. 'Ivri added that over the  past several years, there has been a slight and gradual drop in  Israel's security exports, which corresponds with the global  markets.    The Defense Ministry director general pointed to additional  difficulties for Israeli exports, such as tougher competition  from government-sponsored Western industries; a policy of  banning the transfer of technologies and know-how adopted by the  United States and other countries; the restrictions on the use  of U.S. aid, 90 percent of which is designated for the purchase  of equipment in the United States; the need to obtain export  permits for Israeli systems equipped with U.S.-made components,  which makes arms deals more difficult and slower; and more.    He further said that the defense industries must become  smaller and adjust to the change in demands from clients who are  more interested today in upgrading systems and in sophisticated  complementary systems such as guided missiles and bombs,  intelligence-oriented systems, electronic warfare, and command  and control units, and less interested in basic ammunition and  equipment such as airplanes, tanks, and armored vehicles, of  which there is plenty on the global market and at relatively low  prices.    This explains why the Military Industries are in trouble.  "Israel's relatively comfortable situation has helped to open  new markets for the industries, made the establishment of  business ties with foreign countries easier, and created greater  potential for sales to nearby countries as well. At the same  time, the effective scope of sales depends on defense budgets on  the receiving end, and they are on the decline internationally,"  he said.    The speakers at the seminar unanimously agreed that the  Middle East peace process is a result of Israel's image as a  deterrent, which caused most of the Arab countries to abandon  the military option and opt for a political dialogue. Most of  the speakers expressed the belief that an image of powerful  deterrent ability will guarantee long-term peace and stability  in the Middle East.</p>

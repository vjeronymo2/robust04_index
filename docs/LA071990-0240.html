			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CELTICS' PARISH SAYS SONICS WANT HIM  </P> <P> Boston Celtics center Robert Parish, the oldest starter in the NBA, says the  Seattle SuperSonics are trying to acquire him, according to a published report.  </P> <P> "I did talk to K. C. Jones and he told me that they are trying to get me," The  Union Leader newspaper quoted Parish as saying.  </P> <P> Jones, now Seattle's coach, formerly coached the Celtics.  </P> <P> Parish said trading him would be a mistake because the Celtics "wouldn't have a  legitimate center."  </P> <P> "Joe Kleine is not a legitimate center in the sense that he is not a shot  blocker and not an intimidator," he was quoted as saying. "He's not a force on  the offensive end."  </P> <P> Parish, 36, acknowledged that Kleine is the best backup he's had since Bill  Walton in 1986. But if the Celtics trade him, Parish believes no one on the  roster could replace him.  </P> <P> "Kevin McHale is capable, but he'd be playing out of position," Parish said.  </P></p>

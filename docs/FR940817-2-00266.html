			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 5.2.3. Exposure Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This step of the risk assessment process determines the source, route, dose, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duration of human exposure to an agent. The results of the dose-response assessment are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined with an estimate of human exposure to obtain a quantitative estimate of risk. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either the effect of or the exposure to an agent approaches zero, the risk of neurotoxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches zero. It should be recognized that exposures to multiple agents may produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> synergistic or additive effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exposure can occur via many routes, including ingestion, inhalation, or contact with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skin. Sources of exposure may include soil, food, air, water, or intended vehicle (e.g., drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulation). The degree of exposure may be strongly influenced by a number of factors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for example, the occupation of the individual involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The duration of exposure (i.e., acute or chronic) and interval of exposure (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> episodic or continuous) are variables of exposure that are common to all types of risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments, including carcinogenicity (OSTP, 1985).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although not routinely used, biological markers or biomarkers of exposure could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> theoretically improve the exposure assessment process and, thereby, improve the overall risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of neurotoxicants. Exposure biomarkers may include either the quantitation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exogenous agents or the complex of endogenous substances and exogenous agents within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system (Committee on Biological Markers, 1987). A limited number of examples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biomarkers of exposure have been reviewed by Slikker (1991) and include blood or dentine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead concentrations (Needleman, 1987), cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of dopamine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metabolites following MPTP administration (Kopin and Markey, 1988), cerebrospinal fluid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of a serotonin metabolite following MDMA exposure (Ricaurte et al., 1986),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and serum esterase concentrations following organophosphate exposure (Levine et al.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1986). The use of muscarinic receptor binding in peripheral plasma lymphocytes has also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been described as a potential biomarker of exposure for the organophosphates (Costa et al.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990). These examples suggest that biomarkers of exposure are available for some agents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but more effort will be required to demonstrate that these biomarkers can routinely be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to improve the exposure assessment process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 5.2.4. Risk Characterization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The final step of the risk assessment process combines the hazard identification, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dose-response assessment, and the exposure assessment to produce the characterization of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk. As previously stated, the current practice is to divide the NOAEL by the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety factor to obtain the RfD. The magnitudes of the safety factors used to determine RfDs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [interspecies extrapolation (10), intraspecies extrapolation (10), and acute vs. chronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure (10) = 1000] are based more on conservative estimates than on actual data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Sheehan et al., 1989; McMillan, 1987) and have been questioned for empirical reasons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Gaylor and Slikker, 1990). Uncertainty factors may be decreased as more data become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available. Modifying factors are also employed under certain circumstances to account for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the completeness of data sets. Along with this RfD numerical value, any uncertainties and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions inherent in the risk assessment should also be stated (OTA, 1990). Although the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RfD provides a single numerical value, it does not provide information concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainty of this number nor does the RfD approach attempt to estimate the potential risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a function of dose or consider the potential risk at the NOAEL. The risk at the NOAEL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally is greater than zero and has been estimated to be as high as about 5 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Crump, 1984; Gaylor, 1989). Concern has been expressed that the application of the RfD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach to all neurotoxicants is unlikely to be biologically defensible in light of mechanistic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data (NRC, 1992). Several other quantitative risk assessment procedures have recently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emerged as alternatives to the RfD approach (Kimmel and Gaylor, 1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quantitative risk assessment may be defined as a data-based process that uses dose-response information and measurements of human exposure to arrive at estimates of risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assumptions are required to extrapolate results from high to low doses, to extrapolate from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animal results to humans, and to extrapolate across different routes and durations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a step toward quantitative risk assessment, Crump (1984) suggested the use of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benchmark dose defined as ``a statistical lower confidence limit corresponding to a small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in effect over the background level.'' The benchmark dose is determined with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mathematical model and is less affected by the particular shape of the dose-response curve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the benchmark approach avoids several problems inherent in the RfD approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., lack of precision in defining the LOAEL; Kimmel, 1990), the same final step of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dividing by arbitrary safety factors is obligatory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another approach to quantitative risk assessment is the statistical or curve-fitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach. If quantal information concerning the proportion of response at a given dose is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available but mechanistic information is lacking, statistical models can be used to fit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population data (Wyzga, 1990). This approach has been used to fit various models to data of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead toxicity. The data were sufficient to allow discrimination of several models in terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goodness of fit; the nerve-conduction velocity data from children exposed to environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead as a function of blood lead concentration fit a ``hockey-stick'' type dose-response curve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than a logistic or quadratic model (Schwartz et al., 1988). These statistical approaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not only provide a method to extrapolate data to lower exposure conditions but also can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide circumstantial evidence to support a proposed mechanism of action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The development of quantitative risk assessment approaches depends, in part, on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of information on the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of the agent in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> question. In the development of a biologically based, dose-response model for MDMA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicity, Slikker and Gaylor (1990) considered several factors, including the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pharmacokinetics of the parent chemical, the target tissue concentrations of the parent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical or its bioactivated proximate toxicant, the uptake kinetics of the parent chemical or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metabolite into the target cell and membrane interactions, and the interaction of the chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or metabolite with presumed receptor site(s). Because these theoretical factors contain a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saturable step due to limited amounts of required enzyme, reuptake, or receptor site(s), a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonlinear, saturable dose-response curve was predicted. In this case of neurochemical effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of MDMA in the rodent, saturation mechanisms were hypothesized and indeed saturation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> curves provided relatively good fits to the experimental results. The conclusion was that use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of dose-response models based on plausible biological mechanisms provide more validity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prediction than purely empirical models. Concomitant with attempts to develop quantitative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk assessment procedures, it is imperative that regulatory policy or risk management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures also be developed to use appropriately the type of data generated by quantitative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk assessment. However, until alternative risk assessment procedures have been validated,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the available RfD approach with its limitations will most likely continue to be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> 5.3. Generic Assumptions and Uncertainty Reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The purpose of risk assessment is to determine the risk associated with human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to a hazard. The quality of the data from toxicological studies differs. In the case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of therapeutic products where human effects information is available, risk assessments rely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily on the result of controlled clinical trials. Even when clinical trial data are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available, however, conducting a risk assessment is complicated by many uncertainties. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the face of these uncertainties, conservative assumptions are usually made at several steps in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the risk assessment process. For example, unless adequate clinical data are available, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most sensitive experimental species is frequently used. While conservative assumptions may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead to a risk assessment that adequately protects the human population, this may result in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased financial burden on the public (e.g., manufacturing costs or loss of jobs); even then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is impossible to be certain that the total population will be protected. Conversely, errors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leading to allowable exposure levels that are too high reduce the safety margin for human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and increase health care costs. Thus, there are compelling public health and economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons to obtain more precise risk assessments; all assumptions cannot be completely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminated, but the degree of uncertainty associated with certain specific assumptions can at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least be reduced (Sheehan et al., 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Letter: Distress of Maxwell pensions episode has given rise to an unexpected and beneficial side effect Sir, Leaving aside the depredations perpetrated by the late Mr Robert Maxwell on his pensioners, his untimely demise has done more to advertise the merits of pension schemes than any less tragic event or advertising campaign might have done. As they say, it's an ill wind. . . Public opinion, like stockmarkets, always overreacts. Understandable, then, are the proposals attributed to MPs and outlined last week ('Pension fund trustees face stiff rules', March 4). These advocated sweeping changes in pension law, that trustees should to be subject to the same strict rules as company directors, the remit of the Occupational Pensions Board should be substantially extended, and more. In the main, these are 'stable door' measures. Frauds with pension funds are rare because in the main the legal system has worked well. Mr Maxwell contrived to control the company, its pension fund, and the in-house investment manager, inhibiting any employee who valued his job from speaking against him. That argues not so much against the system as in favour of ingenuity of the individual. The best way to frustrate another budding Maxwell is to aim in advance at preventing such a specific set of circumstances arising. There is much to be said for pension funds being legally bound to have an independent trustee responsible to the authorities, with powers to act in advance of any suspicious event. Indeed, a prototype already exists in the form of pensioner trustees, a mandatory requirement for controlling directors' own self-administered pension schemes, answerable to the Inland Revenue directly and included in a register maintained by them. For larger pension schemes a similar register of independent trustees could be kept, maintained perhaps by the Occupational Pensions Board to whom the Independent Trustee is made accountable. The OPB could be obliged to freeze the assets of any pension fund immediately, as soon as an independent trustee, suspicious of what is going on, requires them to do so. I suggest this approach is likely to be more effective and infinitely less expensive than the suggestions for increased control currently being promoted by the media (and, we are now told, by parliament), which are likely to be no more effective than Imro apparently was.

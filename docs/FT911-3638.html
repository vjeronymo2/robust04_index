			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Arts: The Barber of Seville - Barcelona Michael Hampe's Cologne production of The Barber of Seville, seen at the Edinburgh Festival in its time and now in the hands of Hampe's colleague Kai Luft, has made its way to the Liceu in Barcelona, where I caught the last performance. The intimate, domestic style might have proved too low-key for this large and splendid theatre were it not for good team-work from a fine cast (alternatives for most of the principals) and notable support from the much improved Liceu orchestra under Paolo Olmi. Olmi's speeds were on the whole fast, riskily so when some of the soloists' runs threatened to turn into slides, but only the final vaudeville, which lost its lilt and sense of happy relaxation, was damagingly quick. A major attraction was the appearance as Rosina of Cecilia Bartoli (sharing the role in Barcelona with Raquel Pierotti), the young mezzo whose recordings have made a great impression. In the theatre the volume is not so great as the records suggest, but the vivid impact, the personality, the rhythmic zest and the burnish on the tone are unmistakable. She recalled Conchita Supervia at Covent Garden before the war - the sound was quite small but every note, inflection, gesture, carried. As a comedienne Bartoli, with her expressive features, supple movements and sure timing, is a treat to watch. William Matteuzzi, Bartoli's partner in a recent Barbiere recording, rightly played Almaviva's first scene (properly handled, one of the most effective and atmospheric openings in any opera) as a young gallant half-asleep in the cold early morning, uncertain of his welcome. Unfortunately the stiffness crept into his first aubade, but the second, the ravishing 'Se il mio nome", was most delicately turned, with decorations in keeping with the sinuous windings of the tune. Matteuzzi is an agile comedian and a good ensemble player. Long-held high notes are on the way back, it seems. With this singer, no regrets. Anthony Michaels-Moore's young, fresh and likable Figaro, his warm, vigorous baritone riding out into the theatre, reached the same high standard - no need, though, to outpace this conductor in 'Largo al factotum'. The Bartolo, Enrico Fissore, was gentle, restrained, almost self-effacing. In the midst of these the ripe and rusty Basilio of Nicolay Ghiaurov, with his imposing Slavonic bigness a potential cuckoo in the nest, was all the more effective for his restraint. He greatly pleased a packed house.</p>

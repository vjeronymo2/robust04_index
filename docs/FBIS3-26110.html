			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Stunned by Western criticism of its proposed law on  eugenics, the Chinese Government is revising the draft  legislation in an attempt to make it less contentious, according  to Beijing sources. The original draft, submitted to the  National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee for  deliberation last December appeared to advocate the forced  sterilisation of mentally and physically disabled people and led  to an outcry of protest from many Western countries.    The criticism came as something of a surprise to the  Ministry  of Public Health, which drafted the legislation, since China had  practised eugenics for the past five years and the new law was  designed simply to codify existing practices. However, the  State Family Planning Commission, which had borne mainly  American criticism of China's one child policy and was more  aware of how the legislation would be received abroad, quickly  voiced its concern over the proposed law, particularly its use  of language such as "inferior births".    A source at the commission said the draft law was seen by  many within the Government as "very contentious" and possibly  damaging to China's international reputation. There was also  concern that it would place additional burdens on the work of  the commission without providing any extra resources, the source  said. All government agencies concerned with the proposed law  are now refusing to discuss the legislation publicly for fear of  creating more controversy, but it is understood the draft is  being reworked into a less contentious form.    Sources said that while the basic aim of the law, to slow  the  rapid increase in the number of children born with disabilities,  remained the same, the language used would be altered and the  proposed regulations watered down so as to appear less  Draconian. The word "eugenics" would not appear anywhere in the  new draft, a source said.    The new draft would make it clear that no one would be  forced  to have an abortion or be sterilised and that the emphasis would  he placed on improving medical and social welfare care. "The  new draft will focus on the positive aspects of the programme  rather than those negative, prohibitive aspects," the source  added.    The law is now unlikely to go before the full session of the  NPC which meets in Beijing on March 10. The legislation is  still considered too controversial to be discussed at the NPC  which attracts national and international media attention. He  pointed out that the last time a controversial law was discussed  at the NPC namely the three Gorges Dam project, the voting  session ended in chaos with a deputy from Taiwan storming out.  It was more likely that the Government would wait for a smaller  standing committee meeting of the NPC before putting the  legislation to the vote, he said.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USE OF ADC LAWYERS IN COURTROOMS  </P> <P> It is clear from the editorial that the author's opinion of the Alternate  Defense Counsel was based upon misinformation.  </P> <P> For the past six years the attorneys of the Alternate Defense Counsel (created  by Los Angeles County after approximately seven years of planning) have  provided consistent, quality legal representation to indigent defendants at a  substantial savings to Los Angeles County taxpayers. ADC has always had a  year-to-year contract that must be renewed each year by the county after  careful scrutiny of the quality of legal representation and cost effectiveness.  </P> <P> As a result, ADC has consistently saved Los Angeles County substantial sums of  money. The first two years (1983 and 1984), ADC provided legal services in Van  Nuys and San Fernando courts and saved taxpayers approximately $2 million each  year. ADC was then expanded to the Westside and downtown, and saved Los Angeles  County taxpayers approximately $5 million per year.  </P> <P> The many trial judges that The Times claim privately express reservations about  the quality of legal representation by ADC obviously have never worked with our  lawyers, or are those few judges who desire to continue to use the "old-boy"  system of appointment of attorneys regardless of the cost to taxpayers.  </P> <P> RICHARD CARL HERZOG  </P> <P> Attorney  </P> <P> Alternate Defense Counsel  </P></p>

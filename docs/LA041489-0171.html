			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> FOUNTAIN VALLEY BUSINESSMAN SENTENCED TO 79 YEARS FOR RAPES  </P> <P> A Fountain Valley businessman today was sentenced to 79 years in prison for  raping three women and attacking two others -- one of the harshest prison  sentences ever handed down in a sexual assault case in Orange County.  </P> <P> Thomas Panichas, 32, who told jurors at his trial that he was just "a  good-looking guy" to whom women were easily attracted, steadfastly denied all  the charges in interviews from the Orange County Jail following his conviction.  </P> <P> But in court today, Panichas told Superior Court Judge David H. Brickner that  while he had thought each woman had consented, "I may have misread their  actions."  </P> <P> But Brickner told Panichas that he was a man "with delusions of grandeur" who  thought he could talk his way out of any situation.  </P> <P> "One only shudders to think how many others (victims)) are out there," the  judge told him.  </P> <P> Panichas was sentenced on 19 counts of rape and sexual assault in incidents  from 1985 to 1986. He had been investigated, but never arrested, after four of  the incidents had been reported. Deputy Dist. Atty. Marv Stern said that each  time it had been difficult to make a case against Panichas.  </P> <P> But he was finally arrested after a Las Vegas woman claimed he raped her when  he interviewed her for a job with his cellular telephone business.  </P></p>

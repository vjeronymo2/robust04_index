			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS / ALLAN SLOAN: CBS CHIEF MADE A BIG SACRIFICE FOR OTHERS  </P> <P> Remember the famous Sherlock Holmes story, "Silver Blaze," in which the key to  the mystery was the dog that didn't bark? Well, think of this as the story of  the $130-million tax break that Laurence A. Tisch didn't take.  </P> <P> Tisch, the tough, shrewd and frugal chairman of Loews Corp., the  tobacco-television-insurance conglomerate, didn't become a billionaire by  leaving money on the table. Certainly not amounts like $130 million. Tisch  giving up a tax break of this size seems to be a violation of the natural order  -- as if the sun rose in the west or a sucker got an even break.  </P> <P> Yet the CBS stock buyback, announced last week, will someday cost Loews a huge  tax payment that it could have avoided had CBS paid out $2 billion of dividends  to its holders rather than buying back $2 billion of stock. Because Tisch is  CBS' chairman and because Loews is by far CBS' biggest stockholder, you have to  think that if Tisch made a fuss, CBS would have gone the dividend route.  </P> <P> So why didn't he? No one involved in the deal wanted to discuss this with me.  The reason, as best I can tell, is that while paying a dividend would have cost  Loews less in taxes, it would have cost other CBS stockholders more. And that  Tisch took seriously his obligation to maximize income for CBS holders, toward  whom he has a fiduciary duty.  </P> <P> CBS is buying 44% of its stock from its holders at $190 a share, an  above-market price. Because Loews owns about a quarter of CBS' stock, it will  get about a quarter of the total payout. Let's call it $500 million. For  reasons complicated beyond belief, tax law allows Loews to treat the $500  million as a dividend. And any corporation getting dividend income receives a  huge tax break: 80% of the dividend is excluded from tax.  </P> <P> Let's say that instead of buying back 44% of its shares for $190 each, CBS had  paid an $83-a-share dividend -- which amounts to the same thing. That would be  quicker, simpler and cheaper than the buyback plan, which is a logistical mess.  </P> <P> Loews would get about $500 million of dividend income this way too. But because  CBS is doing a buyback, the tax laws require Loews to reduce the value of its  remaining CBS stock for tax purposes by $400 million. Had CBS paid a dividend  instead, Loews could have avoided the $400-million reduction. The reasons for  this disparity are mind-bogglingly complicated. You don't want to know about  them.  </P> <P> What all this means is that when Loews sells the CBS shares that it will keep  after the buyback, it will pay taxes on $400 million of income that it could  have sheltered. At today's 34% federal corporate tax rate, the tab would be  $136 million.  </P> <P> "There is no question that Loews knew about this and could have reaped the  benefit," says Lehman Bros. tax genius Robert Willens, whom I consulted. And,  Willens added: "Loews is obviously sacrificing a clear benefit for the common  good of other CBS stockholders."  </P> <P> Consider, if you will, what would have happened to the estate of the late  William S. Paley, the longtime CBS chairman. Paley, who died Oct. 26, took  advantage of the only fail-safe tax loophole: death. Your heirs get to value  the stock in your estate at what it sells for on the day you die. No income tax  is due, ever, on the difference between that price and the price you paid for  the stock. In Paley's case, that's big dough: His 1.3 million shares cost him  around $5 each but were worth $164 when he died.  </P> <P> Assuming that CBS buys 44% of the estate's stock at $190 a share, the estate  will raise $109 million and will pay a $6-million income tax bill, by my math.  If CBS had paid an $83-a-share dividend, the estate's tax bill would have been  $43 million.  </P> <P> Any other tax-paying CBS stockholder would be in the same situation, only with  fewer dollars at stake. So Tisch is giving up a potential $136 million tax  saving for Loews to save money for other CBS stockholders.  </P> <P> Contrast this with the special deal that MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman got when  he sold the company to Matsushita Industrial Electric Co. Other holders get $66  a share of cash and have to pay a tax bill. Wasserman gets $327 million of  Matsushita preferred stock in lieu of cash and owes no tax until the preferred  is sold. Which surely won't be while Wasserman, 78, is among us. The reason, of  course, is the death loophole. When Wasserman shuffles off this mortal coil,  his heirs will be able to value the stock at $327 million for tax purposes and  sell it back to Matsushita. The tax saving: $113 million of federal and  California income tax, by my math.  </P> <P> MCA said Wasserman wouldn't talk to me. But in an Associated Press story last  month, he was quoted as saying, "Well, is that against the law?" No, but it  would have been nice to offer the same deal to other MCA holders who wanted it.  </P> <P> You can argue that I'm being too nice to Tisch, who has dismembered CBS, and  too nasty to Wasserman, who built MCA. That's a whole other subject. But  there's no question that, when it came to treating his shareholders fairly,  Tisch bent over backward. And that Wasserman should have too.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed JCS: "Police Scandal Discredits Two </F> Netherlands Ministers"; as released by The Hague ANP Database]    [Text] The Hague, 24 Mar (ANP) -- Netherlands Justice  Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin (CDA) [Christian Democrat Appeal]  and Foreign Minister Ed Van Thijn (PVDA) [Labor Party] have been  discredited by an Amsterdam police scandal. Opposition parties  claim that neither minister remains completely untainted by the  scandal surrounding the disbanding of the IRT [Interregional  Investigation Team] criminal investigation unit.    The IRT, which operated in the provinces of North Holland  and  Utrecht between 1987 and the end of last year, was unfairly  disbanded according to a report made public on Thursday [24  March]. According to the Netherlands national investigation  unit, it was incorrect to claim that the special police unit was  shut down owing to its "controversial methods," as Hirsch, on  advice from the public prosecutor and the Amsterdam police, had  reported to Parliament in January.    In its report, the national investigation unit described the  actions of the team as "well-considered, careful, and  responsible." The national investigation unit believes the real  reasons for disbanding the team to be the result of jealousy:  The heads of the Amsterdam criminal investigation unit wanted  to do away with the IRT as it could not accept its independence.    Van Thijn, former mayor of Amsterdam, does not want to  accept  any resignations of senior members of the public prosecutor's  office or the Amsterdam police. Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers is  of the same opinion.    The liberal opposition parties, the VVD [People's Party for  Freedom and Democracy] and D66 [Democrats 66], together with the  Ecologist Left opposition, are demanding a full explanation of  this police affair. "Seldom has the belief in the ability to  successfully combat organized crime suffered such a blow,"  stated D66 spokesman Kohnstamm.</p>

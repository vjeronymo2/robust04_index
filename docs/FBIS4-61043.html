			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Kokoshin, Russian Federation first deputy </F> defense minister, under the "Russian Weapons" rubric:  "Country's Security Cannot Be Ensured without Strong Defense  Industry"]    [Text] The existence of modern, powerful armed forces is  impossible without a strong defense industry, design bureaus,  scientific collectives, and stable cooperation in the  development and production of arms. That is axiomatic.    In turn defense production facilities can be effective under  present conditions if they are part of powerful diversified  industrial companies and financial and industrial groups --  efficient components of the market economy.    Today the defense industry and science complex is living  through exceptionally complex times. In the past few years it  has undergone substantial changes. On average at enterprises of  Russia's former defense complex the volume of defense production  is 20 percent of the total production volume. Despite all  efforts, the optimum path for the development of defense science  and technology and defense production facilities under the  conditions of the changes taking place in our country has still  not been elaborated. Although many outlines of this path have  already become clearer. Collective intelligence is needed for  its elaboration, as is the comprehensive examination not only of  the military, economic, and technological aspects but also of  the social and legal aspects of this problem.    The new supplement in KRASNAYA ZVEZDA can ensure such  collective thinking. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already done quite a  lot to cover these problems under present conditions but I am  sure that it can do even more.    Today a particularly strict, self-critical, extremely  attentive and scrupulous examination of the problems of  providing arms for the army and navy is needed. I think that  with this sober, analytical approach constantly illumined with a  high sense of concern for Russia's supreme interests and for our  fatherland's defense capability, our newspaper's new supplement  will be an important step forward in preserving and augmenting  Russia's defense industry potential in its optimum dimensions  for the state and the army.    I very much hope that the newspaper will inter alia help  reveal and educate new leaders of our defense industry and  science. And for that, however paradoxical it may seem, you  often have to look into the past and extract from it as much as  you can in the way of lessons for the present and future.</p>

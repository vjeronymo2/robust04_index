			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> FESTIVAL ORGANIZERS SCHEDULE FORUM  </P> <P> Organizers of the Ojai Festival, eager to mend fences with their neighbors  after years of uneasy coexistence, have scheduled a public forum for Oct. 16.  </P> <P> Joan Kemper, president of the annual festival's board of directors, said the  meeting will be held to solicit comments from Ojai-area residents and  merchants.  </P> <P> In recent years, local critics have complained that the three-day summer event  concentrates on music that appeals to only a few listeners, largely overlooks  the surrounding community and caters almost exclusively to out-of-town  visitors. Festival officials face an unprecedented deficit of nearly $100,000  after this summer's event.  </P> <P> The forum is scheduled for 7:30 a.m. in the Ojai Playhouse. Christopher Hunt,  recently hired as consulting director of the festival, is expected to lead the  discussion. CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS  </P></p>

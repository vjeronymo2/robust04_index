			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> STILL THE OLD SYSTEM  </P> <P> Considering the obstacles, the state of black business is fine. Opportunities  are limited because the old system -- a system that usually denies blacks  access to capital and contracts -- is still in place.  </P> <P> Access to capital affords you an opportunity to grow.  </P> <P> Many of the major banks and (financial institutions) have hired more blacks  over the last few years, but they haven't been placed in positions that give  them full lending authority.  </P> <P> Major corporations also have more black employees. However, corporations don't  have many blacks in the contracting and purchasing departments -- and that's  where the hard decisions of selecting vendors and suppliers are made. A chief  executive officer might try to sensitize his people at the lower end to the  policies of affirmative action. However, the people (in purchasing departments)  will resist those efforts. Until you change the corporate culture and until you  change the structure of power at the bottom, there will be always be deterrents  to access to mainstream business.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DANIELS LEARNS TO LIVE WITH CREEPY CO-STARS IN 'ARACHNOPHOBIA' ROLE  </P> <P> The way Jeff Daniels tells it, his first reaction to the proposal of a film  called "Arachnophobia" was negative.  </P> <P> "My agent called and said, 'Well, it's about spiders,' " Daniels recalls.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Oh great! "The Attack of the Killer Spiders." Great!  </P> <P> Terrific! I'll pass.' "  </P> <P> When the agent explained that co-producers Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy and  Steven Spielberg were involved in the project, Daniels agreed to read the  script. And liked it. His verdict: "If anybody can do this in a first-class  way, those guys can."  </P> <P> After years of directing second unit on Spielberg films, Frank Marshall made  his debut as director with "Arachnophobia." Besides the human actors --  Daniels, John Goodman, Julian Sands and Harley Jane Kozak -- Marshall directed  hundreds of spiders that invade a small California town.  </P> <P> "I don't mind the little guys," Daniels said. "I'm pretty much a manly man when  it comes to that sort of thing. But the big boys, nine inches across with the  legs spread out, . . . spit at you."  </P> <P> "They had a 'spider orientation' on the second day of shooting. We were all  supposed to go and basically learn how to become friends with the spiders and  have them crawl on you as pets. I blew that off. If we're supposed to be afraid  of spiders, let's be afraid of spiders.  </P> <P> "If there's any opportunity at all to eliminate acting I'm all for it. In the  second half of this movie, there's not a lot of acting going on. It's personal  terror."  </P></p>

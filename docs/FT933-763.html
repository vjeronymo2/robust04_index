			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Vietnam clears path for IMF deal VIETNAM yesterday jumped its final hurdle before being reinstated into the international financial community when donor nations completed negotiations for clearing up the country's Dollars 140m (Pounds 91m) arrears to the International Monetary fund. Nine governments led by France and Japan agreed to provide Dollars 55m in grants to wipe out part of the arrears. A group of banks led by the Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieure and the Japanese Eximbank will then provide a syndicated bridging loan of Dollars 85m. Once Vietnam is back in good standing, the IMF board is expected to agree next Wednesday to an Dollars 85m credit under its standby arrangements, which will repay the bridge loan. The arrangements will also pave the way for Vietnam to receive financing from the World Bank. Mr Christian Noyer, director of the French Treasury and co-chairman of yesterday's meetings in Washington, said Vietnam would also qualify for a Dollars 20m drawing under the IMF's new Systemic Transformation Facility, a special loan fund set up to help centrally planned economies such as Russia make the shift to a market economy. A similar meeting is planned for today which could arrange for Cambodia to erase its Dollars 55m arrears to the IMF. Donor countries are expected to meet in Paris on November 9-10 to work out aid to help finance Vietnam's balance of payments shortfall over the next two years. Mr Noyer said the Paris Club of creditor nations would probably also meet in November to discuss rescheduling Vietnam's official debt.</p>

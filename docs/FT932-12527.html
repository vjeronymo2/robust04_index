			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Limit on business rate rise gives Pounds 350m 'boost' MR ROBIN SQUIRE, junior environment minister, told the Commons last night that business would receive a Pounds 350m boost in the current financial year as a result of uniform business rate increases being limited to 3.6 per cent. The non-domestic rating bill, which for the second successive year freezes business rates in real terms, was given a general welcome and an unopposed second reading. Mr John Redwood, minister for local government, said that about 250,000 shops and offices - mainly in the south of England - would benefit from the bill to the tune of more than Pounds 190m. About 85,000 factories and warehouses - mainly in the north - would also benefit from reductions worth more than Pounds 30m. Mr Redwood explained that a further 165,000 properties would gain relief worth Pounds 120m, while businesses in Wales would save about Pounds 9m. The total cost was estimated to be Pounds 350m in 1993-94 and Pounds 225m in the following year. Comparable reductions in Scotland would be introduced by regulations. Mr Redwood disclosed that more than 525,000 of the 633,000 appeals made against the 1990 revaluation had been settled. Valuation tribunals were on target to clear the remainder by the end of the current financial year. Looking forward to the new revaluation based on property values on April 1 this year and due to take effect in 1995, he said rental values in depressed sectors were likely to be 'significantly lower'. Mr Redwood told the House that if this proved to be the case rateable values would fall and some businesses still benefiting from transitional relief next year might never have to face the full rate liabilities implied by the 1990 valuations. Mr Doug Henderson, chief Labour spokesman in the debate, urged the government to take account of the views expressed by some in the business community that there would be advantages in restoring to local councils some say in determining business rates.</p>

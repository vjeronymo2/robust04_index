			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI bucks end of grey trade US BUYING gave a lift to ICI although liquidity was cut back after the Stock Exchange stamped on the recently introduced 'grey' market in the shares of the soon to be demerged company. There were suggestions that complaints might have been lodged by other leading securities houses. Salomon Brothers which had been making an unofficial market in ICI 'new' shares and in Zeneca, the bioscience arm, bowed to Exchange pressure yesterday and pulled out, at least until May 12 when the anticipated Pounds 1.3bn rights issue will be priced. The final grey-market price for Zeneca was 690p and for ICI ex the demerger was 590p. All trades done since Salomon opened the market on Tuesday will be honoured. The underlying shares, which shot up on Thursday following higher than expected first-quarter results, added a further 11 to close at 1289p, their highest level since June last year. However, one cynical analysts argued: 'The chickens are going to come home to roost after the demerger.'</p>

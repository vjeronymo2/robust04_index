			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Environmental promotion planned for jute A FOUR-day international consultation on jute and the environment will be held in the Hague from October 26 to promote the market for environment-friendly jute products. The consultation is being organised by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation with financial support from the European Community and the Rockefeller Foundation. According to an official of the Indian Jute Mills Association, the three main objectives of the consultation will be to encourage research and development in the production and marketing of environment-friendly jute products; establish closer links between the jute research laboratories and the markets; and develop marketing strategies to create an awareness of and demand for jute products. The jute goods producing countries like India, Bangladesh, China and Thailand, which believe the decline in jute demand can be arrested by projecting the environmental attributes of the natural fibre, are attaching great importance to the consultation. While jute scores over the synthetic substitutes because of its biodegradability, doubts arise about its carcinogenic attributes when the fibre is softened with petroleum products. According to the IJMA official, the problem has now been overcome with non-edible castor oil replacing petroleum as the softening agent. Following this development, the hazelnut producers in Turkey have started using hydrocarbon-free jute bags on a large scale and the Indian industry thinks that it should now be possible to convince the coffee and cocoa producers to use jute as the packaging material. The FAO meeting will try to identify marketing opportunities for jute products by taking into account 'the experience of selected exporting and importing countries', said the official. The producing countries acknowledge that they will have to bring about 'modifications in jute and kenaf products' to conform to the environment and health policies of the developed countries. Producers hope to get assistance from international agencies for environment related research and development and technological improvements.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN;  </P> <P> MEDIA: THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF CBS TELEVISION STATIONS VIEWS THE NETWORK'S  LATEST SHUFFLING WITH A CONTENTED EYE FROM THE HELM OF CHANNEL 39 IN SAN DIEGO.  </P> <P> For 24 years, Neil Derrough had a front-row seat to the well-documented  corporate turmoil that gripped CBS, once known as the "Tiffany of the  networks."  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, when Eric Ober was named president of CBS News, Derrough, now  the general manager of KNSD-TV (Channel 39), greeted the news with a certain  amount of resignation, a sense that he had seen it all before.  </P> <P> Just for a second, he also must have flashed on his own career, and how close  he came to rising to the top of television's most prestigious organization.  </P> <P> A few years ago, Ober worked for Derrough, who served as president of CBS  Television Stations for six years until he left the network in 1986. It was his  duty to oversee the operations of the five TV stations CBS owned throughout the  country.  </P> <P> "In a large corporation, you spend a certain amount of time, and you make a run  for it," Derrough said over lunch a few days after Ober was named to head CBS  News. "Was there a point where I might have liked to be Group Broadcast  president? Yeah. But the cards didn't fall that way."  </P> <P> Timing is everything, and the 52-year-old Derrough has no regrets.  </P> <P> "CBS had become a different place," he said.  </P> <P> Channel 39 offers Derrough plenty of challenges. When he took over, it was  perennially the third-rated news operation in the city. In his two-year tenure,  he has changed the station's call letters and given it a new identity. After  little movement, the station's ratings have slowly started to move forward.  </P> <P> Now that he has a 3-year-old daughter by his wife of nine years -- Sharon  Lovejoy, a former CBS correspondent -- Derrough's priorities have changed since  his days at the network. He talks about the satisfaction of operating a TV  station and the disappointment of not spending more time with his now  25-year-old daughter from his first marriage, a marriage that dissolved during  his CBS tenure.  </P> <P> "My life objective is much different today," he said.  </P> <P> Living and working in San Diego -- far from "Black Rock," the CBS corporate  headquarters in New York -- has allowed him "to focus on what matters," he  said.  </P> <P> "Family and friends made a difference; it wasn't all the deals I made," he  said, referring to then and now.  </P> <P> It's hard, though, for Derrough not to have fond memories of CBS.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a heyday, it was an era. It had been the dominant TV influence. . .  . It was like tampering with the crown jewel of the medium."  </P> <P> As for the new president of CBS News, Derrough said Ober is the "right guy at  the right time." The news people will "accept him," and he "knows what the job  is," in the sense that he has been involved at every level of the network for  several years.  </P> <P> Most important, Derrough said, "he's a businessman. He's been accountable."  </P> <P> Ober is charged with boosting CBS' lackluster ratings, stabilizing management  and returning some past glory.  </P> <P> According to published reports, Ober got the news job because he was a CBS  insider, a contrast to the outsider image of his predecessor -- David Burke, a  former ABC News executive. Critics said Burke was unable to deal with the  intricacies of CBS management, either on financial or personal levels. For 24  years, Derrough was the consummate CBS insider, groomed within the  organization, a veteran of the tradition and corporate struggles that shaped  the company.  </P> <P> Derrough started in 1962 in the sales departments of CBS Radio stations in  Detroit and Boston. In 1967, he took over as general manager of KCBS Radio in  San Francisco. While most of his contemporaries were in television "selling  (commercial) spots in Los Angeles," he was running the first all-news CBS radio  station on the West Coast.  </P> <P> "Radio was in a changing period," Derrough said. "Radio was essentially  forgotten. All the bright, young, attractive people were running as hard as  they could to TV."  </P> <P> But with videotape, advanced satellite technology and CNN still years away,  radio was still the medium with instant news and immediacy. The late '60s and  early '70s were an exciting time in history, and news radio flourished.  </P> <P> In 1971, Derrough took the job of general manager of WCBS Radio in New York,  the CBS Radio flagship, which was finding success with an all-news format.  </P> <P> "News radio has a lot to do with developing the appetite for news, letting  people know that there was an audience for news," Derrough said.  </P> <P> In the late '60s and early '70s, Derrough and most CBS employees had little  doubt who was the guiding hand of CBS: William S. Paley, the founder of CBS.  Although Paley turned 70 in 1971, he personally interviewed Derrough for the  WCBS job, and was still actively involved in all aspects of the organization,  meeting with top officers three to four times a years, Derrough said.  </P> <P> In 1974, Derrough moved into television, taking the general manager post of the  CBS-owned and -operated WBBM in Chicago.  </P> <P> "Derrough . . . was at WBBM to bring order to the place," Peter Boyer wrote in  his book "Who Killed CBS?" "The ratings and attention WBBM were getting were  nice, but it was too maverick. The carte blanche was gone."  </P> <P> One of Derrough's first acts was to take Van Gordon Sauter off the air. Often  described as something of a Hemingway-esque character in both style and  appearance, Sauter would later preside over CBS News during the early 1980s,  its most tumultuous time, eventually rising into the CBS corporate structure  before being forced out in 1986 in yet another shake-up.  </P> <P> "We called him into the office and told him we were going to take him off the  air for Bill Kurtis," Derrough recalled. "He looked at us, pushed his chair  back, and said, 'I don't know about you, but I'm going to go out and get  drunk.' "  </P> <P> A few years later, Sauter would become Derrough's boss and, ironically, an ally  in the corporate infighting that gripped CBS.  </P> <P> Derrough says the CBS of lore began to come apart in 1978, soon after he had  taken over WCBS-TV in New York. In Derrough's eyes, the problems started when  the decision was made to add another level of management to each division of  CBS -- sports, news and entertainment -- creating, in effect, independent  fiefdoms.  </P> <P> Until that point, "the network was run like a TV station," Derrough said. "One  guy had run all of it, and each department reported to one guy."  </P> <P> And, in Derrough's opinion, it ran well enough. In the new system, each  division was looking out for its own success, not that of the company, he said.  </P> <P> In 1981, when Derrough was named president of the CBS Television Stations, the  highest post on his side of the corporate ladder, CBS was still riding high,  with Walter Cronkite in his last days and the network programming doing well in  the ratings.  </P> <P> When CBS network programming started to slip in the ratings, and video and  cable started to further cut into the share of the network's audience, CBS  became the focus of a fierce and well-documented corporate battle. Ted Turner  talked of a hostile takeover. Newspaper articles said Sen. Jesse Helms wanted  conservatives to buy it. Meanwhile, Paley was in his 80s, and the company was  taking on a new look.  </P> <P> The mid-1980s became the era of massive budget cuts throughout the  organization, most publicly in the news department.  </P> <P> CBS News, the "house that Murrow built," had always operated aloof from  corporate pressures. To many, CBS News represented the heart of CBS, its  corporate identity. It didn't matter how many millions it lost.  </P> <P> In a sense, Derrough says, the company definitely needed to be trimmed,  especially the news department. The loss of dozens of employees and a tighter  budget, he said, have not drastically hampered the operations of CBS News.  </P> <P> "I've seen no evidence of it having a dramatic bearing on how they cover the  news," Derrough said.  </P> <P> But he does object to the manner in which cuts were implemented, particularly  calls for mandatory staff cuts, regardless of the division's efficiency.  </P> <P> Because the TV stations generally operated as money-makers, Derrough for many  years worked outside the fray. But, as the company looked for every dollar, the  stations were increasingly pulled into the discussion and given the same  cost-cutting mandates as the other divisions.  </P> <P> The pressures mounted at every level of the company, Derrough said. He recalls  it as an "unpleasant" place to work.  </P> <P> "It was like a palace revolt. Nobody knew who was going to stay, and who was  going to be crowned.  </P> <P> "It ended up at a point . . . I had reached a point where I had to leave," he  said.  </P> <P> Derrough said the end came when he was asked to fire Frank Gardner, the general  manager of KCBS-TV (Channel 2) in Los Angeles. Three weeks earlier, Channel 2  had debuted an experimental news format called "the wheel," which featured  20-minute looks at one subject, such as health or fitness. Critics ripped it.  </P> <P> "When I refused to (fire Gardner), they said, 'Well, it sounds like you're  resigning,' " Derrough said.  </P> <P> After taking time off, Derrough went to work for Gillett Communications, first  running a station in San Luis Obispo and then taking over Gillett's San Diego  operation in 1988.  </P> <P> KNSD may be far away from New York, but controlling a TV station was always an  optional goal of his career if things didn't work out at CBS, Derrough said. He  may miss the chauffeur and the intensity of network life, but he likes the  control his current job affords him, the ability to bring change and to  interact with the community.  </P> <P> "Running a TV station in a major market is one of the best jobs in the  business," he said.  </P></p>

During his meetings he has been acquainted with the draft  law  on citizenship, which has already passed its first reading. The  draft envisages that, depending on the demographic and economic  situation, the [Latvian] Government will decide how many people  are granted citizenship every year.    In the opinion of the CSCE commissioner, prospects for many  citizens will remain vague. He suggests that one should be  guided by the number of years people have lived in Latvia.    However, according to Saeima Chairman Anatolijs Gorbunovs,  this approach will lead to a "large wave of naturalization."  The parliament head said a repatriation program is needed,  which would encourage people to leave voluntarily. In his  opinion, the CSCE structures could demonstrate initiative by  drawing up such a program.    During his visit Max van der Stoel was told that non-Latvian  citizens intend setting up an association to protect the  interests of more than 700,000 people. Representatives of the  initiative group handed him a list of laws which restrict the  rights of citizens with no citizenship, who amount to one-third  of the population. They are deprived of the opportunity to work  as lawyers and judges, to own land, to freely choose their place  of residence in Latvia, and to go to some European countries  without a visa. The bill on the elections to local authorities,  which has passed two readings, does not allow them to elect and  be elected. Sergejs Dimanis, leader of the "Equality"  [Ravnopraviye] movement, commented on the bill in detail.    The Latvian Foreign Ministry press service reports that at  the meeting with the head of the Foreign Political Department,  the CSCE commissioner said he "can see no violations of human  rights in Latvia."</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, March 14 (UNI [United News of India]):  The Supreme Court has expressed the view that any party or  organisation fighting elections on a plank with proximate effect  of eroding the Constitution's secular philosophy would be guilty  of following an unconstitutional action.    In their separate judgment while disposing of the appeals  filed by various parties in connection with the dismissal of  State governments and dissolution of Assemblies last week, Mr.  Justice S.C. Agrawal and Mr. Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy said a  religious or cultural body did not aim at acquiring State power  unlike a political party which is formed to capture or share  State power. They might be associations of individuals, but  their functional relevance--acquiring State power--could not be  ignored.    They said political parties were an integral to the  governance of a democratic society. If the Constitution required  the State to be secular, the same requirement was attached to  political parties. The Constitution did not permit mixing  religion and State power which must be kept apart.    They said religion was an impermissible element in the body  politic and an imbalance in the constitutional system. If a  party espousing a particular religion came to power, that  religion tended to become the official religion and all other  religions would come to acquire a secondary status or enjoy a  less favourable position which would be antithetical to Articles  14 to 16, 25 and other provisions of the Constitution.    The judges said if a party, by word of mouth, print or in  other manner created the impression of its being a political and  a religious party it would be guilty of unconstitutionality and  have no right to function as a political party. The fact that a  party might be entitled to go to the people seeking a mandate  for a drastic amendment of the Constitution or by its  replacement by another was wholly irrelevant in the context.    "We do not know how the Constitution can be amended so as to  remove secularism from the basic structure of the Constitution  (as defined in the Keshavananda Bharti case)," they said. "Nor  do we know how the present Constitution can be replaced by  another.... It does not provide for its own demise."    The judges alluded to the provisions of the Representation  of  People Act (RPA) and said even a single instance of the use of  religious symbols or an appeal to the electorate to vote on the  basis of religion, race, caste or community was enough to  vitiate the election of a candidate. The Act also provided for  parties to affirm their faith and allegiance to the principles  of socialism, secularism and democracy.    Mr. Justice K. Raniaswaniy, in his judgement, observed that  the rise of fundamentalism and communalisation of politics was  anti-secular and encouraged separatist and divisive forces which  became breeding grounds for national disintegration.    He said it was the duty of the court to interpret the  Constitution to bring political parties within the purview of  constitutional parameters for accountability.</p>

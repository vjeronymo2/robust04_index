			<p>Language: <F P=105>Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Yu. Mekekechko, A. V. Kovalenko, I. M. </F> Chernenko, V. F. Katkov]    [Abstract]The study shows that a planar ZnSe/GaAs structure  fulfills all the main requirements for semiconductor chemical  sensors. Moreover, it is also possible to use this material as a  gas detector. The fact that the stoichiometry is controllable  when the layer structure is synthesized and the lack of defects  in the crystal package reduce the effect of chemical activity of  the working medium. In the broad range of partial hydrogen  pressures, the ZnSe layer is characterized by a relative change  in resistance of 5-50% with little sluggishness, fast  recovery  and a good reproducibility rate for the results. 2 figures, 5  references</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Canfor in all-share offer for forestry rival The rationalisation of Canada's forestry industry is poised to take a big step forward with an all-share bid by Vancouver's Canfor for Slocan Forest Products, also based in British Columbia. Canfor's offer values Slocan at about CDollars 715m (USDollars 518m), or CDollars 18 a share, which is one-third higher than Slocan's closing price on the Toronto stock exchange last Friday. Canfor is Canada's biggest lumber company and second biggest pulp producer. Its flagship is the Howe Sound pulp and newsprint mill north of Vancouver, a joint venture with New Oji Paper of Japan. Slocan's business centres on lumber and it has cutting rights to 3.7m cubic metres of timber a year. Its shareholders would be offered 0.935 Canfor shares for each Slocan share. The offer is subject to a minimum acceptance of 75 per cent. Slocan had not responded to the unsolicited offer by midday yesterday. Its shares are widely held, with its chairman and chief executive, Mr Irving Barber, holding a 9.5 per cent stake. Canfor said the combination would increase its wood and fibre self-sufficiency, strengthen its marketing clout and offer a better balance between solid wood products, pulp and newsprint. The combined company would have posted sales of CDollars 1.6bn in the first nine months of this year, with cash flow of CDollars 183m. The forestry industry's fortunes have improved in the past year, on the heels of unexpectedly sharp rises in pulp and paper prices. Canfor earned CDollars 28.7m in the third quarter, compared with a CDollars 7.9m loss a year earlier. Slocan's profit has surged to CDollars 25.5m from CDollars 10.1m. However, many companies have been weakened by the protracted recession of the early 1990s and by heavy investments in anti-pollution equipment and other modernisation projects. The Canadian industry has been especially slow to modernise, leading to predictions of an extensive shake-up as companies seek to maintain their competitive edge. In one of the biggest deals to date, Slocan joined forces a year ago with Donohue, a Quebec-based producer, to buy Finlay Forest Products, a troubled lumber and newsprint producer.</p>

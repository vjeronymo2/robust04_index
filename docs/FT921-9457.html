			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Nadir committed for trial on Pounds 100m fraud charges MR ASIL NADIR, the former chairman and chief executive of Polly Peck International, the fruit and electronics group, was yesterday committed for trial at the Old Bailey, some 14 months after his arrest at Heathrow Airport in December 1990. Mr Nadir faces 66 charges of theft and three of false accounting brought by the Serious Fraud Office for amounts totalling Pounds 100m. A second defendant, Mr John Turner, the former Polly Peck group chief accountant, is charged on 10 counts of false accounting, totalling Pounds 7.4m. The case now goes to the Old Bailey, but it is not expected to open before the start of 1993. Mr Nadir's bail conditions were slightly eased yesterday. Sir David Hopkin, the chief metropolitan magistrate, maintained a requirement for Mr Nadir to report to Savile Row police station each week, but lifted a year-old ban on Mr Nadir contacting a list of persons from whom statements have been taken but who are not now expected to be prosecution witnesses. Pannone March Pearson, Mr Nadir's solicitors, said there was still no evidence to refute the findings of defence accountants supplied to the SFO many months ago. 'The Polly Peck companies continue to trade successfully and we shall press for the earliest possible hearing date,' the statement said.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles), a patient at the Betty Ford Center where he  is undergoing treatment for alcoholism, is organizing a $1,000-per-plate  political fund-raising dinner that will avoid all alcoholic beverages. Greene,  who checked himself into the Rancho Mirage hospital last month, issued the  invitation in a letter to Sacramento lobbyists. Indicating that he is close to  completing the treatment program and plans to attend the fund-raiser at a  Manhattan Beach hotel on Sept. 22, the veteran lawmaker told the lobbyists,  "There will be plenty of liquids of all types, but there will be no alcohol  served with dinner." A predinner reception, however, "will be open to anyone's  preference," he said. "As a footnote, I am going to use a portion of the funds  from this dinner to establish a recovery program in my Senate district, where  it is sorely needed and so much can be accomplished through such a program."  </P></p>

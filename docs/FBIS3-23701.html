Savinskiy, Council of Veterans of Baykonur  Cosmodrome; "Space Mementos Under the Hammer"]    [Text] The veterans of the Baykonur cosmodromes were  shocked by the news of the sale of mementos of our cosmonautics  at the Sotheby's auction in London. The fact that today  cosmonautics is in decline and Baykonur for the time being is in  a deep crisis are not reasons for consigning our space  achievements to oblivion. The auction which was held caused us a  feeling of bitterness and bewilderment. And gave rise to many  questions.    How could such a thing happen? Who gave permission for  selling the national heritage of Russia? It is said that most of  the 200 space rarities belonged to private parties. Is this so?  But is the spacesuit of A. Leonov his own personal property? And  the notebooks kept by S. Korolev and the manuscripts of K.  Tsiolkovskiy? Whose are they? Neither Korolev nor Tsiolkovskiy  can any longer exert control over them. Who then put them up for  sale?    At the auction Aleksey Leonov declared that the "history of  Soviet cosmonautics should belong not only to the Russian  people, but also to all world civilization." Yes, this is so.  But is it necessary to sell our space mementos for this purpose?  Was it not the pursuit of ready cash which darkened the  reasoning of some Russian auction participants?    Throughout the world norms have been adopted with respect to  the monuments of literature, history, science and technology.  These norms also exist in Russia. For example, a project is  underway for the facsimile publication of Pushkin's rough  notebooks. This will make it possible not only to preserve for  centuries a national treasure of Russia, but also will broaden  the numbers of researchers concerned with research on the  creativity of the great poet. Was it not possible to act in the  same way with the manuscripts of Tsiolkovskiy, the diaries of  Korolev, Mishin and Feoktistov? It also is possible to exhibit  our space mementos abroad... Is this not an example of  displaying and publicizing our attainments and a means for  rectifying the sad situation of the former designers, cosmonauts  and their families?    It seems to us that it is not only our cosmonautics which is  in crisis, but also our moral values. After all, only this can  explain the foreign sale of space vehicles, spacesuits and lunar  ground by some space companies. This will scarcely save the  space branch in Russia. And if we want to think about the  future, a national space museum should be established.</p>

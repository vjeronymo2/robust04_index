			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Daishowa Paper slips into the red again DAISHOWA Paper, Japan's second biggest paper maker, announced a loss for the second consecutive year. The company said its pre-tax loss was reduced to Y6.3bn (Dollars 48.8m) from Y14.9bn the previous year, but it predicted the deficit would increase to Y13.8bn in the current fiscal year. Daishowa has been plagued by heavy debts which it incurred during a rapid acquisition programme abroad in the 1980s, including the purchase of the Canadian paper operations of Reed International in 1988 for CDollars 631m (USDollars 530.2m). Daishowa has been selling assets, including securities and land, in an effort to halve last year's debt burden of Y450bn by 1996. However, the recent fall in share prices has meant Daishowa's progress in reducing debts has been slower than expected. It repaid only Y5.3bn in debts during the last fiscal year, instead of the planned Y14bn. Daishowa expects earnings from the sale of securities will be lower this year, resulting in higher pre-tax losses. Net income dropped by 76 per cent to Y1.65bn, but remained in the black due to the disposal of land. Net profit is predicted to slip slightly to Y16bn in the current fiscal year. The reconstruction programme has been set back by lower paper prices which reflect a production glut in the global paper industry. Sales slipped by 1.3 per cent to Y349.2bn, although Daishowa predicts a recovery to Y368bn this year.</p>

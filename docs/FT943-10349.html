			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: TI Group After the initial disappointment with its Dowty purchase, it is gratifying to see things coming right for TI Group. Some impact of economic recovery was expected in yesterday's interim figures, though it is still largely confined to the US. More fundamental is TI's focus on cash. Gearing has halved to 42 per cent in the pace of a year, thanks partly to the kind of working capital squeeze that might be expected from a finance director imported from GKN. Admittedly Dowty's Pounds 500m price tag still looks high. Recovery is late to affect the airline industry, but margins at Dowty Aerospace have improved to over 9 per cent and the company reports a pick-up in spare parts orders. Once the recovery in this sector is felt, Dowty could look a solid, diversified, cash-generative engineering company - a far cry from its rather flashy image of the 1980s. The trouble, as so often with cyclical stocks, is that this is already discounted in the price. A prospective multiple of around 20 times is hardly cheap, especially when the dividend is likely to be well under two times covered. Having failed to cut its dividend in the recession, payout growth will almost certainly lag earnings in the recovery. One has to hope that desire for a bit more fizz will not eventually lead TI to squander its cash on ill-conceived acquisitions.</p>

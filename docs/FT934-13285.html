			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Technology: Postcodes move to compact disc - Worth Watching Most British businesses know that if they address their envelopes in the required format  - so that automated equipment can read them  - they will get a discount on their postage rates. Capscan, of London, has introduced Matchcode, a compact disc which contains all the UK's postal addresses in the required format. If addresses are entered into the computer in a random fashion, Matchcode will automatically format them, adding postcodes where necessary. The data can be used to adjust individual addresses as they are typed in, or to manipulate batches of addresses on a database. Matchcode can also be used for rapid addressing.

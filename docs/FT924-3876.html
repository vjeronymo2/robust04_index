			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Fears grow in India of bloody clashes TENSIONS were running high in the Indian holy town of Ayodhya in the state of Uttar Pradesh last night as tens of thousands of Hindu militants converged with the aim of building a temple on a controversial site next to a mosque. The possibility of a renewed outbreak of bloody communal clashes between Hindus and Moslems over the temple dispute is putting growing pressure on New Delhi to impose central government rule on Uttar Pradesh. About 12,000 paramilitary police are guarding the site to prevent possible damage to the mosque and further bloodshed on an issue which has claimed 2,000 lives across India in the last three years. Mr Arjun Singh, the human resources minister, told parliament yesterday the situation was 'very dangerous'. Referring to the separation of India and Pakistan in 1947, he said: 'We do not want a second partition of the country." Hindu fundamentalists have long voiced claims to land in Ayodhya and other sacred sites. But their demands have been transformed in the last three years by the political rise of the Hindu Bharatiya Janata party, which has grown into the largest opposition party by promoting Hindu militancy. Its success has prompted the formation of radical groups, including the Vishva Hindu Parishad. BJP leaders have been playing a dangerous game, whipping up national enthusiasm for the temple, whilst trying to keep in check the passions of extremists, some of whom believe India's Moslems should be expelled to Pakistan. The government is relying on a Supreme Court order issued this week instructing the state government of Uttar Pradesh to prevent construction work. But Uttar Pradesh is led by the BJP, so Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, may be unable to rely on the state carrying out the Supreme Court's bidding. This would force him to impose central rule, a step he is loathe to take.</p>

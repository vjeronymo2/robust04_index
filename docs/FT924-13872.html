			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Walker Greenbank ahead 5.6% and sales begin to improve WALKER GREENBANK, the wallcoverings group which recently emerged from a substantial reorganisation, yesterday reported a 5.6 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits and said it had detected a slight improvement in sales in the last two months. Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 rose from Pounds 2.69m to Pounds 2.84m on turnover which fell slightly to Pounds 29.51m (Pounds 30.37m) as a result of the disposal last year of the non-core Grimson stairlift business. Operating profits, before exceptional items, increased by 13.3 per cent to Pounds 3.14m (Pounds 2.77m), but the increase was partly offset by higher net interest payments which grew to Pounds 301,000 (Pounds 83,000). Earnings per share increased by a modest 2.6 per cent to 2.11p (2.06p) and the interim dividend is unchanged at 1.2p. The core commercial and consumer wallcoverings business managed to boost its market share and increase its turnover by 4.6 per cent to Pounds 25.47m, mainly because of the inclusion of the Harlequin distribution company in Germany, acquired in December. Without this new business Mr Charles Wightman, chief executive, said first half sales would have been flat. After a strong first quarter Mr Wightman said sales declined in May and June as business and consumer confidence evaporated after the election. However he added that there had been signs of a slight improvement in August and September. Operating profits from the wallcoverings manufacturing and distribution businesses, which now also include growing fabrics businesses, rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 3.42m) as a result of 'tight cost control' and reorganisation benefits. During the first half Bloom Signs, the group's illuminated sign business, continued to suffer as a result of the declining UK market and recorded a Pounds 805,000 pre-tax loss in the first half despite a further substantial rationalisation. Earlier this month 85 per cent of the business was sold to its management team for Pounds 650,000. The interim results include a Pounds 484,000 (Pounds 474,000) extraordinary charge. The latest charge mainly relates to the costs of the group's litigation against Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, and William Carr and his son, Alan, for about Pounds 15m in damages and interest in connection with the Pounds 3.5m acquisition of Alkar, a shopfitting company, in January 1987. The High Court began hearing the claim on October 1.</p>

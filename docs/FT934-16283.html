			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / New law will speed equal pay cases THE GOVERNMENT has told the Equal Opportunities Commission that it is ready to change the law to speed up the processing of equal pay for work of equal value cases. There have been only 23 successful cases in the past 10 years. The announcement came in talks begun earlier this week between the commission and the Department of Employment on ways of toughening the laws on equal pay. The EOC has also submitted a complaint to the European Commission over the government's alleged failure to implement the existing legislation. Changes proposed by Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, include: Requiring employers to cite one reason - rather than many, as at present - why there is a variation in an applicant's pay with that of the comparator which is not due to difference of sex but another 'material factor'. Companies have been accused of time wasting by putting up their reasons one at a time. This must be done by the employer before the preliminary review of the case. Accepting that each equal value claim should be subject to a preliminary review to improve access to the judicial process. Mr Hunt will give this 'further consideration'. Mr Hunt has turned down the commission's demand for a statutory requirement that all employees in the same employment should be entitled to the same award. The government argues that such a move would conflict with the system of justice. The commission's call for full-time independent experts to assess equal value cases has also been rejected. Refusal to accept most of the commission's proposals has strengthened determination to push ahead with its complaint. If the EC is unhappy with the government's response, the case will go to the European Court of Justice.</p>

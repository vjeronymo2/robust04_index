			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Swiss vote to banish transit lorries from the Alps The Swiss moved boldly yesterday to protect their alpine environment, voting in a plebiscite to ban all transit lorry traffic through the Swiss Alps within 10 years even though such a ban is likely to worsen relations between their government and the European Union. Nearly 52 per cent of those who went to the polls voted in support of the ban, defying the Swiss government's strong denunciation of the proposal. Two years ago, Bern signed a 12-year accord with the EU to restrain the growth of transit lorry traffic in the Alps. It argued in the referendum campaign that this provided adequate protection, but will no longer be able to respect that agreement. It is the second time in less than two years that the Swiss people have voted to undo agreements between their government and the EU. In December 1992 they rejected proposals to join the European Economic Area, a free trade zone linking the countries of the European Free Trade Association with the EU. In Brussels, an EU official said the decision was regrettable. Bern fears that the EU will be reluctant to enter planned bilateral negotiations over air traffic rights in the union for Swissair and other issues. There was jubilation in the tiny canton of Uri, which lies in a narrow mountain valley leading up to the Gotthard Pass, the shortest road and rail route between Germany and Italy. It was there that a petition was drawn up in 1990 proposing that all transit lorry traffic be forced to move to the railways after a 10-year transition period and all Swiss transit-related motorway construction be halted. About 2,500 lorries go through the Gotthard Pass each day, of which 1,000 are in transit. Much of this is EU traffic. A crestfallen Mr Adolf Ogi, the Swiss transport minister, said the government would do what it could to minimise discrimination against EU lorries, but there is little room for manoeuvre. Under Switzerland's system of direct democracy, the people's decision in a plebiscite is binding. The result could also complicate the EU's enlargement negotiations with Austria, now in an intense final phase. Austrians are also upset about the pollution caused in Alpine valleys by transit lorries. Their determination to prevent any further liberalisation of transit traffic could be stiffened by the Swiss vote. Mr Viktor Klima, Austria's transport minister, noted in Brussels yesterday that the vote was a signal that Europeans wanted a more environmentally friendly transport policy.

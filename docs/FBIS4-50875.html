			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan will share its  experience in preventing dengue fever with Southeast Asian  countries, Environmental Protection Administration Administrator  Chang Lung-sheng said Monday [23 May].    Chang made the remarks at the opening ceremony of an  international dengue fever control meeting which gathered more  than 180 experts and scholars from 19 countries in Taipei.    Chang said the main purpose for holding the meeting was to  invite specialists to form a new dengue fever control alliance  in Asia to jointly combat the disease and develop programs in  urban areas to kill mosquitoes which carry the disease.    The meeting will also propose that a private foundation be  established in Taiwan to help fight dengue fever, common in  Southeast Asia and Mainland China, Chang said.    Taiwan eliminated dengue fever in just three years, Chang  said, while neighboring Southeast Asian countries continue to  fight the spread of the disease.</p>

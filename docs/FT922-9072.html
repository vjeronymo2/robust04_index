			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Flexible friends face hard times in recession - How to ..choose a credit card THE HEYDAY of the credit card may have passed. The recession and a rise in personal debts have made many people turn their backs on these plastic pieces of temptation. The recession has also hit the card issuers. It now appears that bankers priced their credit card services too low in the fight to enter the market, and the credit card income of the banks has dropped. So, interest charges have risen and annual fees have been introduced. These measures have led to fewer customers: Lloyds, the first bank to introduce credit card charges, is believed to have only 1.6m Access cardholders compared with about 2.8m two years ago. Further changes are likely. At the beginning of 1992, Barclaycard predicted that smaller credit card issuers would be squeezed out of the market, with some cards being sold to larger issuers and others disappearing. If you do not have a credit card, you may find it harder to get one now than a few years ago. 'There was a time when we would not think twice about issuing a credit card to someone who worked in the City,' said a spokesperson for one UK bank. 'But we know that these jobs are no longer secure and our preferred customers today are more likely to be doctors than bankers.' The type of card you choose is likely to fall into two broad areas - a straightforward credit card, or a 'gold' or 'charge' card. 'ORDINARY' CREDIT CARDS Prompt payers These are the cards that people are likely to obtain from their bank or building society. Two dominate the market. There were 17.6m Visa cards and 12.3m Mastercard/Access in issue in 1990, according to Mintel, which expects figures for 1991 to show a fall because of the introduction of fees. Barclays and TSB were the original issuers of the Visa card in the 1960s. For this reason these banks have been able to market their Visa cards under brand names - Barclaycard and TSB Trustcard. Access is a UK MasterCard subsidiary brand name jointly owned by National Westminster, Midland, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. The cheapest and best way to use a credit card was revealed by Nigel Lawson, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, who advised people to pay off their monthly bill in full. This is a convenient form of payment and gives the user a period of interest-free credit, in addition to some perks. However, for many card holders the credit is no longer free because of the annual fees. The Big Four banks now all charge an annual fee of up to Pounds 12, although free cards are still available from some issuers, such as the Co-operative bank, Girobank, National &amp; Provincial and TSB. Late payers Many people begin with good intentions but, when faced with the choice of paying only Pounds 5 rather than, say, Pounds 500 for the month, opt for the former and soon slide into debt. If this is you, one of the most important criteria will be the rate of interest being levied. This is usually measured by the APR, or annual percentage rate. Unfortunately this is becoming unreliable as a basis of strict comparison because of the different assumptions made by card issuers in their calculations (the date at which they begin to charge interest and the amount of credit they assume is outstanding) and because of the fees. If a card issuer chooses a large sum as a typical credit limit over which to spread the fee, its APR will look smaller than another issuer spreading the same amount over a smaller sum. For example, the Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale bank both have a Pounds 10 annual fee and a 1.9 per cent monthly interest charge, yet Bank of Scotland gives its APR as 26 per cent while Clydesdale quotes 26.6 per cent. However, the difference is not likely to be much more than a percentage point and according to Paul Hersey, senior finance analyst at Mintel, 'the APR is still the best figure because it shows you the overall cost of credit for the year.' Alternatively, you can look at the monthly figure and the size of the fee as a basis for comparison. In its last survey of credit cards, Which?, the Consumer Association's monthly magazine, found that the Bank of Cyprus Visa card, with 19.6 per cent APR, and National and Provincial's Visa (24 per cent APR) and no annual fee offered the cheapest credit. Apart from the APR, your credit limit and perks are other considerations. Perks One of the more irritating aspects of opening the monthly bill is the paraphernalia that drops out of the envelope advertising credit card perks. Which? points out that many of these are little more than a way of marketing associated products, such as discounts on holidays offered by the issuer. Some perks are inbuilt no matter what sort of ordinary credit card you hold. Under the Consumer Credit Act, all card issuers have to give you protection against faulty goods if the supplier does not compensate you. If your card is stolen and you have notified the issuer, you will not be liable for goods purchased subsequently with the card. Credit cards also give some degree of travel insurance, although this is not a substitute for full travel cover. Barclaycard offers more perks than most, including free purchase protection, which insures many items bought with the card against theft or accidental damage for 100 days after the purchase; free emergency assistance for travellers, such as an emergency cash service; free travel accident insurance (covering accidents which happen when you are in transit and not mishaps at other times during the holiday); and a points system which can be cashed in for gifts. Affinity cards These operate as credit cards but a small proportion of the money spent by the holder is donated to charity. The card provider gives about Pounds 5 or Pounds 10 to the charity the first time the card is used. Thereafter, a fixed fraction of cash spent is donated - usually only about 20p or 30p per Pounds 100. You can be governed in choosing a card either by the charity or the existence of a fee. For example, National Westminster has a World Wildlife Fund for Nature affinity card but charges an annual fee of Pounds 12. Alternatively, you can give free to Oxfam through Girobank, or to the Arts, through Midland. Charge, or Gold cards Designed to appeal to high-earning big spenders. Charge cards such as American Express and Diners Club give unlimited credit but have to be paid off in full every month. Most Gold cards also operate as charge cards but some, such as Lloyds Gold Mastercard, operate as a regular credit card. Such cards have substantially higher annual fees - the Bank of Scotland announced this week that it will raise its annual fee for its Premier Visa charge card from Pounds 50 to Pounds 70 on June 1. Those who benefit most from Gold and charge cards are travellers who need hefty credit to cover expenses. However, be wary of using credit cards too liberally abroad - most use an exchange rate more favourable to the issuer than the customer. Similarly, check the exchange rate on some 'no commission' promises, which are sometimes compensated by giving a worse exchange rate than at other bureaux. People who occasionally need a high overdraft will also find Gold and charge cards attractive as they offer preferential rates on overdrafts, usually up to Pounds 10,000. Barclaycard Gold charges 14.7 per cent EAR (equivalent annual rate) on overdrafts of between Pounds 2,500 and Pounds 50,000, compared with its 24.1 per cent EAR authorised overdraft rate. However, the annual fee is Pounds 70. Many Gold card holders might be better off switching to an ordinary card and paying a smaller annual fee. It is easy to be seduced by the perks offered by Gold and charge cards but customers should ask whether they really need unlimited cover for emergency evacuation when travelling abroad - one of the perks being added by Bank of Scotland as a sweetener for the rise in its fee. The Co-Op's Gold Visa card is one of the few no-fee cards but you must hurry to get one - its promise never to impose a fee runs out on June 30. Gold and charge cards are only available to those earning a minimum of Pounds 20,000 a year - but you would have to earn much more in order to settle bills of Pounds 1,000 a month regularly. Another disadvantage is that Gold and charge cards are not covered automatically by the Consumer Credit Act. However, Coutts, Co-Op, Girobank, Lloyds (Mastercard) and NatWest (Visa) have all secured full CCA protection on their Gold cards.</p>

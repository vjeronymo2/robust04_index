			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Why Rover left home: Nostalgia for the UK's car industry If this week's letter columns in the British press are a guide, the sale of Rover to BMW is being condemned up and down the country. This is perfectly natural. In the psychology of any manufacturing nation, the car industry plays a role which goes beyond mere economics. Even in a country whose industrial self-esteem is as low as the UK's, the collapse of the last big carmaker into foreign hands is bound to cause an atavistic twitch. How far this is rational is another matter. In terms of industrial logic, the game was up for Rover a decade ago and more. The last cars which it developed on its own were the Maestro and Montego in the early 1980s. Ever since, it has relied heavily on Honda for design and engineering. The Rover 600, launched last year, is nothing more than a lightly disguised Honda Accord. The fact that future Rovers may be similarly disguised BMWs is regrettable, but no worse than the status quo. Land Rover is, of course, a different matter: a highly successful British product, domestically designed and made. There is no reason to suppose this will change. When car companies merge, the key to saving costs is designing a common chassis. But BMW has no chassis relevant to Land Rover, nor does it plan to produce one. It has every incentive to leave well alone, except that its much bigger dealer network will presumably help Land Rover's sales overseas. But, the letter-writers will say, this is beside the point. Previously, Rover was British-owned and controlled. Now it is not. True enough: but again, the damage was done a long time ago. Granted, Rover's present owner, British Aerospace, is as true-blue as they come. But its purchase of Rover from the UK government in 1988 owed at least as much to politics as to commercial logic. Not for the first time, privatisation was a convenient means of ducking a politically awkward issue: in this case, the ultimate necessity of selling Rover into foreign hands. As an expedient, it was always bound to be temporary. There was no industrial case for BAe owning Rover; and financially, as BAe conceded this week, it simply could not afford to develop both Rover and its defence business in the long run. All the while, it was clear that Rover was too small to survive alone. It needed to merge with another car company. There being no other British volume car company left, this logically meant merging with a foreigner. The foreigner also had to be strong enough for the merger to thrive. Logically, this also meant that Rover had to be the junior partner. Rover had already learnt this lesson the hard way, when it sold its Leyland truck business to Daf in 1987. Daf proved too weak a partner, and the merged company went bust last year. BMW may not be among the giants of the world car industry, but it has three times Rover's turnover. It is also consistently profitable, whereas Rover has made a loss before tax for the past three years at least. None of this means that Britain's demise as an independent car producer is welcome. On the one hand, Britain has on balance benefited from its open-door policy on inward investment, especially from Japanese makers of cars and consumer electronics. But it is not all plain sailing. Scotland's high-technology electronics industry, for instance, has found that turning out silicon chips and personal computers for its American masters has done little to develop the local supply of technology or components. Again, Britain's openness to foreign takeover is the necessary counterpart of its appetite for buying companies overseas. Indeed, some foreign takeovers of UK companies seem genuinely to have helped both parties. Nestle's highly contentious takeover of Rowntree six years ago has done nothing to harm Britain's output of chocolate. Siemens's purchase of large chunks of Plessey at around the same time was a step towards the German company building a Pounds 1bn turnover business in the UK. But there is always the risk that a foreign buyer will simply seize the opportunity of closing down a competitor. Thomson of France bought Ferguson, the television manufacturer, only to shut UK production and keep the brand. General Electric of the US bought Thorn's UK lighting business, and is now closing much of it in favour of manufacturing in Hungary. In Rover's case, there is a more specific danger. As an ex-chairman of Land Rover pointed out in the FT's letter columns yesterday, the history of takeovers in the car industry - as elsewhere - is littered with failures. BMW has grown organically throughout its history, and has no previous experience of merger. If it all goes wrong, Rover as the underdog may get more than its share of the kicking. Thus, this week's announcement cannot be greeted with rejoicing. Of course there are risks involved. Of course Britain would be better off making its own cars. But the peculiarly emotional character of the industry has merely postponed an inevitable event. Now that it has finally arrived, there is no use crying over spilt milk: especially when it was spilt such a long time ago.</p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa picks up from low Johannesburg picked up from the day's lows in late afternoon trade as investors returned to key stocks after the recent hefty declines. Analysts cautioned, however, that future direction would depend on the country's credit ratings, expected shortly from the leading credit agencies, and South Africa's weighting in key emerging market indices. They added that the market had now absorbed Friday's discount rate rise and poor August inflation data. The overall index finished 34 down at 5,583, having earlier touched 5,556, for a two-day loss of 172 points. The gold shares index was 26 softer at 2,422 and industrials gave up 32 to 6,171. De Beers slipped to an early R97 before recovering to close 50 cents firmer on balance at R99.50. Anglos finished R2.50 weaker at R235 and SAB improved R1.50 to R81.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 7 January, Tsutomu Hata, concurrently deputy  prime minister and foreign minister, decided to appoint adviser  for the foreign minister Hisashi Owada--who is former  administrative vice minister for foreign affairs--to be  ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Owada will succeed Yoshio  Hatano, who has served nearly four years. Foreign Minister Hata  decided to appoint Mr. Owada who has an experience as the former  vice minister to the post because there is a great possibility  that Japan will become a permanent member of the UN Security  Council. Mr. Owada is father of the crown princess.  Originally, there was a plan to appoint him as ambassador to  the United States or ambassador to the UK.    Moreover, Foreign Minister Hata decided on the following  personnel changes: Ambassador to Thailand Hiroaki Fujii will  succeed Hiroshi Kitamura as ambassador to the UK; Consul-General  in San Francisco Atsushi Tokinoya will succeed Yukio Sato as  North American Affairs Bureau chief; Ambassador to the ROK  Yutaka Kawashima will succeed Tadashi Ikeda as Asian Affairs  Bureau chief; and Consul-General in Los Angeles Koichi Haraguchi  will succeed Kazuo Ogura as Economic Affairs Bureau chief.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Food and Drink: Cut-price glamour cuts - Cookery The trouble with economising is that, all too often, it is depressingly evident. The art of paring costs while giving real pleasure to your guests depends on a calculated blend of sheer greed, a shrewd eye for bargains, presentational flair, lateral thinking and - last but not least - a smiling demeanour. Cut-price glamour is the thing to aim for. Relish the challenge, plan and execute economies with style, and you might even create the impression that you are lashing out, rather than being economical. Soup, for example, is cheap food and the workhouse image haunts its past. But a broth made from, say, the sinewy left-overs of game birds can be gloriously savoury. And if it is served theatrically in individual bowls sealed under puff pastry lids, the image and the eating are decidedly classy. A few thoughts on meat cookery are given below. Vegetables, fish and dessert ideas will follow next Saturday. For those on the economy trail, one thing to avoid is mince, which has become linked inexorably with nasty. But some other cheap cuts are both chic and appetising. Oxtail is splendid rib-sticking stuff, just the ticket for stews and braises when winter turns wintry. The only worry is that it has become so fashionable that half your friends may be serving it, too. The same goes for lamb shanks. The time has come for avant-garde cooks to greet the revival of shin of beef, another richly-meaty, awkwardly-bony, lip-smacking, gravy-producing cut. Once shunned by the smart set, my crystal ball forecasts that it is tipped to star. Beef shin has been prized for years by a few cognoscenti who used this meat (where others used more costly chuck steak) to make splendid casseroles and stews - with extra cooking time, of course. I suggest, though, that it is more fun, and much better value, if shin is cooked and served on the bone. Ask the butcher to cut it across in thick slices, then treat it in much the same way as shin of veal. To make what is, in effect, a deeply-flavoured version of classic ossobuco, colour beef shin slices lightly all over, then lay them flat to contain the marrow safely in the bones. Pour on reduced red wine, add a plum tomato or two or a few prunes, some onion, thyme, bay and a curl of orange peel. Cook very gently indeed for four hours or so until the meat can be pulled clean from the bone and the gravy is sticky. Garnish with a variation on gremolada consisting of finely-chopped garlic, parsley, and the zest of an orange. For an oriental slant, slow-cook the beef shin slices with onions, garlic, ginger, soy, oyster sauce and beef stock. Finish with strips of stir-fried green pepper and a handful of chopped green coriander. Offal is 'in'. Less celebrated than chicken livers (a ritzy, long-standing favourite of many paupers) but worth consideration, are sheep and ox kidneys. The writer Edouard de Pomiane, who considered the last to be 'unjustly despised', raised their status to 'aristocratic' by sauteeing them and serving with a bearnaise sauce. It is a winning combination. Lambs' kidneys assume slightly exotic appeal when split, cored, threaded on skewers, grilled, and served on a bed of rice with a snowstorm of chives and pats of dukka butter (butter with dukka mashed in) melting over them. Dukka is an Egyptian treat, a mixture of toasted and chopped hazelnut kernels, sesame, cumin and coriander seed which is prepared easily at home. Toast each ingredient separately in a dry frying pan, allowing four parts of nuts to three of sesame, two of coriander and one of cumin. Mix, add sea salt and pepper, and pass the mixture through the coarse blade of a meat mincer. Dukka keeps well in an airtight jar for many weeks. It can also be served as a welcome alternative to bruschetta with pre-dinner drinks. Spread dukka on a tray and warm it briefly in the oven to freshen it (if not newly-made), then serve it with a bowl of good olive oil and warm, crusty bread. To eat, break off a piece of bread, hold it by the crust, and dip the crumb into the oil to dampen it. Then press it into the dukka to pick up some of the fragrant nut-and-spice mixture.</p>

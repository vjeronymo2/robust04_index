			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Smith manifesto seeks to set 'radical' agenda MR JOHN SMITH, odds-on favourite in the Labour leadership contest, yesterday unveiled a personal manifesto aimed at broadening the party's support by promoting a fairer society with 'an economic strategy from which everyone gains'. To quash criticisms that a Smith leadership would represent 'more of the same', the shadow chancellor said no policy must be seen as 'out of bounds'. The party needed to make a 'radical response' to its fourth successive election defeat. Central to his agenda is the creation of a wide-ranging Commission on Social Justice, to review wealth distribution, welfare policy and taxation in an effort to forge a national consensus on reform. In a key passage in the 11-page document, Mr Smith said the chief challenge to European parties of the left was how to address societies in which two-thirds lived in relative security while a third did not. The task of government was not to prescribe and direct but to create an 'infrastructure of opportunity' with policies that 'bring fairness to the minority who are in poverty while commanding the support among the majority who are not'. Presenting the document, entitled New Paths to Victory, at a Westminster news conference, Mr Smith underlined his continued belief in a minimum wage and a redistributionist tax policy. Hinting at the need for a sharp reduction in the role of the unions, he added that the party's first task was to ensure that all major policy decisions are taken on the basis of one member one vote. 'We cannot approach the next five years on the basis of business as before,' he said. Beyond internal reforms and a fresh debate on tax and social policy, Mr Smith's manifesto also argued that Labour must position itself as the party of the consumer not the producer. He stressed closer integration in Europe and pledged himself to constitutional reform. This included a renaissance of local government, devolved power to the regions, a Freedom of Information Bill and a Bill of Rights based on the European Convention, fully incorporated in law, he said. Mr Smith rejected political pacts with other parties but insisted Labour would, under his leadership, attempt to represent the 58 per cent of voters who rejected the Conservatives at the last election. Reacting to the manifesto, Mr David Blunkett, campaign manager for Mr Bryan Gould, the rival leadership contender, said the challenger's policy positions had clearly forced Mr Smith to adopt a 'slight change in style and approach'. However, Mr Blunkett insisted that people should not be asked to 'line up behind documents in an uncritical fashion' promising that Mr Gould would launch his own manifesto after the May 7 local elections. The leadership contest ends at a special meeting of Labour's electoral college, including unions, MPs and constituencies, in London on July 18.</p>

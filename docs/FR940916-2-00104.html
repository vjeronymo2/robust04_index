			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, PHLX Rule 1025 requires written procedures for the review and maintenance of customer options accounts. Specifically, paragraph (d) requires that backgrounds, financial information and copies of account statements respecting option-approved accounts be maintained at the branch office servicing that customer's account as well as at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over that branch office. The PHLX proposes that the requirement applicable to principal supervisory offices be amended to permit the required information to be maintained at another location, provided that the information is readily accessible and promptly retrievable. The record retention requirement applicable to branch offices remains unchanged, such that off-site record maintenance is not permissible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PHLX states that the increasing use of computers, fax machines, optical disk and other technology coupled with the expense of storing records on-site have resulted in more member organizations storing records away from their principal supervisory offices. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The PHLX states that corresponding amendments to exchange option rules relating to customer account records are now required, and that the other self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') have enacted similar amendments to their rules <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  or are proposing the same to their respective rules in order to maintain uniformity among the SROs respecting option account rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In June 1993, the Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') issued a no-action letter permitting broker-dealers to maintain certain records required by Rules 17a&hyph;3 and 17a&hyph;4 under the Act on optical disk technology, under certain conditions. See Letter from Michael A. Macchiaroli, Associate Director, Division, Commission, to Michael D. Udoff, Chairman, Ad Hoc Record Retention Committee, Securities Industry Association, dated June 18, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34564 (August 19, 1994), 59 FR 44442 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;27). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In view of technological advances, the Exchange believes that it is appropriate to permit the off-site storage of customer records previously required to be maintained at a principal supervisory office. Technological advances such as optical storage technology may enable broker-dealers to improve customer service, due to the speedier and higher quality access to records that optical disks afford. The Exchange also believes that off-site storage should not compromise the supervisory obligations of member/participant organizations because the customer information necessary to fulfill those responsibilities must be easily accessible and promptly retrievable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, as well as to protect investors and the public interest. While facilitating the storage concerns and technological needs of member organizations whose principal supervisory offices would be affected, the PHLX believes that the proposed change to PHLX Rule 1025(d) should nevertheless safeguard the customer protection purposes of maintaining customer account information because the information would continue to be readily accessible and promptly retrievable, merely at a different, usually central, location. As a result, the PHLX believes that the Exchange's ability to investigate and access option customer account records would be preserved, and possibly enhanced, as computer technology advances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PHLX does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No written comments were either received or requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III.

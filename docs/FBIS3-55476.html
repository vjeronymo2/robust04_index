			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Azerbaijan's leaders have reiterated their view that  a peaceful solution must be found to end the war between Armenia  and Azerbaijan and called for the Armenian Armed Forces'  immediate and unconditional withdrawal from the areas they have  occupied. President Aliyev outlined this when he received  Colonel General Fedor Reut, commander of the Transcaucasian  group of Russia's troops, at his request on 6 January.    President Aliyev said the illusions of Armenia's extremist  circles, which believe the occupationist forces will remain in  the territory they have occupied in Azerbaijan indefinitely, are  meaningless. He asserted: Azerbaijan can and will safeguard  its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the nonviolation of  its border. But we believe the dispute, which has continued for  nearly six years, is meaningless. So, we call for obstructing  unnecessary bloodshed and killing.    President Aliyev also asserted: CIS resources must be used  to achieve that; the organization was not established just to  solve economic problems. It also has political and military  responsibilities. We have signed the agreement on collective  security. The CIS must not remain inactive in the face of  aggression by one member against another. On behalf of  Azerbaijan, which is a sovereign republic, I brought the issue  to the attention of the participants at the Ashgabat summit. As  the commander of Russia's troops in the Transcaucasus, you must  contribute to the effort to halt Armenia's continuing aggression  against Azerbaijan.    Geydar Aliyev said: Russia has military bases and units  under your command in Georgia and Armenia. Many of our kin live  miserably in several rayons in Georgia. We have received  serious information that they are being unjustly treated. We  have held talks with Georgia's leaders. A great tragedy may  emerge if the negative developments are not stopped. The  incidents in Karabakh confirm that. Stability must be  established in the region at all costs.    According to President Aliyev, Russia's military units in  the  Transcaucasus and Russia must play a significant role in  arranging relations among the republics in the Transcaucasus.  He said: The [word indistinct] of Russia's troops in Armenia  has a military status. Azerbaijan and Russia are members of the  same alliance. We are independent countries. I have the legal  and moral right to make my request. I wish to unofficially  stress that Azerbaijan's leaders have received information that  Russia's military units in Armenia have helped that republic's  military forces in various ways. But considering our friendly  relations with Russia, Azerbaijan will spare no effort to  facilitate the transit of freight through our republic for  Russia's military forces in Armenia. Information we have  received that the freight, fuel in particular, is falling into  the hands of the Armenian military forces makes us very uneasy.    Gen. Reut described his talks with Aliyev as a very  important  development. He said Russia's political and military leaders  support the effort to find a peaceful solution to the dispute  between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Without directly referring to  the points raised by Aliyev, Gen. Reut said the dispute in the  region has made everyone, including Russia's military forces,  very uneasy. He said that they too are forced to live under  conditions of war. Gen. Reut stressed that he has arrived in  Azerbaijan to ask the Republic's leaders to facilitate the  uninterrupted transit of military echelons [last word in  English] travelling to Armenia through Baku.    Deputy Prime Minister Abbas Abbasov and Defense Minister  Mamed Rafi Mamedov attended the meeting.</p>

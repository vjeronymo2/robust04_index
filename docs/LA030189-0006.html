			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PLANE CARRYING 1 CRASHES OFF SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND  </P> <P> One person was believed to have been aboard a plane that crashed about 15 miles  west of San Clemente Island shortly before noon Tuesday, Navy officials said.  </P> <P> The flier's condition was not known.  </P> <P> The aircraft was an MU-2 Mitsubishi twin-engine turboprop, owned by Flight  International in Carlsbad. The company is under contract with the Navy to  provide target practice, but the plane was not operating in that capacity when  it crashed, said Navy Cmdr. David Dillon, public information officer with the  Naval Surface Force in Coronado.  </P> <P> The plane "was flying under (Navy) control, working with the Fleet Combat  Training Center out of Point Loma," Dillon said. "They train air traffic  controllers; they don't come under us.  </P> <P> The Navy was assisting in the search because there were Navy ships in the area  when the plane went down, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Arts: Billy Budd - Metropolitan, New York Peter Grimes and Billy Budd represent modern opera at the Met . Grimes, first staged in 1948, was restaged in 1967 in a near-replica of Covent Garden's 1947 production (producer Guthrie, designer Tanya Moiseiwitsch). Still in use, it stirs memories for older British visitors. Budd arrived in 1978, in a strong, striking production by John Dexter. The stage lifts were put to full use; sometimes four or five thronged decks of the Indomitable were on view. Peter Pears sang Vere, Richard Stilwell was Billy, and James Morris was Claggart. This Budd has also been revived often- most recently this month when Thomas Hampson sang his first Billy, Graham Clark his first Vere, and Charles Mackerras conducted. While Budd was in gestation, EM Forster wrote to Britten, 'I want grand opera mounted clearly and grandly.' The Met Grimes and Budd, played to conservative audiences, are closer to traditional grand opera than what we see now in Britain. After Tim Albery's sharp-eyed, sharp-edged ENO productions, they seem curiously old-fashioned, romantic. Period pieces. In an age when, in various fields, people are trying to recapture performance styles of the past, this has its interest. Dexter's Budd was sharp when it was new. It's now a softened house revival put on after the book - fuzzy at the edges, sloppy in nautical detail that was originally formalized and precise but now clumsy would- be-realistic. Morris's Claggart was in keener focus, alert and energetic, particular, 14 years ago; it has become heavier, more portly, less arresting in both physical and vocal manner. Hampson is New York's star of the season, appearing everywhere. He opened the Philharmonic series. He opened a new concert hall in Queens. At the Met he has been singing Mozart's Count and Rossini's Figaro. His Largo al factotum - newly fresh,wonderful  - was the highpoint of the city's Rossini Birthday Gala. His Billy, however, was not altogether convincing. Onstage he often seems a bit self-conscious, gauche; he is tall (6'5 or so), affects a Ramey-type mane, tends to hunch his shoulders and throw his arms about. But he has one of the most beautiful baritones around and - provided one could accept a simple seaman's scrupulously covered and moulded tones and the carefully cultivated diction - he was moving. The close of the gun-deck scene, after Dansker's departure, was especially fine. Claggart and Vere's three officers were men as or nearly as tall; beside them Clark seemed a tiny Captain, not reaching their shoulders. His voice was small and unattractive, but he gave an intelligent, intent, very clear performance; a great burst of emotion in the epilogue, as he echoed Billy's paragraph, was something new and stirring. Sir Charles's account of the score was warmly felt, warmly played, and very sure. The sounds were beautiful. I have heard performances more nervously exciting'the tone leaner, the signals more sharply etched'but none more romantic.</p>

			<p>931106 FT  06 NOV 93 / Demolition at Elstree halted BRENT WALKER, the property and leisure group, has agreed not to carry out any demolition at Elstree film studios pending the hearing of a High Court application by Hertsmere Borough Council. The council is seeking to enforce a planning condition which, it says, binds the owners to maintaining the 15-acre Hertfordshire complex for film production until 2015. Mr Justice Lindsay adjourned the case until next month.</p>

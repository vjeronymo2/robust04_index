			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A MODERN FAIRY TALE;  </P> <P> MOVIES: DIRECTOR TIM BURTON IS BACK ON THE CUTTING EDGE WITH 'SCISSORHANDS,'  POSSIBLY THE MOST ORIGINAL FILM FANTASY CREATION OF THE YEAR.  </P> <P> "Edward Scissorhands" has a lot to do with growing up in Burbank.... Not  literal translations, actual people. But there are memories. -- Tim Burton  </P> <P> His face is pale, covered with cuts and scars, dominated by yearning eyes and a  black, sticky tangle of hair. His manner is wary but sweetly considerate,  belying the punkish black leather he wears under his everyday garb. He could be  an ordinary boy -- except for one thing. Springing from his wrists are 10-inch  razor-sharp metal blades that slice, zip and whoosh through the air with  hedge-trimming deftness and Ninja ferocity.  </P> <P> He's "Edward Scissorhands" (at the GCC Avco Cinema) and, as Tim Burton dreams  him and actor Johnny Depp plays him, he's perhaps the most original movie  fantasy creation of the year: an icon of tenderness and artistic alienation  that clings, stickum-like, to your mind's eye and the softest, most woundable  parts of your mass-culture heart.  </P> <P> "Scissorhands" is not as frenetic and juicy as previous Burton movies, like  "Beetlejuice" or "Pee-wee's Big Adventure." Occasionally, there is something a  little distant and dry about it. But it's just as daffy and inventive: a modern  fairy tale about a bewildered young manufactured boy, complete except for  makeshift hands, pulled from a Gothic horror-house into the screamingly pastel  candyland of modern suburbia.  </P> <P> It's part Portrait of the Artist as a Young Frankenstein, part relentless  satire of Burton's birthplace, Burbank. And it's also part Dr. Seuss-Edward  Gorey allegory about how middle-class America has educated and programmed  itself out of appreciating wonder.  </P> <P> Burton, digging into his psyche with a ruthlessness that mass-audience movie  makers usually avoid, has fashioned Edward out of the adolescent fears and  longings that usually only emerge, bent out of shape, in confessional novels  and bits of youth-rebel movies. And Depp has done something marvelous with the  part. Summoning up a silent-movie grace and abandon, he has converted himself  almost wholly into a figure of the imagination, translated the script's  emotions with such transparency that it is the freak who seems real and all the  human denizens of the comical flatland suburbia below who seem false or  grotesque.  </P> <P> As Burton remembers and imagines them, these suburbanites are a gaggle of  Bermuda-shorted, back-slapping dads and chattering moms, salted with bigots and  religious fanatics. In this conformist subdivision (we never learn its name but  the license plates all read "Midland"), the favorite sport is telephone gossip,  the snap response to any disturbing new event is to hold a barbecue. There,  newcomer Edward proves handy for chopping salads or working as a human shish  kebab -- in between his other local gigs as topiary artist, dog barber and hair  stylist.  </P> <P> Burton's satire of middle-brow America, the milieu in which he grew up, is  devastating but never nasty. The citizenry seems to have grooved into a sapped  conformity: glaze-eyed, glib Bill Boggs (Alan Arkin), patriarch of the family  that hosts Edward, burbles out platitudes as if he'd been programmed by a cult  based on TV family sitcoms. The youngsters are mean-rebellious, impatient for  more money, good times.  </P> <P> The two dominant figures are marvelous, spine-tinglingly funny caricatures by  Dianne Wiest and Kathy Baker. Seraphic Peg Boggs (Wiest) is a cosmetics lady  whose face lights up like a Christmas tree when she finds someone to help and  who brightly chirps "Avon calling!" as she enters Edward's dank and shadowy  mansion. And hot-pants Louise (Baker) is an auburn-haired virago of bottomless  innuendo.  </P> <P> Against all this, Burton and novelist-screenwriter Caroline Thompson make  Edward a tamed Prometheus, the artist in chains. His almost slavish, rapt  adoration of Peg's cheerleader daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), girlfriend of the  villainous Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), is an agonized manifestation of the  adolescent outsider's desire to be accepted. His blade-fingers are the artist's  symbol. He can carve up wonders with them, but they also cut him up, make him a  freak. He can't make love without hurting, can't even touch or sleep on a  water-bed without springing leaks in every direction.  </P> <P> This is the most deeply personal thing Burton has done since his 1982 debut  cartoon, "Vincent," and, after a mass-audience monster like "Batman," perhaps  that made him hedge a little. I admired "Edward," but I didn't find any magic  in what should have been its most magical moment: Winona Ryder whirling in a  drizzle of shimmering flakes, as Edward vibrantly carves out an ice-angel. And  the lack of chemistry between Ryder and Hall damages the sequences where Edward  supposedly goes crazy with jealousy.  </P> <P> But these are quibbles. The whole film has a tender underlining and a marvelous  fun-house look and pace. There are lots of laughs, tears and the most hilarious  hedges and hair styles in many a moon. There's Vincent Price, like some  benignly demonic paterfamilias, and another witty, rich score by Danny Elfman,  whose sensibility connects as perfectly with Burton as Bernard Herrmann's did  with Alfred Hitchcock.  </P> <P> There's the whir of Depp's fingers, trimming a poodle, picking a lock. There's  Wiest, Arkin and Baker, good as they can possibly be. And there's a little,  sweet-sad moment when Edward, outcast of outcasts, sits on a curb by a waiting  sheep dog and gently snips hair out of the dog's eyes. Gentleness is a nice  quality to have back in movies. Along with some fairy-tale pain, longing and  hilarity, "Edward Scissorhands" (rated PG-13 for language and violence) has it.  </P> <P> 'Edward Scissorhands'  </P> <P> Johnny Depp: Edward Scissorhands  </P> <P> Winona Ryder: Kim  </P> <P> Dianne Wiest: Peg Boggs  </P> <P> Anthony Michael Hall: Jim  </P> <P> Kathy Baker: Louise  </P> <P> Alan Arkin: Bill  </P> <P> A 20th Century Fox release.

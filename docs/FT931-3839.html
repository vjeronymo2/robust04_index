			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: German bourse chief executive to step down MR Rudiger von Rosen, one of the most prominent figures in the campaign to strengthen Germany's financial markets in recent years, is to step down as chief executive of the Deutsche Borse, the single German stock exchange which came into being at the beginning of the year. The move came as a surprise in Frankfurt as it was only recently that Mr von Rosen had his contract as chief executive renewed until the end of 1994. He is to be replaced by Mr Werner Seifert, a Swiss businessman who is main board director of Swiss Re responsible for the company's primary insurance activities. Mr von Rosen will retain his job as chief executive until the end of July when Mr Seifert, 44, will take over. The official statement said that Mr von Rosen would stay on as an ordinary member of the managing board but Frankfurt financiers said that this was unlikely. Mr von Rosen, 49, was not available for comment yesterday. He is a former head of press relations at the Bundesbank and personal assistant to Mr Karl Otto Pohl, former president of the German central bank. He is one of the more outspoken figures on the German financial scene. He left the Bundesbank in 1986 to take up a position as managing director of the Frankfurt stock exchange, the largest in Germany. He was a key figure in the campaign which led ultimately to the creation of the Deutsche Borse, a holding structure which brings Germany's eight regional stock-exchanges partially under one roof.</p>

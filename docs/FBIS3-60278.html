At a binational meeting held recently in Cucuta the parties  agreed to establish, after 17 years of talks, a technical  committee to exploit and preserve the basin of the Catatumbo  River, which "has been damaged by irrational exploitation by the  two countries of their respective upper basins," said Omar  Baralt, president of the Venezuelan Presidential Commission on  Border Affairs.    Baralt said that the Catatumbo River, with its headwaters in  Colombia and its drainage into the sea in Venezuela, is an  ecosystem that supplies 60 percent of the fresh water that flows  into Lake Maracaibo. "We have high stakes in this," he warned.    Colombia rejected in the beginning any understanding  claiming  principles of sovereignty, because it argued that Venezuela was  merely offering it participation in the preservation of that  basin.    Baralt added that "in view that no agreement was reached  then, we insisted over the past 17 years and managed to reach an  agreement with OAS assistance to settle sovereignty problems  between the two nations."    This agreement states that the two nations, through the OAS,  will preserve the basin by implementing a medium-run  comprehensive plan.    Omar Baralt added that in that zone "not only the basin is  being destroyed but there is heavy contamination of the river,  because the Departments of Santander and Norte de Santander,  which contain 85 percent of the population estimated at between  6 and 8 million inhabitants, are along the Catatumbo River."    The president of the commission on border affairs also  voiced  his concern over the exploitation of coal, which is highly  contaminating, which was detected in the Catatumbo Basin.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fukuoka, May 30 KYODO -- An opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) leader called Monday [30 May] for  top-level talks among the leadership of major political parties  to address the unstable political situation.    The call was made by Koichi Kato, head of the LDP policy  study group Shinseiki, during a press conference in Fukuoka,  western Japan. Kato said talks among Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata and the leaders of the LDP, the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) and new party Sakigake should commence soon after the  passage through the Diet of the government's fiscal 1994 budget  legislation.    Kato said the party leaders should also discuss how to  ensure that Japan presents a credible performance at the Group  of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations summit in Naples, Italy in  July.    Taku Yamasaki, a member of the same LDP subgroup also  attending the press conference, suggested a general election  could be held with the current multiseat constituency system for  the House of Representatives.    He said chances are that the lower house will be dissolved  and a general election held probably on July 24.    Former Posts and Telecommunications Minister Junichiro  Koizumi predicted at the same news conference that a  no-confidence motion against the Hosokawa cabinet will be  submitted either June 27 or 28 and a general election would be  held either july 24 or july 31.</p>

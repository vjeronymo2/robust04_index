			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China has tightened control over the leaking of  information on the annual plenary sessions of the NPC and CPPCC,  which open today and on Thursday [10 March] respectively.  Deputies said the move was another indication of the tense  political atmosphere in Beijing.    Sources said the 2,000 deputies of the CPPCC had been warned  not to divulge the contents of reports marked "confidential".  These include the Government Work Report to be submitted by the  premier, Li Peng, to the second plenum of the Eighth National  People's Congress session. "It appears that the atmosphere is a  bit more tense this year," a CPPCC delegate said. "Of course,  there's nothing really sensitive in the work reports." But how  the Chinese leadership saw the political situation was  different, he said.    The communist regime tightened control over the media  following the leaking of a work report by the Communist Party  chief, Jiang Zemin, at a party plenum in 1992 -- days before it  was scheduled to be delivered by Mr Jiang.</p>

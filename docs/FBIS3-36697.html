Fuel reserves at two of  the town's heating plants are running out. Here, heat and  electricity are used only for the social sphere, they are  supplied to houses and enterprises to ensure the port's vital  services.    A critical fuel situation has appeared in Arkhangelsk. The  temperature in the heating systems has been lowered.    Main production lines of the paper and pulp combine in  Novodvinsk, which is a major combine in the oblast, have been  stopped.    Power engineering workers in the White Sea region do not  have  the money to buy fuel. Non-payers -- mainly organizations  financed from the budget -- owe them over 20 billion rubles.  This situation in power engineering causes special concern in  connection with the weather forecast -- which predicts a sharp  fall in temperature in Murmansk Oblast this week -- down to  30-40 degrees [centigrade] below zero.</p>

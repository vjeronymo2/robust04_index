			<p>920728 FT  28 JUL 92 / Directors keep pay details secret FEW BRITISH companies disclose details of their directors' pay packages, according to an analysis by Company Reporting, the accounts monitoring service. Only 10 per cent disclose the amount paid to directors in bonuses and just 3 per cent show how these bonuses are calculated in spite of recommendations on greater disclosure from the Cadbury Committee on corporate governance. The study, which examined 440 accounts published during the past nine months, found that 28 per cent of companies provided some information on directors' earnings and that the figure was rising. Some 19 per cent disclosed contributions to pension schemes on behalf of directors, 10 per cent performance-linked incentive payments and 2 per cent some other form of payment. Company Reporting says that no company published the actual formula or calculation used to provide directors' bonuses, which have come under increasing criticism during the recession. It says that among companies providing the most extensive information of directors' bonuses are the Economist, the airports operator BAA, Boots and Reed International. Some 5 per cent of companies - including Midland Bank, RTZ, British Airways, Lonrho and Forte - disclose the earnings waived by directors. Company Reporting says BAA discloses auditor fees separately from other services provided by its accountants. This is in advance of the introduction of Company Act requirements to do so. Company Reporting. 68 Dundas St, Edinburgh EH3 6QZ. Pounds 315 per year.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Ciller urges public debate on Kurds: Turkey's PM is seeking to regain the political initiative Turkey's beleaguered prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller sought to regain the political initiative this week, calling for a public debate on what has long been an official taboo - use of the Kurdish language in schools and television. In a style more reminiscent of the late Turgut Ozal, Mrs Ciller dropped her bombshell at an engagement in Paris, telling reporters she wanted to see the constitutional ban on Kurdish broadcasting and education lifted. The move could serve to win over moderate Kurds, and isolate the rebel Kurdish Workers' party (PKK). But the suggestion has left the Ankara establishment floundering. Mrs Ciller's apparent change of heart is prompted by mounting international criticism of Turkish policy, and the government's apparently blind pursuit of a military solution. It will also divert attention from the newspaper allegations of impropriety Mrs Ciller and her husband face in connection with property acquisitions in the US. 'In institutions, schools and the state television, the official language is Turkish. But beyond that, everything should be free,' she said. Clearly, such a move risks alienating hardliners in her True Path party (DYP), without whom it may be hard to win a two-thirds majority in parliament for constitutional reform. It will further strain the uneasy compromise between civilians and the military which has prevailed since she came to power last summer. Western governments have been particularly shocked by recent moves to close the Kurdish-based Democracy party (DEP), following lifting of the parliamentary immunity of MPs representing the Kurdish region, five of whom could face the death penalty for espousing the Kurdish cause. International censure is also hampering Turkey's efforts to win financial aid from western governments to see it through its current economic crisis. 'At the moment her ambassadors can't even get through the doors of Europe's treasuries to present their requests,' says one foreign banker. Concern has been voiced in the US, where the House of Representatives has for the first time proposed to link US aid to improvements in Turkey's human rights. Furthermore, the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly voted last week to send a delegation to Turkey to investigate the Kurdish problem. Ironically, the promotion of Kurdish education was one of the charges cited in the Constitutional Court's decision to close the DEP on June 30. The debate could trigger further divisions within Mrs Ciller's conservative-led coalition. Only this week, speaking to the military academy, President Suleyman Demirel echoed hardline sentiment when warning that the west's demand for democratic reforms would be rejected if they threatened Turkey's territorial integrity. In sharp contrast, Mr Celal Kurkoglu, a social democrat deputy, called on the justice ministry to investigate Mr Nusret Demiral, head of the Ankara state security court, for his actions against the DEP. It could also imperil Mrs Ciller's close ties with the army, which has until now been given carte blanche to prosecute increasingly bloody counterattacks against the Kurdish Workers' party .</p>
